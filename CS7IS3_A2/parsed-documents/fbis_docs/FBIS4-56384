College students, mainly from the UNAM's National School of Economics (the 1964-69 generation), came together to form PP and get it off the ground. Some of them were Alberto Anaya, Hugo Andres Araujo, Rolando Cordera, and Gustavo Gordillo, under the intellectual leadership of Adolfo Orive, who was their professor. Also contributing to the expansion of PP, with financial support, were officials in the governments of Luis Echeverria and Jose Lopez-Portillo, some of whom were members of that generation and are currently in the Salinas cabinet. This information came to PROCESO from Agustin Acosta, Alberto Anaya, and Hector Camero, who founded one of the PP's strongholds, the Land and Liberty Popular Front, in this city. Interviewed separately, the three agreed that the PP never had a well-defined organization and that its growth led to fierce internal squabbling, which ultimately split it into two major blocs: Mass Line and Proletarian Line, led respectively by Araujo and Orive. The distant forerunner of Land and Liberty, Costa related, was the movement that emerged in the Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon against the increase in fees in 1967. Acosta, then a student in the Department of Philosophy and Letters, was involved in the formation of the Coordinator of Preparatory Schools, which sought to expand the student movement with an eye towards incorporating it into grass-roots movements. The goal was achieved three years later when a group of college students backed 400 colonia residents from Topo Chico in their invasion of some lands, on which Land and Liberty was later to emerge. "We invaded...and three days later they pounded us out of there." Nevertheless, he continued, "we realized that we had a gold mine there and that we had to start working in an organized fashion." The government, he explained, had the workers and peasants under control, but had neglected the new residents who were arriving in droves from the countryside and had no options. We saw that we could slip in there. We studied the situation...and we prepared to invade once again. On 30 August 1971 we invaded the first colonia in the group that later formed the Land and Liberty Popular Front, colonia Martires de San Cosme." Some months before, he recalled, Marcos Cruz, who was a PP brigade member in Durango, arrived in this city. He gave us a lecture, saying: `We are doing the same thing. We have a lot in common. We ought to work together.' And he left us the document that you talked about in PROCESO (897), `Hacia una Politica Popular,' so that we could study it." Then came Alberto Anaya, another brigade member in Durango: "He gave us the same speech and asked us to join the organization. Which one? I asked...The fact was that there was no such organization; there were just scattered groups of brigade members. He then asked me whether I wanted to know `the guy who has the whole story...' and I told him I did. This was how Adolfo Orive first came here. We had our first official meeting in April 1971. He recommended that we step up our political work, that we become more professional, that there was funding for this. And that was what happened." Both Anaya and Cruz, who served as federal deputies in the 1988-1991 Legislature representing the PMS [Mexican Socialist Party]-OIR-Mass Line coalition, later left Durango "because we called them back as reinforcements, but also because most of the cadres that they had over there split and joined the guerrillas. Many joined the 23 September Communist League." Acosta recalls that in 1968 Acosta was in a postgraduate program on economic planning at the Advanced Teachers College in Paris. "He lived through May 1968 in France and, showing great intuition, sensed the coming worldwide revolt; he came back to Mexico in early July of that year and started giving economics classes at UNAM. His philosophy was quite well developed; it was Maoist, a product of the studies that he had done on the People's Cultural Revolution in China, particularly with Professor Charles Bettelheim, who was his adviser, the president of the French-Chinese Friendship Association, and the main Marxist theoretician of that revolution." Orive, the son of Adolfo Orive Alva, the secretary of water resources under Miguel Aleman, had graduated as a civil engineer from UNAM in 1963. His thesis was entitled "Modern planning techniques for the comprehensive development of the Grijalba River Basin," which already evinced his interest in solving specific problems facing the country. When the student movement erupted, Acosta said, "a lot of brigades were formed, and the factions began to multiply: the Communist Party, the Trotskyites, the Maoists...The latter had just emerged; its source was the Espartaco Communist League. The factions came together in the brigades, and the so-called Coalition of Emiliano Zapata Brigades was formed. It was the one that issued the first version of the document "Towards a Popular Line" (Originally "For a Popular Line"). Orive wrote it up, pursuant to a consensus among university professors, mostly in economics, among them Araujo, Gordillo, and Anaya." The Brigades Regroup After the crackdown on the student movement, the brigade members scattered. Orive regrouped them in 1969, and a decision was made to implement the principles of the PP, a task that began the following year in several regions around the country. The first place was indigenous communities in Guerrero, Chiapas, and Oaxaca. They "did almost social-welfare work, sending in medical brigades, for example. Back then there was a lot of discussion about the best way to integrate with the masses...and splinter groups kept forming, later giving rise to other organizations, such as the Mexican Party of the Proletariat, which Gustavo Gordillo headed." Anaya, a current leader of the Labor Party in this state and president of the Land and Liberty Popular Front, confirmed that the PP emerged "before 1968. It was based on Maoist principles concerning the so-called mass line, which basically says that everything has to come from the decisions of the people, on the basis of which a line of action is developed." He pointed out that the PP did its work in three stages. The first was "integration with the masses and it ran from mid-1968 to 1971. The second was mobilization of the masses, from 1971 to 1976. The third was organization and consolidation of the mass groups and the construction of social support bases; we are still doing this work." The movement spread at first to Durango, Monterrey, Bahia de Banderas in Nayarit, the Yaqui Valley in Sonora, Las Truchas in Michoacan, Torreon, Monclova, Tlaxcala, and Zacatecas. He explained that "the regions into which we went had been selected according to their political profitability, that is to say, the ones in which the people were willing to become involved." The selection was also made on the basis of "Orive's political contacts and interests within the State apparatus," says Hector Camero, the current leader of the Land and Liberty Civil Association, a group that split from the Front that Anaya heads. For example, he notes, brigade members went to Las Truchas because the iron and steel plant was run by Orive's father, and they went to Bahia de Banderas because Orive himself worked there. During the time that Orive worked in Monterrey, he adds, "we realized more clearly that he had political contacts at the highest level, including President Echeverria and his interior secretary, Mario Moya Palencia. Besides drafting PP documents, Orive was explicitly charged with raising funds for the movement, and we brigade members had only hints of where they came from. For example, he brought in vehicles from Las Truchas. Orive's and Anaya's contact man with Echeverria was the rector of the UANL, Luis Eugenio Todd." Through Todd, Camero contends, Echeverria supported some of Land and Liberty's projects. Acosta, who at present has his own law practice, says that Orive had "direct ties with Echeverria and was very good friends with his eldest son, Luis Echeverria Zuno; they studied together in Paris. As of 1971 Adolfo was very much involved in the Bahia de Banderas Trust. He did the organizing; I was there for four months." Later, "we realized that other politicians were supporting the movement. In 1975 some of us brigade members were in the Huasteca Hidalguense [the Hidalgo State portion of the Huasteca region]. It was a dangerous zone, owing to the presence of the caciques' white guards, like the Austrias, so we needed cover for our work. We got it from Raul Salinas de Gortari, the director of rural roads for the SAHOP (Secretariat of Human Settlements and Public Works), who introduced us as researchers. Another who backed us was Emilio Lozoya; I do not recall what post he held at the time, but I once went with Orive to pick up money at his office." "Humberto Perez Hinojosa, who was working with Araujo in La Laguna, once invited me to Manuel Camacho Solis's home in the Federal District. There were a lot of people there whom we had to tell what we were doing because of the financial support they were giving. That kind of thing bothered me. I felt like a clown, but Orive justified it...Lozoya and Camacho also studied economics at UNAM; hence their relationship with Orive and other members of that generation. The fact is that this support enabled us to maintain a roster of around 300 professional brigade members throughout the country from 1976 to 1979." Camero recalls that in late 1975 "Orive settled here; we ourselves asked him to do so, to integrate with the masses, because he would only visit occasionally on the pretext that he had to raise funds. His presence was ill-fated; the cultural revolution that he advocated led to the death of six colonia residents on 18 February 1976." Orive began his "cultural revolution" here with the argument that we had to wage a battle to the death against Social Democracy, represented by Anaya, because it put the leaders above the masses. The masses, Orive said, are the ones that must lead movements. He indicated that the leaders who do not teach these methods are bourgeois Social Democrats who must be swept away by the masses. In this way he carried the ideological struggle to bitter, terrible extremes." Against this backdrop a problem arose in colonia San Angel, which is between colonias Francisco Villa and Tierra y Libertad, when some patrolmen arrested a group of colonia residents on charges that they had stolen electrical equipment: "We went to help our comrades. The patrolmen called for reinforcements, and just when we had reached an agreement with the police to release them, residents of colonia Francisco Villa showed up and began provoking them. They were people whom Orive controlled; he called them `red guards.' The police shot at them, killing six." He charges: "Orive sent those comrades to their death. We did not criticize him publicly at the time, but we did complain to him in private. We told him that his cause had brought death. He said: 'Revolutions shed blood.' The fact is that his goal was to sweep away the leaders here." After the slayings, Acosta says, the grass-roots movement posted "huge growth, in this city and in others, which also caused the organization to grow excessively...and the internal feuding to intensify. After the ideological battle that he had with Anaya in Monterrey, which in the end was just a struggle for control, Adolfo maliciously saw that the situation could be repeated in La Laguna, where Araujo was the natural leader. Orive himself had bequeathed that influence to him, just as he did with Anaya in Monterrey, but his disciples turned out to be cheeky. The fact is that Orive maneuvered to get Araujo to go to the Huasteca Potosina [the San Luis Potosi State portion of the Huasteca region]." Araujo got to the region in early 1977, shortly after being released from prison in Saltillo, where he had been held for two months on orders from Governor Oscar Flores Tapia. "He arrived in the Huasteca Potosina with a lot of backing. His political contacts were very obvious by then, most notably with Raul Salinas de Gortari. The so-called Land and Liberty Camp was founded there, comprising a lot of ejidos near Ciudad Valles. Some of us brigade members settled in the Mezquital Valley, more or less where the Huasteca Potosina and Hidalguense meet. It was very difficult work, in communities as backward as the ones in Chiapas...and around which the army started building heliports as a precaution." Meanwhile, Acosta continues, "Orive settled in Chiapas, where he had been making contact with religious groups since 1974. He lived there from 1978 to 1988. His presence has great significance in the region, given its characteristics. Suffice it to say that in 1988 he organized an assembly at which some 2,500 Indians got together to discuss their problems. But I doubt whether Orive planted the ideological seed for the guerrilla war that has now erupted. He is very cool towards such things. What could have happened is that some of his people broke off and became radicalized, just like what happened with the network of catechizers that outstripped Bishop Samuel Ruiz." Anaya: "The self-styled Proletarian Line, headed by Orive, worked in Chiapas to build social support bases by organizing the indigenous peasants economically and socially. He never proposed the armed struggle as a solution. He sought to combat the caciques and great estates and fought to start solving problems with the Chiapas governments, which at least over the past 15 years have been characterized by authoritarianism, political narrow-mindedness, and intolerance." Camero concludes: "It would be going too far to say that Popular Line planted the ideological seed of the Chiapas guerrilla war. At least not its leaders, although some of its people may have split off and become radicalized. But I do not think it was people like Orive and Araujo. They showed their true faces a long time ago when they joined right in with the State apparatus. There is a reason why they are together in the CNC, to which in one way or another they were always linked, probably as part of a project that Echeverria started and the Salinas brothers later picked up again."
