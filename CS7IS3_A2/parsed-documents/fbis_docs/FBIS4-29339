Kanda admitted at a news conference the U.S. forces are conducting a study with Japanese bases, but stressed it has nothing to do with the deepening Asia-Pacific crisis. "We have been conducting research and studies (on Japanese bases) to secure efficient operation in view of maintaining and boosting reliability of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," he said. "Japan's Self-Defense Forces have been cooperating with these studies, and (the ongoing study) is one in line with them," Kanda said. "The U.S. forces are always doing (such studies). The study now under way has nothing to do with the North Korean issue." The daily TOKYO SHIMBUN reported in its Friday edition that the U.S. forces are studying Air Self-Defense Force bases for possible use as airbases for fighters apparently in preparation for any military involvement in the Korean peninsula. The U.S. appears to have already selected four bases in Chitose, Misawa, Matsushima and Komatsu as proper sites to serve as bases for U.S. fighters which would fly from the U.S. mainland, the daily said. Kanda denied he has received any request from the U.S. for such use of Japanese bases. The U.S. forces conduct studies on SDF bases to renew data once or twice every year, according to the Defense Agency.
