In the last three years, under the policy of giving equal importance to oil and gas, the level of effort in gas-geology research and exploration has been raised, and the growth of reserve volumes has equaled that of the previous 40 years. Because of a series of findings, China is now taking the initial steps to create three new large gas regions. One is the largest contiguous gas field ever found on the China mainland, which is located in northern Shaanxi and covers an area of over 2,340 square kilometers, where most recently, at Ih Ju Meng in Inner Mongolia a number of industrial-grade wells were drilled that foretell even greater expansion of the gas-bearing area. Two is a group of gas fields found in eastern Sichuan, and high-output gas wells found in central and southern Sichuan that forecast the existence of more major gas fields. Three is the finding of geological indicators for natural gas reserves of considerable volume in the Turpan-Hami, Junggar, and Tarim basins, including some in Tarim that are hoped will continue to expand in scale. Additionally, in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, a gas-bearing region rich in natural gas has been confirmed. Wang Tao said that it is expected that confirmed volumes of natural gas will more than double over the next seven years. He firmly believes that based on finds already confirmed and the expected growth of reserves over the next several years that the ground has been laid for a rapid development of China's natural gas bases.
