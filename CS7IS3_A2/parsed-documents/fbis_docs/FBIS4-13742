In an interview with our reporter, Mr. Omar Bahman emphasized that the UN and Security Council member countries, including Britain, France, and Russia were directly responsible for the massacre of Gorazde Muslims. In reference to activities of the UN secretary general, he said: Butrus-Ghali and other UN officials are receiving huge salaries from the international budget to guard the interests of powerful countries. The Bosnian ambassador also called on Islamic countries to show greater movement toward solving the Bosnian crisis. Mr. Omar Bahman said: Islamic Conference Organization resolutions, much like UN resolutions, have remained as paper documents. He said that a number of Islamic countries, in particular Arab governments, which are similar to Western countries and act to deceive public opinion, support Bosnia only in words. Thanking Tehran for its stance, the Bosnian ambassador said: The practical support provided by the people and government of Iran for the Bosnian nation was an appreciated reality.
