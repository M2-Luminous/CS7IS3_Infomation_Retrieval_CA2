The East Asian nations are undergoing spectacular economic growth. The wave of market economies is now pushing onto the shores of former socialist nations. The economies of advanced nations have been withering and distinctions from energetic developing nations are becoming vague. The question now is how will advanced nations transform themselves in the world economy which has been significantly changed after the Cold War, and what sort of order will they establish? The theme discussed at the cabinet-level directors meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris concentrated on this one point. The joint statement of the cabinet-level directors meeting gave the impression that difficulties will be encountered in the solution of issues spreading on a global scale such as unemployment and environmental pollution. However, some progress was manifested in the formulation of a major policy statement concerning a new global economic order. Unlike last year, when the world was struck by widespread recession, this year's global economy is enjoying a fledgling recovery. The U.S. economic expansion is being accompanied by a widening economic bottoming out in Europe. The OECD Secretariat's revision of the outlook for growth in member nations as a whole for this year--from 2.1 percent predicted at the end of last year to 2.6 percent--in itself provides support to the brightening prospects. It is only natural that the concerns of the respective nations shifted from near-term economic measures to chronic unemployment of increasing intensity. The joint statement states, "Unemployment represents a waste of potential human capabilities and is a threat to the unity of society." There is no disagreement in the perception that solution of the unemployment issue requires not only economic measures, but an indispensable structural reform of the economy. The problem is whether such actions are feasible. Chronic unemployment in European nations emanates from an unemployment system which provides for generous jobless insurance benefits, extended payment periods, and the capability to survive somehow without acquiring a stable job. Such practices are a cause for inflating the fiscal deficits of concerned nations. However, it is not easy to convince the public of the need to reduce payments and conserve in the area of welfare. The unemployed in OECD nations as a whole total 35 million because they have lost their jobs owing to an onslaught of cheap industrial products flowing in from developing nations and East European countries. The view has been voiced in Europe and the United States that imports should be banned from developing nations where environmental regulations are lax and labor conditions are inferior. However, we should not embrace protective trade practices which split the world economy in two. OECD strategy calls for the import of developing nation products on the one hand while implementing deregulation and technological reform on the other hand to increase employment through the creation of new markets which do not compete with developing nation products. This represents sound logic, but regretfully we still lack new investment sectors which lead to significant increases in employment. We should probably face the reality that it will take time for advanced nations to recover economic vitality. In that respect, we can appreciate the OECD position of withdrawing from the erstwhile "club of advanced nations" and seeking other means for expanding its economic activities. This month's affiliation of Mexico has been followed by preparations by South Korea and four East European nations to join the OECD. Aside from signing an economic cooperative agreement with Russia, it is actively pursuing dialogue with China and Central and South American nations. The OECD has assumed a new role in which it strives for equalization of competitive conditions by establishing mutual affinity for working conditions and environmental standards with newly industrialized nations and former Eastern bloc nations as well as advanced nations. Although the excuse given was the preoccupation with Diet budget deliberations, it is regrettable that not even a single Japanese cabinet member attended the OECD conference. It was an exceptional opportunity for Japan to demonstrate its resolve to expand domestic demand, just when European and U.S. attention is focused on Japan's lagging economic recovery and growing current accounts surplus. The Naples summit of principal world leaders will be next. We would like Japan to awaken to its grave role in formulating a new world economic order and to spare no effort in preparing for the summit.
