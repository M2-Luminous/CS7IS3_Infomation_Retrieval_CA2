He pointed out that it is the consistent stand of the Chinese Government to build a new airport in Hong Kong. Despite the fact that the British side has once again complicated the issue deliberately, the Chinese side still cherishes the hope that the two sides can continue talks on the airport in line with the spirit and principle of the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's New Airport, reach an agreement at an early date, and strive to start construction of the airport as soon as possible. Lu Ping indicated that the aforementioned Memorandum of Understanding is a solemn diplomatic document signed by the heads of both the Chinese and British Governments; therefore, everything should have been fine after the signing of the document. However, the British side has asked us to make our position known. The Chinese Government has already declared its stance, that is, we support the idea of building a new airport at low cost and with high efficiency and demand that it brings no financial burden to the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. To put it in detailed terms, financial reserves of HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars] should be set aside for the SAR government and the total debt borne by the government should not exceed HK$5 billion. Things could begin right then if everyone agreed to act in compliance with the Memorandum of Understanding. However, the British Hong Kong Government later put forward a financial package in which liabilities overran by a large margin the provisions in the Memorandum of Understanding. The total amount of liabilities set out in the first package stood at over HK$70 billion. Lu Ping said that the British side must be kidding if it is indeed acceptable for the SAR government to undertake debt of over HK$70 billion given financial reserves of just HK$25 billion. Lu Ping noted: The British side put forward a third and then a fourth financial package, and the latter still falls short of the stipulations of the Memorandum of Understanding. Therefore, the British side is to blame for a failure to act in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding. The issue is very simple, and they can go ahead without holding discussions with us. The reason why the British side wants to hold talks with the Chinese side is because nothing can be accomplished if they stick to this financial package. They will not be able to raise loans. Banks will not grant them loans because the financial package raised by the British side does not conform to the Memorandum of Understanding. Lu Ping added that the British side is making trouble again. Despite this, the Chinese side will not rigidly adhere [si qia zhu 2984 1595 0145] to the HK$5 billion ceiling, yet hopes the British side can consult the Chinese side if debts exceed HK$5 billion. The problem now is that the gap is too wide. Lu Ping said that at the present stage, the Chinese side is still prepared to hold talks with the British side and hopes an agreement can be reached at an early date.
