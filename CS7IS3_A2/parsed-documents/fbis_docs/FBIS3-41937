Thus, this tunnel is very troubling to the people of the world. These rumors got started in the West, particularly in the United States, the enemy of Libya's leader, Qadhdhafi. There have also been reports that Thai engineers designed this nuclear weapons plant. And there are more than 60 Thai laborers working on this tunnel. [passage omitted] Police Major General Luan Panarotsathip, the commander of the Suppression Division, ordered Police Colonel Chaloemchat Sittanon, the deputy commander, and Police Colonel Chumphon Manmai, the superintendent of Precinct 2, to coordinate things with the Labor Skills Development Department in order to conduct an investigation. A few days later, police officials checked the people at that company. It was suspected that this was an engineering company that was involved in sending Thai laborers to work in Libya. The police detained four officials at the Suppression Division and seized a number of documents. [passage omitted] On the morning of 14 October, Police Colonel Chumphon and a team of officials raided a condominium located at 13/1 Nimmanmoen, Lane 12, Suthep Subdistrict, Chiang Mai City. The offices of the W and M Company Ltd. were located there. When the police rushed in so early in the morning, Mr. Wirot Sakunmuthita, the owner of the company, looked very bewildered, and the more than ten workers there all wondered what was happening. "What the hell is going on," said Mr. Wirot looking at the police officials. Focusing on Chumphon Manmai, who had entered the office ahead of the other police officials, he asked, "Do you have a search warrant?" "We have both a search warrant and a warrant for your arrest," said Police Col. Chumphon, taking out the warrants for him to see. Mr. Wirot's attitude softened, and he tried to ask what was going on. He asked why the police wanted to search his company. When informed that officials believe that this company is sending workers to work abroad without authorization, Mr. Wirot angrily said that "this is clearly a political matter." But even though Mr. Wirot made a scene, the police began searching the offices, which were filled with modern equipment. They were particularly interested in the ten computers and computer disks. Wirot just stood there complaining, saying that "the United States probably put pressure on you to do this." In the end, the Suppression Division officials seized three computer disks and a number of documents concerning the operations of this company. After that, the police escorted Mr. Wirot to his house at 65/7 Sirorot Road, Lane 1, Suthep Subdistrict, and found 158 disks containing information on sending laborers from the north to work in Libya. They also found receipts and expenditures journals. The police charged Mr. Wirot with hiring Thai laborers and sending them to work abroad without authorization. Mr. Wirot admitted that he was the owner of the W and M Company Ltd., and said that he was the engineer who had designed that tunnel in Libya. Libya awarded the contract to build this tunnel to the M.N.C. Company Ltd. Construction got underway two years ago. It is thought that construction will be completed within another year. This tunnel is about 17 meters wide and about 110 meters long. Wirot was paid 25 million baht to draw up the plans and oversee the construction. The Libyan government has invested approximately 700-800 million baht in building this tunnel. And they plan to build several more tunnels! Mr. Wirot denied knowing anything about this. And he said that he isn't interested in what Libya plans to do with the tunnels once they are completed. He said that he doesn't know if they will use them as air raid shelters or sites for nuclear and chemical weapons plants. But Wirot has to fly to Libya about twice a month. A report from an intelligence unit stated that the situation concerning the construction of chemical and nuclear weapons production plants in Libya is expanding, particularly in Lotta and Banghazi, which are located about 10 hours away from Tripoli, the capital. Those plants are located in valleys with an area of more than 1,000 rai and in underground tunnels. There are at least nine such plants. Most of the chemicals are sent directly from Germany. It's said that if these chemicals come in contact with the air, they will immediately burst into flames. If applied to steel, this chemical can quickly melt the steel. They now have about 120 tanks of this chemical, with each tank weighing 40 tons. Because of its great concern about this, the United States is closely monitoring the construction of these tunnels in Libya. Police officials are very suspicious about the role played by Mr. Wirot. They wonder who he is exactly and how he managed to gain a monopoly on the construction of these tunnels. Another question that the police must answer concerns the relationship between the engineer who drew up the plans, that is, Wirot, and a Thai engineer who studied in Germany and who is an expert on chemicals. The police wonder how important he is in the construction of these tunnels. The United States has charged that these tunnels are being modified so that they can serve as plants for producing nuclear and chemical weapons, mankind's most destructive weapons.
