We must be convinced that, beginning today, we will harvest the fruits of the great efforts made by the people and the government in these past few years to secure peace, democracy, and development. In the beginning of this second half of my presidential period, we have more opportunities for economic growth, a considerable development of social programs, and a better outlook for a greater political, social, and economic stability. Along our Atlantic coast, the electoral process of the autonomous regions of the northern and southern Atlantic areas -- with the participation of the various political parties, alliances, and popular groups -- must be institutionalized. Popular elections in our country are periodic and sacred. In the past, the change of authorities was made through force and violence. Now, we do this in complete freedom with joy and a great civic spirit. With enthusiasm and renewed optimism, I just announced the cabinet members that will accompany me in 1994 -- a year whose task will be to reach the noble goals established for 1994. Only in unity, with much perseverance and true teamwork, we will be able to bequeath our citizens a more prosperous Nicaragua and a renewed and stronger state apparatus. It will be a state apparatus that will help strengthen our government institutions. Public work in Nicaragua has been misunderstood at times and constantly criticized. Many criticize it for political reasons, while others criticize it out of ignorance, because they do not know how difficult it is to build that which has been destroyed and to make progress amid so many obstacles. Many times, we have had to make difficult decisions, decisions that are unpopular. Nevertheless, we must remember that it is not easy to govern. We are always subject to criticism -- even criticism that is ill-intentioned. Still, if we want to be honest and consistent rulers, we have to assume our commitment seriously. Presidential decisions should not be made based on political costs but, rather, based on assumed responsibilities. The important thing is to be sincere with the people, always keeping their legitimate interests in mind. Public work, in addition to involving great sacrifices, must be characterized by honesty, integrity, a devotion to duty, and a love for our people, particularly the neediest sectors. To govern is to serve and fulfill the assigned duty responsibly and patriotically. Let us make our daily work effective and develop our efforts inspired on national interests only in order that social justice and reconciliation will become a reality for us. They will be the expression of a government that is based on unity, concerted effort, and dialogue. For this reason, government offices must be open so that all Nicaraguan citizens, regardless of their social or political status, can enter them and be heard respectfully and patiently. For this reason, we must also be willing to implement the postulates of the government program, a program Nicaraguans voted for on 25 February 1990. I want to sincerely thank all Nicaraguans who accompanied me last year in government posts and who are leaving public office. I also thank the people who will continue to accompany me in the government this year. I am certain we are going to work in a coordinated fashion and with true patriotic devotion. I hope that God enlightens us and makes us more efficient in our posts to enable us to better serve the Nicaraguan people. Thank you, my dear friends and cabinet members, and may God bless you all.
