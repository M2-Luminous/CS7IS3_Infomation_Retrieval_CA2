Hospital sources inform us that since last weekend the Kigali hospital admitted around 10 dead and injured people. This morning, five dead and 22 injured people were registered, while on 21 and 22 February the hospital registered seven dead and 21 injured people. Informed sources say numbers are growing as the killings in various suburbs continue. Police sources say that the most affected area is Gikondo where this morning a woman and her two children were killed, while last night seven dead were taken away. Another affected suburb is that (Gasaka), but the police have not yet informed us about the human and material losses there. Kigali remains a ghost town. Government employees did not go back to work because the public and private transport is at a standstill. Shops did not open. The streets are empty except for the cars of expatriates.
