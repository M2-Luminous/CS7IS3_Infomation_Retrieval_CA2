Every manifestation of skepticism is, in principle, an example of a discerning point of view, as long as it does not go beyond a certain limit. Where is the prime minister's limit? Vaclav Klaus's profound mistrust of any kind of supranational institutions, full of bureaucrats who would like to dictate a new international discipline, is undoubtedly well founded. No matter what European habits and customs are today and no matter what European public opinion, which has been evolving for centuries, is, the road toward a united, supranational Europe will still be a long one, if we ever reach the end of it. Critical skepticism in this regard may only be to the benefit of the situation. As the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset pointed out: "I do not recall that any civilization has ever succumbed to a paroxysm of doubt." And from where else but our country, endowed with its rich experience of cheap internationalism, should the most frequent critical and caustic remarks against the "Brussels visionaries" come? Even the most pertinent skepticism, however, must steer clear of pointless eccentricity. Klaus's Euroskepticism is evidently inspired by the British mistrust of becoming too bogged down by European structures, a mistrust whose apostle is Margaret Thatcher. Her coolness toward any form of international affiliation, however, is born of the Briton's traditional insular peevishness and about whom it is claimed, half in jest, that his often affected inclination toward little animals comes from what he has put aside from his contacts with other people. It would be rather absurd, however, if the prime minister of a small country in Central Europe, where no nation can simply "dance only to the beat of its own drum," were to endorse a similar level of isolationism. It is not just that, in essence, the companionable Bohemians and Moravians will never be such full-blooded adherents of the British style of "splendid isolation." The indications that Klaus's cool attitude toward Brussels and his comments about the "unfairness" of the NATO air strikes against Serb positions have aroused unexpected interest from Russia are far more serious. Some of our government officials have explained away the recent unanticipated invitation to Vaclav Klaus to make a state visit to Russia by saying that Moscow would like to find a kindred spirit in the Czech prime minister as far as its schizophrenic attitude toward Western Europe is concerned. There was even a sharp exchange of views at the extraordinary government session, during which some members of Klaus's Cabinet somewhat hysterically recommended that the prime minister not go anywhere. In the end, Klaus himself had to rid Chernomyrdin of all his false illusions when he declared categorically in Moscow that politics will not be discussed now because "business" is on the agenda. Nevertheless, for us to circumvent the Kremlin's dubious "attachment" in the future, it would be far better if the prime minister would limit his natural Euroskepticism, first and foremost, to criticism of the unrealistic ideas about the foreseeable unification of Europe. And, as an advocate of traditional bilateral diplomacy, he should declare clearly that none other than Kohl's (or, after the elections, Scharping's?) Germany is our closest partner on our incontrovertible road toward the European Union. So far, however, the government has made no attempt to find a cure for the understandable German traumas that persist among our public. Out of an obvious fear of losing popularity, Vaclav Klaus and other coalition politicians have left the political field here to the opposition, which is shamelessly playing an anti-German card. Today, however, Germany is a scrupulously democratic state that is an inspiration for us in many things. There is much to encourage us and much to learn, for example, from the way the Germans bore, calmly and honorably, the postwar catastrophe and from how they managed energetically to come to terms with its terrible aftermath. For this reason, it would be fitting for Vaclav Klaus to stand up, with Mrs. Thatcher's courage and sarcasm, not only to the anonymous bureaucrats in Brussels, but also to the still burning issue of the Sudeten Germans, which the Bonn government would also like to sweep definitively from the table.
