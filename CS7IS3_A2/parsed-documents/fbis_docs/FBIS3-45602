And the number of serious criminal cases -- including murder and drug trafficking -- rose 23.4 percent over 1992. The 19,000 drug trafficking cases was a 32 percent rise over 1992. And police seized more than 27,000 drug traffickers along with 3,500 kilograms of opium and 4,200 kilograms of heroin, said Bai Jingfu, Deputy Minister of Public Security. Bai said that the rate of criminal offences has reached 20 per 10,000 people in China. Although the figure is low compared to other countries, the government will continue to crack down on criminal offences, he said. Since 1982, the crime rate has risen an average of 6 percent per year. Bai made these remarks yesterday in a report to the National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing. More than 200 NPC deputies from Beijing gathered at the Great Hall of the People yesterday to hear ministry work reports. In the next 10 days, the group will be preparing for the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC, scheduled for March 10. In the fight against crime last year police handled 15,000 cases involving the kidnapping and trafficking of women and children, the deputy minister said. The police also recovered stolen money and goods valued at more than 4.08 billion yuan ($469 million) during the first 11 months last year, double the amount secured in the whole of 1992. According to Bai, robbery and theft accounted for 80 percent of last year's criminal offences. Last year, more than 300,000 robberies and 150,000 thefts were filed up 20 percent and 21.6 percent over the figures in 1992. Bai also said more offenders last year were involved in gangs or used violence. During the first 11 months of last year, Chinese police caught more than 780,000 gang members and handled 185,000 gang-related cases. The figures were up 55.5 percent and 49.7 percent respectively over 1992, he said. The deputy minister noted that gang activities have been a problem for a long time in China's suburbs and countryside. In terms of violent crimes, more than 32,000 people were murdered and more than 80,000 people were injured, up 7.8 percent and 8.6 percent respectively over 1992.
