The government was defeated over the package last Friday, when it was rejected by the House of Councillors. The LDP's decision to allow the matter to go before a Diet panel was reached by party President Yohei Kono and Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, the officials said. The crucial package, on which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his job, could still be enacted if the panel of 10 members from each of the two houses worked out a compromise that then won approval by a majority vote in both houses. The package rejected Friday had already been approved by the more powerful House of Representatives.
