FBIS4-47951 "drafr088_c_94024" FBIS-AFR-94-088 Daily Report 8 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 6 May South African Press Review for 6 May MB0605104894 MB0605104894 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Lessons in Conciliation -- "The struggle for hegemony in KwaZulu/Natal has been transferred largely from the killing fields to the political areas, leading mericifully, to a marked reduction in the death toll," notes an editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 6 May on page 10. The winner in ZwaZulu/Natal should "take a cue" from Hernus Kriel, likely to become premier in the Western Cape, and his ANC rival Allan Boesak, who have been holding "cordial discussions" on filling executive posts. ANC premier-designate in the Northern Transvaal Ramathlodi also talks about including members of the Freedom Front in his executive. "The rivals for the premiership in KwaZulu/Natal, Frank Mdalalose of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and Jacob Zuma of the ANC, are fortunately, men who know that politics is the art of compromise." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Judge and Be Judged -- An editorial in the Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English on 6 to 12 May on page 16 evaluates what happened to the elections, concluding that "an incompetent IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] bungled the administration of the election wholly and completely -- it couldn't get ballots to the voters, its security systems were inadequate, its counting plans non-existent. This opened the way to fraud on a massive scale -- but so hopeless was the IEC organization that it has been unable to pinpoint the fraud." "By last weekend Judge Kriegler has to admit that he had to throw aside the rules, the safeguards and what few systems he had in place just to get some sort of result. By Wednesday afternoon he had to acknowledge that counting accuracy and care had given way to horse-trading among the parties. He has ceased to be a judje, ruling on accuracy and validity of the result, but a mediator, desperately negotiating a result that all parties would accept." This is not only the "fault" of Judge Kriegler, there is "evidence" of "a Department of Home Affairs `third force' in IEC structures." But in the "most tense and sensitive area of all, KwaZulu/Natal, the result will be tainted." In an election meant to give the people of KwaZulu/Natal a choice, "IEC bungling has prevented that and threatens to prolong instability in the region" NEW NATION Security Forces -- On the day of Nelson Mandela's inauguration he will "acquire the instruments of power, which have for more than three centuries been deployed to surpress the aspirations of the African majority," notes an editorial in the Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 6 May on page 16. "The government will be confronted with its most formidable challenge -- namely securing the loyality of theese forces." "Theres are disturbing signals within the ANC, which suggest that the responsibility of building popular organizations in civil society will be relegated to a secondary function after parliamentary responsibilities. If allowed to go unchallenged, all gains made so far will come under threat." And it is also "important" that "those who have relished in the abundance of wealth that this country had to offer, to come to grips with the priorities of reconstruction and development," "with the reality that there will be less for them from now on." If "defensive actions" of "affluent constituencies" are "left unchallenged" the ANC "will be in no posaition to ask the poor and working constituency to moderate their aspirations." BEELD Task of Inclusivity Not Yet Completed -- "One of the most heart-breaking stories of the week was about Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and 50 of his supporters who gathered at Lichtenburg for a symboli protest against the new South Africa," writes columnist Willie Kuhn in his "Politial BEELD" column on page 12 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 29 April. "Dr. Hartzenberg declared that they had become a rejected people." "Rejected? No one has rejected the Afrikaner collectively. No one has robbed them of their freedom. All that happened is that those people over whom the Afrikaner for so long ruled unilaterally have, with the Afrikaner, become co- rulers of South Africa." "There are too few people who realize that the Afrikaner's freedom depends on the degree to which other peoples in the country have also been liberated." "Dr. Hartzenberg and his followers view their flag-raising ceremony as the first step on the road to Afrikaner freedom. Many Afrikaners, in fact the majority, view the election as the first step on the road to freedom. In this way they have become part of the just dispensation in which one people and group become equals with other peoples and groups. Most Afrikaners and whites do not wish to become terrorists and boycotters. They want to be useful citizens of a new dispensation. They wish to show by example that cooperation in South Africa can succeed." Kuhn concludes: "Let us then reach out to those who form the shrinking part of an old order. Their fears have not yet been assuaged, and it must be the task of others to help them to believe that they are not a rejected tribe. They are our language and cultural partners. When the lost sons and daughters feel themselves free to return, there must be happiness. The task of inclusivity has not ended with the election." Western Cape a Challenge -- The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 3 May says in a page-8 editorial: "The National Party's victory in the Western Cape is one of the highlights of the election. It is the only one of the nine provinces where the NP beat the ANC -- thanks to strong support among the colored community. The NP therefore has a particular responsibility in that region to prove, by means of effective management and a policy of reconcilation for the whole country, that its policy can and will be practically implemented. In short, the NP can make the Western Cape a showcase for its policy. If ever the party had an opportunity to apply affirmative action in human relations and all that it entails, it is in the Western Cape. It is a chance it must grab." Avoid Irresponsible Affirmative Action -- A second editorial on page 8 of BEELD says: "One has sympathy for the unenviable and almost impossible task the Independent Electoral Commision had in arranging the election in such a short time," and "one hopes that those who serve in the government of national unity as well as members of the new state administration have learned a few lessons from the election. The election serves as an example of how a country should not be run. If South Africa wants to become a success, weak administration, even mal-administration, poor training, strikes, waste and indiscriminate affirmative action will have to be avoided. The new government will have to ensure that people are properly trained for their task; that indiscriminate affirmative action for political gain is avoided; that people work for their money; and that unnecessary strikes which cost the country millions are stopped. South Africans voted for a new beginning -- they deserve better."
