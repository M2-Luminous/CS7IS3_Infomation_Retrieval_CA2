The Russian Border Troops leadership had decided to hold a session of the Main Military Council in Tajikistan. This unprecedented event--such military council sessions have not been held in the field for a very long time--illustrates yet again the enormous importance that Moscow attaches to the situation on the Afghan border. Even so, there has already been more than enough evidence in the past couple of weeks that the Tajik-Afghan border is today one of Russian's most important borders, even though it is separated from Russia itself by thousands of kilometers. On a trip to Dushanbe, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev visited the Moscow Border detachment. It was also visited by Russian Defense Minister Grachev, who had come to Tajikistan to see maneuvers by CIS collective peace-keeping forces. The exercises are being held with a view to the possible need to repulse a massive invasion of Tajikistan from the south, from Afghanistan. The situation on the border even worries Patriarch Aleksiy II of Moscow and All Rus, who has told Russian soldiers serving in Tajikistan that the "inviolability of the border of Tajikistan protects the inviolability of the borders of Russia, as well as of Ukraine, Belorussia and other countries." "We have to hold these lines, we will not retreat," Lieutenant-General Tymko, chief of the Russian Border Troops General Staff, told the assembled personnel of the Moscow Border Detachment's much-suffering Outpost No. 12. One gets the impression that if, God forbid, the Tajik-Afghan border were to be breached, it would spell the end of Russia. It is a strange border, to say the least. For a long time, the very men serving here could in no way figure it just what sort of border were they defending. The border of the Soviet Union? But it hasn't existed for a long time. Russia's border? Russia is far away. The border of the CIS? That's an abstract notion altogether. This vague situation persists in part to this day. Border markers with the inscription "inviolable" continue to stand along the Pyandzh River to this day, they were built to last. Posters and signs at the outposts say: "CIS Borders Are Inviolable!" On the faded signs, "CIS" stands out with a fresh coat of paint; under it one can clearly make out the initials "USSR." But no one here pays attention to such trifles here any more. A quite different peculiarity of this border is more prominent now--the fact this it is becoming increasingly less like a state border and more and more like a forward defense line. Outpost No. 12 has been rebuilt--the very one that was seized and destroyed last July by fighters who slipped in from Afghanistan. Well, it's not exactly the same. The old outpost is about four kilometers away. Its half-destroyed structures can be discerned with a powerful stereo-telescope. You can't go up close, the area is heavily mined. In actual fact, there really isn't an outpost here. Thin barbed wire along a line of trenches covers the top of a 1.5-kilometer hillock. There are a pair of dug-in tanks, an armored personnel carrier, dug-in mortars and a few dugouts that afford a person at least some protection from the penetrating mountain wind and sporadic shelling. And a Russian flag on a bent flagpole proudly flies above all this. It is a completely new type of border outpost, a creation of the post-Soviet era. It is a forward post on the border of a Russian sphere of influence. The new Outpost No. 12 has been moved about six kilometers back from the actual border. That area is a no man's land partially controlled by the border troops and partially controlled by their counterparts on the other bank of the Pyandzh--mujahedeen groups, and the armed Tajik opposition. In effect, several enemy staging grounds are scattered around new Outpost No. 12; despite constant skirmishes, efforts to dislodge the fighters have been unsuccessful. In April the border troops plan to finish mining the main trails leading from the Pyandzh to the outpost. In the meantime, they are nearly surrounded. At night, fighters approach to within range. And they fire on the outpost and launch rockets at it. They can also do this in the daytime. Last week two tank crewmen from the outpost who had gone for water (the only source is a depression half a kilometer below the outpost) encountered some fighters. Fortunately, they were able to safely escape. With sentries posted about, the men sit at their posts for three or four weeks at a time, becoming filthy and half-wild. Then they get a brief R&R, and it's back into the mountains. Officers and soldiers are in chronic short supply. "Where and what is in supply in our country?" said Lieutenant Colonel Masyuk, shrugging philosophically. Masyuk has seen everything in his two years as commander of the Moscow Border Detachment. (Incidentally, it's curious how a person undergoes a metamorphosis on the Tajik-Afghan border. At our last meeting 18 months ago, Masyuk was a typical career border officer, albeit one serving in a hotspot, it's true. Now he is more like a combat officer fighting in a border zone than a border soldier. Routine border service is now painfully distant from the Moscow commander's responsibilities: Mining strategic areas, conducting reconnaissance, setting up a zoned defense, drawing up operational plans). As for his subordinates... Yes, the undermanned force has clearly gotten a few reinforcements. The border detachment's half-extinct compounds have been invigorated somewhat. A few families sent to Russia during at the height of the tension in Tajikistan have returned. The Moscow Border Detachment has even opened a mini-school for officers' young children. But the number of those who serve here on a permanent basis is becoming fewer and fewer. The border detachments are switching to a system of getting officers based on a so-called "tour" method. They are sent here from other Russian border districts for six to 18 months. "At least a person knows for sure that this hell is going to end sometime," some of them told me. However, a temporary worker is temporary. The detachments have given these officers an unflattering (excuse me) nickname--"tampexes." I don't think one need explain the meaning. "The timing of the Main Military Council field meeting is no accident," explained Lt-Gen Tymko. "The hardest time to guard the state border--summer--is beginning, and the situation here is especially unstable at that time. And judging from how much combat equipment and manpower are concentrated on the opposite bank of the Pyandzh, this spring can't help but give rise to special apprehensions. Intelligence has reported unprecedented preparations by the mujahedeen and opposition fighters to storm the border. We have to be ready to not only guard it but also defend it." Incidentally, guarding and defending are fundamentally different notions. The concept of border service has always proceeded exclusively from the mission of guarding a border. A border soldier with a dog on patrol, a neatly plowed observation zone, an insidious intruder hobbling across the border on cow hooves--all that is from the realm of guard duty. But the border realities here constitute pure defense, for which the border troops have never been trained, for which they were never intended. The most the border guards are supposed to do is to engage an enemy advancing from the adjacent side and hold him until regular army units arrive. The "green caps" on the Tajik-Afghan border began fighting such battles several years ago. And they continue to hold their position, waiting for the army to move up. But what army? From where?
