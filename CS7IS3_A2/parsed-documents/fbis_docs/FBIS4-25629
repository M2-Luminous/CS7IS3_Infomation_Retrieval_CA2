Hsu said that the change in mainland policy is inevitable in light of the Qiandao Lake incident, which has once again exposed the nature of the Beijing regime and their ideas about cross-Taiwan Strait relations. Hsu, a career attorney, said the recent trial of three suspects involved in the Qiandao Lake murders was so speedy and so simple that the whole process was not only "coarse" but also "immoral." Taiwan was denied a say in the trial, hsu said, adding that the case early on turned from the criminal to political and needed a political solution. Hsu said Taiwan residents have been too hasty to develop close ties with the mainland since the 40-year ban on cross-strait contacts was lifted. The hastiness is understandable, he said, as the Taiwan people could not help themselves in the face of eager calls from the "homeland," and seemingly unlimited business opportunities, he said. Stricken with "mainland fever," Hsu said, Taiwan residents forgot to remind themselves of the huge difference between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and the fact that Beijing has never renounced its threat to take Taiwan by force.
