F. Trotskiy and V. I. Yamkovoy; Novosibirsk State University, 630090; UDC 577.113.6] [Abstract] In order to improve solid phase enzymatic synthesis of extended oligoribonucleotides, the authors used biogel P-300, sepharose 4B, and cellulose hydrazides as substrates to immobilize tetraribonucleotides that had been oxidized with sodium periodate. The reactivity of (pU)[.sup]3[/]pU[.sub]ox[/] and (Ap)[.sup]3[/]A[.sub]ox[/] tetraribonucleotides immobilized on the above substrates was studied in solid phase ligation and phosphorylation reactions. The subscript ``ox'' indicates a sodium periodate-oxidized nucleoside residue with cleavage of the 2'-3'-C-C-bond. In this case, it was discovered that the greatest yield in both reactions was achieved with the use of biogel P-300 and sepharose 4B. An advantage of sepharose 4B over biogel P-300 was that it had superior hydrodynamic qualities. References 7: 6 Russian, 1 Western.
