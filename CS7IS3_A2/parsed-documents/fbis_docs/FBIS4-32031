Zlatko Kuretic reports: [Kuretic] [passage omitted] After introductory speeches by the host and Franjo Greguric, the president of the Croatian Fire Brigade Association, the rally was addressed by President Franjo Tudjman. He expressed gratitude to the Croatian firemen for their contribution in the patriotic war. Speaking about the firemen's parade in Varazdin, he also said: [Begin Tudjman recording] This parade speaks about the unity of all parts of Croatia, of all Croatian counties, about the unity that we must nurture in all areas because we have established a single, independent, sovereign, and internationally recognized Croatian state. There are still people in the world who cannot reconcile themselves to this fact. Our Croatia has become, however, not just internationally recognized, but our sovereign and independent Croatia also has powerful allies and friends, including, in the first place, the United States, the most powerful world superpower in one part of the world, and also our friend China, another world power, in the other part of the world. We have good relations with the European Union and friendly relations with most of the European and other countries in the world. Croatia's international status is such that we can devote ourselves to carrying out other tasks before us: the liberation of the occupied parts of Croatian and the development of the federation and the confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina. From then on, we can devote ourselves in peace to economic and cultural development and to the tasks our government is faced with. In both the economic and political fields, we have achieved not just surprising results, but a miracle that the world is admiring. We have curbed inflation. We have created conditions for the introduction of a new Croatian currency that will be stable because our efforts and our sweat and blood are in our hands and will no longer go to foreign capitals. All our sweat and blood will be in the interests of Croatian men, Croatian people, and the Croatian state. [end recording] [passage omitted]
