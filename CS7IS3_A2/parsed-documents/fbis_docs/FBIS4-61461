The Tajik delegation includes Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov, Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov, National Bank Chairman Kayum Kavmidinov and a large group of experts. According to an official version, set forth by Emomali Rakhmonov's press secretary Nabi Karimov, the deepening and expansion of bilateral political, economic, and military cooperation will be discussed with the Russian leadership in Moscow. A Tajik Government official said any further procrastination on the process of unification of the monetary systems can lead to unpredictable political and economic consequences, since the industrial production slump has already reached a critical point because of blocked payments and the majority of the population have not received pay packets and various social allowances since the beginning of the year. Asked whether Tajikistan was planning to introduce temporary banknotes for the duration of the transitional period, as announced by the prime minister at recent press conference, the government official said there was no uniform approach to the problem among the Republics leaders. Moreover, Emomali Rakhmonov and National Bank Chairman Kayum Kavmidinov are against this measure. According to the official the Tajik leader will ask Moscow for more Russian cash to last through the transition period. Russian journalists at Dushanbe airport were denied even a blitz interview with the republic's top leaders before their departure for Moscow. Prime Minister Abdudzhalil Samadov said all details of the visit will be released to journalists after the visit.
