[Roman] I thought I knew him well, but I received a surprise. Of course, the surprise was only as far as I was concerned. I thought we had the same political beliefs and the same human features. But I had to ascertain that my trust in him was not justified. [Badralexi] Do you think it possible that he once uttered the words: "I cannot leave the political scene now, because the others will put me in jail"? [Roman] Anyone might say words like that at a time of political discord. Maybe some people feared such a thing at a certain point in time when the vindictive feature was very strong in Romanian society. Now, I consider such a statement to be pointless, if we think of the things that are known... [Badralexi] What if there are some other things? [Roman] In that case, everyone is also responsible for what is not known, if he is guilty of anything. Everyone is also responsible for what is not known at a given point. [Badralexi] To conclude this topic, would you say that the danger resides in the fact that President Iliescu does not sincerely believe in giving land to the peasants and that he considers that the only purpose of factories is to ensure food for the workers? [Roman] From a political viewpoint, this is definitely a danger. I would like to be more concrete and recall the million jobs promise he has made during the electoral campaign, something that was obviously impossible to achieve. Therefore, there is a danger here, because the peasants' work has always been the main source of economic growth in Romania. Second, the Romanian factories can only survive if they adjust to the generally recognized principles of management. They have markets, technology, and everything else they need so that, briefly put, they can obtain 1,001 lei-worth of production for 1,000 lei-worth of costs. This was not the case in Ceausescu's [former communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu] time, when many industries were operating at a loss despite the fact that the raw materials were cheaper than in other countries. To continue this state of affairs today, through such a political attitude, is a dangerous thing. If the President Is Not Able To Adjust to Reality, the Citizens Will Draw Appropriate Conclusions [Badralexi] Can anything be done to convince the president that his approach is dangerous? [Roman] The influence of such an approach is obviously nefarious. However, since he keeps coming in contact with the economic reality of the developed world, I believe that the president will realize that this is the only way for us, too. Moreover, I subscribe to the idea of maintaining the social structure -- this is a dominant feature of our party -- only that this effort becomes meaningless, if it does not rely on a solid economic reality. This is all. This is the simple difference between demagoguery and pragmatism. [Badralexi] Do you believe that we can simply ignore the danger to or posed by President Iliescu? [Roman] One can never ignore what a president says, particularly in a semi-parliamentary republic like ours. However, the reality obliges the president to realize what the situation is really like and if he is not able to adjust to that reality, the citizens will draw appropriate conclusion. [Badralexi] Let us hope so. Mr. Roman, many share your fear that Romania might lose the race with the other Eastern European countries. Do you think that the current holders of the power do not share these fears? [Roman] I am afraid they do not. The majority of those currently occupying important positions in the administration are people used to the methods and mentalities of the centralized regime. Somewhere, at the back of their minds, they do not believe in the need for Romania to reach the standards of the civilized world. It Would Be a Crime for Romania To Now Miss Its Greatest Chance [Badralexi] Are we talking here about irresponsibility, ignorance, or stupidity? [Roman] We are faced here with an entire mental system that shaped the people who grew within that system. Consequently, they are unable to think differently. I noted this in many ruling acts and recovery plans of the current government. I am really concerned about this aspect. Romania has missed a lot of chances in its history, and it would be a crime to also miss a chance now that is probably greater than ever before. [Badralexi] Why is it greater than ever before? [Roman] For an external and internal reason. In the modern world, the desire to see as many nations as possible entering the democratic space is very big. I am firmly convinced of that. On the other hand, from an internal viewpoint, the great majority of the people are capable of getting hold of information in various ways. They have access to information. To all this one should add the everlasting desire of the Romanians to see their country make as much progress as possible. [Badralexi] In your opinion, what are Romania's chances that the great powers will not sacrifice it again to the omnipresent Russians? [Roman] I do not believe in this desire to sacrifice Romania. I am qualified to state this, in the wake of my contacts with responsible representatives of the great powers. I repeat, today there is a desire to see Romania in the front-ranking group. [Badralexi] I hope to God you are right... [Roman] God will see to it, while we will actually do it. [Badralexi] May this come true. Is this desire shared by other quarters, too, outside Western Europe? [Roman] It is also shared by the United States. I have enough proof of that. But let us go back to our being sacrificed to Russia's omnipresence and omnipotence -- so as to return to your question. In this respect, everything depends on our choice. Until now, our choice has categorically been in favor of NATO integration, with the exception of the extremist hysteria, which, however, is not decisive. Well, this commitment should remain categorical and should be implemented. Then, we will be able to eliminate the Russian insistence on maintaining a certain sphere of influence. Let us remember that Romania has already managed to do that in the period between the two world wars. We Are Not Calling Upon the People To Make New Sacrifices [Badralexi] Would an eventual victory of the opposition in the case of early elections further the cause of Romania's integration into NATO? [Roman] This is a very good question. Regarding our progress toward the Western structures, the answer is definitely yes. The opinion-shaping leaders of the majority would no longer be people who are definitely indebted to, if not even the slaves of, the Ceausescu mentality. However, there is still the problem of overcoming the economic blockage. In this respect, it is not sure that an opposition majority would be able to do much about it. The reason for that is that we need a solid consensus in these times of transition. However, I believe that such a majority should be endorsed by a broader political spectrum, since contestations are extremely damaging to the implementation of reform. It is obvious that we must take unpopular steps in the short run; but if voices come up promising to ease the people's lot, then everything is going to be spoiled... However, reform does not require new sacrifices. We are not calling upon the people to make new sacrifices, but to work. However, if the people are to do that, they must first realize that there is no alternative to it. [Badralexi] Therefore, in case the current opposition emerges victorious in the elections, will it engage into negotiations with the future opposition? [Roman] Yes, I believe it will be necessary to engage in a very serious dialogue with it. [Badralexi] What makes you think that that dialogue would be more successful than the recent negotiations? The dialogue partners will be practically the same... [Roman] This does not matter, since the other side will no longer negotiate from its current position. At this moment, they are putting their own interests above the country's interests. [Badralexi] Do you think that they will keep believing that their power is everlasting? [Roman] This is quite possible, if we think of the mentalities I referred to before. This is how they used to think and this is how they are going to think in the future, too. Not all of them, of course, but anyhow, those who are now represented in the government. [Badralexi] Nevertheless, do you believe that a man like Mr. Adrian Nastase [Party of Social Democracy, PDSR, executive president] can be so naive? [Roman] No. I suspect that Adrian Nastase -- a man who has been around the world -- does not believe in that, but I see that he is playing that game. Therefore, he probably has no independence in the matter. [Badralexi] Does Mr. Gherman [Oliviu Gherman, PDSR president] have such independence? [Roman] I do not think he has it either. However, Mr. Gherman is a man without strong personal ambitions. Consequently, he is sometimes able to give a better and more positive nuance to his stands. [Badralexi] Could Mr. Gherman's attitude have a positive role within the PDSR? [Roman] I hope so. 17 June 1990 Was a Great Trial for Me... [Badralexi] If the Democratic Convention [CDR] wins the next elections, would you want or be able to participate in a government? [Roman] I do not think we would really want to do that. However, we would like to reach an agreement with the CDR on the package of necessary measures, after which we can give them our endorsement. [Badralexi] Would such an alliance be viable? [Roman] Yes. [Badralexi] Mr. Roman, do you not regret now that you agreed to become prime minister at the beginning? [Roman] When, on 26 December [1989] or 28 June [1990]? [Badralexi] On 28 June. [Roman] If I think about it, I do not regret it, since what was done at the time -- to the extent of eliminating certain old structures or filling up certain gaps in the process of the country's modernization -- is a positive thing. [Badralexi] This may be so, but I was addressing myself to the politician Petre Roman of today. [Roman] On 17 June I was thinking of resigning. That was my great trial. If I were to think about it as a politician, therefore with a certain degree of egotism, the answer is yes. After all, such a gesture would have probably solved a lot for the following year. I am not the man to think egoistically...
