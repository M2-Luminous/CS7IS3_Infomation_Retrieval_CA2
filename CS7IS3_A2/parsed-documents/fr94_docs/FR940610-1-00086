FR940610-1-00086 FR940610-1-00008 Field Crop Impacts The major impact of the proposed rule on the field crop markets would be in the wheat market. Menu changes would increase the wheat used in various forms in the school lunch program from 16.5 million bushels currently to 28&hyph;30 million bushels, under the first two scenarios, in a total U.S. market of 2.5 billion bushels. While the difference between scenarios is insignificant, an increase in wheat demand of 10 to 15 million bushels could spark a small adjustment in the market. After offsetting changes in production, feed use and exports are taken into account, the net increase in total use would be roughly 5 million bushels and generate a 2 cent per bushel higher farm price. This would reduce deficiency payments by about $35 million (from a 1990&hyph;93 base of $1.9 billion) and would increase farmers' market receipts by about $45 million (from a 1990&hyph;93 base of $7.3 billion), more than offsetting the lost deficiency payments. Rice use would increase roughly 1 million hundred weight under the first and second scenarios in a national market of 180 million hundred weight. This would generate less than a 1 percent change in the farm price of rice, a $7&hyph;9 million increase in market revenues, and an offsetting $6&hyph;8 million reduction in government payments. The proposed rule could also reduce use of oilseeds and related products. Changes in menu items as well as preparation techniques would decrease use of vegetable oils for frying and salad dressings. But the decreases would be too small to measurably affect prices; moreover, with government support for oilseeds limited to a loan program with rates set well below forecast market prices, there would be no budget implications. Peanut Impacts In the agricultural impact models developed for this analysis, peanuts are part of a group including legumes and nuts. This group shows some increases under the first and second scenarios, although the direct impact on peanuts is less clear. Even if the findings for the group as a whole are assumed to similarly impact peanuts, the impacts of the proposed rule on the peanut market would be small under the first and second scenarios. Under the first and second scenarios, total usage of peanuts in the school lunch program would increase about 6 million pounds from its current school lunch base of about 44 million pounds. This increase represents less than 0.3 percent of the total U.S. peanut market of 2 billion pounds. Farm prices of peanuts are expected to rise about 0.1 percent and farm revenues increase about $1.0 million. There would be no impact on the government cost of the peanut program.

They also emphasize that school menus would have to change in order to avoid any impacts in the commodity market.
