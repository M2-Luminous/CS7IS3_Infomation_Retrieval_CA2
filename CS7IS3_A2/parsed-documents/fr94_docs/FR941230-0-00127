SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 23, 1994, CSRS published in the Federal Register (59 FR 48978&hyph;48985) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on the revision of the administrative provisions for the Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants Program. Public Comment In the NPRM, CSRS invited comments on the proposed regulations for consideration in the formulation of a final rule. No comments were received in response to the invitation in the NPRM. With the exception of changing the references to CSRS to CSREES, there are no differences between the NPRM and these final regulations. Paperwork Reduction Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the collection of information requirements contained in this rule have been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and given the OMB Document Nos. 0524&hyph;0022 and 0524&hyph;0024. Classification This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order No. 12866 and it has been determined that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' rule because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. This rule will not create any serious inconsistencies or otherwise interfere with actions taken or planned by another agency. It will not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs and does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order No. 12866. In addition, it will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law No. 96&hyph;534 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .). This rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order No. 12778, Civil Justice Reform, and the required certification has been made to OMB. All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule are preempted. No retroactive effect is to be given to this rule. This rule does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. Regulatory Analysis Not required for this rulemaking. Environmental Impact Statement This regulation does not significantly affect the environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq . Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.210, Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants. For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule-related Notice to 7 CFR Part 3015, subpart V, 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983, at which time the authority to administer this program resided in the Agricultural Research Service, this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order No. 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. Background and Purpose Under the authority of section 1417(b)(6) of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 3152(b)(6), the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to conduct a competitive graduate fellowship grants program. This action amends the administrative regulations governing the Food and Agricultural Sciences National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants Program published in the Federal Register on February 13 1987 (52 FR 4712&hyph;4716), and on January 22, 1990 (55 FR 2214&hyph;2215). Establishment of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service Pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;354, the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture issued Secretary's Memorandum 1010&hyph;1, Reorganization of the Department of Agriculture, on October 20, 1994. That memorandum orders the abolishment of the Cooperative State Research Service and the establishment of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service which assumes the function previously performed by the Cooperative State Research Service. This rule includes amendments to 7 CFR chapter XXXIV which are necessary to bring agency regulations into alignment with the departmental reorganization.
