To ensure PFL support for his plan -- the Social Emergency Fund [FSE] will be voted on today -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso committed himself to stimulating government participation in the revision, including voting on changes in the economic order. The minister asserted that he supports the end of monopolies in the field of telecommunications and oil. The PFL defends these points as being fundamental for the revision. Cardoso yesterday received for breakfast PFL President Jorge Bornhausen and PFL leaders in the Senate Marco Maciel (Pernambuco) and Luis Eduardo (Bahia). The minister's first gesture in favor of the revision was to ask rapporteur-general Nelson Jobim (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party -- Rio Grande do Sul) to move forward the date for reporting his comments on the amendments and proposals related to the economic order. Bornhausen said: This is a political gesture by the minister. He is thus stimulating debate about the issues that we deem fundamental for the revision. The agreement with the PFL will make it possible to vote on postponement of the constitutional revision to 31 May -- as the PFL wants -- during today's session of the Constituent Congress, which has been convened to vote on the FSE. According to Cardoso's agreement with the PFL leaders, postponement of the deadline for the end of the revision work will be voted on first, as a guarantee of the government's commitment to the constitutional revision. According to Senator Marco Maciel, the agreement does not mean that the government will support the changes proposed by the PFL: "There are changes in the economic order that are of interest for the development of the plan, but the leaders of the party and of the allied bloc in Congress will be responsible for their approval."
