Comrade Wang Zhongyu, chairman of the State Economic and Trade Commission, delivered a report "on further giving considerations to the issues of achieving state-owned enterprises." Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, attended the report meeting. Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, chaired the meeting. Comrade Wang Zhongyu pointed out in his report: State-owned enterprises, as the pillar of the national economy, have made great contributions to reform. The reform of state-owned enterprises is the key and a difficult point of economic system reform. The party Central Committee and the State Council have paid full attention to the problems of state-owned enterprises. Comrade Wang Zhongyu introduced: The current development trend of state-owned enterprises is very good. The situation of enterprises has been improved. These enterprises' real profits have noticeably increased. The number of money-losing state-owned enterprises has really been reduced. In line with the situation that the number of money-losing state-owned enterprises is to be expanded and the amounts of deficits are to increase this year, Comrade Wang Zhongyu said: All this results from the facts that since the implementation of "the general rule for enterprises' financial affairs," "the criterion for enterprises' accounting," and the law on manufacturing costs from last July, state-owned enterprises have increased the depreciation rate of enterprises' equipment and have had to transfer some funds from enterprises' profits, such as long-term loan interests, newly added wages, and bonuses, to production costs. Although this has caused a decrease in enterprises' profits as kept in their accounts, changed some enterprises from ones with small profits into ones with deficits and from ones with covert deficits into ones with overt deficits, the enterprises' real results have increased. Comrade Wang Zhongyu stressed: We should pay high attention to the difficulties and problems that state-owned enterprises are confronted with, and conscientiously solve these difficulties and problems. He analyzed the reasons for causing some enterprises' deficits, suspension of production, operation under capacity, and strain on capital; and then pointed out that state-owned enterprises have prospects and are able to enliven themselves. In regard to the issue of how to achieve state-owned enterprises, Comrade Wang Zhongyu said: First, state-owned enterprises should change their ideas to suit the changes in the socialist market economic situation. Second, we should grasp favorable opportunities to deepen reform and to comprehensively reform the auxiliary systems, make key breakthroughs, and set up new restriction and encouragement mechanisms for enterprises. Third, according to different actual conditions, we should work out countermeasures to help state-owned enterprises handle their major and difficult problems. Fourth, we should expand the dynamics of technological reform and accelerate the readjustment of structures. Fifth, we should strengthen enterprise management and comprehensively upgrade enterprises' quality. Sixth, we should create conditions to set up a modern enterprise system and to promote the implementation of this system in a step-by-step manner. Seventh, we should set up a social guarantee system to create external conditions for deepening enterprises' reform. Chen Xitong made a speech at the report meeting. He said: Setting up the frame of the socialist market economic system is a long-term and arduous task. So, we should not only grasp favorable opportunities to speed up the pace of reform but also make progress step by step. Advancing step-by-step is a special feature and an advantage of China's reform. This is a successful experience to stably push the large ship of reform forward. He also said: State-owned enterprises are our foundation. Enterprises are still the standpoints of the overall reform. If we fail to enliven state-owned enterprises, it will be impossible for us to make a success in reform. The overall situation at present is not bad. We should try every possible means to help enliven the enterprises with difficulties so long as they have markets for their products and have efficiency. This is conducive to maintaining stability. The central authorities, the municipal party committee, and the municipal government have paid attention to the difficulties of state-owned enterprises. They have adopted many measures to help resolve their difficulties. Simultaneously, enterprises should be inspired with enthusiasm, strive to make explorations, and make efforts to study the problems of their own. Only by so doing will they be able to resolve their difficulties and problems and will we be able to attain our targets. Present at the meeting were leading comrades of the municipal party committee and the municipal government, including Chen Guangwen and Wang Baosen; responsible comrades of the departments, commissions, and offices under the municipal party committee and the municipal government; and secretaries of party committees of the bureaus, general companies, and some large plants under the industrial work commission of the municipal party committee.
