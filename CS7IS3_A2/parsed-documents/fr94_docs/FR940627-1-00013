FR940627-1-00013 FR940627-1-00009 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Delissea undulata was first described by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupre from specimens he collected in the Hawaiian Islands (``Isles Sandwich'') in 1819 (St. John 1959). He chose the specific epithet to refer to the undulating margins of the leaves. F.E. Wimmer named a specimen J.F. Rock collected in 1911 from Kanahaha, Kona, as Cyanea arqutidenta, which H. St. John later moved to the genus Delissea (St. John 1959, Wimmer 1943). St. John also named a specimen collected in 1968 from the southern Kona District as D. konaensis (St. John 1986). The current treatment of the family (Lammers 1988, 1990) considers all of the above species to be synonymous with D. undulata. Lammers recognizes three subspecies of D. undulata: subsp. niihauensis, subsp. kauaiensis, and subsp. undulata (Lammers 1988, 1990). Delissea undulata of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae) is a palm-like tree with unbranched woody stems 2 to 10 meters (m) (6 to 30 feet (ft)) tall. The leaves are long and narrow or elliptic with long petioles and undulate or flat, toothed margins, about 5 to 21 centimeters (cm) (2 to 8 inches (in)) long and 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4 in) wide. The flowering stalk bears 5 to 20 greenish-white, slightly down-curved flowers 1.6 to 2.5 cm (0.6 to 1.0 in) long with one or two small knobs on the upper surfaces. The fruits are ovoid to globose purple berries 0.6 to 1.2 cm (0.2 to 0.4 in) long. The three subspecies of D. undulata can be distinguished from each other by leaf shape and leaf margin characteristics: subsp. kauaiensis has ovate leaves with flat, sharply toothed margins; subsp. niihauensis has leaves with heart-shaped bases and shallow roundly toothed margins; and subsp. undulata has narrower, lance-shaped leaves with undulating margins and spreading, pointed teeth (Lammers 1988, 1990). The species D. undulata is distinguished from closely related species in this genus by its broader leaf bases, larger flowers, and larger berries (Lammers 1990). Historically, D. undulata is known from Niihau, Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii. Subspecies kauaiensis was collected west of the Hanapepe River on the island of Kauai by A.A. Heller in 1895 and has not been relocated (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1991a, Heller 1897, Lammers 1988). Subspecies niihauensis was collected twice in the 1800's on the island of Niihau and has not been located since (HHP 1991b, Hillebrand 1888, St. John 1959). Both of these subspecies are considered extinct (HHP 1991a, 1991b; Lammers 1990). Delissea undulata subsp. undulata was reported from four valleys of southwestern Maui in the 1800's, and from the Kona region of the island of Hawaii (HHP 1991c1 to 1991c9). This subspecies was observed in 1971 at Puu Lehua and was subsequently thought to be extinct (HHP 1991c6, Lammers 1990). However, one individual plant was discovered on April 24, 1992, at Puu Waawaa, at a previously unreported location on Hualalai on the island of Hawaii (Jon Giffin, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (Hawaii DLNR), in litt. 1993). Delissea undulata grows primarily in dry and mesic forests at about 1,000 to 1,750 m (3,300 to 5,700 ft) elevation (Lammers 1990; J. Giffin, in litt. , 1993). The substrate is a thin organic soil layer over 'a'a or pahoehoe lava (Department of Geography 1983). The only known individual grows on the brink of a collapsed lava tube at 1070 m (3520 ft) elevation. The vegetation is open Sophora chrysophylla (mamane)- Metrosideros polymorpha ('ohia) forest with such associated species as Santalum ellipticum ('iliahi) and Acacia koa (koa). The endangered species Nothocestrum breviflorum ('aiea) also is found in the area of the one remaining individual of D. undulata. Introduced plants in the area include Pennisetum clandestinum (kikuyu grass), Passiflora mollissima (banana poka), and Senecio mikanioides (German ivy) (J. Giffin, in litt. , 1993). The greatest immediate threats to the survival of D. undulata are damage from domestic and feral herbivores and competition with alien plants. Fire, whether started naturally or by arson, poses a serious threat to the population. The small population size of one individual with its limited gene pool also comprises a serious threat to this species (J. Giffin, in litt. , 1993).
