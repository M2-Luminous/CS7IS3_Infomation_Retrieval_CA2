He insisted that any Union approach to the drugs phenomenon could only be truly comprehensive if it were integrated into a wider European and global strategy, which in turn pointed to the importance of the Pan-European Conference. Commissioner Flynn drew attention to the disturbing increase in illicit drugs activities in Central and Eastern Europe and asked for these countries to be assisted in their efforts to create an effective and multidisciplinary drugs strategy. The Pan-European Conference must provide the platform "for an ever more intense and comprehensive effort" in the fight against illicit drugs.
