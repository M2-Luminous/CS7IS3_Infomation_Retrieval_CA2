In response, both the United States and South Korea have reached an agreement to suspend the resumption of their joint military exercise "Team Spirit." We have maintained that the suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development should be solved not through a "north wind" [hard-line measures] such as economic sanctions but through negotiations, and that the solution should lead to the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and to the normalization of the whole situation. We would like to highly appraise the UNSC's rational decision. We sincerely hope that North Korean leaders will positively react to the statement and they will accept additional IAEA inspections to dispel the suspicion of its nuclear development. The international community's prudent stance is an indication of its hope to resolve the nuclear suspicion through negotiations. North Korea should not misunderstand this intention. Before the statement was issued, the IAEA special Board of Directors had referred the matter back to the UNSC, claiming that it failed to confirm that nuclear materials had not been used for military purposes because its first inspection of seven North Korean nuclear-related facilities in a year was obstructed. In response, the United States, the UK, France, and Russia, which are permanent UNSC members, worked out a draft resolution which urged North Korea to accept nuclear inspections within one month and hinted at future economic sanctions against the country, stating that if North Korea does not comply with the resolution, "a further step will be taken." However, China did not change its policy of seeking a solution through dialogue during recent successive visits to China by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. The country has called for a presidential statement which has less binding power than a resolution, and 10 nonpermanent UNSC members have agreed with it. For this reason, it appears that the United States and other nations have decided to take a course of moderation. Consideration for North Korea is seen everywhere in the presidential statement. While it says it is "regrettable" that the IAEA inspection failed to bring a conclusion to the question of whether nuclear materials had been transferred to military weapons, the statement says it has attached "importance" to North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA inspection. The "25 February U.S.-DPRK agreement," to which the presidential statement especially refers, stipulated simultaneous implementation of the following: 1) North Korea's acceptance of inspections of its nuclear facilities; 2) resumption of South-North dialogue; 3) suspension of "Team Spirit" military exercise this year; and 4) start of the third round of the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. However, the United States later proposed that the IAEA's full inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities and exchange of special envoys between the North and the South become a precondition to the start of the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. North Korea has expressed opposition to the U.S. proposal. It is hoped that all the parties concerned will resume their own dialogue with North korea as soon as possible in line with the the UNSC presidential statement. Especially, the U.S.-DPRK negotiation is the key dialogue. North Korea has promised that if the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks are held, it will discuss such issues as its complete return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and switchover of its nuclear facilities to light water reactors, together with the issue of normalizing relations between the United States and the DPRK. Moreover, the country has maintained: "We have no obligation to accept full inspection of our nuclear facilities because we have now just suspended the effectiveness of our declaration of withdrawing from the NPT." If the United States succeeds to have North Korea return to the NPT through high-level talks, there will be no grounds for North Korea to assert such a peculiar logic. The United States and North Korea should resume their working-level talks immediately and should make concessions to implement the above four points at the same time. Moreover, we hope that China will continue to serve as a mediator between North Korea and the countries concerned from now on and it will play a major role in achieving denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. The real value of the UNSC presidential statement, which China pushed forward, will be judged from now on.
