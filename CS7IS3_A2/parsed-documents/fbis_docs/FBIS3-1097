General Fiore, the commander of our contingent in the country, who, as you will recall, is stationed on the aircraft carrier Garibaldi, has given a precise order to all journalists to leave Mogadishu immediately in order to board the carrier, where, as I will remind you, the bodies of our two colleagues have been taken. Filippo Gaudenzi spoke on the telephone to Gen Fiore. Let's hear what he had to say. [Begin recording] [Gaudenzi] What is the situation like at present in Mogadishu? [Fiore] The situation is always difficult, and anything can happen from one moment to the next. For all intents and purposes, we no longer have any information sources on the ground because we are now stationed only at the port area and the airport. The last 90 soldiers will board the aircraft carrier this evening, and, in this way, our mission is over. [Gaudenzi] In other words, does this mean that none of our fellow nationals will remain in Somalia? [Fiore] From this evening, when the last group will board the ship, none of the contingent will remain on land. Only the diplomatic delegation, the ambassador, some administrators from the embassy and a group of carabinieri to escort the ambassador will remain. [Gaudenzi] What is the morale like of the men following the end of a mission whose balance sheet has yet to be added up? [Fiore] This event has hit us hard because we were used to living with these journalists. They almost seemed to belong to us. We are very sad. The journalists had been with us for a week, and the irony is that this evening they would have boarded the Garibaldi to return to Italy with us. [Gaudenzi] Do you think it significant that the two journalists were Italian? Did they want to kill Italians? [Fiore] Not just Italians. They wanted to kill Westerners. There are very few Westerners remaining in Somalia, and Italians are Westerners. Unfortunately, this is the way it goes. [Gaudenzi] When do you expect to return to Italy? [Fiore] We should have left this evening, but our schedule has been altered slightly because tomorrow morning a [word indistinct] 122 will arrive from Mombassa. We will load the bodies of the two journalists on the 122 (?plane), which will then leave for Italy. I believe that we will finally leave on 23 March. [end recording]
