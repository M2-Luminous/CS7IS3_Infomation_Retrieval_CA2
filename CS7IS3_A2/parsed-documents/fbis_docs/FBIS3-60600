Commenting on a remark which IZVESTIYA attributed to V. Kryzhanovskiy claiming that "80 dismantled and disassembled nuclear warheads" were dispatched to Russia, Yakovlev claims that the "ambassador's words do not correspond to the real state of affairs." The Press Service of the Ukrainian Embassy in the Russian Federation is authorized to state that the Ukrainian ambassador did not make any such remark either during the 23 November press conference or at any other time. This also becomes obvious on objective analysis of the transcripts of the press conference -- both the one available to the embassy press service and, for instance, the one which was prepared and then circulated to subscribers of the Russian-U.S. FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE agency. Incidentally, nothing of the sort was reported in the VESTI broadcast which IZVESTIYA cites (the embassy has the video recording in its possession). The issue at the press conference was the Ukrainian side's readiness to start carrying out the treaty straight after ratification by the parliament, which the mass media, including the Russian media, reported straight away. [Signed] The Press Service of the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow.
