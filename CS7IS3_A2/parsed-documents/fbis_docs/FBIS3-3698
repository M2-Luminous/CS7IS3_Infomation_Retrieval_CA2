In 1993 alone, Tibet approved 40 cooperative investment projects with a contracted investment volume of over 67 million yuan and $9.6 million, thus setting a record in introducing outside capital to the region. Foreign trade volume reached $100 million, setting a record. This shows that the original rigid and closed form of economy in the region has been broken and that the region's economy is beginning to move in the direction of an open pattern. A new economic operating mechanism is taking shape. Last year, the regional party committee and government lost no time in taking the initiative to open up Tibet to the outside world by strengthening ties with neighboring provinces and cities, especially strengthening lateral economic cooperation with the coastal areas. Serious efforts were made to cultivate markets outside the region and to support and encourage economic departments and enterprises to seek markets in the coastal areas and in other countries. According to incomplete statistics, economic and foreign trade departments in various prefectures and cities set up nearly 100 trade missions, export-oriented trade display centers, and wholly owned or joint venture enterprises in Guangdong, Shandong, Shanghai, Liaoning, Tianjin, Beijing, and Hainan Provinces and Cities. The regional department of economic relations and trade alone set up more than 20 foreign trade centers in the coastal areas. It also cooperated with foreign firms to establish more than 10 export-oriented enterprises, including an eiderdown processing plant in Shenzhen, a goat down processing plant in Hebei, and a warehouse in the Tianjin Bonded Area. Through these centers, Tibet's farm and animal products and nationality handicraft products were able to enter the world market. While transforming their operating mechanisms, state-owned enterprises in the region also took the initiative to enter into cooperation with large enterprises in the coastal areas. So far, they have established dozens of export-oriented wholly owned or cooperative enterprises in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. In Hainan Province alone, Tibet has set up more than 10 enterprises there. To attract outside business firms and to promote prosperity by opening up to the outside world, the autonomous region stepped up the construction of infrastructure facilities in 1993 despite financial difficulties in a bid to expand trading with other parts of China and foreign countries. It invested more than 1 billion yuan to finance the expansion of the Bangda Airport in Gonggar County, to improve the Sichuan-Tibet, Qinghai-Tibet, and China-Nepal highways, to import advance communications equipment, to install program-controlled, direct-dialing telephones in the urban areas of six prefectures and cities, and to build new power stations. At the same time, the right to handle foreign trade and the power to examine and approve foreign trade investment projects were delegated to lower levels, thus enhancing the capacity to attract foreign investments and investments from other parts of China. So far, Tibet has attracted nearly 1 billion yuan worth of investments from more than 20 provinces and cities in China and more than $100 million of foreign capital, and has accepted nearly 30 aid projects, worth more than $40 million, from United Nations organizations and the governments of foreign countries.
