The Romanian president found Domingo's concert "a good overture to this conference," and said he hoped the presence at the conference of the Israeli foreign minister and the PLO leader is a "good omen," showing optimism about the possibility of direct contacts these days in Bucharest. Challenged by a journalist with the supposition that an agreement might be signed, the president said: "I do not know if the stage of signing an agreement will be reached, because negotiations are in progress. They will be coming with fresh information from the negotiations under way in Cairo, but we do hope that their meeting in Bucharest marks a positive step, stimulative for the ongoing of the negotiations." President Iliescu also expressed the hope that the conference might contribute to the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis and to stopping the conflict in that area.
