The KNSB has warned that it will call a general strike on May 17. It was decided that the government proposals would be discussed by a working group as of May 13. Prof. Petkov also said the government was ready to put forward its ideas on the other proposals by the KNSB, including the curbing of inflated prices and giving an impetus to the structural adjustment of the economy and privatization, which are now at a standstill. Prime Minister Lyuben Berov headed the government delegation to the talks as Prof. Petkov had insisted. While suggesting certain measures, the KNSB has failed to suggest ways and means to solve problems, Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev said after the talks. The trade union should comply with budget austerity in 1994, as well as with the agreements with the IMF on the cabinet's domestic economic policy, Matinchev said. The document proposed by the cabinet is incomplete and needs updating, trade union leader Petkov said. Tomorrow the KNSB will present to Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov a draft document on the protection of deposits of individuals from inflation. The trade union will press parliament to amend the Confiscation Act and pass a bankruptcy law and a law on the separation of social funds from the budget, Petkov said. On April 4 the KNSB announced it would call a general strike and made social and union claims on the cabinet, which were further developed. The trade union calls for state programmes for economic stabilization. The KNSB insists on the rehabilitation of the economy and clarifications on certain questions of foreign policy. An appeal to the political forces approved by the trade union yesterday calls for "a new reform, new parliamentary elections and a new government." The KNSB pledged its assistance and at least two years of social peace to any party or coalition that would win the elections by democratic means and would implement a national reform programme. Should the political forces, parliament and the government persist in trying to implement a reform forced on this country, which poses a threat of lasting instability and a return to totalitarianism, the KNSB will block this reform, the document says. The other most influential trade union, Podkrepa, officially stated yesterday it would not support the KNSB strike. Podkrepa affirmed that it is against the present cabinet and called for parliamentary elections. Podkrepa leader Konstantin Trenchev informed Krustyu Petkov that Podkrepa was considering "unconventional forms of protest" against a new government if it allowed the "plundering of the country" to continue behind its back. The Association of Democratic Trade Unions announced a day of union action today and staged protests in Sofia. In an appeal to the state institutions the association called for amendments to Labour Code provisions on cooperation between the cabinet, employers and the trade unions, and on collective bargaining.
