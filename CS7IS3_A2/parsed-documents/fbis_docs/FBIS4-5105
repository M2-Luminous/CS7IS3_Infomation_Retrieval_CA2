Last month, 68 inter-Korean deals worth 21.28 million U.S. dollars were approved by NUB. This compares with 53 cases amounting to 14.77 million dollars in February. The monthly total for March exceeded 20 million dollars for the first time since last August. The sharp increase was caused by North Korea's expansion of imports to offset a shortage of materials. Inter-Korean deals approved by NUB in the first quarter are forecast to rise 10.3 percent from the same period last year.
