We appeal to all the fellow countrymen: Fellow countrymen, 14 years ago, our people suffered a terrible disaster in Kwangju owing to the United States. The entire city turned into a city of blood, all the streets were covered with corpses, and all the streams inside the city were running with blood. That was Kwangju in May. So many innocent people were shot dead by the airborne special warfare force driven by the United States, were crushed to death by their armored vehicles, and stabbed with their swords. Even before the disappearance of this grudge, the cursed United States is bringing a horrible nuclear holocaust upon our people and our nation. Finding fault with the North's nuclear issue in a groundless manner, the United States has expanded its nuclear strategic commotions step by step. Now, it has even announced a blunt plan for a war of northward aggression and is staging a hectic war exercise on the sea and ground, and in the air with the introduction of massive war means, like Patriots, and the armed forces of aggression close to South Korea and the Korean peninsula, driving the situation to a phase of war. This is naked expression of the aggressive design of the United States which aims to sacrifice our people and nation in a nuclear war to realize its strategic goal. Using the South Korean-U.S. cooperative system of countering the North's so-called nuclear issue as bait, the United States grasped $5 billion and put an end to 6 million South Korean farmers' lives by enforcing the opening of rice market. Now, it is scheming to make undue profits worth billions of dollars by opening South Korea's weapons market while babbling about countering the arms buildup of the so-called nuclear threat from the North. The United States is running amuck in putting pressure on the North, even going through the United Nations in a bid to open the way out for U.S. war industrial complexes that are facing marketing difficulties with the end of the cold war and in order to revive the sluggish U.S. economy by turning our country's land into a nuclear war theater and by sacrificing our nation in a nuclear war. Do you see the evil intention of Wall Street! How can we permit this if we are to call ourselves descendents whose hearts throb with the blood of the Korean race? It is deplorable and heart-breaking to see a nation divided into two to live in such a condition for almost half a century without achieving reunification. Worse still, why must we endure a nuclear holocaust forced upon us by yankees from across the ocean? Was there any time in the long history of our nation that we had to experience such a heart-breaking crisis of national suffering? Our people can never become an object of exploitation, nor can our nation be sacrificed in a nuclear war. Now is the time that all the people must rise in a struggle to regain national sovereignty. Our nation must determinedly rise in a struggle to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons fraught with nuclear holocaust withdrawn from South Korea and to smash U.S. pressure to open the rice and weapons markets. Let us all put an end to the colonial rule and intervention of the U.S. imperialists and retake the sovereignty of the nation with the nationwide anti-U.S. struggle. Smashing the U.S. imperialists' war maneuvers and defending the peace on the Korean peninsula are a vital question directly linked with our nation's fate. Patriot missiles are not for defense but for a war gamble. Let us audaciously carry out a struggle to withdraw the Patriot missiles that support a nuclear war. The U.S. arms buildup and the Team Spirit exercise are aimed at kindling the flame of war on this land. Let all fellow countrymen who love peace and value the nation rise in a struggle to deter the U.S. scheme to buildup arms, to suspend the Team Spirit exercise, and to smash the U.S. imperialists' war maneuvers. Leaving intact the Kim Yong-sam clique which is parasitic on the chin of the United States, our people and nation would not be able to avoid a calamity. Let us all overthrow Kim Yong-sam, the arch traitor to the nation, who has reduced South Korea to a colony and a nuclear forward base of the United States and which schemes to ignite a nuclear war in this land, and realize the sovereignty of the nation. Today's dark situation calls on the popular masses from all walks of life to rise in an anti-U.S. struggle. The patriotic popular masses of all classes who want to live independently and peacefully should spring up to the plaza of anti-U.S. struggle for independence so as to defend our nation regardless of whether they are the haves or have-nots, whether they are atheists or not, or whether they live in Cholla Province or Kyongsang Province. With the spirit of the May Uprising, let us all stamp out U.S. intervention and domination from this land and open the new road for independence, democracy, and reunification in a grand anti-U.S. struggle for independence.
