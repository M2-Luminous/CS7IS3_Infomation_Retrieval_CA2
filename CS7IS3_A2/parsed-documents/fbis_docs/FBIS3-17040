He commented the memorandum of March 16 on the delay of the construction of the terminal. The memorandum was addressed to the President Algirdas Brazauskas by the Union of Motherland /Lithuanian Conservatives/. Vaisnoras said a lot of political groups were interested that the object of vital importance to Lithuania was not built. In recent times, ways of development of Liepaja oil terminal are often discussed. He said these ways were unacceptable as an alternative because Latvian-Russian political relations became complicated and oil artery from Russia may be broken off. Eimantas Dragunevicius, chairman of energy committee of Motherland' Union, who also participated in the news conference, said that Lithuania's situation in energy is worse than Estonia's or Latvia's, that's why the problem of the terminal is so important. Dragunevicius also criticized intentions of the Ministry of Energy to privatize five biggest objects of Lithuanian energy system. It should not be done until the property is not indexed.
