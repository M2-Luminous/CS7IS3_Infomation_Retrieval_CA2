The aid is to help counter the effects of conflict and drought which have left an estimated one and a half million people in urgent need of assistance. Kenya also has around 400,000 refugees forced to flee from conflict and instability in Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia. Australia's Development Cooperation Minister Gordon Bilney says the aid will go towards a supplementary feeding program aimed at reducing malnutrition in women and children. Funds will also be spent on blood testing kits to screen for the AIDS virus, HIV, while further assistance will go to drought rehabilitation, specially, in Kenya's northwest.
