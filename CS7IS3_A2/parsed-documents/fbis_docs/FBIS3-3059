China Tex is the country's leading overseas trader of textile goods. It also manages exports of the country's finished and unfinished cotton products, including cotton yarn, cotton grey, cotton polyester yarn and cotton polyester grey. Last year, the corporation's overseas trade amounted to $18.9 billion, of which exports accounted for $15 billion and imports $3.9 billion. This year China Tex plans to expand its overseas enterprises and envisions a multinational textile trading group, according to its president, Wang Ruixiang. The corporation has 34 overseas branches in more than 20 countries and regions. China Tex will also set up a large-scale production base for export-oriented goods, Wang said. The base would contain technology-intensive enterprises making famous-brand products. Wang added that the company will also expand the production capacity of existing enterprises. China Tex has invested more than 200 million yuan ($23 million) in more than 80 industrial projects around the country. This investment has taken the form of shareholding and economic cooperation. Last year it also established 13 business branches around the country. Wang said that this year China Tex will try to develop new markets that depend less on the quota system. And exports of unfinished cotton products are expected to rise this year, Wang said. To improve administration, China Tex, the China Textile Commercial Association and the country's various cotton-trading corporations in port cities established the China Cotton Trading Centre last year. In addition, the government approved the establishment of the China Yarn Import & Export Corp. This year the world market for unfinished textile products is promising, which bodes well for Chinese exports, Wang said. On the other hand, Wang said, China should continue improving its management of exports since the country may face a shortage of raw materials, as well as financing for foreign trade companies. Finished and unfinished cotton products are among the central government's list of 16 key goods controlled by a quota system. In 1993, China's textile exports totalled $26 billion, or 28.4 per cent of all exports. Textile imports amounted to $9.67 billion, leaving a record trade balance of $16.33 billion. China's textile industry maintains trade and technological relations with more than 140 countries and regions. Hong Kong has the largest share of China's textile exports, 31.99 per cent, and Japan the second largest, 19.62 per cent. The United States and the European Union are also major markets for Chinese textiles.
