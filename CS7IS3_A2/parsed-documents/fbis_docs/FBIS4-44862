FBIS4-44862 "jpest014___94030" FBIS-EST-94-014 JPRS Science & Technology Europe/International 26 May 1994 WEST EUROPE COMPUTERS Siemens-Toshiba-IBM Cooperation to Develop 64-MB Storage Chip Siemens-Toshiba-IBM Cooperation to Develop 64-MB Storage Chip 94WS0372A Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE WIRTSCHAFT in German 26 May 94 p 8 94WS0372A Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE WIRTSCHAFT German CSO [Text] Munich (Reuter). Three leading electronics companies--Siemens AG of Germany, Toshiba of Japan, and IBM of the United States--are notably expanding their cooperation in the development of computer storage chips. Siemens of Munich reports that the three companies want to begin immediately to develop the second generation 64-MB chips jointly. The three companies have been working together since 1992 on the current developmental step--the 256-MB chip. The same companies have been cooperating in other electronics fields for a long time. The dynamic 64-MB read/write memory is to be developed in the IBM laboratories in East Fishkill, New York, and in Essex Junction, Vermont. The participating companies will share in the costs. A Siemens spokesman indicates that the costs will probably come to several hundred million German marks [DM]. The experience gained in the ongoing cooperative work on the 256-Mb chip will enrich the new cooperative venture. Siemens reports further that a first working model of the new 64-MB chip is to be ready as early as 1996. The chip can be expected to appear on the market in 1997. Its storage capacity will be able to hold the text content of more than 2,000 typed pages. Currently, the computer market is still dominated by the two-generations older 4-MB chip. Siemens and Toshiba have been working together since their joint development of the 1-MB chip, standard cells, and the so-called "gate arrays." IBM is involved in a joint venture with Toshiba in Japan on the production of flat color screens. The same two companies are also cooperating in flash-storage technology. To date, cooperation between the three companies has been limited to the development of the 256-MB chip. IBM and Siemens are also jointly developing the first generation 64-MB chip, the first working model of which was shown last autumn. The only cooperative production venture between IBM and Siemens is in the case of the 16-MB chip. According to Siemens, further cooperation in semiconductor production has only been discussed in general terms, with no specific projects named.
