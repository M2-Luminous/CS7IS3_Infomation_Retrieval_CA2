Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, addressing an on-going national work conference of township coal mines, said that within two years the sorting out and rectifying of the township coal mines nationwide should be completed. He told officials from local governments and the ministry of coal industry that the guidelines to "support, innovate, rectify, unite and improve" township coal mines should be adhered to in the process, for the promotion of their healthy development. China's township coal mines, outstripping state-owned and locally-owned large and medium-sized coal mines in the rate of development, have been one of the fastest growing sectors over the past 15 years. Their annual production stood at 470 million tons in 1993, more than three times the figure in 1978 when China began its open door policy. With output now making up 41.2 percent of the nation's coal production, the township coal mines have become an important component of China's coal industry, Zou said. Their rapid development has contributed to the improved coal supply and continued growth of the national economy, he added. However, he said, appropriate attention should be paid at the same time to the problems existing in the development of township coal mines. Illegal mining has gone rampant. More than half the 80,000 township coal mines in China are operating without any government permission. And some of them don't have basic safety conditions, giving rise to more accidents and deaths. Zou made clear that it is the nation that possesses all coal reserves and the central government exercises a "centralized" administrative role, while the local governments play "subordinate" roles. Therefore, every township coal mine will be screened in accordance with the set standards, Zou said. "Those in need of rectification should be overhauled and those without licence should try to get a government permit." Zou said all the mines should be given clear territorial boundaries for mining to prevent indiscriminate undercutting and eventually waste of resources. The death rate per million tons in the mines should be reduced to meet the national standard, he stressed. He ordered the coal ministry and local governments to strengthen cooperation and enhance administration of the mines in a system which unifies power and responsibility. The coal market should also be addressed for the formation of better standardization of coal transportation and sale, he said. "We should raise the level of administrating township coal mines, which would contribute to a durable, sustained and healthy development of the national economy," he added. The conference, which began on Tuesday [29 March], is expected to end tomorrow.
