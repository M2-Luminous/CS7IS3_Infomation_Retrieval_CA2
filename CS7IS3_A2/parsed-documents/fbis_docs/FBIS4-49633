"I foresee that the principle of 'one country, two systems' will not change not only within 50 years, but much longer," said Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a luncheon given in his honor. "The obvious reason is that we are still in the primary stage of socialism. We need hundreds of years to build China into a strong socialist state. In this whole course of building socialism, Hong Kong will continue to play its important role as a bridge between China and the Western world," Lu said. "It is a correct policy, it is good for Hong Kong, good for the country and good for the rest of the world. It is also acceptable to all. Why would China want to change it?" he asked. The director said, "it is the responsibility of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office to see that the principle of 'one country, two systems' as well as all the basic policies laid down in the joint declaration and the Basic Law are being fully carried out." The principle of "one country, two systems" is embodied in all the articles of the Basic Law, which was adopted by the National People's Congress and has become a national law, he said, adding that it has to be observed not only by Hong Kong but also by the rest of China for matters relating to Hong Kong. Noting that it took four years and eight months to work out the Basic Law, he said "if we are not serious in carrying out the principle of 'one country, two systems', why on earth should we spend such a lot of time, money and energy to put it into law?" "I wish to repeat that the principle of 'one country, two systems' is guaranteed by law," the director said.
