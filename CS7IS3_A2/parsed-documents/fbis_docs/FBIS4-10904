This increase in the cost of transport is the direct consequence of the increasing price of fuel. Jean-Max Blanc filed a report: [Begin Blanc recording, in Creole] In the last week, the cost of public transportation has increased in the Haitian capital. A gallon of gasoline, which was $20 last week, cost $26 on 18 April on Boulevard La Saline. The retailers are asking $28 for this same gallon of gasoline. A gallon of gas oil costs slightly less, $24 in La Saline. Public drivers report that they pay $26 to $27 for it. Therefore, two gourdes was suddenly added to the regular taxi fare. There are two kinds of drivers assuring transportation between Bourdon and Petionville, Petionville and Delmas, Port-au-Prince Cite Soleil and Port-au-Prince-Airport; Port-au-Prince and Carrefour. To go from Port-au-Prince to Carrefour is seven gourdes; the same with Petionville to Delmas; and Petionville to Christ-Roi. The first category of drivers are those who do not demand seven gourdes from the passengers. According to them, the price still remains at five gourdes. The second category demands seven gourdes from the passengers. Those drivers explain that the high cost of gasoline causes them to increase the fares. [passage omitted] For the other routes, such as for the buses to the airport, the cost is five gourdes instead of the 3.5 gourdes it was last week. The small buses going from Delmas to downtown cost the same as those going to Cite Soleil or other neighborhoods. However, the sector that seems to be most affected by the increase in the cost of public transportation is the students. Not only are buses scarce, but the fares are too high, according to a student who worries for the future of students in Haiti. [passage omitted] Within a few months, the fare for public transportation has tripled. It is not impossible that in two months a parent will have to give 30 gourdes [$6] to his child for public transportation. Meanwhile, factory workers are also facing misfortune. The fare they pay for transport is almost equal to the money they earn in a day. [end recording]
