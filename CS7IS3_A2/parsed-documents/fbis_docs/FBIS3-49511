KSCM experts consider the law to be in violation of the Czech Constitution, Vojtech Filip said. The law is based on the idea of collective responsibility and collective guilt, he said, adding that it violates a ban on discrimination incorporated into a number of international standards recognised by the Czech Republic. The law also allows the punishment of deeds considered legal under the former regime and those which would otherwise be no longer punishable, Filip said, adding he believed there would be no new stage trials. Should it come to that, the KSCM will provide the accused with legal aid irrespective of their political affiliation, religion or race.
