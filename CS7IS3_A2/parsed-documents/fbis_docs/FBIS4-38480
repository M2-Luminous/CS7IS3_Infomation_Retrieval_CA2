Kravchuk set forth his position on this at the news conference that took place at Slavutich yesterday. [Begin recording] [Kravchuk] I hope that sobriety will come to those people who have got it into their heads that they can do anything, while disregarding, first, Ukraine's laws and Constitution, disregarding even the established principles of the international community, which has set this highest line for states, which is integrity, inviolability of borders, and sovereignty. They thought Ukraine would continue to tolerate, to close its eyes, while they, being guided by, say, ambitions, act and do whatever they feel like. We said that you have now reached that red line, and once you have gone past it we will act severely, resolutely, and consistently within the framework of the constitutional system. For our part, there is no other course. But if the other side also acts equivalently and appropriately, then we will resolve all issues in a peaceful, legislative way. If someone should want to work using muscle power or pressure, then he should know that Ukraine has sufficient forces to make safe -- I am using the absolutely exact words -- those who resort to such provocative and unlawful actions, which violate all world principles, including the principles of goodneighborliness with Russia. I want to say that no one does more harm now to our friendly partnership relations with Russia, which are and will be the determining factor in spite of everything, as the Crimean leadership does; no one does more harm. Because in words, for people to see, they shout they want to become, so to speak, a bridge between Ukraine and Russia; but in reality they are always laying mines underneath this bridge, some consciously, others because they do not know any other way to resolve in a civilized manner except for one way -- rallies, slogans, and irresponsibility. I call on everyone -- as you have put this question -- to be guided by the Constitution, normative acts, and the principles drawn up by the UN, the CSCE, and other international organizations. [Unidentified correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, another increase in the exchange rate of the American dollar has occurred in the last few days, which was caused by more rumors of the introduction of the hryvna. And so, what prospects do we have regarding the introduction of a national currency? [Kravchuk] Well, first, the introduction of the hryvna is not some kind of rumor. We stated long ago that we are preparing to introduce our own national currency. To do this we need the appropriate domestic conditions and the appropriate external assistance. I have often stressed this. The second thing is that we are not going to, and I am saying this again and ask you to pass it on, make the introduction of the hryvna into some kind of secret. When this decision is taken, it will be taken openly, publicly. All of the mechanisms will be set forth to the people. Everything will be set forth to the people through the Supreme Council, through the mass media. It will not be as has happened before: You get up on Thursday and already you have different money and different prices. This will not happen this time. One can calm down. We wanted to know what money remains in the banks now, how much money there is in circulation now, how many notes, so that we know what we have, how much and what exchange there is, what the relationship is. And the National Bank and government sent an appropriate letter to the localities. This is a normal phenomenon when the state wants to know what it has. And again people say, oh, they now want to know (?how much money there is), they are going to introduce the hryvna. Believe me, there is not going to be a cavalry attack here. It will be done in a civilized way, consistently, openly ...[recording abruptly ends]
