FBIS4-6878 "dreas079__a94020" FBIS-EAS-94-079-A Daily Report 25 April 1994 ANNEX Japan * Senior EPA Official Assesses State of Economy * Senior EPA Official Assesses State of Economy 942B0066A Tokyo KANKAI in Japanese Feb 94 pp 170-178--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0066A Tokyo KANKAI Japanese CSO [Interview With Seiichi Toshida, director general of the Research Bureau, Economic Planning Agency (EPA), on 17 December 1993; place not given: "A Turning Point for Leading Industries...."] [Text] Perceptions Worse Than Reality [KANKAI] Speaking from the standpoint of reading business trends, I am afraid this year [1993] has been a very difficult one for you: in June, for example, you declared that the recession had bottomed out, and yet in November the word "recovery" once again disappeared from your monthly economic report. I wish you'd begin by commenting on the point I've just raised. [Toshida] It isn't just this year; after all, it has been that way since the year before last. Just this November, we took the liberty of making a sort of tentative conclusion that "the economy had peaked in April 1991," which means that two and a half years have elapsed since the peak. This year, all of us, both in and outside the government, started off with an expectation that the economy would get on the recovery track beginning in the fall. In early spring, a view gained ground that things were indeed moving in the direction that seemed to bear out our earlier expectation. It was in that context that in June we took a look at the overall situation as existed at the time and came up with an assessment that somehow the economy would not deteriorate any more than it already had and that things would get back on the road to a slow recovery starting in the fall as we had expected earlier. At that time, as things stood, there were some reasonable bases to our assessment: the so-called stock adjustment and inventory adjustment were making considerable progress; in June, a supplementary budget was adopted for new comprehensive economic measures, the practical impact of which seemed certain to be felt in earnest beginning in the fall; and even the problem of bad assets among financial institutions was being dealt with--sort of--by a clear initiative to encourage the banks to aggressively write off such bad assets. In that sense, we had the feeling that we were gradually getting a handle on those problems then facing us. In reality, however, we ended up facing a situation totally unexpected--you might call it a case of Murphy's Law, which is omnipresent lately: "No sooner had we declared the bottoming out of the recession than the economy took another turn for the worse." I think the rising yen was the biggest factor after all, but what made it worse was that we had a cool summer with a long rainy season, which resulted in a bad rice crop. As a result, it became clear that the scenario we had envisioned--that the economy would get on a recovery track beginning the fall--was not going to materialize. That's why in November we dropped from the monthly economic report our earlier prediction of gathering momentum for a recovery, the prediction which we had held to during the summer with expectations. In that sense, what was difficult was not just our work; rather, I think it was the not-so-simple economic movement that made our work correspondingly difficult. I also think that this view is shared by those in the private-sector businesses as well. [KANKAI] The "QE" [Quick Estimate] (national income statistics bulletin) came out just the other day for the months July through September, the period you called "a cool summer with a long rainy season." The report painted a picture which, I should say, was somewhat better than what had been anticipated: contrary to general expectations, the report showed a fairly high rate of growth for that particular period. I suspect that from this report some could draw a conclusion that the real economy might not have been so bad after all. [Toshida] I think we are dealing with a question of yardsticks--the standard by which we decide "what is the range that is bad." "Good is when Japan's economy itself is in the plus territory; bad is when it is in the minus territory"--if this is the standard by which we measure things, obviously we could say that 2-percent growth isn't bad. But the thing is, the April-June quarter had negative growth, and what gain there was in the July-September priod was barely enough to make up for it. So, if you average it out, the conclusion is that the economy was hovering near the bottom just as we had anticipated; therefore, it cannot be said that the July-September performance was anything particularly good. But from the standpoint of those who had noisily predicted that the bottom would fall out of the economy, the actual performance in the July-September period may very well be rated as having exceeded expectations. The 2-percent growth may be given its due appraisal if it had served as a catalyst toward firming up the economic base to bring about better conditions beginning in the fall; in reality, however, while the 2-percent growth was in progress, the reading of business conditions by companies themselves and consumer confidence kept on cooling off disproportionately to the actual state of the economy. And it is these negative psychological factors that have been affecting the real economic activities during the October-December period and will continue to do so in the days ahead. This has been the trend. In the eyes of the general public, the state of the economy must have seemed worse than it actually was, especially if such psychological aspects were also taken into account; yet, regrettably, I believe the economy has been lacking the strength to negate such psychological cooling-off effects. Industrial Production Holds the Key to Business Recovery [KANKAI] Looking at the factors directly underlying business conditions, I have the feeling that not everything there is totally negative. In your process of studying economic trends ahead, what is it that you are watching most carefully in terms of indexes or indicators that are key to your discerning a turn toward recovery? [Toshida] To put it plainly, whether or not there is a clear sign of an upward move in industrial production--this, I think, is the key. Industrial production registered the worst single-month decline in October. Subsequently, it zigzagged during November and December, following a torpid trend. If only it begins to show an unmistakable upward trend, even little by little, I believe it will have salutary ripple effects on other sectors of the economy. As to the reason for the stagnancy in industrial production, it clearly boils down to low levels of shipment and weak demand. On the demand side, there are many influencing factors, including the housing and public investment indexes, both of which look bright at the moment; I think industrial production, more than anything else, provides an early indicator that reflects the aggregate impact of all these factors that govern demand. So, we watch production for a clue to the immediate trend, but it is employment we pay attention to when we are thinking about the conditions a little bit more into the future. The reason is this: If the employment picture is such that consumption is negatively affected by it, it is bound to impact on the levels of factory shipments and consumer demand, the two factors which I've just mentioned. That's why, as a matter of approach, we judge the current picture by production. But I think the question of employment adjustment will inevitably come up when we are to look at the near-term future outlook. [KANKAN] Employment is a lagging index, is it not? I gather what you are saying is that you need to watch the employment picture quite closely because of its effect on consumpiton. [Toshida] That is correct. Let's take a look at the demand side of the picture: In the past, when all was said and done, demand was given the initial push by exports and public investment; only when that initial phase was clearly proving effective did the next phase--plant and equipment investment and consumption--come into play. Speaking of consumption: again in the past, because consumption as a whole was being supported at its base, rarely did it fall by any drastic measure. This time around, however, demand could not count on exports, for one thing; then on the consumption side, too, unlike the tendency of the past when consumption seldom nosedived, sluggishness is the notable feature. Moving on to the third element which is plant and equipment investment: This is being affected negatively by the prospect that attempts by business firms to dispose of their excess property holdings, such as office buildings and other structures, will be a time-consuming proposition; thus, not much can be expected of this element in the near term. Consequently, a popular view now is that it is essential for consumption to provide a measure of firm support to demand. It is in this connection that I believe the impact of the employment picture on consumer confidence may very well hold an important key to this question. As we touched on at the beginning, what changed the picture between June and the fall was this: Consumer confidence, and business psychology to a lesser degree, showed some improvement around June, but then it began cooling off once again in the fall. As for the reason, I think it was a sense of uneasiness touched off by the fear of spreading employment adjustment or personnel cutback. In this sense, when we talk about the employment index we don't simply mean the jobless rate or the ratio of effective labor demand to effective labor supply; what really affects consumer confidence, I believe, is the question of how widespread and how deep are these personnel reductions. A Structural Turnabout of Japan's Economy--Pros and Cons [KANKAI] The view attributing the current recession phase to two factors--the effect of the bubble's collapse and a cyclical force--has been around for some time now, but lately another view, which goes beyond that, seems to be gaining ground, pointing to the possibility that Japan's economy may be faced with a structural turning point. But the question is whether it is indeed at a turning point or not. Let's say it is, then my question is, what are the areas must one observe closely in order to be able to come to such a conclusion? [Toshida] This is an extremely difficult question; for one thing, I think it can reasonably be argued that a structural turning point is at hand. In any event, the crux of the question lies in the industrial sector. There is a view that the automobile industry and the electric machinery industry, which have been the leading industries thus far, could be at a turning point of sorts. Some see this as a problem arising from the strong yen. Although there is a school of thought that, had it not been for the strong yen, both of these industries would've been able to make it out all right, when it comes to the question of their strength to pull the nation's economic growth, I am afraid they will no longer be as strong as they have been in the past 10 years or so. What kind of industries will be leading the Japanese economy in the days ahead? This, I think, is going to become a question of increasing importance. There is another aspect to the question of structural turnabout. That is, some seem to think that various systems within the Japanese economy may have reached their limits. In some sense, this is a question of degree. There is no denying that the systems have gradually become antiquated and therefore need to be repaired; still, until two or three years ago, the popular view had been that the Japanese-style systems may be superior. Internationally, if anything, there clearly remains a strong tendency to try to learn and adopt the Japanese-model systems. Given this circumstance, it somehow seems too hasty for the originator to say that all of these systems should be discarded and replaced with something else; this is why I believe it behooves us to give the question a little more thought. In general terms, if for instance there are too many regulations, of course those things ought to be rectified, but to say just for that reason that the Japanese economic system as a whole is bad would be.... Such an argument, I am afraid, would make those countries trying desperately to study and adopt the Japanese system feel that we are pulling the rug from under them. In last year's Economic White Paper, we gave major points of this question an analytical once-over, which did not lead to a conclusion that the Japanese-model system as a whole had better be changed. The picture that emerged from our analysis is this: That each of the segments of our economic system has its own historical background, which makes it sensible to give them partial repairs while retaining their bases; that not all mountains can be made to look like Mt. Fuji--some may look like this way and others that way, but all of them are linked and integrated at the bottom. There is no way one can draw a conclusion that the whole system had better be changed by shifting from one mode to another. It is in this connection that one gets an impression that perhaps the drastic impact of the bubbble's collapse somehow got mixed up with the argument for a structural changeover. [KANKAI] I touched on the structural question because you raised the issue of structural reform in your World Economic White Paper for this year. Obviously, circumstances are different for each country, but my impression is that you are analyzing this issue based on the premise that not just Japan but all other countries must come to grips with the question of post-Cold War economic order and global economy. [Toshida] As far as that goes, following the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations, Japan has already done a quite a bit in opening up and improving the transparency of its domestic markets. The times are such that we need to take those steps. In this connection, that we are faced with the need for structural reform to accommodate these changes is most typically reflected in the case of rice. In that sense, I think your point is well taken. Still, if that line of thinking and the subject of short-term recession are hastily linked together in the manner of short-circuiting, I am afraid it will create misunderstandings on the question of structural reforms that are a matter of medium- and long-term concern. If you say business conditions will not improve without structural reforms, you are apt to paint an extremely pessimistic picture. Some may take it to mean that no improvement can be expected for a period of years. It may also lead to another kind of misunderstanding--that implementing structural reform is useless or may do more harm than good to the business situation. I think it behooves us to consider structural reform correctly and pretty much as a medium- and long-term proposition and to accept the fact that its effects, too, will only be felt over the medium and long terms. Without question we will have to undertake structural reform, but to say that business conditions will never improve without it or that it will have nothing but negative impact on business is, I think, a case of going too far in mixing up the subject of business conditions with the medium- and long-term structural question. Will Listen More to Private-Sector Views [KANKAI] At present the EPA, of course, is evaluating business conditions on the basis of all kinds of indicators. In this connection, I am sure you are aware of the presence of a school of thought that has, for quite some time now, been saying, among other things, that the economy is shifting from goods to services. I suspect that some in this school may be wondering whether the indicators being followed by the EPA might not be giving too much weight to goods and too little to services. What is your feeling on this? Do you, for instance, see the need for reviewing your selection of indicators? [Toshida] It is very difficult to seize, in a timely fashion, the trends in the service sector, and this is clearly due to the limited availability of data. This is why I think we ought to make up for the lack of data on the service sector by such means as holding hearings. It so happens, however, that in the current situation, as you know, the nonmanufacturing sector, too, is not doing very well. But during the high-yen slumps of the past, even if the manufacturing sector was doing poorly, the nonmanufacturing sector was doing well; so, it was possible to point to the nonmanufacturing or service sector and say that the overall picture was such and such. Today, perhaps to a lesser degree, the nonmanufacturing sector, too, is behaving generally the same way as is the manufacturing sector; my sense, therefore, is that the point you raised is not causing much of a problem to our grasping of the business trend. In any event, looking back, I believe we have learned quite a bit from the development related to the so-called bubble economy, especially its impact on the financial sector, for example. [KANKAI] You have not reached the point where you feel you should reexamine, for example, the specific items covered by the DI (diffusion index), or have you? [Toshida] Of course that is one of the things we will have to do, but my feeling is that it might be better to wait until business conditions improve a little more and everyone is in a calmer frame of mind before we take such steps. But we are continuing our basic studies: for instance, we have requested the Business Cycle Base Dates Determination Committee, which has been practially decommissioning itself after each time it completed the job of determing the peak and trough of a business cycle in the past, to make itself a standing group because we would like groups such as this to serve as the forums for continuous debate. It is always too late to fuss over the indicators' being good or bad when business conditions have already become dubious; it is like trying to figure out how to make a rope after.... This is why even members of this committee themselves are saying, "Surely it is a question worth asking: Wouldn't it be a good idea for us to meet regularly to keep an eye on business trends and to discuss the modality of economic indicators while the situation is still relatively stable?" [KANKAI] Just the other day--I believe it was in November--for the stated purpose of listening to the voices of outsiders, a businessmen/economists forum was set up as your personal advisory body. Trying to figure out where exactly an organ of this nature fits in, I am wondering whether listening more closely to outside voices is your only reason for having it or if you have something else in mind. [Toshida] In the private sector, the so-called think tanks have achieved a great deal of progress and growth; there are quite a few of them around, all working very hard and publishing the results of all kinds of analyses they conduct. Looking back, in the old days--some 20-30 years ago--the EPA's Research Bureau, acting to some degree as if it had a monopoly of the market for economic research, used to handle that kind of work. Now, however, the bureau has many competitive counterparts sprung up in the private sector. So, a thought has occurred to us which, if I may explain at the risk of being misconstrued, goes like this: Would it not make sense if we tried to let these outside gurus teach us some of their ideas? After all it used to be.... We were the ones who provided all the ideas, so there is no reason why we shouldn't be on the receiving end for a change. Basically, we want them to teach us some fresh ideas that have escaped us and therefore will be a pleasant surprise to us. I believe it is a good idea if possible to let people with different views debate various issues which we present to them. In this sense, what I have in mind is not the normal deliberative council process, in which the council's view is "solicited" on an idea or proposal formulated and presented by the secretariat. Rather, I want to see the forum's participants truly face one another with different opinions so that we can listen to their debate and enjoy instructional benefits from it. This is my aim. Take forecasting, for example: as you know, some see the outlook bullish, others bearish. What is the difference in their standpoints that lead them to come up with different forecasts? I intend to ask the forum to take up this question. Not just the question of forecasting but other questions as well, such as the question of how to come to grips with the problem of bad assets, because I believe there are different ways of looking at these questions. I think it would be nice if the forum taught us not just different options, but also the different arguments behind them. Recovery of the U.S. Economy--Premature? [KANKAI] Because we touched on the global economy earlier, let me ask you how you see the current state of the U.S. economy. Also, in view of the extraordinary amount of attention the United States is paying to Asia of late, which was evident at the APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] meetings, I would like to hear your views on Asian economies. [Toshida] The aspects of the globlal economy which we have to keep an eye on are widening more and more, creating a non-too-easy task for us. It used to be that we considered the global economy as something we looked at as a prelude to our consideration of the future direction of Japan's economy; now, however, when it comes to subject matters such as the APEC which you've just mentioned, inevitably it raises the question of strategy as to how--to what direction--Japan intends to lead the global economy, and it is we at the EPA's Research Bureau who must provide necessary background information for the formulation of such a strategy. We are proceeding with this awareness. As for the U.S. economy, I think the consensus now is that it is moving, albeit slowly, from a smooth recovery to an expansionary phase. Even so, there is a question about whether the structural problem of the U.S. economy has been truly resolved or not, and opinions are divided on this point between the fairly optimistic and the fairly pessimistic. I personally believe that the popular view of the U.S. economy used to be overly pessimistic but has now turned a little too optimisitic. U.S. enterprises have intrinsic strengths. This time around, too, they have regained their profitability by going ahead with restructuring; yet, when it comes to the U.s. economy as a whole, one has to wonder whether the problems inherent in it have really changed by any significant degree. The U.S. Government, meanwhile, seems to have realized that there may well be a limit to domestic procreation of its economic growth potential. So it came up with the idea of boosting its economic growth potential by "latching onto"--perhaps this is a poor choice of word--Asia that has an extraordinary possibility for development. This, I believe, is the reason why the Clinton administration has begun taking great interest in the APEC. As can be surmised from what I've just said, truly Asia's growth and development potentials are by far a cut above those of others within today's global economy. It is all the more so because China has entered into the picture. Of particular note is that the Asian economy as a whole is beginning to move along very well. Moreover, this favorable development is likely to continue because there are various positive factors helping the Asian economy. The development process of an economy is like the process of a business cycle: once it starts to move smoothly, or to put it another way, once it enters into a favorable cycle, it tends to stay on that track. This, I am inclined to think, is what can be expected to happen in Asia as a whole. For starters, the United States is keenly interested in Asia; the strong yen, among other things, is driving Japan into placing increasing emphasis on investment and production overseas; and then there are big countries such as China and Vietnam that are poised to move toward market-oriented economies. Given all these factors, the smooth development of Asia as a whole is likely to continue. What should Japan make of this Asian outlook and how should Japan deal with it as a matter of foreign policy? These, I should think, are questions of extreme importance. Because of the involvement in the picture of such major powers as the United States and China, these questions are, in some sense, difficult ones to answer; in another sense, however, I think they present significant themes worth tackling for us. [KANKAI] What is your view on the EC or the European economy? They say the economic picture in the United Kingdom has improved somewhat. [Toshida] The assessment that the EC's economy is at its trough this year but will begin to improve next year [1994] is probably on the mark. Because, for one thing, the German economy seems to be moving toward a gradual improvement. Nevertheless, that the much touted union will greatly invigorate the EC's economy as a whole is a prospect not so easily attainable. How to overcome the different interests and idiosyncrasies of its member nations poses a very difficult problem. Even in Japan, there are regional differentials which we have been trying to eliminate for the past 20-30 years without much success. So, it only follows that there be some doubt about whether things will go smoothly when individual EC countries remove their fences to become integrated. Naturally some countries would want to maintain their traditional high standards. The question is, would things work out all right when these countries are put together with others that are trying to catch up with the former's high standards? I believe this is the crux of the matter. [KANKAI] Now, if you have anything else to add, please go ahead. [Toshida] In closing, if I may be allowed to indulge in some self-advertisement, we at the EPA have a rather difficult task of trying to get Japan's economy back on a smooth growth track and we are working very hard on it. But, as you know, we are often subjected to such criticisms as "the government's perceptions are wishful" or "the government's way of looking at things lags behind reality." But perhaps these criticisms are in some sense not as substantive as they may sound if you consider the fact that it is the private sector that is pulling Japan's economy by means of market mechanisms. When it comes to the question of medium- and long-term economic directions I believe the government and the policymaking authorities must bear a heavy responsibility for them, but it is a little different story when it comes to the economic activity occurring right now. Recently, some people praised us for having closed the gaps between us and the private sector with respect to certain projections; no sooner were we praised than the stock prices fell; then there were people who scolded us for saying that business conditions were not likely to recover readily...(laughter). In this sense, now is truly the time for business managers of the private sector to demonstrate their capability. We at the EPA have learned a lot during the currrent recessionary phase; in the process, we have been able to improve many aspects of our work in comparison with the way they were handled in the past. I know this will sound funny, but let's take the narrative style of our monthly economic reports, for example: There were periods in our past history when the readers of our reports could not be sure, because of the way the reports were worded, whether the business conditions of the period were bad or what. During the current recession, however, the monthly reports we have been putting out are so worded that future historians reading them would immediately know that the economy was in a slump in this period. In the process of preparing these reports, we have, as I briefly touched on earlier, been creating opportunities for us to listen to the views of those in the private sector. Also, recently we initiated a minithesis series entitled Research and Analysis Viewpoints, the purpose of which is to enhance the timeliness of our research products. When business conditions are fluctuating as much as they are now, if research takes too much time, people's perception of the problem itself may have changed by the time the research results are produced. This is part of the reason that we are putting out minitheses without waiting for the annual white paper time. I think it is fortunate that because of the recession we have made progress in certain aspects of our work; likewise, I believe those of the private sector, too, can make progress on account of the recession. What I mean by this is that they can go forth with forward-looking restructuring measures, which is what I hope they would do. This is my thought toward the coming new year [1994].
