FR941028-0-00032 FR941028-0-00009 Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final §773.25 provides for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in support of his or her position. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary materials; when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and when counsel states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel states that such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of §773.25 provides that, when the decision of the responsible agency is reviewed by an administrative or judicial tribunal, the challenger could present any evidence to such tribunal which is admissible under the rules of the tribunal. Under the regulation, however, the evidence submitted still has to be probative, credible, and substantial. Paragraph (d) of §773.25 provides for the review and revision of information in AVS to reflect determinations made by regulatory authorities in response to challenges of ownership or control links or the status of violations. Paragraph (d) provides that, following any determination by a State regulatory authority or other State agency, or following any decision by an administrative or judicial tribunal reviewing such determination, the State regulatory authority shall review the information in AVS to determine if the information in AVS is consistent with the determination or decision. If it is not consistent, the State regulatory authority is required to promptly inform OSM and request that the AVS information be revised to reflect the determination or decision. Part 778_Permit Applications_Minimum Requirements for Legal, Financial, Compliance, and Related Information Paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 778.14 is amended to require a permit applicant to disclose ``all violation notices'' received by the applicant within the preceding three years. In addition, the introductory language of the provision is amended to require the disclosure of all outstanding violation notices for any surface coal mining operation that is deemed or presumed to be owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who is deemed or presumed to own or control the applicant under definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5. The regulation previously required the applicant to disclose violations of a number of various laws listed in 30 CFR 778.14(c). Use of the amended definition of ``violation notice'' adopted today as part of 30 CFR 773.5 obviates the need for listing each of these violations in 30 CFR 778.14. The regulation also previously required that the applicant provide only a list of unabated cessation orders and unabated air and water quality violation notices received prior to the date of the application by any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant. With respect to this list, the previous regulation did not require that an applicant list notices of violation received or unpaid penalties or fees incurred by any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant. Paragraph (c) of §778.14 is now amended to require an applicant to disclose all outstanding violation notices received by any surface coal mining operation that is deemed or presumed to own or control the applicant. In addition, OSM has amended paragraph (c) of §778.14 to provide that for each notice of violation issued pursuant to 30 CFR 843.12 or under a Federal or State program for which the abatement period has not expired, the applicant must certify that such notice of violation is in the process of being abated to the satisfaction of the agency with jurisdiction over the violation. Part 840_State Regulatory Authority: Inspection and Enforcement Paragraph (b) of 30 CFR 840.13 is amended to include a reference to §843.23, a proposed rule. As has been explained previously, OSM has deferred action on adopting proposed §843.23 at this time. The reference, however, to that section has been placed in §840.13 in the event that proposed §843.23 is adopted. The use of such reference does not mean, however, that OSM will ultimately adopt proposed §843.23. Part 843_Federal Enforcement OSM amends the Table of Contents of 30 CFR part 843 to add §843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control of the status of violations. Former §843.10 is deleted since part 843 did not contain any information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507. The references to §§843.14(c) and 843.16 formerly in §843.10 did not represent information collection requirements. The requirement in §843.14(c) for OSM to furnish copies of notices and orders to the State regulatory authority and to any person having an interest did not require OMB approval because the obligation to provide the information is imposed upon OSM and not upon the State or upon a member of the public. Section 843.16 merely informs the public of the right to file an application for review and request a hearing under 43 CFR part 4.
