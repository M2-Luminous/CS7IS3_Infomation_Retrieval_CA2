It is in Mexican territory where those who are looking for jobs in North America -- mostly Salvadorans -- fall into the hands of the authorities to be subsequently sent to jail until their deportation is processed. If there is so much emphasis to travel to the United States without meeting the requirements demanded by those authorities it is because the [illegal alien] traffickers are successful more than once. Of course this serves as propaganda for other naive Salvadorans to start securing the $1,000 that it costs to put them on the other side of the border for the Lord to help them. According to reports we receive from Mexico, the detentions continue. The Judicial Technical Police of that nation have placed greater emphasis on looking for our people and for those of other nations who do not have their documents in order and who attempt, with practically nothing, to cross the border. Once in North American territory they contact other traffickers or relatives to start looking for a job so they can stay. This of course is until immigration authorities uncover, arrest, and deport them. Previously, it was mostly the Central Americans who struggled to get on the other side, overcoming the risks in Mexican territory. Now, however, the Asians have also joined in; these are the ones who pay the traffickers the higher sums. The flow of Salvadorans to Uncle Sam's land, however, does not decrease. Once there, they hope to gains dollars to send back to their relatives who they have left behind praying for them not to be captured. The trip is not as easy as it seems. Reports from those who have returned, deported from Mexico or the United States, have declared that a trip without documents or with false documents does not cost less than $1,000. The adventure starts with obtaining that sum of money which does not include food or the guarantee they will arrive in the "promised land." Once they are deported they are back to their old activity. Now they have to look for a job, not only to support their family but also to pay back the loans they made to pay the Salvadoran traffickers. It is said that these traffickers have contact with the Mexican traffickers who in turn have contact with those in the United States. As we have pointed out in the past, the situation in the United States is no longer the same; vigilance is now much stricter. The conditions in some states, such as California, is absolutely negative for illegal aliens. One must not forget a deadline has been set for those who are already there in that territory to meet the requirements demanded. That deadline is approaching, and a large number of compatriots have difficulties, created by the same North American authorities. To speak clearly, The United States does not want immigrants, and much less those who try to cross over flouting that nation's laws. Once again we bring up the issue to suggest to the Salvadoran immigration authorities to adopt an official campaign targeted at those who want to live and work in the United States, in order to send help to their families. They must be made to understand that to fall in the hands of the traffickers is to throw away their money, as they will be deported either from Mexico or the United States. Once back they will be in worse shape than before, including their health given the conditions they had to face. If the immigration authorities try to explain to the stubborn individuals who want to travel without the required document by citing the very reports of the deportees, it is possible that many will avoid that failure. They should try to make their life here or travel to North America with the required documents.
