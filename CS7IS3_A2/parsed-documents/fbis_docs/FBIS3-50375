The statements by the UN generals that have served in Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly express that the UN Administration has done nothing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has not observed a single UN resolution, and has brought its mission into an extremely unenviable position. Our argument that the partition of Bosnia, as preached by Lord Owen, forces over 1 million people off their property -- therefore they lose their entire private property -- has caused much confusion in the West [words indistinct] based on private property. The question arises what kind of a partition is it that takes rights from the people, Dr. Ganic explained. The Bosnia-Herzegovina attitude is to negotiate only if there are clear political principles. They were set out at the London Conference but have in the meantime been abandoned. In order to reach a solution those principles have to be implemented. A new international conference -- not a European one, as Europe has proven itself impotent and ineffective -- would involve the problem of the entire region by defining principles and a moral code of conduct. With the announcement of the withdrawal of some Western troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina, one has to take into account the readiness of Turkey and some other countries to send in their troops. That does not suit those who want to partition Bosnia, Ganic believes. These factors initiated the Russian proposal, which suits the Serbian aggressor. The Russians know that they can have the majority when it comes to the partition of Bosnia, and want thus to force the United Sates to accept that partition. The aim is to drag the United States into such a job. Everything speaks in favor of things returning to the beginning, although that is what the Russians do not want, Presidency member Ejup Ganic said. Our Assembly has never accepted the partition of Bosnia, but (?internal demarcation is possible). However, every citizen must have the right to his property and the right to participate in political decisionmaking. An attempt is being made to thwart the strengthening of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army by an unfavorable solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The drop in the motivation of the Serb army and the drop in the living standards in Serbia does not suit those who want to achieve their greater state ambitions in this region. We are for peace, for a cease-fire, and for a just solution, Ganic stressed in a statement for B-H PRESS.
