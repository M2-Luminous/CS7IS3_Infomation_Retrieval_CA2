Comment is invited on this aspect of the proposal. ( c ) Fee System. EPA will establish, and as necessary adjust, the level of a fee-based compliance system in consultation with the FAA to achieve the seasonal commercial aircraft emissions targets for each pollutant. Each commercial airline will be expected to meet the seasonal pounds-per-PEU environmental performance target as described above. Any airline that exceeds the target in any ozone season will pay an emissions fee proportional to the excess emissions. Expressed differently, the fee will be applied only to the incremental emissions which are in excess of the performance target, not to the airline operator's total seasonal emissions. Through an iterative process, EPA will set the emissions fee at a level designed to discourage such noncompliance. EPA requests comment on a triggering mechanism that would prevent implementation of the fee system as long as the area-wide commercial aircraft emission allowance target is achieved. Beginning with the 2001 annual report, EPA could use airline annual emissions/activity reports to determine total actual area-wide commercial aircraft emissions. If this total emissions quantity did not exceed the allowance for that year, airlines could operate undisturbed by the FIP. If the total actual emissions quantity did exceed a given year's allowance, however, the emissions fee system would be implemented for that year and would remain in effect for all subsequent years. It is important that the fee paid by the airlines for excess emissions be high enough to encourage adherence to the pounds-per-PEU limit but not so high as to needlessly reduce industry profits or to drain away funds that should be spent for mitigating emissions. For the other fee systems discussed in this FIP, EPA proposes a base fee of $10,000/ton of pollutant. The following example describes the impact of a $10,000/ton fee on a commercial airline under the proposed control strategy. The 1990 emissions per PEU are 0.087 pounds of VOC per PEU and 0.162 pounds of NO X per PEU using current EPA data (see discussion above). The 2005 example environmental performance targets as presented in Tables D and E are 0.039 pounds of VOC per PEU and 0.073 pounds of NO X per PEU . Assuming that there is no improvement in environmental performance from the current uncontrolled rate, a maximum fee for 2005 can be calculated as follows: VOC Fee: (0.087 lbs/PEU&hyph;0.039 lbs/PEU) X $10,000/ton divided by 2000 lbs/ton = $0.24/PEU for VOC NO X Fee: (0.162 lbs/PEU&hyph;0.073 lbs/PEU) X $10,000/ton divided by 2000 lbs/ton = $0.45/PEU for NO X On this basis the maximum fee would be $0.69 per PEU. This is equivalent to approximately $120 per landing plus takeoff, for an average airplane. To put this excess emissions fee in the context of other fees, collected from commercial aircraft operators for other purposes, current landing fees at LAX are $1.56/1,000 pounds of gross landing weight; for a typical Boeing 737 this is about $178 and for a Boeing 747 about $913. From another perspective, the FAA allows airports to apply passenger facility charges of $3 per passenger to pay for qualified airport improvements. The $10,000/ton emission fee, therefore, may be an inappropriate starting point for commercial aircraft, since the likely impact is so small, that between 2000 and 2005 upwards adjustment is very likely to be needed. EPA believes that a substantially higher fee may be necessary for commercial aircraft in order to ensure compliance with the seasonal environmental performance targets. On the other hand, the expectation of larger fees after 2001 may have an effect on its own. Also, there are enough fee cycles between 2001 and 2005 that a fee level which will produce the desired reductions by 2005 should be reachable by 2005 even if the fees initially are based on $10,000 per ton. EPA requests comment on what fee levels will achieve the objective of discouraging noncompliance without being excessive, and on what the starting level of the fees should be.
