A gunman fired several shots in the air as Rafsanjani addressed a gathering in the shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni last Tuesday to mark the 15th anniversary of the Islamic revolution. The official media reported that the 26-year-old gunman, Kurush Nik-Akhtar, fired bullets from a low-calibre colt pistol while standing 50 meters (yards) away from the podium. "Why didn't the gunman try to get closer to the stand which was a simple thing to do?" the daily SALAM asked. "Why did he attempt to shoot from a distance where he knew he had no chance of hitting his target?" The paper also demanded explanation on how the gunman had been able to pass through the shrine's security "on a day when so many foreign and domestic personalities were present." The authorities initially played down the incident as a "childish affair", but later called it a "premeditated plot" aimed at undermining the Islamic republic. Iranian Information Minister 'Ali Fallahian said Monday that more than 20 people had been arrested in connection with the shooting. They have all confessed to having "ominous and counter-revolutionary aims," he said.
