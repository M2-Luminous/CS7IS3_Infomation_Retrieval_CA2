During his visit, he inspected the 2,500-cubic-meter blast furnace system project, including a wharf, a warehouse, a sintering plant, and a disk mill, which was recently put into operation. He warmly praised the hard-working spirit displayed by the company's workers and staff members who have increased the company's annual production capacity from 2 million tonnes to 4 million tonnes. Zou Jiahua also attended and spoke at a ceremony marking the full operation of the blast furnace system project. After his inspection, Jou Jiahua held an on-the-spot meeting at the company. He listened carefully to the briefings presented by all section chiefs of the company. He also asked them about their experiences in running large and medium enterprises. He said: As a large enterprise, the Maanshan Iron and Steel Company has invigorated itself by seizing opportunities, deepening reform, and changing the management mechanism. Under the leadership of the Anhui Provincial CPC Committee and Government, the company has achieved great results in its work because its leading group is united and its workers are capable. He expressed his hope that the company will achieve greater results on the basis of its current achievements. Jou Jiahua said: In carrying out the economic work, it is necessary to keep the general goal in sight and to take the daily tasks in hand. We should carry out our work step by step. The steel industry is an important basic industry. Besides building some more new steel plants, we should focus on renovating existing steel enterprises because this is the best way to achieve quick results with less money. The most important way to run state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises is to become market-oriented, develop new products, adopt new technologies, guarantee quality, reduce costs, and enhance economic performance. He also urged all enterprises to continue to pay attention to spiritual civilization construction. Secretary Lu Rongjing and Governor Fu Xishou of Anhui Province accompanied Jou Jiahua during his inspection.
