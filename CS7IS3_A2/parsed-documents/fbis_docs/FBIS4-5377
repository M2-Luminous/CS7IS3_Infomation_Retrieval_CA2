Collegians at Seoul universities had joined some 13,000 farmers' representatives, opposition lawmakers, activist teachers and dissidents at Poramae Park in southern part of the capital by 2:30 P.M. to launch the rally opened simultaneously in 11 other cities. Hundreds of ralliers in the southern city of Ulsan occupied downtown streets chanting "renegotiate, renegotiate." Some 2,000 protesters in Chonju threatened to fight to bring down the government if the agreement is not rebargained. "No to UR," "Fight UR till death," shouted protesters in Seoul as they tried to cut the police blockade to march to the National Assembly hall. Fierce clashes are likely late into the evening with hundreds of students vowing to reunite at Myongdong Cathedral to go on a hunger strike until the trade agreement is vetoed at the National Assembly. Organizers said 197 groups participated in the rally that turned out to be the largest this year to fight Seoul's commitment to the global trade pact at the signing ceremony starting next Tuesday. Controversy over South Korea's country schedule never waned after the government retracted a presidential promise and opened its rice market. Government officials said they are going ahead to ink the Uruguay Round final agreement despite the protest at home. Trade, industry and resources minister leaves for the ceremony in Morocco Sunday. "The government could not possibly sign the agreement in Morocco on April 12 if it sincerely cared for the people and the country's future," opposition leader Yi Ki-taek said through a blaring microphone. "We will never sit idly by if the government tries to put its stamp on the agreement as is," he said. Organizers read a statement demanding an immediate hearing on allegations of secret agreement with the United States on rice market opening. The headquarters of the pan-national movement for protection of farmers pleaded with the citizens to participate in the fight against ratification and to keep foreign products off the market shelves.
