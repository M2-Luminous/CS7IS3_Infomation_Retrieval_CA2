NDP is not satisfied with the democratic processes going on in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], particularly since the disintegration of Yugoslavia. This party is emphasizing that the Albanian people have been deprived of the right for self- orientation, although they are the third largest nation in the former Yugoslavia. The memorandum condemns the manipulations by the government in relation to the census of the population. The NDP concludes that these manipulations are aimed at discrediting the Albanian political factor before the international institutions, as well as its further splitting apart. The NDP underlined the government's responsibility for the further building up and functioning of the state and community institutions on a one-national basis. This, the NDP believes, legalizes the political discrediting and tolerance of the advents of neofascism. Otherwise, the NDP is pushing for a federalization of Macedonia and the formation of an autonomous region Ilirida in Macedonia. Guests from the PDP fraction were also present at the conference, as well as representatives from the Demo-Christian Party of Kosovo and the Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party from Albania.
