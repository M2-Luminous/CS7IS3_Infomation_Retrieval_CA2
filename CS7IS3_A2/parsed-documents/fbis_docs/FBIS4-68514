Sometimes one even gets the impression that everybody is right, and the arguments of one side are just as convincing and well-substantiated as those of the opposing side. This is not accidental: As a rule, such conflicts have their root in disputes over possession of territories, which the conflicting sides may consider their traditional domain with equal justification (including from the standpoint of historic rights). A KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondents' conversation with Ibrahim Dzikic, Bosnia-Herzegovina representative in Moscow, is indicative in this respect. In Mr. Dzikic's opinion, the war in Bosnia is not of religious or ethnic nature. What is happening there is a fight for territories, and a predatory one on the part of Serbs--they have dismantled and taken out to Serbia the entire industrial potential from the lands seized from the Muslims. Overall, in Mr. Dzikic's opinion, Serbia has been the initiator of both Yugoslavia's disintegration and all the wars on its territory. Belgrade is set to build a "Great Serbia," which would include most of former federative lands. Unfortunately, these actions had the blessing of the Orthodox churches--Russian and Serb. Today the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia interferes directly in the Bosnian conflict, sending there tanks, equipment, and troops from its army's Uzice and Novi Sad corps. Heavy armaments taken by Serbs from Sarajevo environs was used in the latest battles near Gorazde. Describing the situation around this city, Mr. Dzikic emphasized that it shows that Bosnian Serbs do not want the war to end. The situation in Gorazde got exacerbated due to Serb aggression. The diplomat characterized all talk of "Muslim provocations" as Belgrade's conjectures, since the population of besieged Gorazde consisted mainly of women and children, who for two years have not had contacts with other parts of Bosnia. To accuse them now of provocations is madness that would be tantamount to accusing Leningrad inhabitants of similar things during the blockade. As to Bosnia's Serb leaders--Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic--they should be regarded as nothing more than war criminals, with whom it is no longer possible to conduct a constructive dialog. Especially considering that, in Mr. Dzikic's opinion, they do not represent the interests of all Bosnian Serbs: Only about 40 percent of Serbs live in the Serb Republic controlled by them. Most Bosnian Serbs, however, consider themselves its citizens and cooperate with the government. As to Russian role in settling the conflict, in Mr. Dzikic's words, its position should be "more balanced" with respect to all republics of former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia. Today Moscow essentially defends great-power claims on the part of Serbs (although far from all Serbs share such ideas). Russia also is against lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the Bosnian army, but without it, in Mr. Dzikic's opinion, it is impossible to defend the state against aggression. At the same time, Sarajevo supports Moscow in that Bosnian borders cannot be changed through violence. Looking at the overall level of inter-state relations, however, much remains to be done. A good beginning, in the opinion of Bosnia's representative, would be to establish diplomatic relations. So far Russia is in no hurry to proceed with this, although it has recognized Bosnia a year ago.
