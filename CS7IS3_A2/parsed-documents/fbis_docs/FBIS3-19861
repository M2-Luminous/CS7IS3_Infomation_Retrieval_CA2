However, it is now discussed in the White House how North Korea can be forced to its knees. The reasonable decision to cancel the Team Spirit maneuver will probably be rescinded and Patriot missiles are to be sent on a journey. In former times, Kennedy had the Cuban crisis and Bush had Kuwait. Clinton sticks to the K's [German spelling of Cuba is with a K], while, of course, issues other than only Korea are also at stake. The trip by the U.S. secretary of state to East Asia was not precisely a success. Exactly for that reason, it cannot hurt to demonstrate to this region, above all to Beijing, that Washington can show its teeth. This crisis is also good for domestic use: The gossip about Clinton's Whitewater affair is far too lustful. It is high time that topics of conversation are imported. At present, the favorite opponent in the Middle East is of little use. First of all, it has to be forgotten that for almost one month Washington prevented the Security Council from commenting on the Hebron massacre. In the Balkans, ownerless planes that can be destroyed cannot be found every day. In Central America the United States is cutting such a figure with its policy toward Haiti that it is better for everyone not to look there. Thus, what remains? Old Kim with his bomb, which perhaps does not exist at all. A rigid regime, which has been driven to the wall, is boasting as if it were a superpower, precisely at the right time, so that Clinton can save the world -- in a way that will only result in an escalation of everything if prudence does not soon prevail. Well, Clinton pretends to be Kennedy. It is true that now the opponent is many numbers smaller, but it is Bill who is acting. And if a fire breaks out, he will be big enough.
