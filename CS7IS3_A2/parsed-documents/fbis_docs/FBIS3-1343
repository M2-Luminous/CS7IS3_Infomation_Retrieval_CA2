FBIS3-1343 "drafr058_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-058 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Mar 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Police Morale Reportedly at `All-Time Low' MB2403150794 Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English 18 Mar 94 pp 1, 2 MB2403150794 Cape Town CAPE TIMES Language: English Article Type:BFN [Report by Jackie Cameron] [Text] Police morale has hit an all-time low and many may strike or resign -- unless their salaries are brought in line with those of National Peace Keeping Force [NPKF] members. This shock warning was issued to the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] by the officially recognised South African Police Union (SAPU) in a document which paints a picture of a police force brewing with rage and turmoil. SAPU national secretary Captain Peter-Don Brandt said in an exclusive interview yesterday: "The threat of a police strike before the election in April is not to be taken lightly. Union and non-union members are not asking for an increase in salary, they are demanding it." Strong fears were also expressed that if the demands were not met, many policemen would join private armies. The police medical aid, Polmed, has also cut its medical aid contributions for psychological treatment from about R160 [rand] per visit to just R30. There is a massive discrepancy between the salaries of NPKF and SAP [South African Police] members: NPKF constables and lance-sergeants earn double the salary of their SAP counterparts. NPKF members ranking from sergeant up to captain earn about one-third more than SAP members of the same rank. In addition, the daily allowance for NPKF members is almost triple that given to SAP members, R61.50 per day compared to R22.50. "Policemen on the ground believe that a strike will work for them because it worked for the NPKF," Capt Brandt said. He said that he had to daily "pacify" those who believed a strike was the only option. Trainee NPKF members were granted salary increases earlier this month after they went on strike when they discovered they were being paid at the lowest rate for their particular rank instead of the highest -- which they had been promised. "SAP selection standards are much higher and our training is much longer and more purposeful than those of the NPKF and see what they get compared with us," Capt Brandt told the TEC. He said that policemen would play as vital a role as the NPKF in the pre-election, election and post-election phases. With ordinary policing also continuing, SAP members would have to work overtime constantly during the run-up to and after the election. Already there is talk of 12 hours continuous work, followed by 12 hours of rest, immediately followed by another 12 hours duty. "Should chaos break out, it could mean that these time schedules will have to be maintained for an indefinite period which could place unprecedented, indefinite pressure on the police." Police are overworked and tired, suffering from stress "and our families are disintegrating because of this". While police were fully prepared to render impartial service, they were "sick and tired" after being abused by several politicians in the past "to give of their best at a meagre salary and no overtime pay". Mr Craig Kotze, spokesman for Minister of Law and Order Mr Hernus Kriel, said yesterday: "We will not allow policemen to strike. There is no reason for them to do so and all the channels are in place for them to voice their grievances. We do not believe police morale is that low. Policemen chose their career path because they wanted to serve the community," he said. Chairman of the law and order subcouncil of the TEC, Mr Peter Gastrow, said last night the matter would appear on the council's agenda at their meeting next week. Speaking in his capacity as DP [Democratic Party] spokesman on law and order, he said: "The unhappiness of members of the police force is perfectly understandable in the light of the exceptionally heavy burden which they are being asked to carry while others appear to receive a better reward. I think they are justified in taking this matter up at the highest level and if the minister does not want a demotivated police force during the election serious attention will have to be given to their demands". SAPU has recruited more than 10,000 members since January -- more than 2,000 from the Western Cape. Major-General Nic Acker, regional commissioner of police in the Western Cape, said last night the morale of the men under his command was "a hundred percent". The head of the SAP's Police Psychology Unit, Dr Neel le Roux, said it was a tragedy that just when policemen needed psychological assistance more than ever the carpet was being pulled from under their feet by the cut in medical aid contributions for psychological treatment. "At the moment about 80 percent of medical boardings in the force are psychological and the suicide rate in the police force is about seven times higher than the rest of the population," he said. A spokeswoman for Polmed in the SAP, Major Marinda van Rooyen, said they had introduced the benefit cuts in January but said they were re-evaluating the cuts following numerous complaints from members and practioners. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Salary Comparison | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rank |NPKF |SA Police | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Brig |R10,534.25 |R10,534.25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Col |R7,697.25 |R6,536.50 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lt-Col |R6,536.25 |R5,418.75 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Major |R5,836.25 |R4,687.75 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Capt |R5,053.25 |R3,901.00 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lieut |R4,354.00 |R3,297.00 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |W/O |R4,052.00 to R2,793.00 |R5,053.25 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sgt |R3,599.00 |R2,288.00 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lt-Sgt |R3,146.00 |R1,691.00 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Const |R2,389.00 |R1,265.25 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
