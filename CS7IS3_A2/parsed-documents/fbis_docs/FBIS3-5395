Lantuu, who is responsible for construction in the capital of the hotel "Chinggis-Haan", speaking about reasons for the dragging out for a long time of construction works, explains this by financial difficulties and, on the other hand, by annulment of the agreement with the Yugoslav corporation "Genex". The annulment of the agreement was connected with economic sanctions in respect to Serbia. L. Lantuu notes that, judging by the world experience, for foundation of such a hotel needed are approximately 30 million dollars, but for building the hotel "Chinggis-Haan" in all probability we have to spend about 70 million dollars.

The central newspaper of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) "UNEN" publishes an article by candidate of historical science D. Altay "paradigm of development of Mongolia". In the article it is said that the present transition period of the country's development is notable for that the Mongolian society is freeing itself from usual methods of assessment of social and economic life. The author writes that this is accompanied by a crisis, which has enveloped the society as a whole. Mongolia, as noted in the article, has made a historical choice-creation of a humane democratic society, which is consolidated in the country's Constitution. In this connection the author rises the problems, which should be urgently solved, in her view, for realization of the planned tasks. As journalist J. Roozon writes in "UNEN", in Mongolia for already fourth year deformations of social-economic life are felt. In J. Roozon's view, such deformations are the growth of forcible crimes, squandering of material values, in particular, under pretence of privatization, oblivion of moral and spiritual traditions of the Mongolian people. The newspaper informs about the outcome of the international free-style wrestling tournament "Mongol Gobi `94". About 100 sportsmen from China, Russia, South Korea and Mongolia have participated in the tournament. The Mongolian sportsmen have won 7 gold medals out of 10.
