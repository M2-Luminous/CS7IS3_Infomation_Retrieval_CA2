The beginning of the abandonment of the ideals of American liberalism is deplored with undisguised distress. It is complained that the West did not help its heroes enough--Gaydar, Fedorov, Chubays--and I am not even talking about the president of Russia. Correspondents writing from Moscow have no desire to look into the face of tragic Russian reality. The arguments of the critics of shock therapy are disregarded, and their proposals for correcting policy and the resignation of the main architects of failed reforms are interpreted almost unanimously as a return to the old ways. Appeals to save Russian reforms are appearing in newspapers and journals. To do everything in order to continue the policy that received the approval of the International Monetary Fund and the "Big Seven." They speak freely of a wish to have an influence in accordance with their own views on the internal development of Russia, as if interference in the internal affairs of others in international relations has become the natural right of the rich and powerful. Articles in recent issues of the American journal TIME and the English ECONOMIST are full of mournful intonations: "A gigantic step backward," "the road to breakdown." True, TIME still tries to explain to Americans why Russians are disappointed in reforms according to the Western formula. "Imagine," the journal writes, "that the monthly rate of inflation in the United States is 20 percent, the output of industrial products is reduced by 15 percent annually, unemployment is growing everywhere, and the government has obviously turned out to be insolvent." "Imagine," it states further on, "that California and Texas have seceded, foreign communists are giving advice on how to reorganize the American Government... This is the equivalent of what Russia is encountering." This is something, of course, that Americans are not in a condition to imagine, because this is simply impossible in their country. And it is stupid to guess how they would behave in a similar situation, but they have taken to giving advice to we who are in such a situation. It would seem that the dramatic effect of Russian reality should prompt Western observers and analysts to give us advice that is somewhat more constructive than a simple toughening of that policy that led us into the impasse. But, alas, the faith-healing power of the monetarist drug is so great that no matter how convincing and well-reasoned the proposals are to select a unique Russian path to reform, they are immediately rejected as a return to the old ways, and their authors fall into the ranks of antireformers. In leading Western newspapers and journals, and even in Russian publications that have a pro-president orientation, market and democratic reforms are not thought of in some variant that is different from "shock therapy" and authoritarian presidential power. The idea is stubbornly taking hold that this variant has no alternatives. Perhaps it was out of naivete, but I supposed that in view of the catastrophic economic situation it was especially important in the traditions of serious science to analyze deeply and thoroughly the reasons for our troubles and, proceeding from the established diagnosis, to recommend methods of treatment. Unfortunately, the assessments and conclusions from the experience of Russian reforms were turned over to the control of journalists. In their propagandistic chorus, the voice of the objective researchers is barely distinguishable. During the past year Russian academic science has already twice come out with detailed reports that proposed an alternative strategy of reforms on the basis of a critical analysis of our experience. The failure of the purely monetarist policy of the stabilization of the economy and the market transition was disclosed in a number of reports and books of important Western economists. However, not only scientific data but also the real everyday experience are ignored by the authors of propagandistic stock phrases and myths, among whom are members of Gaydar's team as well. Thus, an official analyst in a governmental semiofficial organ proves that there was no shock therapy in Russia. I agree that the policy the authors themselves at first compared with Polish shock therapy has little in common with therapy; that is, with improving the health of the economy, and with Polish reform. But the shock that the population experienced from it did take place, and it was truly monstrous. And it cannot be covered up with any kind of literary stratagems. In a year and a half the real monetary income of the population was cut by almost a factor of three, and the quality of life was thrown back by 20-25 years. It is more and more difficult for supporters of the Gaydar reforms to conceal their failure in the Russian and Western mass media. And searches for those responsible are thereby being conducted more intensively. Jeffrey Sachs damns the Western powers for inadequate monetary assistance to the reformers. Others reproach the Russian reformers for insufficient toughness in limiting the consumption of the population and for budget expenditures. But all agree in accusing the chief banker of the country--V. Gerashchenko--who, it is said, did not keep credit and monetary emissions in check. At first glance, there are grounds for such accusations: The monetary and credit mass in circulation is growing, and so prices are also increasing. But many of the specialists in our country and abroad do not agree with this explanation. They cite the fact that galloping inflation is not caused by surplus effective demand, which has been suppressed, but by an increase in costs and the behavior of monopolist producers who shift continuously increasing expenses and taxes to prices, and also by inflated prices that are under the influence of inflationary expectations. According to their estimates, in its real purchasing power, the credit-monetary mass in Russia (i.e., with a correction for price increases) was reduced up to 30 percent from the initial level of January 1991. The excess money (the monetary overhang) was eliminated in this way. People's real monetary income fell to one-third, they were deprived of their savings, and enterprises were deprived of working capital and development funds. All this was supposed to cause the inflationary wave to recede. But the opposite happened. And all of this despite the fact that commodities that in the past were never an object of trade began additionally to be included in market turnover: apartments, land plots, enterprises, etc. In a word, before calling for a further toughening of credit-monetary emission, there should be a comparison of the physical-material and monetary components of the market that has evolved. Such a comparison, more than anything else, will confirm the correctness of the findings of academic science: In the current situation of cost inflation, anti-inflationary measures directed at limiting the monetary mass and reducing the budget deficit deprive the entire national economy of the possibility of implementing decisive structural changes and lead to an intensification in the drop in production. By limiting demand and contracting the market, they reduce taxes and other budget receipts and thereby intensify inflation. As you can see, the reasons for inflation are not as elementary as is interpreted by the adherents of liberal-radical reforms. Should we not moderate propagandistic passions and turn to the facts? Then, perhaps, even proposals to select another trajectory of the movement to the market will not seem like "a gigantic step backward." What is especially disturbing is the radical liberal idea of intensifying the state's regulatory interference in order to stop the collapse of production, prevent social cataclysms, chaos, and the further criminalization of the economy, and support entrepreneurship. A cry can be immediately heard here about a return to the administrative command system and a concession to the conservative director corps in industry and "the red barons" in agriculture. Meanwhile, world experience (especially in the period of the last war and after it) indicates that when destructive processes in the economy and society go as far as they have in our country, it is unrealistic to stop them by means of market self-regulation alone. In the period of the postwar restoration of West Europe, foreign trade, the currency rate of exchange, and the movement of capital were regulated by the states, but the transition to a freely convertible currency in current trade operations took more than 10 years. State price control over key commodities, and also subsidies for their support, were continued just as long, and they have remained in agriculture and the power industry to this day. The state sector played an important role in industry, and only now, it seems, is its broader privatization maturing. I will add that the successes of the Japanese economy, and recently also of the new industrial countries, are in many ways tied to the guiding influence of the state on market relations and the gradualness of reforms. It seems that in the so-called "deregulation," that is, the elimination of the state from the sphere of regulation of the economy, Russia, under the influence of liberal theory, went further in many spheres than the experience of capitalist countries suggests. Hurrying to abolish the instruments of state regulation inherited from the former Soviet Union, Russian reformers began to rely on the invisible hand of the market. The calculation did not justify itself: It is now much more complicated to recreate a capable state administrative mechanism that is not infected by corruption and bureaucracy, and to recreate one not as a counterbalance to the market but precisely for the sake of creating a civilized and socially oriented market. I cannot comprehend why the Western press refrains from reproaching China, where market reorganization is not being implemented according to an IMF formula but by means of a gradual displacement of state regulation by market regulation (and then by no means everywhere), and why so much indignation is aroused in it by the proposals of some members of the Russian Government to cope with inflation and the drop in production by using the same experience. Well, after all, the new American administration is also sending Reaganomics, with its ideas of deregulation, to the archives. In conclusion, I would like to repeat: The best support for our democratic market reorganizations is rejection of the imposition of schemes that are foreign to Russian conditions, calm businesslike analysis of problems that face us, and respect for the abilities of Russian scientists and politicians to find a way out of the impasse by themselves. Attempts to condition assistance to Russia with the implementation of recommendations of the IMF and the "Big Seven," while not hiding the sympathies of the West for those who follow this advice in spite of real results--all this is capable only of stirring up the anti-Western mood in Russian society.
