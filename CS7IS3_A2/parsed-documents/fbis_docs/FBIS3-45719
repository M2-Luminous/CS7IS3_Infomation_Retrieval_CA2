Intending to conduct strategy talks in London with British Prime Minister John Major and senior cabinet ministers, Mr Patten reiterated a stern warning to China not to mix politics and economics. He intimated China might have more to lose than Britain if it did so. "China has pretty well a two-to-one trade surplus with the United Kingdom," Mr Patten said. "China has attempted to join the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), an application which has the United Kingdom's and, of course, the Hong Kong Government's enthusiastic support. And countries which join Gatt don't behave in the sort of way that has been suggested by one or two Chinese officials." Since the Sino-British negotiations broke down, Mr Patten's relations with Beijing have been strained and acrimonious. Britain has now embarked on unilateral constitutional reform in Hong Kong, but he stressed that the door to negotiations on the contentious issues surrounding the final elections under British rule was still open. With the first part of his constitutional reform package now before the legislature Mr Patten has made it clear the remainder will not be introduced until after that bill is approved. The bill needs to be approved by the end of the month, leaving the way clear for the remainder of the constitutional reform package to be introduced in March. Mr Patten will seek cabinet backing to take this course of action when he meets senior ministers in London on Monday. "I don't think you should expect any dramatic announcements," he said. "The position is one I think the community well understands. We want to go on talking to Chinese officials about the three outstanding contentious issues (surrounding the 1995 Legislative Council elections). "We're happy to go on talking until that moment when we have to begin legislating on the remaining matters which have to be resolved for the 1995 elections. We hope that the talks can be resumed, and if that's not the case we will have to try with the Legislative Council to put in place arrangements which are acceptable to Hong Kong," Mr Patten said. Today, he will begin his strategy talks with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, and the minister responsible for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad.
