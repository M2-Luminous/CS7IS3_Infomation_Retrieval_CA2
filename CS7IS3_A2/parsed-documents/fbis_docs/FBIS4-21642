Srinivasan, programme director of the integrated launch vehicle programme of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Speaking to this paper here today, Dr Srinivasan, an aeronautical engineer who has masterminded ISRO's launch vehicle programmes, said that the failure of last PSLV launch was due to an error in the software. Earlier, speaking at the annual symposium on "Space Research in India: Achievements," organised by the Bombay Association of Science Education (BASE), Dr Srinivasan said the space age had come to stay in India and the objectives of India's space programme would go a long way in meeting the needs of society. He said that, in the development of satellite launch vehicles, ISRO had gone step by step. "It has to be developed in a cost effective manner," he told teachers who had come from different parts of Maharashtra. Some of India's top aerospace scientists like Dr George Joseph, director, space applications centre, Ahmedabad, and Dr Ramachandran, deputy director of ISRO's Satellite Centre, are attending the three-day symposium at the Nehru Science Centre. Dr Srinivasan said the development of a launch vehicle involved numerous disciplines like aeronautics and mechanical engineering. He said there would be one more launch of the augmented satellite launch vehicle (ASLV) later this year and work had begun on the geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV). Emphasising the need of the ASLV programme, he said, it enabled space scientists to test various systems. "We need cryogenic engines and we will have it," said Dr George Joseph, while inaugurating the symposium. Emphasising the importance of self-reliance in the field of launch vehicles, he said, the failure of the PSLV would help one to improve and correct mistakes. He said that, 30 years ago, when India launched its space programme people doubted its wisdom. But, when they watch TV programmes they realise its benefits, he said. Dr George Joseph later spoke to the audience about remote sensing programmes and its advantages. In his presidential remarks, the director of the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Mr V.G. Kulkarni, said that Indian teachers were as good as those in foreign countries. The director of the Nehru Science Centre, Dr R.M. Chakraborthy, welcomed the gathering and the secretary of BASE, Mr P.K.G. Nair, proposed a vote of thanks.
