In the first months after my election, I will conduct financial operations to compensate the population for the loss of bank savings and the devaluation of possessions. Apart from this, we will repay all debts in connection with government bonds, insurance, and payment for farm produce in 1991-93. The main focus of my activity will be economic recovery. We must give enterprises a chance to work and cancel all administrative restrictions, prohibitive taxes, licences, and quotas, which are smothering enterprises today, hiking up interest rates to unheard-of proportions, leading to a payment crisis, and bringing business to a halt. We will ensure financial stabilization in society, with stable prices, currency exchange rates, and wages. This will provide the basis for an increase in production and an increase in pay. Our calculations show that in six months after these reform measures, we will be able to raise wages four- and five-fold, taking the average wage up to the equivalent of $90-$100 monthly. [passage omitted] We will not be able to make a move forward until we regionalize our life; that is, grant social and economic independence to oblasts, the autonomous republic of Crimea, and local authorities, both in terms of democratic self-government and necessary financial and tax opportunities, independence in regulating the investment, and production climate and foreign trade on their territory. Apart from this, we are faced with a very important task of ridding ourselves of national self-isolation we have wound up that smothers us today in economic and humanitarian terms. We must become active in international life, profit from foreign trade, and repatriate hard currency, which is currently kept abroad, depriving us of economic confidence. We must become an active participant of the political life. We will, of course, be admitted to the international community, and we will become one of the civilized nations in the world. Thank you.
