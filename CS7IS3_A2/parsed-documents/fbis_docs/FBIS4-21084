Sanchez Belisle] [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for the United People political alliance, yesterday called for compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties during a meeting with U.S. congressmen who advocate U.S. military presence in Panama beyond the year 2000. "Compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties is the most advisable thing for the United States and Panama," Perez Balladares told U.S. Congressmen Phil Crane and Howard Phillips, who are holding talks in Panama to promote a law before the U.S. Congress to extend the U.S. military presence in Panama after 31 December 1999. Perez Balladares said his government would be "willing to hold talks" if the United States should request discussions on defense issues and on a U.S. military presence beyond the year 2000. The United People candidate said, "We held very frank talks." He added that times have changed and currently "our interests and the interests of the United States are focused on the war against drugs and drug trafficking." Perez Balladares said drugs are causing havoc in Panama, adding that, if he wins the 8 May elections, he will ask neighboring countries, specifically Costa Rica and Colombia, "to establish a united Latin American front to fight drugs." The struggle against drugs, the presidential candidate added, must be based on mutual respect that must prevail among free, independent, and sovereign countries. Perez Balladares' meeting with Congressmen Crane and Phillips, who were accompanied by about 20 people, took place in the afternoon in the Blue Room of the Continental Hotel.
