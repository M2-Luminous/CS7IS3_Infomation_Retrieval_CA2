FR940413-1-00030 FR940413-1-00010 Environmental Analysis This proposed rule represents a clarifying change and would not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. In addition, pursuant to Department of Transportation, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts'' (FAA Order 1050.1D, appendix 7, paragraph 4), the FAA was categorically excluded from providing an environmental analysis with regard to part 34 because it was mandated by law to issue regulations to ensure compliance with the EPA aircraft emissions standards, and the EPA has performed all required environmental analyses prior to the issuance of those standards. Federalism Implications The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposed rule would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion I certify that the proposed rule: (1) Is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a significant rule under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
