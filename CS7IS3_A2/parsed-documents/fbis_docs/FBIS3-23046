They named the three, who were described as traders, as Kwaku Sasu and Eric Danso, on admission with serious injuries and Joseph Asare, who had been treated and discharged. "No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion and no one has been arrested. But we believe the incident is a spillover of the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in the northern region," they said. They said one unexploded grenade was found at the site of the incident, and that the injured were asleep when the grenade exploded. Police said three men in military uniform were seen in the market area about the time of the incident and that investigations are going on. The National Electoral Commission (NEC) has postponed indefinitely the district election slated for 22 March in the entire northern region and parts of the Volta and Brong-Ahafo regions which experienced a spillover of the conflict.
