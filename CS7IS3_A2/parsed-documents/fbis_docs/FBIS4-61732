The two political leaders agreed to convert his death penalty into 20 years of imprisonment. The same sources revealed that Nicolae Andronic, the chairman of the [Moldovan] parliamentary commission in charge of having the Tiraspol political prisoners freed and restoring the rights of deputy Ilie Ilascu, was not allowed to attend the negotiations by the Dniester party, because of Andronic's inflexible stance regarding the unconditioned release of the six political prisoners.
