China's first gigantic computer, the "Yinhe No. 2", is used to forecast medium-range weather conditions, so that China has become one of the few countries to provide effective weather forecasts four to five days ahead. A ground reception system in coordination with the "Fengyun No. 2" meteorological satellite has begun to receive and handle data from the satellite, the officials said. The feasibility report of an automatic atmosphere monitoring system has been drawn up, and a preliminary plan to organize a state climatology center has been approved and regional branches have gone into operation. Nationwide, 331 remote computer terminal stations had been set up by the end of last year, together with 15 ocean meteorological stations and 14,750 stations at township level. The central and local meteorological departments also gave accurate reports of some disasters last year, such as sand storms, typhoons and torrential rains. In addition, the departments made great efforts to aid the growing and harvesting of crops, and the handling of plant diseases, insect pests, soil conditions, and forest fires. Meanwhile, meteorological departments in 23 provinces and autonomous regions induced artificial rain and prevented hail over an area of more than two million sq km.
