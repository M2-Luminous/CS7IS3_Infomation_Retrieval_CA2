[passage omitted] President Lech Walesa, who took part in the government meeting, left the Office of the Council of Ministers without making any comment to the press. Olechowski said that the president will take part in the Prague summit. According to the foreign minister, the president -- like the government -- considers the Partnership for Peace proposal as insufficient, which does not mean that he is against it. "If when jumping across a hole in the ice your jump proves too short you have every chance of falling in," Olechowski quoted Walesa as saying. One of the Polish reservations about Partnership for Peace concerns the lack of a time-frame for granting NATO membership. "We perceive it as a process lasting several years," Olechowski said. He recalled that even a few months ago there was no mention of NATO opening up to new members and added that at present the "partnership" makes our future participation in the structures of the treaty plausible. In his opinion the postponement in time of Poland's membership will not bring about immediate negative effects because currently there is no military threat. Olechowski said that he does not regard our present position concerning NATO as a waiting-room situation but rather as "being engaged to a girl who only yesterday said that she was going to get married but did not say to whom." He expressed the hope that Poland will be in the first group of countries which NATO will incorporate in the future. According to Olechowski, as far as democratic standards and the development of the military sector are concerned, Poland is no more lagging behind than was Greece when that country joined the treaty. He said that issues related to the funding necessary to implement the "partnership" program were also discussed at the meeting. He emphasized that the pace of bringing Poland closer to NATO will depend on our financial contribution. Asked whether he envisages a meeting with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, if his visit to Poland takes place, Olechowski said that his diary is full. "If I were to meet every member of parliament, I would not be able to do my job," he said, adding that Zhirinovskiy may enter Poland, but if he breaches our interests, he will be taken back to the border with an administrative visa
