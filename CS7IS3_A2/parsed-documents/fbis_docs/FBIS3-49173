Thus he responded in the new program to questions by reporters concerning the establishment of these bodies and the state administration reform. Moreover, he said that it is questionable whether this issue requires an immediate and deep involvement. He, himself, as he said, will not support this rather harsh approach. He said further that he supports such an approach only if he is certain that an immediate and harsh solution to a particular problem is useful and necessary. At present, however, he does not see the constitutional arrangement as the most important and urgent problem. Further, the prime minister pointed out that the higher territorial bodies "undoubtedly will cost something, and it will not be little." Here, he added, one could ask whether the price is worth the gain brought about by the establishment and operation of these bodies. To a direct question concerning the quality of the documentation submitted by Kalvoda's Office for Legislature and Public Administration regarding the issue of the constitutional arrangement reform, Klaus replied that this document is a topic for discussion in the government, but he added that the document does not deal with the problem of financing the establishment of the higher administrative bodies. "Some people see only the advantages of the administrative bodies, others are concerned precisely with the cost of their establishment and operation. That is the basic conflict," the prime minister added. According to him, the questions of powers, budget, financing, property relations between the territorial bodies, and other points that are connected with the administrative reform have not yet been solved. Nevertheless, he himself does not reject the administrative reform, and the Civic Democratic Party will not, according to him, block the emergence of the higher bodies. In this context, he pointed out that the government found a solution to the constitutional arrangement problem, which was sent to the parliament just before the end of last year in the form of draft principles for the constitutional law on the establishment of higher autonomous territorial bodies and a schedule for legislative measures toward the implementation of the administrative reform. He also mentioned individual deadlines for the implementation of the gradual steps that would lead to the establishment of higher bodies. He denied, however, that the coalition leaders agreed on some specific date for the election to these bodies. Nevertheless, he said that for many reasons it would not be desirable for the elections to take place every year. [Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 4 January on page 9 also carries a report on Klaus's appearance on the television program and adds: "Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus rejected on the Czech Television program that part of President Vaclav Havel's New Year's address that deals with the tasks of the Cabinet. Klaus is convinced that his government is paying equal attention to all important issues."]
