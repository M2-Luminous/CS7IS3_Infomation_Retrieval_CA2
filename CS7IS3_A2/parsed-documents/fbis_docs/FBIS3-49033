As reported in detail by this newspaper, the grave charges related primarily to the social policy of the local government; the soup kitchen opened last Monday was viewed as humiliating from the standpoint of citizens, and as a political move whose timing coincides with the elections. "Despite the difficult situation and the grave shortage of money, the local government is taking every possible action to provide for the poorest stratum of the city's residents, to enable these people to weather the cold and the misery. The fundamental void in the charges leveled by the gentlemen from the SPS is that they forget to mention the fact that they were the ones who brought this situation upon the citizens, the same people who are now in power in the republic, and whose policies cast the country into total isolation, and its citizens into total misery," Jozsef Kasza said relative to the charges that "exceed anything we have heard so far." "I agree with the assertion that a soup kitchen is degrading, particularly in this part of Vojvodina, one of the richest agricultural areas of Serbia, where extremely diligent people live, people who could earn a livelihood as a result of their work. But inappropriate policies have brought these people to a point where they cannot afford to buy a loaf of bread, or a single warm meal per day. The SPS does not support our humanitarian action program, despite the fact that they have been hauling food away from here to other parts of the country for years. We are aware of the identity of those who carried relief supply shipments to every part of the former Yugoslavia; they took aid collected in Szabadka to the battle fields, or the shipments ended up on the black market. At this point it is the local government's function to rescue citizens lingering below the subsistence level. By using funds from our tight budget, and from humanitarian aid received, we are trying to help these people irrespective of their nationality, religion, or political belonging. At this point, those who plundered the northern Bacska region have tried to undermine the launching of a soup kitchen program. They cannot succeed in this effort, however, because the people of Szabadka are prepared to cook on hot plates to save their fellow citizens from hunger," according to the Szabadka mayor. The mayor expressed regrets over the fact that the SPS, while increasingly losing ground, creates political issues out of social welfare concerns, and in the course of this, it uses the customary method of telling lies. Jozsef Kasza denied that the SPS members of the municipal committee in charge of organizing supplies for the populace were not invited to participate in the committee's work. Compliance with the most recent government decree is delayed because the ministry having jurisdiction has failed to dispatch all the the vouchers, despite repeated interventions. Citizens did not receive their laundry detergent for September because the local government had neither funds nor fuel to transport the detergent from Krusevac to Szabadka. Transportation charges for bringing the per capita rations to Szabadka frequently exceeded the worth of goods to be transported. Jozsef Kasza expressed regrets over the fact that a noted professional, Dr. Rodoljub Duric, the director of the Szabadka hospital, also joined the SPS's campaign, which is filled with lies and is aimed at discrediting the local government. Managing the hospital would be his primary function, but "he should, at least, be honest as long as he entered into political discourse," because the local government supports the hospital by using municipal reserve funds. The mayor of Szabadka says that it is not true that Dusan Stipanovic successfully lobbied for the opening of a border crossing point at Bajmok-Bacsalmas; the truth is that Stipanovic raised obstacles in the path of opening the crossing point. Similarly, the truth is that Jozsef Kasza negotiated with Foreign Minister Jovanovic and with the appropriate Hungarian organizations regarding extended work hours. Construction of facilities at the border crossing point is also impeded by people from Bajmok encouraged by the SPS; construction could begin upon release of the disputed area. On the other hand, contrary to to experience of residents of other municipalities, Szabadka residents are unable to obtain passports for months. This could not occur if Interior Ministry organs performed their functions and provided passports continuously. Every citizen has a right to receive passports. "The Szabadka local government wants peace, and tries to conduct its affairs despite the difficult circumstances that it experiences by no fault of its own," Mayor Jozsef Kasza said in conclusion of yesterday's news conference.
