While the CIP [Job Training Contract] has not been officially suspended, Employment Minister Michel Giraud, speaking yesterday to the parliamentary committee on the five-year law, announced that "new legislative measures" on employment will be adopted. The minister stated that the aim is "to reconsider the job training contract. We are envisaging adopting a different approach which can only come through parliamentary debate." Shortly before this, Charles Million, president of the Rhone-Alpes regional council, and Michel Pericard, president of the Assembly's Social Committee, had both asked for a new employment law, the latter stressing that "only a law can undo a law." Michel Bon has continued to consult with trade union organizations in drafting the proposal which will then serve as the basis for the law. On several occasions, the director general of the ANPE [National Employment Agency] has repeated: "At the moment, I am listening," and has refused to comment further. The CFDT [French Democratic Confederation of Labor], however, stated at the end of the meeting "that it will not accept a new measure that forces young people to pay a job entrance fee," and said that it was "completely opposed to the ANPE-youth project: There is no reason to apply a measure that would discriminate against young people." The CGC [General Confederation of Executives] was dancing to the same tune, asking for a "contract for the integration of young people into the labor market," as was the CFTC [French Confederation of Christian Workers], which considers it essential that "we avoid any confusion between training and the activity of integration." At the end of the day -- when Michel Bon was meeting with the employers' organizations -- a certain degree of unanimity seemed, in any event, to have been reached among the social partners, recalling that they had signed a document proposing "contracts for guidance, adaptation, and qualification," and increasing exemptions on social charges for employing young people.
