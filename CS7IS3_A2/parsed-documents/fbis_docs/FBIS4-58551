The prime minister was addressing the student officers at the Command and Staff College in Quetta today. [Begin Bhutto recording] We are aware of the dimensions of our national defense which call for heightened consciousness. We are clear about the diagnosis and the prescription. National security must always take precedence. Pakistan is a peaceful nation. We are against territorial aggrandizement. We are against nuclear proliferation and we have exercised commendable self-restraint to demonstrate the point, but we do not accept discrimination. A country which has had three wars cannot afford to do so. Today it has become fashionable to talk about nuclear phraseology, words like capping, freezing, roll back are being thrown about in the open with abundance without appreciating that national security must be accorded collective responsibility. Each day self-centered individuals intent on achieving narrow objectives throw about strategic issues, indifferent to the damage they inflict on national policies. We have said it before and I am saying it here today before this august gathering that if even the sun melts we will not accept discrimination or compromise on our security. The right of survival is the first right. [end recording] The prime minister said we are determined to make Pakistan a modern welfare state. She said we will have to take strong decisions to achieve this objective. The prime minister said there is a need to reform our taxation system and we have decided to take steps in this direction. The prime minister said the next budget will be a step forward for revitalizing the economy. She said the government will give firm economic foundation to the country to promote free market economy and would ensure smooth economic progress and prosperity. Earlier, the commandant of the staff college gave a resume of the training facilities available at the college. Some military officers are also getting training at the college.
