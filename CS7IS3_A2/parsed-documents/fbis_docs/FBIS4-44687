A German computer is working with PRARE together with a laser situated on board the Russian satellite Meteor 3. Among other things, it can make an exact determination of continental drift, of the "tides" of the earth as a solid body, and of earth's gravitational field. The data is evaluated at the GFZ and also yield the flight path of the satellite with an accuracy of within 10 to 20 centimeters. It is reported that PRARE has several advantages in comparison to other laser systems: it operates in all weathers, by night as well as by day, with approximately equal accuracy. Data is stored in the satellite and transmitted to the GFZ field office in Oberpfaffenhofen on every pass. This earth-measuring project is the result of close cooperation between the German and Russian partners. On the German side, participants include the GFZ, the German Agency for Air and Space Affairs (DARA) and Stuttgart University. The satellite was manufactured in Russia by the Research Institute for Electro-Mechanics in Istra (Moscow district), while the flight is monitored by mission control centers in Kaliningrad.
