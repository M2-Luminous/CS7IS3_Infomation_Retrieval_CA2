The meeting is considered to be the first step toward establishing interparliamentary ties between the two countries. Burbulis together with his American and Japanese counterparts participated in the trilateral forum on security in the north- Pacific region which closed here on Wednesday. Burbulis emphasized the significance of his meeting with Takako Doi "from the point of view of a revival of the Russian Parliament's prestige and the authority of the Russian parliamentarians" in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday. According to him, Takako doi showed much interest in the process of forming the new Russian Parliament and emphasized that it was important to establish fruitful cooperation between the Russian and Japanese lawmakers as soon as possible. She called on the Russian Parliament to resume the activities of the Russo-Japanese parliamentary committee which was suspended because of the dissolvement of the former Supreme Soviet. Takako Doi expressed grave concern about the fact that the last transformations inside Russia's Government might result in curtailing the economic reforms. In response, Burbulis, who represents the "Russia's Choice" faction in the lower chamber of Russia's Parliament, said that the new Russian Constitution, which was adopted on December 12, 1993, had for the first time given the chance to secure political stability in the country. "In no case shall we leave President Boris Yeltsin in isolation, without the indispensable support of the professionals who carried out the economic reforms," he emphasized. In his opinion, joint work of President yeltsin and Premier Viktor chernomyrdin Is a sure guaranty of stability inside Russia. "Boris Yeltsin has received enough powers to provide for a stable and competent system of government. As for Viktor Chernomyrdin, he has always demonstrated his ability to make strategic decisions which were in line with the course of economic reforms," he said. "Today it should have been dangerous to let the union between the president and the chairman of goverment collapse," he emphasized.
