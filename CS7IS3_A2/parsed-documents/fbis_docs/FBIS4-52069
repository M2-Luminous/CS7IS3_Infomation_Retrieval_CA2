In the letter, although the Khmer Rouge strives to show that it wants the cease-fire -- which constitutes a step toward national reconciliation, peace, and compromise -- Khieu Samphan spends a large part of the message detailing a vague description. This has prompted His Majesty to complain that he does not know what the Khmer Rouge want to have or do. The king also says that he does not know whether the Khmer Rouge rejects or supports his proposal. It is clear that the Khmer Rouge has painstakingly raised the obsolete pretext that it has been using for years in order to shun the cease- fire and refuse to enter the roundtable meeting to solve problems peacefully. It is well known that for over a decade the Khmer Rouge, using Vietnam as a pretext, has totally destroyed monasteries, Buddhist monks' quarters, stupas, roads, bridges, trains, schools, and hospitals. It has massacred children, elderly persons, women, and our people in rural areas without mercy. Moreover, the Khmer Rouge has also alleged that the Paris Accord of 23 October 1991 mapped out with the international community's support is a Vietnamese scheme. It contemptuously trampled upon the accord. It not only refused to cease firing, demobilize its troops, and lay down its arms, but it also fired at UNTAC and called the latter YUONTAC [derogatory word for UNTAC]. The Khmer Rouge also calls the royal government, which has come into being as a result of the people's wish through the elections organized and supervised by the United Nations, a Vietnamese puppet government. In its latest letter, the Khmer Rouge has sternly charged that the subsistence of the two-headed government is maintained only by the communist Vietnamese's muscle and force. This constitutes a show of utter contempt for the people's wish and displays scorn for the king, who approved the government lineup last year. Most seriously, the Khmer Rouge has charged that the three conditions raised by the royal government in keeping with the king's 21 November 1993 three-point proposal are part of a Vietnamese scheme. It seems that the Khmer Rouge tends to insolently regard the king's proposal as a Vietnamese scheme as well. This is really an intolerable action. Moreover, the on-the-spot cease-fire is based on the clear-sighted initiative of the king; so why did the Khmer Rouge wildly accuse it of being a poisonous trick of the royal government. In sum, it can be seen that the Khmer Rouge, drunk with its sense of identity with the people, has regarded those outside its group as Vietnamese, whom it intends to destroy completely. The Khmer Rouge has used the Vietnamese issue as a pretext to continue the destructive war against the nation. Vietnam is a label used by the Khmer Rouge as a pretext to massacre the people. At a meeting with Buddhist monks, senior citizens, nuns, and his children in front of the Chan Chhaya pavilion on 4 May, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman said Vietnam should not further be used as a pretext to continue the war and that one should understand that the present war is a war between Cambodians. His Majesty added that those using any pretext whatever to prolong war are all national traitors, who are endangering the nation and bringing about a loss of Cambodia's independence, territorial integrity, and race. This being so, the Khmer Rouge, which always boasts about its patriotism, should feel humiliated and stop using the obsolete and base pretext to continue its political and military ambition. It should turn to talking about the reality with veracity and equity.
