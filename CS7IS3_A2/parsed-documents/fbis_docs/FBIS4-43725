At a meeting of the Land Council -- the highest body that meets between the federal delegates' assemblies -- they want to discuss 10 "turning points" in Magdeburg. With these they will enter the election campaign and, later on, perhaps the coalition talks. FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU correspondent Peter Ziller talked about the touchstones with Ludger Volmer, one of the two Executive Committee spokesmen of the Greens. Volmer has had a few pleasant days. The "unexpectedly good" result of the European election was followed by an appearance at the DGB [German Trade Union Federation] federal congress, where the 42-year-old man felt "unconcealed sympathetic feelings" coming from the delegates. For the sociologist, who is considered a member of the left wing, the Greens are now the third political force. The turning points suggested by the Executive Committee do not mean a correction of the Mannheim election congress. No wing of the party wants that, Volmer says, rejecting the suspicion that is emerging here and there. What was decided at the end of February must, however be "explained and detailed" in some fields. Thus, the demands often have a different time scale. In Magdeburg, the Greens now want to make clear what kind of "change in direction" they consider feasible and indispensable within one legislative period. In Volmer's view, not only some media but also the desired political partner, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], have misunderstood the Greens' decisions. "In contrast to the widespread rumors, our goal is not the immediate abolition of the Bundeswehr and departure from NATO." He says that the Greens rather want a "diplomatic initiative for the dissolution of the military blocs in a system of collective security." This cannot be achieved by a one-sided act, which has been agreed on in a coalition agreement. "After all, we know that our remote foreign policy goals can be only the result of years of diplomacy." In the turning points, his party describes what is possible soon: for instance, the strong reduction of the military service, the renunciation of German crisis intervention forces, and new projects for the acquisition of armament goods. However, the Greens are putting other issues in the foreground. The first four turning points are aimed at the ecological restructuring of the economy, the lack of jobs, the situation in the new laender, and social policy. "We need a courageous reform policy -- and reforms are expensive." Therefore his party says that new sources of money must be opened up. Rudolf Scharping's "safety-fence concept," which rejects higher taxes and debts and says that reforms are carried out only if it is possible to finance them, extends the "policy of muddling through," in the view of the Greens leader. "There is a great deal of money in Germany," Volmer says. He includes the high private capital incomes, the high liquidity of the companies, and inherited assets. "We want to get to the pinnacles of wealth"; the broad population benefits from tax-free amounts and is not burdened additionally. However, the consumers are not spared ecological taxes. The higher petroleum tax, for instance, which is to rise by 30 pfennigs per year, will not be generally compensated for by the reduction of other taxes, Volmer affirms. The increase is to make the consumers buy energy-saving products and to change the structure of industry's range of products.
