Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States, issued a similar reaction. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said this is "a positive signal" from al-Asad. Syria announced that it will allow the delegation to arrive in Syria only through a third country, and not directly from Israel through the Golan Heights, and that it will not stamp the visitors' passports. Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday that the fact that Darawshah was invited to Damascus should not be overrated. At the same time, they pointed out two positive aspects: the fact that Syria has agreed to allow the visit of an Israeli MK, and the fact that al-Asad accepted the Israeli pressure and approved the visit. [passage omitted] Ambassador Rabinovich said that the Syrian Government agreement to receive the delegation headed by MK Darawshah is of certain importance, but it should be viewed in the right perspective. "This is one step, but additional and more significant steps are needed for us to be able to say that Syria is taking steps to project the feeling that it has indeed undergone a change of heart with regard to Israel," Rabinovich told reporters in Washington. Ambassador Rabinovich added that "it is clear to us that al-Asad is not al-Sadat, that he will not follow the latter's example, but there is still a giant gap between what Syria could do and this step. Inviting Darawshah and receiving the U.S. delegation of inspection of the MIA's and POW's issue are beginnings; we expect a continuation." Israeli sources said that the visit to Damascus by MK Darawshah was raised in the meeting of the chief Israeli and Syrian delegates to the bilateral negotiations, and that the issue "was handled in a practical manner which indicates that the Syrians wish to prove that the Washington track is alive and active." In the first week of the current round of the Washington talks with the Syrian representatives, Israel asked that a discussion be devoted to the time aspect of the negotiations -- that is, to the relation between the stages of withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the stages of implementing the full peace. The Syrian delegate, however, again demanded that the depth of the Israeli withdrawal be discussed first.
