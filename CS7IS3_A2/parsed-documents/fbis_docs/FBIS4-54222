The province is facing an acute hunger situation due to the failure of two consecutive crops. About 16 percent of its population is experiencing serious hunger. Among them, 34,000 are ethnic minorities and 44,000 are people dependent on social welfare assistance in the coastal area. More than 70 percent of families in 11 of 44 villages inhabited by ethnic people face severe hunger. To resolve this situation, Quang Tri Province has allotted 1 billion dong from its reserve budget to buy seeds for distribution to the peasants to help them quickly engage in planting the summer-fall rice crop. The province also is striving to improve the irrigation system and encouraging the people to plant more subsidiary food crops to relieve the hunger situation. Quang Tri Province requested that the government delegation consider an exemption of its agricultural tax and the postponement of its debt payment to the state bank during the winter-spring and summer-fall rice crops. It has also asked the government to provide help to relieve the hunger situation while distributing more seeds to the peasants to help them quickly engage in the planting of summer-fall and winter-spring rice crops.
