The white paper entitled "The Situation of Chinese Women" says that China is striving to develop friendly exchanges and cooperation with women from all over the world, while making unremitting efforts to realize the goal of worldwide equality between men and women, women's participation in social development and maintenance of world peace. "Since resuming membership in the United Nations in October 1971, China has shown great enthusiasm in participating in U.N. activities related to women," the document states. China has been playing an active role in U.N. women's organizations. Since 1974, China has been elected five times as a member state in the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women. "There, Chinese representatives have expounded Chinese women's stand on world peace, participation in development and promotion of sex equality, exchanged experience and information on promoting women's conditions and giving full play to the role of women with their counterparts from other countries," the paper says. Since 1982, Chinese experts have been elected four times in succession as representatives on the Committee on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and participated in evaluating the reports submitted by governments and made strenuous efforts to eliminate discrimination against women, according to the document. The paper says that China was one of the first signatories to the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and has submitted timely reports on its implementation in China as required. "China supported and engaged in activities for International Women's Year in 1975 and the U.N. Decade for Women, from 1975 to 1985. The Chinese Government sent delegations to the world conferences on women held in Mexico City in 1975, Copenhagen in 1980 and Nairobi in 1985, and also to the five global preliminary meetings and two regional preparatory meetings," the document says. "At these events, Chinese representatives gave full support to exertions for the United Nations Decade for Women and expounded China's stand and viewpoints on some major international problems and strategies for the advancement of conditions for women, thus making positive contributions to the success of these conferences," the paper says. The document continues that Chinese women have made vigorous efforts to develop links with women's organizations and individuals around the globe. "To date, the All-China Women's Federation has established ties with nearly over 480 governmental and non-governmental women's and children's organizations in over 130 countries and regions and received more than 10,000 visitors in recent years," it says. In the past 15 years, China has also sent 280 women delegations abroad, according to the paper. Over the past decade, the All-China Women's Federation has cooperated with the United Nations Children's Fund, United Nations Women's Development Fund and other governmental and non-governmental organizations in over 700 projects in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Over 300,000 women have taken part in these programs and the results have been outstanding, the paper says. "As the host country of the fourth world conference on women," the paper says, "China will make positive efforts to ensure its success." "The Chinese Government is at present earnestly carrying out its responsibilities as a host country and increasing its contacts and cooperation with U.N. organizations, governments and relevant non-governmental organizations in the world."
