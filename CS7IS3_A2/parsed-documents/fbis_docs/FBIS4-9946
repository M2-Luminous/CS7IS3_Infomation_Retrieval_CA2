FBIS4-9946 "drlat066_a_94008" FBIS-LAT-93-066 Daily Report 6 April 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Further on Exercise Further on Exercise FL0604014994 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 2300 GMT 5 Apr FL0604014994 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [Report by Pepe Suarez] [Text] Good evening, Cuba. The neutralization of a simulated enemy invasion of the town of Santa Fe on the western coast of Havana was the result achieved by the joint forces of the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP] of the Cuban capital, where the Giron-94 exercises began today. These exercises will be extended until 17 April in an effort to actively thwart criminal and antisocial actions. In each locality of the capital, troops from the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] and of the Minim [Interior Ministry], together with the fast-response brigades, are operating jointly with the troops of the political and social organizations under the command of the Joint General Staff of the SUVP to test the effectiveness of the command's guidelines and the revolutionary response capability against criminal and enemy actions. Speaking with the inhabitants of Santa Fe in Havana City, Jorge Lezcano Perez, Politburo member and first secretary of the provincial committee in the capital, said the results of this operation, called Operation Dignity, were excellent. He also spoke with the people about Cubans who try to illegally leave the country and the risks these actions represent, both for the physical safety of the illegal runaways and for the Coast Guard troops who patrol our shores. Lezcano stressed the political manipulation conducted by the enemies of the Revolution, referring to the issue of illegal departures for the United States, and urged all revolutionaries who were there to offset any action that might tarnish the image and feelings of our people. Giron-94 is already yielding its first political results, and on the field of operations, it will provide great surprises to those who might underestimate the defense and response capabilities of the Revolution.
