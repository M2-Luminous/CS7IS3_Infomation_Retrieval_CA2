Last year, between August and October, various coastal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions ferreted out 2984 smuggling cases, amounting to more than 900 yuan in value. Up to this point, sea and land-based pernicious smuggling activity had already been controlled to some degree, and China's open environment to the West and internal economic order were gradually being purified and strengthened. In a manner similar to the gratifying situation occurring all over the country with attacks on smuggling activity, Tibet's work in attacking smuggling has also achieved a phased success: First, a leading organ for attacking smuggling on a regional basis has been established, and in conducting special purpose attacks on smuggling, full play is being given to the core effect; second, a case involving a group using border passes to smuggle reactionary and obscene propaganda material, gold, cultural relics, rare wild animal skins, fur, and bones has been cracked, and the activity of a criminal group smuggling internally and outside the border has been controlled; third, market management has been strengthened, and groups smuggling goods such as automobiles have been investigated and controlled; fourth, inspections have been launched concerning enforcement of the law, and the establishment of anti-contraband teams has been strengthened; fifth, anti-smuggling education has been launched, and combined with Tibet's practical dissemination of "Customs Laws." However, we must note that anti-smuggling in Tibet is still a long-term and arduous task. In particular, because a portion of enterprise units participate in smuggling activity, there exists in the society a mistaken sense that smuggling will lead to riches, and the implementation details for Tibet carrying out national anti-smuggling legal statutes have not been fully perfected. Because the work awaits gradual strengthening, Tibet's struggle with anti-smuggling work also faces a very arduous task. We should note that attacking smuggling in reality is a serious political struggle between vast numbers of cadres and the broad masses, and an extremely small number of smugglers. The corrosive effect of rampant smuggling on staff and worker teams, the effect of the credit situation, and attacks on the normal management mechanisms are all substantial. In Tibet, the state has provided preferential policies for foreign trade, and any smuggling activity in fact infringes on the interests of the autonomous region; any illegal profit seeking activity, objectively speaking, is a forceful blow against normal lawabiding management and against our establishment of a socialist market economy. Attacking smuggling is not only a requirement for us to put in order and rectify the social and economic environment, and safeguard national interests, but is also a requirement for our safeguarding of the basic interests of the broad masses and striving for Tibet's long-term sustained development. Properly handling the anti-smuggling struggle requires reliance on responsibility being taken by party and government leadership at all levels, and at the same time requires the mobilization of the masses, and reliance on the masses, to jointly construct a steel great wall in the anti-smuggling struggle. Only in this manner will it be possible to create a healthy and stable environment for Tibet's reform and opening and economic development.
