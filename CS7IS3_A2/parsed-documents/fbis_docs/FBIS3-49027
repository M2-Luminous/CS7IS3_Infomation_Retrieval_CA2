There is no reason to change anything, Komarno Mayor Stefan Pasztor said in an interview with CTK. Problems remain and we need a joint stance of a large number of people. At the same time he assured that the meeting will be held in accordance with the law on petitions. Matica Slovenska [Slovak cultural institution] officials yesterday appealed for the meeting in Komarno to be cancelled. In their opinion, the meeting endangers the territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic. They also demanded that a law on the protection of the republic be adopted. Mikulas Duray reckons that it will be not possible to push through the demands of the Hungarian minority under the present government. However, he considers a Hungarian self-governing region, where minority Slovaks would enjoy the same status as do the Hungarians within the Slovak majority, on a reciprocal basis, to be a realistic long-term objective.
