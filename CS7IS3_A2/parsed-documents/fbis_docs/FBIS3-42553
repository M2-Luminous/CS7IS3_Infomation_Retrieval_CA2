We are, they conclude, in a period of minimal cometary activity and asteroid hazard because the last cometary shower caused by disturbance of the cometary cloud ended long ago, and the next such event will not occur for at least 10 million years. Nor are there at present any objects near the Sun that could cause such a shower. Finally, the unexpected and unpredictable cometoid activity described by Drobyshevskiy and resulting from an explosion of the Jovian moon Callisto is virtually impossible. At the same time, the statistically unpredictable fluctuation in asteroid hazard dictate that we refine our theoretical research of the problem and set up observation programs. The objective of the first stage of such research would be to move asteroid collisions from the ranks of random, unpredictable phenomena to the ranks of predictable, calculable events.
