For example, the record reflects advertising claims with respect to inhabitability (Guide 1(, 26 depictions of size or dimensions (Guide 2), 27 pictorial representations of features not included (Guide 3), 28 savings (guide 4), 29 guarantees (Guide 7), 30 and delivery and installation (Guide 9). 31 However, the Commission has no basis to believe that the advertising it has monitored is deceptive or unfair. 26 P924219, B&hyph;6, p. 5. 27 P924219, B&hyph;5, pp. 7&hyph;9, 12&hyph;17, 21&hyph;39. 28 Id., p. 22. 29 P924219, B&hyph;6, p. 1. 30 P924219, B&hyph;5, pp. 10, 17, 20. 31 P924219, B&hyph;6, pp. 1&hyph;2. IV. Evidence of Unlawful Practices In order to obtain some evidence relating to the prevalence of the unfair or deceptive practices in the pertinent industry staff interviewed the responsible heads of the housing code authorities of California, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia. 32 One interviewee, Bill Connolly, the Director of the Division of Codes and Standards in the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, is also the present chairman of the Industrialized Building Commission (the ``IBC''), the commissioners of which comprise the housing code enforcement authorities of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Minnesota. 33 Additionally, staff interviewed representatives of the National Foundation of Manufactured Home Owners and the American Association of Retired Persons. 34 32 Staff interviewed Richard Conrad, Executive Director, California Building Standards Commission; Larry Jordan, Planning Manager, Department of Community Affairs, Codes and Standards Section, Florida Division of Housing and Community Development; Jim Hannah, Director, Codes Administration, Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development; Jim Phillips, Director, Department of Manufactured Housing, Recreational Vehicles and Modular Units, Missouri Public Service Commission; Bill Connolly, Director, Division of Codes and Standards, New Jersey Department of Community Affairs; Jim Martin, Manager of Rules, Policies and Codes Section, Policies and Standards Division, Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation; and Curtis McGiver, Associate Director for Building Regulations, Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development. Report of Interviews by Joel Brewer, P 924219, B&hyph;12, pp. 2&hyph;5 (July 20&hyph;22, 1994). 33 Id. , pp. 1, 5. At this time the IBC is comprised of the three states that have subscribed to an interstate compact on building code standards for manufactured housing (often referred to by code enforcement authorities as ``industrialized'' residential housing). The purpose of the IBC is to facilitate the interstate sale of factory-built housing by developing uniform housing code requirements in the subscribing states. Because it is anticipated that other states will join the IBC over time, the IBC has a Rules Development Committee to develop uniform codes to which most states could eventually subscribe. In order to assure the acceptability of the rules to other states, several state housing code officials from states other than the three Commission states ( e.g. , Maryland and Virginia) represent them on the Rules Development Committee. 34 Staff interviewed Leonard Wehrman, Vice President, National Foundation of Manufactured Home Owners; and George Gaberlavage, Senior Analyst, American Association of Retired Persons. Id. , pp. 1, 5&hyph;6. Mr. Wehrman made no specific comments, and instead advised staff to contact state housing code officials. Mr. Gaberlavage said that he believed that the best source of information on the subject of problems with factory-built housing is the state housing code authorities. According to Mr. Connolly, approximately 35 states have adopted codes providing for in-factory approval of closed construction residential structures (primarily modular housing). These codes contemplate a two-step process: (1) Plan review, which occurs in the state, and (2) inspections in the plant, including out-of-state plants. Almost universally, the states contract with third parties to conduct the out-of-state in-plant inspections. For open construction factory-built buildings ( i.e. , most panelized or all pre-cut housing), normally the local code enforcement authority will inspect the work as it is assembled. As a result of these state and local enforcement activities, the sorts of problems consumers ordinarily will encounter from factory-built housing almost exclusively consist of cosmetic or workmanship problems, or problems arising in mounting the housing at the site. The other housing code authoritues agreed. 35 Such problems are not covered by the Guides. 35 Id. pp. 2&hyph;5. Although the state officials were unanimous in the view that the states afford consumers protection against the kinds of harms addressed by the Guides, Mr. Connolly advised that finding and preventing code violations for open factory-built structures depends on the existence of local code authorities. Although local code authorities exist in the most populous regions of the country, in sparsely populated area that is generally not the case. However, he could not tell how serious or widespread the problems were with factory-built housing in such areas. Staff's review indicates that, although relevant advertising exists and the affected industry is significant, the unlawful practices addressed by the Guides do not appear to be widespread and, to the extent they may exist, state or local housing code enforcement authorities can appropriately handle such problems. Although some problems of the sorts addressed by the Guides may arise in sparsely populated areas of the country where there are no local housing code authorities to inspect open construction factory-built buildings as they are assembled, the Commission has no reason to believe these problems are significant or involve significant consumer harm. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to repeal the Guides. (Authority: 15 U.S.C. 41&hyph;58.) List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 230 Advertising, Factory-built homes, Trade practices.
