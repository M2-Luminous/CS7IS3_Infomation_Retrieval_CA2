FR940407-2-00137 FR940407-2-00071 Exceptions may be made to this policy on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Office of Defense Trade Controls. However, such an exception would be granted only after a full review of all circumstances, paying particular attention to the following factors: Whether an exception is warranted by overriding U.S. foreign policy or national security interests; whether an exception would further law enforcement concerns; and, whether other compelling circumstances exist which are consistent with the foreign policy or national security interests of the United States, and which do not conflict with law enforcement concerns. A person named in an indictment for an AECA-related violation may submit a written request for reconsideration of the suspension/denial decision to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such request for reconsideration should be supported by evidence of remedial measures taken to prevent future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR and other pertinent documented information showing that the person would not be a risk for future violations of the AECA and/or the ITAR. The Office of Defense Trade Controls will evaluate the submission in consultation with, inter alia, the Departments of Treasury, Justice, and other necessary agencies. After a decision on the request for reconsideration has been rendered by the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs, the requester will be notified whether the exception has been granted. Dated: February 24, 1994. Robert L. Gallucci, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State.
