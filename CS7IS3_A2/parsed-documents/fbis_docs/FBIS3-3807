The pamphlets featured a report published in the US magazine THE EARTH TIMES which came out in support of Taiwan's environmental protection programs and raised the ire of British Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) official Peter Knights. Knights argued that the report, which quoted a Taiwan Government official as saying the EIA has misrepresented Taiwan's trade in endangered species parts, was written without consultations with his organization. Knights added that the EIA would call for sanctions against Taiwan for its alleged trade in rhino horns and tiger parts during the forthcoming CITES Standing Committee meeting. Li San-wei, deputy director of the Taiwan Council of Agriculture's Forestry Department and leader of the Taiwan delegation to the CITES regional meeting, said that the threats by EIA will increase the pressure on Taiwan. The CITES Asian region meeting opened in Jerusalem on March 15. It will be followed by a CITES Standing Committee meeting in Geneva on March 21 during which Standing Committee members will vote on whether to impose sanctions against Taiwan and other countries.
