Speaking to journalists following a session of talks that ended early this morning in Cairo, Sha'th said the talks would resume on Tuesday [29 Mar] following consultations by the two delegations in Tunisia and Israel. General Amnon Shahaq, who heads the Israeli delegation to the talks, speaking following a 14-hour session of talks, said a joint document was formulated but there are still several points of disagreement. PLO sources last night said that Israel agreed in principle to a limited presence of international observers and the operation of joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols in Hebron. [In a related report, Cairo MENA in Arabic at 0755 GMT on 25 March cites Dr. Sha'th as saying: "Considerable progress took place in the negotiations with the Israelis over the past two days in Cairo but there are still some points that need to be worked out." [The same MENA report adds: "Sources close to the negotiations say that Israel has agreed to the deployment of 100 Norwegian observers armed with light weapons in Hebron."]
