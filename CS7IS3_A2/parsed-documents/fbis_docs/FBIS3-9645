It seems that these two deputies are at the same time working to form a typically right-wing party and a coalition of right-wing forces, which may be the largest coalition in the next elections. The party for which Baleta and Kalakula are working has its natural roots in the National Front [Balli Kombetar], in Legality, and in the Property With Justice Association. Because the total restitution of property lies at the foundation of its program, it would be natural for this still unregistered party to form a coalition with the Republican Party, whose chairman did not hestitate to take part in a meeting in Shkoder with the "PD's right-wing outcasts," although he has still not publicly repudiated the old distinctly fading Republican-Social Democrat-PD coalition. An increasing rapprochement is also noticeable with the Cameria Association and the Association of Former Victims of Political Persecution, with whose representatives the two deputies meet, it seems, not merely to drink coffee. This is shown by the recent visit to Johannesburg by the right-wing deputies and Kurt Kola, chairman of the Association of the Former Victims of Persecution. But what is the right launching on the Albanian political market? Parliamentary deputy and former Agriculture Minister Kalakula said in an interview published in ALEANCA: "We are for the immediate and unconditional restoration of all property to its legitimate owners. "We are for the privatization of enterprises, especially in agriculture, forestry, construction, the textile industry, the food-processing industry, tourism, etc. "We wish to establish new criteria for privatization, substantially favoring former owners, victims of political persecution, and employees, who will be given priority in the granting of small and medium enterprises on delayed repayment terms. "It is not only the proprietors that have been left disappointed," Kalakula continued in his interview. So have the hundreds of thousands of former victims of persecution, who in fact also include the proprietors, who have also received nothing of what belonged to them. These too were promised "vouchers." There are also hundreds and thousands of unemployed workers and intellectuals on welfare. The people's strongest anticommunist hopes lie here." [no opening quotation mark as published] It is precisely among these strata that the Albanian right hopes to gain support. "I want to stress that these people are watching me, not as an individual, but because of the position that I uphold, which it seems to me reflects their aspirations." Moreover, the right has come out clearly in favor of a nationalist policy, which is the ideological rallying point of the parties with whom they wish to form a coalition. Nevertheless, it must be said that this still undeclared right-wing front needs to create a single center that will have the strength and credibility to attract the fringe, which is often still within the PD's orbit. It seems that the two deputies are not strong enough to do this, and one of them cannot enjoy the total confidence of this home-grown right for the simple reason that he was once Hoxha's representative in the glass palace of the United Nations. In this resepct, the weightiest and most suitable figure, even though he does not speak good Albanian, remains Leka Zogu, whose political baggage contains nothing but the successes and failures of his father Ahmet [King Zog]. The fact that the heir to the royal throne himself is making overtures to the right is shown by the invitation to visit South Africa that Leka extended to its representatives. This also explains the current Albanian authorities' fear of allowing him to enter Albania. Thus, the heir to the throne, if he is allowed into Albania, may also be carrying the little banner of the Albanian right as well as the great flag of the monarch of the ethnic territories. This may be the aim of the home-grown Albanian right: to grow strong under the royal wing.
