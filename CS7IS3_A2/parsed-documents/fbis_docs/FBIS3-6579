Song Yong-tae, the South's chief delegate to the just-suspended inter-Korean working-level talks, said in a statement that Seoul remains committed to resolving the North Korean nuclear dispute peacefully. "The door to dialogue remains open. We strongly urge the North to return to a sincere and rightful posture and respond favorably to efforts to resume South-North dialogue, aware of the internal and external conditions that exist," Song said. He said North Korea was amply demonstrating its bellicosity by resorting to Cold-War-type actions that fan confusion in the South, trying to subvert the South's system by slandering its top leader and agitating South Koreans to struggle against their government. Song said that if Pyongyang is truly interested in holding talks with the United States, it should be more sincere in respecting international order and realizing the proposed exchange of special envoys. He noted that the South had time and again shown its willingness to help the North improve relations with Seoul's allies if Pyongyang worked to resolve the nuclear issue. North Korea is trying to blame the South for the recent breakdown of working-level talks in an attempt to escape international suspicions about its nuclear program, Song said.
