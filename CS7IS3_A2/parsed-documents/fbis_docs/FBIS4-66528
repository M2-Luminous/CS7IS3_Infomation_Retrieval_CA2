However, the Pakistani rulers have rejected this proposal and have asked for some clarification which perhaps will be given during the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strob Talbot's visit to Islamabad. Pakistan's foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ali, maintains that his country will not sign that agreement unilaterally, and that the United States is aware that Pakistan will accept the NPT only when India is willing to sign it along with Pakistan. The truth is that both India and Pakistan have very different reasons for not signing the NPT. India has made it clear that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and it has no desire to make nuclear weapons. As for the NPT, it mostly protects the interests of nations that already have huge arsenals of nuclear weapons. Therefore, it is impossible for India to sign such a biased document. Meanwhile, Pakistan has avoided signing the NPT considering India a major danger to itself. In the context of the new U.S. proposal tied to the supply of F-16 planes, Pakistan has repeated the same old rhetoric that it cannot jeopardize its security just to get 38 F-16 planes. The fact is that the Pakistani rulers have tied their nuclear program to the resolution of the Jammu-Kashmir issue. They say that this issue has endangered the peace and stability of this region, and they do not want to tie their hands by signing the NPT while this issue is not resolved. This attitude of Pakistani rulers has unmasked their unholy designs to the whole world. It is avoiding signing the NPT by joining it to the Kashmir issue, and is secretly attaining nuclear capability with Chinese help. It has also been learned that Pakistan has the capability to make 12 bombs as powerful as were dropped on Hiroshima. It is not possible that the Clinton administration is not aware of it. Islamabad has joined its nuclear program with terrorist activities and all these activities are aimed against India. The U.S. government had at one time proposed including Pakistan in the list of terrorist nations based on this report. However, he United States changed its plan saying that Pakistan's attitude has changed and it was expected that Pakistan will improve. However, instead of improving its attitude, Pakistan has increased anti-India activities and is fully involved in making nuclear weapons. We feel pity for the U.S. government which, instead of putting pressure on Pakistan to stop this program, has announced through one of its senior officials in Washington that if Pakistan suspends its nuclear program the United States will provide it with 38 F-16 planes costing $658 million. This is a paradox and shows the sly tricks of the nation that calls itself the greatest power in the world. It tells Pakistan to stop its nuclear program and at the same time offers to provide it with the dangerous F-16 war planes. Does not the Clinton administration know that if it provides F-16 planes in its efforts to stop nuclear proliferation in South Asia to end the danger of a nuclear war, then no one can stop the tension and weapon race in this region? India has insisted this to be the case repeatedly. Recently Home Minister Chavan informed the U.S. senators visiting New Delhi about India's fear that supplying Pakistan with F-16 planes despite the Pressler amendment will only increase tension in this region while we need to reduce it. If this still does not make sense to the American mind then its policy about South Asia becomes suspect. One reason for this belief and why this fear was strengthened is the advice given by the U.S. print media to India that it should support Clinton government's proposal under which it is giving F-16 planes to Pakistan in order to make it suspend its nuclear program. India's refusal to agree with this proposal and remaining adamant on its stand will be interpreted as hegemonic instead of desiring stability in the sub-continent. [passage omitted]
