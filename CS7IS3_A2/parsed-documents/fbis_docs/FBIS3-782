Addressing a news conference in Ventersdorp, he accused Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen of having betrayed the Afrikaner. By going to Parliament, Gen Viljoen would now go on to the paylist of African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela. Asked whether the AWB's hasty retreat from Mmabatho, during which it lost three men, did not dent the AWB's credibility, Mr Terreblanche replied: "I do not know how you can ask such a question. It is only because you don't have the facts and are not part of my people and my nation." He said the AWB lost only three men in Mmabatho while eight were wounded, compared to 50 dead and 280 injuries on the part of the Bophuthatswana security forces, and this pointed to a brilliant victory for the AWB. He was not sure whether there would be elections from April 26-28, because the country was headed for a revolution. Mr Terreblanche wanted to know how Gen Viljoen could secure a volkstaat [homeland] for the Afrikaner if he became part of a communist election. Speaking in the hot Ventersdorp town hall, and flanked by a row of AWB officers, he said Mr Mangope had been toppled because Gen Viljoen's forces could not handle the situation in Mmabatho after the AWB had been ordered out. The SADF [South African Defense Force] then moved in and handed over the control of Bophuthatswana to the ANC and the South African Communist Party. Mr Terreblanche said the Mmabatho events had been a communist plot, and he had been ordered out of the city because he would not have allowed the administration to fall to communists. He had been betrayed by communist elements in the Bophuthatswana and South African Government. "I fought the lot of them. They posed as loyal people to their own governments." There were heated exchanges with journalists during question time. Some journalists at the conference still bore black eyes sustained during encounters with rightwingers in Mmabatho. Mr Terreblanche denied that his forces shot dead any women in Mmabatho, saying such casualties should be ascribed to crossfire. Bophuthatswana's former minister of state and Freedom Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje had by now managed to give away two fatherlands, he said. He added that the AWB would consider rendering assistance to kwaZulu if such help was requested. South Africa was now close to confrontation and revolution, and the borders of the volkstaat would be drawn by the outcome of war. Mr Terreblanche said the Transvaal and [Orange] Free State, and northern Natal and Richards Bay would form part of the volkstaat, minus the homelands in these areas. President F W de Klerk could not count on the loyalty of the defence force if he wanted to use it against the rightwingers and the nation, and he would be unable to counter the African National Congress/SA Communist Party revolution. "We are heading for chaos, not an election. We are heading for a revolution, not peace and prosperity." Asked again whether the AWB had not retreated from Bophuthatswana with its tail between its legs, Mr Terreblanche said: "Ag please, don't you want to ask a real question." He accused the journalist who posed the question of being part and parcel of the communist conspiracy. Mr Terreblanche said dockets had been opened to investigate the public execution of two wounded AWB men in Mmabatho and the AWB would not rest until the guilty persons had been brought to court. A senior AWB officer said funeral arrangements for the three AWB dead had not yet been finalised.
