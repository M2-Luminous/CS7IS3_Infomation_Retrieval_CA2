Greece is, perhaps, the only country of the North Atlantic alliance which declared that it disagrees with the NATO decision, which was officially registered in its document, the ambassador said. He spoke at a meeting of Russian and Greek businessmen arranged at the Greek embassy in Moscow. The ambassador pointed out that if the bombardment and military intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina begin, none of the Balkan countries should take part in these operations. Turkey, for instance, declared its readiness to send combat aircraft and take part in possible military operations which might entail more serious consequences, the ambassador said. The situation in former Yugoslavia and issues of Russo-Greek bilateral relations and cooperation between the European Union and Russia will be in the focus of attention during Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's one-day visit to Athens scheduled on February 18, the ambassador said. The Russian foreign minister will have talks with the Greek government and members of the so-called EC trio consisting of heads of foreign ministries of the former, future and present chairman of the European Union - Belgium, Germany and Greece, respectively. According to the ambassador, the development of Russo-Greek relations goes ahead, especially following Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Greece. However, there was some stalemate in these relations because of parliamentary elections held in the two countries. However, Russo-Greek agreements will be given a new impetus by visits to Moscow by the Greek foreign, economics, defence and culture ministers and representatives of other departments. Recently, new possibilities for the development of bilateral relations appeared, the ambassador added. A few days ago a delegation of the greek olympic airways company arrived in Moscow to discuss with their Russian colleagues the possibilities for the soonest possible opening of direct air routes connecting the capitals of both countries. A delegation of the Greek Tourist Organisation (ZOT) is expected to visit Moscow soon to prepare expositions of Greek companies organising trips to Greece. A forum of Greek and Russian entrepreneurs is expected to be held in Moscow to discuss ways for further development of bilateral cooperation.
