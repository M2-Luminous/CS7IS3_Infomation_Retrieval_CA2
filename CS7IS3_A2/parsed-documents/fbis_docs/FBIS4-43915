The federal counselor approved an extensive trade embargo and restrictions in the field of air and maritime transportation. These measures add up to those already taken by Switzerland on 30 June 1993. They enter into force on Thursday [23 June]. In addition, the individuals who took part in the 1991 coup d'etat as well as their relatives will not be allowed to enter Switzerland until further notice. This restriction also applies to the members of the government in power since 1991 and to the members of the Haitian police and Armed Forces. In a joint communique released on Thursday, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Department of Public Economy announced that a visa would be mandatory for the holders of diplomatic or special passports. The Swiss trade embargo against Haiti now applies to all imports and exports between Switzerland and Haiti. However, medicines, food stuffs, and publications such as newspapers, periodicals, or books are excluded. Bern has been banning the sale or the export of weapons, oil, and oil products for one year already. Swiss ships are no longer allowed to navigate in Haitian waters and the use of the Swiss or Haitian airspace by aircraft [not specified] is prohibited. This measure does not apply to international flights. The freeze on the funds and capital goods of the junta in power is extended. This measure also applies to the assets of individuals who are under the direct or indirect control of the military government. [passage omitted]
