Lovrenovic; place and date not given: "The Federation Is `Stalingrad' for a Greater Serbia"] [Text] It was difficult to reach Mr. Ejup Ganic after his election, although he wanted to keep his promise and give an interview for VECERNJI LIST, a promise he gave before the election. He found the time for this interview after the session of the general assembly and before the beginning of a new round of Geneva negotiations. [Lovrenovic] What are your first impressions as the vice chairman of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina? What are your first tasks and duties? [Ganic] There is a lot of work, but there is much enthusiasm and cooperation, too. Our work is very responsible. I think that we are at a turning point in history now. This is a special moment, and we must not miss this chance. Cooperation With Zubak [Lovrenovic] You have been elected together with Mr. Zubak. What is the cooperation between the president and the vice president immediately after the election like? [Ganic] The cooperation is functioning quite normally. We met in Sarajevo a month ago, but we could talk for only 10 minutes. Then we worked together during the Vienna negotiations for three or four days. Our cooperation was very intense there. We both participated in the talks that took place in France, too. This is normal since we are both working on the same tasks. I can say that our contacts have always been professional, we have always reached agreement on things that had to be agreed upon. We have similar methods of work, so that I hope that we shall be able to achieve results in the interests of both the Muslim and the Croatian population in the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, naturally, to the benefit of the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Lovrenovic] There were no problems with the election, but have you perhaps noticed a certain resistance toward the Federation? [Ganic] There is a long and very steep path before us. It will be difficult, but the agreement on the Federation is very important, so that certain groups of people or individuals who oppose it should be given no powers whatsoever to thwart this historic process. I would like to repeat that the Federation is "Stalingrad" for a greater Serbia. Serbian Annexation Policy Stopped [Lovrenovic] Why do you think that this will be a turning point in the relations with the Serbs? [Ganic] This is a concept that will enable Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are internationally recognized, to retain their borders. It will also stop the Serbian annexation policy. This is something that has repeated itself every 20 years in the Balkans. Territories and properties have been seized little by little, but we shall bring an end to this policy. Apart from that, we would like to find a formula for a new military balance. The Federation is opening new possibilities for both Bosnia and Croatia. We are not conspiring against anybody, this is only a healthy and logical concept since both nations have a tendency toward the Western type of democracy. They have their historical roots in this area, they are close to the Western civilization character. [Lovrenovic] Does this mean that you support a confederation with Croatia? After you become the president of the Federation, according to the rotation principle, will you try to bring this concept into existence? [Ganic] Bosnia has always supported a confederation with Croatia. Croatia will more or less determine the scope of the confederation agreement. It has the sea, we have electrical energy, they have more food. There is compatibility between our economies and communications. We have similar friends in the world. There is much logic behind this. We are not doing anything behind anybody's back. Our cooperation is the result of democratic processes that are going on in Europe, or rather of the integration of economic interests. We shall try to unite our interests with the Croatian. [Lovrenovic] There were rumors in Sarajevo during the session of the assembly that the Washington agreements were opposed by the ruling party, the SDA [Party of Democratic Action], which is also your party. [Ganic] There was no resistance to these agreements. People just asked certain questions. The Federation is the best possibility of saving Bosnia-Herzegovina as an entity. We hope to see its revival in every part of our territory. We do not want to change its borders and we want to reduce those Serbs who are not loyal to the limits they are entitled to. In other words there were only questions about what, how, where, how much, who supported it etc., but there was no resistance. Our party [SDA] is not homogeneous, there are groups and individuals who always ask questions and have contradictory opinions. Rotation Every Six Months [Lovrenovic] Some time ago the SDA proposed that Mr. Izetbegovic should be the president of the Federation, but this proposal was withdrawn later on and you were subsequently proposed for that function. Is this true? [Ganic] The SDA Executive Committee made that proposal without having consulted Mr. Izetbegovic. In the negotiations with Croatia we discussed all issues, though. Borders, cantons, the government, as well as the functions of the president and the vice president. During the negotiations Mr. Izetbegovic himself proposed making the concession to the Croatian people to appoint a Croatian national as first president of the Federation, although we have a larger population. The proposal that I should run for the position of vice chairman came later on. Mr. Izetbegovic made these proposals because is the party leader. Apart from that, by appointing me vice president of the Federation, he distributed the burden of responsibility to two persons. Later on we agreed on the six-month rotation principle. The most important thing, however, is that the Parliament, the government, the president and the vice chairman cooperate. I think that this is a good solution. The fact that the first Federation president is Croatian is important, too. [Lovrenovic] Will you automatically become president in six months, or...? [Ganic] According to the Vienna agreement there should automatically be a change after six months. I am not insisting on my election to the position of the president of the Federation. It is more important that we complete everything we started in these six months, the elections and peace negotiations; then we can elect a new president, too. Izetbegovic's Deputy [Lovrenovic] Are you a member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] I had, more or less, the function of Mr. Izetbegovic's deputy during his journeys. It will be a useful experience for the work as the Federation vice president. I would like to point out that the Federation is a special task. We have to organize the life in its Muslim part. Our most important task is to make official authorities more efficient and to establish traffic communications and economic relations. Apart from that, we have to finally close the ditches between the Croatian Defense Council and the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We should enable our people to return to their homes. The Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina represents the internationally recognized state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I do not see any problems here. [Lovrenovic] Is it not difficult to accept two presidencies, two parliaments, and two governments? [Ganic] These are not two states, though. The whole state belongs to us, only certain parts of it are occupied. The task of the Parliament, the president and the vice president will be to make the Federation function. In the process of personnel structure and diplomatic network development it will be important that the Federation starts functioning as soon as possible. We must send those people into the diplomatic service who will be able to make the biggest contribution to the development of our Federation. The more powerful the Federation is, the more powerful will be our capacity to defend ourselves. I think that we shall have to agree on the distribution of ambassadors' posts. Appointment of Ambassadors [Lovrenovic] Can you give me an example of who will be appointed ambassador to Great Britain and France? Will you and Mr. Zubak appoint these people, or the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] As long as we are in a state of war, the state has to be represented by the Presidency, but Mr. Zubak and I shall make proposals about who should be appointed ambassador. [Lovrenovic] Does this mean that the foreign policy will remain within the scope of work of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] Yes, but this is because the Presidency is an internationally recognized subject. Mr. Zubak and I shall certainly have to agree on where a representative of the Croatian people will be posted. [Lovrenovic] This means that the Federation is not a legal subject according to international law and that it cannot have diplomatic and consular representatives. [Ganic] It is not a legal subject according to international law. Neither does it have its representatives. Its representatives are the representatives of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is an internationally recognized state. [Lovrenovic] You do not believe in a new Yugoslav state, but you have invited the Serbs to stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Does this mean that you believe in their coexistence in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] Yes. We have invited them to stay so that they can learn to respect human rights. Will the Serbs Stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Lovrenovic] Do you really think they will stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ganic] We shall not allow the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina to change. We shall not interfere with the Serbian policy in those regions where they have a majority, but we shall oppose a greater Serbia. We shall oppose the annexation of our territory, too. They cannot create a greater Serbia unless they seize the territory in which the Muslims and the Croats are the major population. [Lovrenovic] You invited the Serbs to join the federation before the election.... [Ganic] I would like to point out that I have never done anything against Serbia. I have always had fair relations toward the Serbs and have helped those Serbs who have supported Bosnia. From the session of the parliament during the election I sent a political message to the Serbs. [Lovrenovic] Do you believe that the Federation will soon start functioning in the full meaning of that word? [Ganic] I do, otherwise I would not have started working on that project. I usually refuse projects that cannot be implemented since I am very analytical. I make my decisions based on my personal attitude and relevant political circumstances, I never get involved in matters that have no chance. [Box, p 7] No "Common Apartment" [Lovrenovic] Will "the mixed cantons," that were agreed on in Vienna, make the Federation stronger, or will they become a "powder keg?" [Ganic] I think they will make the Federation stronger. There is no reason why they should become a "powder keg." [Lovrenovic] Will they not be like a "common apartment?" [Ganic] There is no "common apartment" here. We shall have common roads, rivers, electric power plants, but our estates will be divided. [Box, p 7] I Was the First To Go to Ravno [Lovrenovic] You have given several interviews so far, one of which -- the one published in GLOBUS -- was interpreted as anti-Croatian. [Ganic] Some papers are full of fantasy. You should follow my attitudes, my publications, my statements for CNN and other television stations. You should forget compiled interviews I have never given to anybody. [Lovrenovic] Have you given an interview to Mr. Brljevic from GLOBUS? [Ganic] I gave him an interview some time ago, but he made several interviews later on, without having interviewed me. He made compilations and invented things. GLOBUS tends to invent certain things. I am a serious politician, though. I have presented my political attitudes in the 60 articles I have published so far, so that it can be proved that I have been making a consistent policy toward the Croatian people since the very beginning. I hope that you can remember that I was the first one to go to Ravno. I have visited the whole of Herzegovina and said what was good and what was bad there. I have been very consistent. The interview in GLOBUS was a cheap campaign against me without argument. [Box, p 7] Sandzak Is a Part of Bosnia [Lovrenovic] You were reproached for having declared yourself a Yugoslav before, alluding to your birthplace. [Ganic] Everybody is born somewhere. Apart from that, Sandzak is a part of Bosnia. The first amputation made at the Berlin Congress harmed Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the Muslims remained there. I am a Muslim to the same extent as someone who was born in Sarajevo. My birthplace is completely irrelevant in this context. On the other hand, I have to say that the Muslims were very loyal to the former Yugoslavia. We even tried to save that state, but since Milosevic wanted to create a greater Serbia, our love disappeared. I had a pro-Yugoslav orientation during the time Yugoslavia existed, I supported a democratic Yugoslavia, like many other Muslims, but I could not support a "Serboslavia." What is more, I opposed that kind of Yugoslavia. I was the first to write articles about the intentions of the Yugoslav People's Army, which caused political discussions. [Lovrenovic] Would you support a democratic Yugoslavia today -- an option offered by certain Western circles? [Ganic] I do not think that Serbia could adapt to it. The change was too big. Even the opposition in Serbia uses nationalism as the only political platform. I think that it is an illusion to speak about a new Yugoslavia.
