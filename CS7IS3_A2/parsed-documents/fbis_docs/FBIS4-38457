A group of Russian state Duma deputies are in Azerbaijan to study prospects for their participation in settling the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict and boosting relations between the two countries. Nikolay Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, stressed that cessation of hostilities in the war zone is the major prerequisite for normalising relations. This opinion was shared by Vyacheslav Lyubimov, deputy chairman of the Committee for Agrarian Policy. He pointed out that the way to peace lies through negotiations and termination of all hostilities. Aliyev praised Russia's role in settling the conflict and emphasised that its mediatory role will bring positive results only if Russian people receive true information about what is happening in Azerbaijan and the region. He called for restoring all ties between the two countries which were severed after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in December 1991. Speaking about the position of the Russian-speaking population in the republic, Aliyev said that despite problems the general attitude toward them has always been favourable and good. He believes this provides a good basis for strengthening bilateral relations. The Russian delegation also met with Azerbaijani Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev and representatives of the Russian community in Baku.
