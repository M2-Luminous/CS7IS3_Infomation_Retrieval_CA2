Introducing the communication Mr. Flynn said that "drug addiction and drug trafficking constitute a major threat to the citizens of Europe. This threat demands a coordinated response by the Community and the member states. This document provides not only a framework for the Union's future action to combat drugs but also an integrated action plan." The Treaty on European Union provides a new framework for combatting drugs which considerably strengthens the Community's powers and enhances cooperation between member states. The Treaty offers new possibilities to consolidate existing Community achievements and promote the further development of union-wide strategies. The prevention of drug dependence and the fight against drugs are specifically mentioned in the provisions introduced by the Treaty on public health and cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs. The Commission wants to ensure that this new legal basis for action is exploited to the full in order to promote the highest possible level of cooperation and coordination. This will mean that the drugs scourge is tackled in the most comprehensive and effective way. Commissioner Flynn pointed out that in line with the wishes expressed by the Brussels European Council of 10 and 11 December 1993, the action plan provides a new framework for a drug control strategy covering three key elements: - prevention of drug dependency - reduction of drug trafficking, and - action at the international level. Each of these key elements is examined in the communication. Measures proposed within the framework of the new union action plan are designed to consolidate existing Community achievements in these fields and take advantage of new possibilities opened up by the Treaty on European Union in the fields of public health (Article 129), common foreign and security policy (Title V), and cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs (Title VI). The communication also highlights the importance of coordinating anti-drug measures at national level and within the Union as a whole in order to enhance the overall coherence of the Union's actions. Furthermore, in line with the emphasis given to the fight against drugs within the Union, drugs had been singled out as a priority of the common foreign and security policy. Considering the heavy impact of the drugs problem on the political and socio-economic development of developing countries, drug control will be given a stronger emphasis in political discussions with developing countries including ACP states. The action plan will also be supplemented shortly by a further and more detailed communication to the Council and Parliament concerning Community action in the field of drug dependence under Article 129 with a proposal for a decision on a programme of Community action in that field. Commissioner Flynn expressed the view that the action plan "will provide an effective framework for the Union to fight against drugs and drug dependence in the foreseeable future." [passage omitted]
