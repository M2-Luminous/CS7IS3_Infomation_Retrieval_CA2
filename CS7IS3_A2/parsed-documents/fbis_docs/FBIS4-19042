The difficult part is about to begin. Not that his achievement thus far has been easy. The intransigence and deviousness of the combatants defeated both previous UN commanders in Bosnia, Generals Morillon and Briquemont. No doubt the warring parties, especially the Serbs, thought they could frustrate and dispirit General Rose also. His skill in playing to such strengths as he has had -- some high-quality troops and the authority to use air power in their defence under UN Resolution 836 -- has outwitted them. Looking back, it will be recognised that his manipulation of those strengths amounts to one of the most cunning military-diplomatic offensives ever mounted in the history of UN peacekeeping and peacemaking. The war-weariness of the combatants has also worked in his favour. The Serbs, again in particular, had not only reached but passed what Clausewitz called "the culminating point of the offensive." They had captured more of Bosnia than they could ever hope to populate, knew that they could neither occupy nor partition Sarajevo, and were suffering casualties, and international odium, for no purpose. General Rose's determination to bring their bombardment of Sarajevo to an end may have offered them an escape from an impasse. The end of the Sarajevo siege has not meant, however, the end of the war. It has merely shifted its focus. Colonel Edward Cowan, who was once the British military attache in former Yugoslavia, said yesterday that it opened the way to the next set of strategic imperatives. "The Serbs were always determined to clear out the eastern enclaves (Gorazde, Srebrenica and Zepa), and the Muslims were equally determined to win back that Muslim land on the western bank of the River Drina." In recent months the Muslims have improved both their military situation and capabilities. The balance of advantage around the eastern enclaves nevertheless rests with the Bosnian Serbs. There they are far closer to Serbia proper than they were at Sarajevo, while immediately across the Drina lie a concentration of Serbian arms-manufacturing centres at Cacak, Kraljevo and Krusevac, all on the road running directly to Gorazde through Visegrad. The Bosnian Serbs were left 80,000 tons of shells at the start of the war. Even if that stock is now heavily depleted, it can be replenished directly from the factories across the Drina. UN observers have reported that much of the Bosnian Serbs' artillery withdrawn from Sarajevo has been repositioned around Gorazde, where they have also just advanced their positions, shortened the Muslim's defensive perimeter, and seized high ground from which to overlook the city centre. Gorazde is filling with refugees driven in terror from their homes in the surrounding villages. There is every sign that a siege as horrible as that of Sarajevo is about to begin but with the Serbs better placed to bring it to a conclusion on their terms. The blame for that rests partly with the United States. I do not share the view that it is under any obligation to send ground troops to former Yugoslavia. It already does most of the world's policing, and if the Europeans, who have many more men under arms, cannot find the will and means to mount an effective intervention, their pretensions to unity for any purpose except the protection of their domestic markets are contemptibly hollow. Moreover, it is generally overlooked that the two effective UN air strikes thus far mounted were by American aircraft. Nevertheless, President Clinton's recent reiterations of his refusal to commit ground troops, echoed by his Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, though issued for domestic reasons, have weakened General Rose's ability to utter threats. How, then, might he play the next round? What he has been doing so far is to commit his UN troops to carry out tasks that hamper the Serb strategy. He first employed them much more aggressively as aid convoy guards, challenging the Serbs to deny passage by force if they dared. They dared not. Then at Sarajevo he threatened air strikes if they dared to keep their artillery in place. They dared not. At Gorazde he has committed special forces to identify and illuminate Serbian artillery positions so that they can be hit by air strikes, as they now have been. The Bosnian Serbs are known to be badly frightened by air power, which they lack, and thus far General Rose's strategy has worked effectively. From this point on, however, the game of dare becomes more fraught. Because special forces have to see a target in order to illuminate it for aircraft, they run the risk of being seen by the enemy. Indeed, they run the risk of being deliberately hunted down. General Rose, a special forces officer of great experience, knows that better than anyone. At least one of his target indication officers was found and killed in the Falklands in exactly that way. He is therefore faced with the dilemma of finding troops to protect his target indicators, when his chief problem is that he is using target indicators because he does not have enough troops to protect the Muslims in the eastern enclaves in the first place. If there is no such thing as a free lunch, there is no such thing as a cheap war, either. General Rose is poised on the brink of escalation exactly as the Americans were in Vietnam in 1965. Then their team of 17,000 "advisers" -- there are 15,000 UN troops in former Yugoslavia -- proved to be too few to bolster the South Vietnamese army. It may be that his UN force is too small to bolster the Bosnian Muslims' efforts to stand up to the Bosnian Serbs. America got into a big war in Vietnam in 1965. How can Europe steer itself away from enlarging its peacemaking endeavour in Bosnia? It has no will to commit more troops. The option of arming the Bosnian Muslims remains a recipe for greater horror: let those who advocate it recall that a million people died after arms were poured into Spain in 1936-38. We have to hope that General Rose can continue to out-dare the peacebreakers. Air strikes may have to be extended, perhaps against the bridges over the River Drina, perhaps against the Serbian complex of arms factories on the other side. The UN force has advantages the Bosnian Serbs will never possess, in signals intelligence, in target indication, in night-fighting capability, in special forces, and above all in air power. The Serbs, an observer of their military outlook recently observed, are "paranoid" about spies and special forces, which they believe are everywhere. They have a well-founded fear of UN aircraft. Let us hope that they take counsel of their fears and conclude that they lack the strength to put the UN force to a real test of strength. If they do not, the war in Bosnia may get nastier yet.
