Juraj Molnar, together with other foreign guests, sat in the presidium of the aforementioned World Slavic Congress where Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal Democrats, suggested setting up an East European community of Slavic peoples reaching from the Adriatic to the Kuriles. Pavol Hagyari, chairman of the Democratic Party, said that the participation of SNS Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar in Zhirinovskiy's party congress harms Slovakia's already bad reputation. He noted that this step is a clear indication of the political thinking of the highest representatives of the purified SNS and its closest partner, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Ivan Duris, chairman of the Republican Party, said that, even if the participation of Molnar in the Moscow Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is an internal SNS affair, such contact with a nationalistically oriented party is unsuitable. He said that it appears that the Russian Liberal Democrats will cooperate with the SNS in the future. However, this is not a positive signal for foreign countries.
