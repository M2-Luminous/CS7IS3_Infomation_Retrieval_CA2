Participants earnestly implemented the guidelines laid down at the national work conference on the "vegetable basket," grain, cotton, and edible oil; analyzed the current situation by taking our province's reality into consideration; unified thinking; and studied ways to enhance macroeconomic regulation and control under the conditions of a market economy, to further deepen reform and improve the system of grain procurement and marketing, to protect and mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers for production, and to ensure a balance in the overall supply and demand of staple agricultural products including grain, edible oil, meat, and vegetables and market stability. Participants also advanced opinions and measures on ensuring the supply of vegetables and farm sideline products for urban and rural citizens. Li Zemin, secretary of the provincial CPC committee, and Wan Xueyan, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee and provincial governor, spoke at the meeting. Liu Xirong, member of the standing committee of the provincial CPC committee and vice governor, transmitted the guidelines laid down at the national work conference on the "vegetable basket." Chai Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC committee and vice governor, presided over the meeting. Liu Feng and Lu Zhanggong, deputy secretaries of the provincial CPC committee; Wang Qichao, member of the standing committee of the provincial CPC committee and secretary of the provincial commission for discipline inspection; Li Jinming, Xu Yunhong, and Zhang Youyu, members of the standing committee of the provincial CPC committee; and responsible comrades from the provincial people's congress and provincial CPPCC [Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference], attended the meeting. Li Zemin pointed out: Under the current conditions of developing a socialist market economy, reaching a common understanding over agriculture, particularly over the grain situation, is an issue of primary importance. Only by reaching a common understanding can we possibly adopt concrete and effective measures to deal with the new situation and problems that have emerged in the current grain production and distribution. It is necessary to fully affirm that the provincial CPC committee and government have made the correct decision to decontrol grain prices and to develop "high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficient" farming, and that their direction of reform is correct. At the same time, we should be aware of the new situation and problems in the current grain production and distribution. Seen from the development trend, some of the problems are quite serious and worrisome. To be sure, there are rational grounds for readjusting and reducing grain planting acreage. What worries us is that this trend continues to develop and expand. If grain planting acreage continues to shrink on a large scale this year, it will surely have a great impact, and produce serious consequences for maintaining a balance between grain supply and demand in our province. Weakened efforts and negligence in farming can be observed in the following: A large number of rice fields have been diverted for other use; agriculture has received insufficient investment; policies and technology to support grain production have failed to fall into place; and instability has grown among personnel involved in agricultural technology and management. These are ominous signs for agriculture, particularly for grain production stability. Therefore, leaders at various levels need to reach a common understanding and to unify thinking in the following areas. First, as the grain problem concerns the overall situation, we cannot afford to make light of it at any time. People rely on food to live. The grain issue concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood. Comrade Xiaoping warned us long ago that if any problems were to arise in the 1990's they would most likely occur in agriculture. In view of present conditions, it is of particular and important significance to recall Comrade Xiaoping's warning. Reform and development require stability. Agricultural stability, particularly grain production stability, directly affect economic and social stability. Increasing agricultural products' effective supply, doing a good job in grain work and on the "vegetable basket" project, and stabilizing food prices will create a good environment for our reform and development as well as for a good material foundation to solve various social contradictions. Our party and government leaders at all levels must fully recognize the importance of, and sense of urgency in doing a good job in grain work; attach a high degree of importance to the new situation and problems in the current grain production; and adopt concrete measures to solve them in a down-to-earth manner. Second, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of "basically seeking self-sufficiency in grain production and regulating the grain surplus and shortage" to solve the issue in Zhejiang. Practice over the years has proved that the above policy is in accord with Zhejiang's reality. Despite the recent lifting of control on grain procurement, marketing, and prices, and the development of a socialist market economy, we should still unwaveringly persist in the aforementioned policy. Historically, Zhejiang has been one of the provinces basically self-sufficient in grain. Although population increases and dwindling arable land in recent years have left a certain gap in grain supply and demand, Zhejiang has been able to basically maintain self-sufficiency. Our province has a huge population with limited arable land; it is frequently hit by natural disasters. The fact that Zhejiang's processing industry and export trade greatly depend on agriculture makes it even more necessary for our province to seek basic self- sufficiency in grain. Therefore, it is hoped that people across the province will form a consensus on this point. Third, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between regions and the entire province, and help form a concept that the entire province is an organic whole. Maintaining a balance in overall grain supply and demand helps maintain the overall situation of the entire province. By balance, we do not mean just achieving a balance in specific regions, but a balance encompassing the entire province. Differences in natural and geographical conditions objectively help shape a pattern that divides regions into grain-producing and consumption regions. For a long time, grain-producing zones have made great contributions to ensuring the supply of grain in the province. We still want to emphasize the need for major grain-producing regions to take the interests of the entire province into consideration and continue to undertake the task of supplying commodity grain. Of course, the province will attach great importance to protecting the benefits of grain-producing regions, give them support in terms of policy, funds, and materials, call on other trades and industries to support agriculture, and try its best to encourage the enthusiasm of farmers to grow grain. At the same time, efforts should be made to readjust regional interests and interests between urban and rural areas as well as to foster a closer link between production and marketing. Fourth, it is necessary to maintain the direction of reform and to devote efforts to deepen reform and improve reform measures. The province's fundamental purpose and point of departure for implementing the reform measure of decontrolling grain procurement and marketing prices last year, was to try every possible means to help farmers increase their income, which was made the basic guiding thought for rural work. We must be firm in belief and never waver from following the correct direction of rural reform. Reform itself did not bring forth the current crop of problems. Those problems are, generally speaking, ones met in the course of progress. The major cause of those problems lays in the failure to devise an adequate number of supplementary reform measures and is due to the delay in working out macroeconomic regulation and control measures. Enhancing macroeconomic regulation and control is not only indispensable for developing a socialist market economy but also important in deepening the current reform and improving reform measures. Enhancing macroeconomic regulation and control must be built on the foundation of respecting the law of value. To deal with and solve problems, we rely on economic policy and economic methods as much as possible. But under the present situation, in addition to adopting economic means, we need to rely on our political superiority and to bring this superiority into play, as well as on adopting some necessary administrative methods. Li Zemin said: The national work conference on the "vegetable basket" project, grain, cotton, and edible oil held by the State Council is of great guiding significance to our efforts in this year's agricultural production, and in planning the people's life in urban and rural areas centered on the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. We must correctly understand and conscientiously carry out the guidelines of the CPC Central Committee. To carry out the CPC Central Committee guidelines, our leading cadres at all levels must understand the guiding ideology in light of Zhejing's actual situation and the implementation of the various tasks put forward by last year's rural work conference convened by the provincial party committee. We must systematically study new situations and problems in production, circulation, consumption, and other fields, deepen our understanding, and work out tasks and policies for strengthening microeconomic regulation and control. First, we should make prompt and solid efforts from now on. At present, all tasks are heavy and the farming season is approaching. We must do our job ahead of the season. It is the crucial moment right now and we must take prompt initiative as early as possible. As long as we do a careful and solid job, we will finish our work in time. We must see to it that the tasks and policies are carried out around the Spring Festival so as to help peasants strengthen the management of spring crops and plant enough early rice. Second, we must concentrate our efforts on production and increase total production steadily. Our top priority is to make sure there is enough acreage of early rice, stop the trend of planting single-season rice in a vast area, and stabilize multiple crop indices. We must adhere to the triple cropping system because it tallies with the actual situation in Zhejiang, a province with a large population and limited land, as well as reflects Zhejiang's strong points in agriculture, especially in the production of grain and edible oil. Of course, we must vigorously explore new ways to implement the triple cropping system in line with local conditions. We must pay close attention to grain production and strive to stabilize the production of some important agricultural products such as cotton, vegetables, and pigs. We must develop new ways of thinking while promoting production. While providing guidance for tens of thousands households in developing production, we should pay even more attention to major households, production bases, and large-scale management. This should be the direction of our agriculture, in which our policy should provide preferential treatment. Third, we should solve current problems in light of establishing scientific and rational mechanisms, and promoting long-term development. To stabilize the current production and market supply, it is necessary to take some interim measures. However, these measures should be commensurate with long-term development, and the establishment and perfection of operationally flexible and effective mechanisms for macroeconomic regulation and control so that they can help establish a socialist market economic structure. We should focus attention on the establishment of a risk fund and storage system for grain and other major agricultural products and should draw up specific procedures for implementation. In circulation, we should continue to give full play to the role of grain, commercial, and supply and marketing departments as the major channels for circulation, but should gradually separate policy-oriented operations from business operations under two different systems. Moreover, we should further cultivate and develop markets, and strengthen the management and supervision of agricultural product markets. Fourth, we should make determined efforts to increase investment in agriculture according to the principle of "first ensuring enough food, and second, guaranteeing construction." Now, while arranging budgets and utilizing credits, governments at all levels must guarantee the people have enough food; they must adopt policies favorable to grain production and the "vegetable basket" project, and ensure this major task even at the expense of cutting back spending in other areas. Fifth, to maintain a basic balance between overall supply and demand, and inject vitality into the province's work as a whole, we should have clearly defined responsibilities and powers, introduce a system of responsibility, and assign macro-control and administrative responsibility to various levels. Li Zemin stressed: Party committees and government at all levels must pay great attention, and top leaders must assume overall charge and become personally involved -- herein lies the key to the success of work related to grain and vegetable production. Members of the party committees or government must, first of all, unify their thinking and enhance their sense of responsibility. Instead of merely relaying the assignments and policy measures issued by the State Council, the provincial party committee, and provincial government, the cities, prefectures, and counties must, in light of their respective realities, take firm, immediate action to implement them. They should take organizational steps by establishing a system of responsibility. The principal leaders of the provincial government shall take charge at the provincial level while the top leaders shall assume overall charge in their respective cities, prefectures, or counties. Local party committees must also conscientiously exercise supervision to ensure success. The provincial party committee and government are stressing once again: In pursuant of a directive from the central authorities, party committees and government of the prefectures, counties, townships, and villages must devote their main energy to agriculture and rural work. In the future, agricultural development and increases in peasant income will be given greater emphasis in evaluating the performance of a locality or a leading cadre. It is necessary to introduce some tangible, measurable targets and introduce a system of responsibility to ensure their implementation at different levels. Village and township cadres and agrotechnicians should be treated equally with others when it comes to recognition and material benefits, so that they will feel respected politically and not disadvantaged economically. It is necessary to change the style of work, go deep among the grass roots, and provide specific guidance. Leading comrades at all levels should go deep down, hear directly what the grass roots have to say and different views from various quarters, and have a good grasp of the real situation. A pressing matter of the moment is to make thorough and meticulous arrangements for the production of early rice. While intensifying ideological education and providing guidance, we should adopt economic, legal, or administrative measures to prevent land from being used for single cropping of rice. We should conscientiously publicize and implement the "Implementation Procedures of Zhejiang Province for Land Administration" amended and promulgated recently by the standing committee of the provincial people's congress, and firmly prevent farmlands from being left idle and unattended or illegally used for other purposes. All levels should assign one or more villages to a cadre whose job is to help the peasants prepare for and carry out spring farming. We should organize all trades and professions to provide support and better services for agriculture. Government departments must -- while transforming their functions -- continue to give top priority to agriculture; they must not think of only their own interests and therefore ignore providing support to agriculture. The provincial party committee and government have instructed all relevant departments to conduct a review of aid- agriculture work, firmly establish the idea of "three agricultures" [san nong si xiang 0005 6593 1835 1927], and provide good services in a down-to-earth manner. We should correctly guide public opinion and do a good job in publicity and providing guidance. Newspapers, radio, and television stations, and other media units should publicize party committee and government's plans by providing positive examples. Their coverage of stories related to grain, cotton, edible oil, and the "vegetable basket" should be helpful in reassuring the urban residents and in mobilizing the peasants' enthusiasm for production. We should, by way of fostering positive public opinion and propaganda, guide the vast number of cadres and people to contribute to promoting production and stabilizing the market and society. At the end of the meeting, Wan Xueyuan emphasized: We must earnestly relay and implement guidelines of the national conference on the "vegetable basket" and grain, cotton, and edible oil, and the provincial conference on grain. In consideration of the seasonal nature of agriculture, we must seize the opportune moment. First of all, we should unify our thinking, be fully aware of the importance of vegetables, grain, and edible oil, positively grasp and implement the guidelines of the central and provincial meetings, and pay attention to linking up new guidelines with relevant policies adopted in the past. We should send cadres to help the grass roots implement policies, conduct research, and sum up and publicize the experience of advanced units in order to advance this work on a larger scale. Present at the meeting were secretaries of the city and prefectural CPC committees, mayors, prefectural commissioners; party secretaries, mayors or heads of 29 major grain producing counties (cities); and officials of relevant provincial departments.
