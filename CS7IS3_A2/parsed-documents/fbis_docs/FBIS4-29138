FBIS4-29138 "dreas116_m_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 Thailand Phalang Tham Party Backs Reform Motion Phalang Tham Party Backs Reform Motion BK1606034894 Bangkok THE NATION in English 16 Jun 94 pp A1, A4 BK1606034894 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] The House of Representatives votes today on a controversial charter reform motion submitted by Phalang Tham [PTP] MPs, a crucial decision that could also decide the fate of hunger striker Chalat Worachat and the Chuan coalition. The motion was put on the House agenda after the rebel Phalang Tham MPs who sponsored it won overwhelming support yesterday from their party colleagues that rendered the pro-Chuan Phalang Tham leadership helpless. With promised support from the opposition, the motion is certain to be moved up the agenda for deliberation today. A New Aspiration Party source claimed last night Bunchu had told Chuan that he would resign as deputy prime minister to show political responsibility. The report could not be immediately confirmed, but Chuan called an urgent meeting of coalition leaders before midnight. Earlier, Bunchu was reported to have apologized to Chuan for the problems his party had caused the coalition. Chalat is expected to end his protest if the motion is passed. But its passage would be a major snub to Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, who has strongly opposed the "political intimidation" directed against his government. Opposition parties will be a decisive factor in the tumultuous test of strength between Chuan and political action groups pushing aggressively for a brand new constitution. The motion needs simple majority support from MPs attending today's House meeting. Chuan's Democrat Party yesterday rejected a face-saving compromise floated by some of the Phalang Tham MPs who sponsored the motion. They suggested that since the motion calls for the formation of a House committee to draft a new constitution, a committee already set up by Parliament President Marut Bunnak to study political reform should be entrusted with the job if the motion is passed. Democrat Spokesman Akhom Engchuan reiterated yesterday that the democrats would not vote for the notion. But he said whatever decision was made today by the House, Chalat "must respect it". Democrat whip Churin Laksanavisit added that it was unlikely Democrats MPs would be allowed a free vote. Government whips will meet today to finalize the coalition stand on the motion before it is debated. The opposition bloc has pledged considerable support for the motion although the second biggest party, Chat Phatthana, said it would vote for the motion only if the MPs who sponsored it can justify their action. A faction in the Chat Thai Party vowed to block the motion, so did the tiny Prachakon Thai Party. The opposition's announcement yesterday of its own motion seeking political reform strongly indicated the bloc "doesn't want to miss the democratic train," observers said. Social Action Secretary-General Chaloem Yubamrung said yesterday the opposition would vote for the Phalang Tham motion Prime Minister Chuan last night emphasized his belief the current pro-reform campaign was directed at his Democrat Party. But he was adamant that a House dissolution was not a way out of the crisis. Asked if he would dissolve the House if the opposition joined with Phalang Tham to pass the motion, Chuan said: "It (House dissolution) is still very far off." Chuan yesterday discussed the political situation with the Phalang Tham leadership, including Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian and Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, Communications Minister Winai Somphong, and Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset. An informed source said Democrat leaders who had been analysing the political situation believed a House dissolution was inevitable if the Phalang Tham motion was passed today. Chuan and other Democrat leaders went into a huddle with Phalang Tham leaders again at Parliament about 7 o'clock last night. A source who attended the meeting quoted Bunchu as expressing deep regret to Chuan for "having let Phalang Tham cause so many problems." Bunchu also told Chuan to "wait and see what will happen" if the Phalang Tham motion was passed by Parliament, according to the source. It was not known if Bunchu was hinting he would resign or pull Phalang Tham out of the coalition to allow Chuan to bring in an opposition party in a Cabinet reshuffle. Rumours abounded yesterday about the Democrats "approaching" two major opposition parties -- Chat Thai and Chat Phatthana. Chat Thai leader Banhan Sinlapa-acha called an urgent meeting yesterday evening with deputy party leaders, said Chat Tha spokesman Pratuang Wichanpricha who admitted that he did not know what the meeting was all about. Some Democrat MPs compared Phalang Tham with the Democrat Party six years ago when Democrat rebels doomed the Prem government by violating a coalition resolution on a copyright amendment. They said Phalang Tham would "owe the people an explanation" if the government crumbled as a result of the controversial motion. An estimated 10,000 people turned up in front of Parliament yesterday to join a pro-Chalat rally. Leading reformists have already declared victory, voicing confidence that the motion would be surely passed. But considering Chalat's initial demands, passage of the motion could be just the beginning of another painstaking process that might bring the whole episode back to square one, observers said. Chalat started his hunger strike after the opposition and Senate joined hands to kill proposed constitutional amendments drawn up by an ad hoc House committee. But the emotional campaign and the Democrats' tough stand against "political intimidation" soon spiralled into an antigovernment crusade with opposition MPs joining the fray and supporting the radical reformists. The government has pointed out that there is one question that the pro-Chalat side has tried to avoid: Will Chalat resume his fast if the Phalang Tham motion fails to produce satisfactory motion?
