But the dues exceeding one trillion roubles has not been credited to the account of the Russian Defence Ministry which means the money will not be returned to defence industry workers. Without these funds scientific research institutes and design bureaus will not be in a position to meet the defence supply orders for the year 1994 which were approved by the government. According to specialists, it will have a negative effect on the implementation of the long-term armament programme, the main directions and priorities of which were stated by Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin at a session of the Russian Security Council held on December 19 and were approved by President Boris Yeltsin. The hopes of the defence industry workers that the current year will turn out to be the year of its revival have also not come true. For the time being many samples of Russian arms, which are considerably superior to similar arms manufactured elsewhere in the world, cannot be produced on a large scale due to deficit of funds. This not only concerns firearms brought to perfection, but also principally new kinds of military hardware, in particular, aviation and anti-aircraft rocket complexes and means of communications. According to Director General of the Aviation Production Amalgamation (Komsomolsk-on-Amur) Anatoliy Petrov, Russia makes the best multipurpose interceptor-fighter aircraft "SU-27", but not a single aircraft was delivered to the airforce. Fighter aircraft in different finishing stages are standing unclaimed on the premises of the plant. The same fate awaits other kinds of military hardware, including invisible to radar low-flying interceptor "MIG-31", fire-support (tank destroyer) "KA-50" helicopter, well-known as "Black Shark" and possessing tremendous flying capabilities for its class bomber "TU- 22M", according to specialists. In order not to become an outsider tomorrow, Russian armourers have to find non-traditional ways to perfect their production. But they need support, first of all financial.
