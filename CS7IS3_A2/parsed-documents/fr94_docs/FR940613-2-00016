FR940613-2-00016 FR940613-2-00006 All non-profit and for-profit applicants are subject to a name-check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal if any key individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges such as fraud, theft, perjury, or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty or financial integrity. No award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Federal debt until either: (1) The delinquent account is paid in full; (2) A negotiated repayment schedule is established and at least one payment is received; or (3) Other arrangements satisfactory to the Department of Commerce are made. Unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding. In addition, any recipients who are past due for submitting acceptable final reports under any previous SRD-funded research will be ineligible to be considered for new awards until final reports are received, reviewed and deemed acceptable by SRD. A false statement on an application is grounds for denial or termination of funds and grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C., 1001. If an application is selected for funding, the Department of Commerce (DOC) has no obligation to provide any additional future funding in connection with that award. Renewal of an award to increase funding or extend the period of performance is at the total discretion of DOC. However, funding priority will be given to the second year of multi-year proposals upon satisfactory completion of the first year of research.
