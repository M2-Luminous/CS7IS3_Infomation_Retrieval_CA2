FR940413-0-00022 FR940413-0-00005 Currently, there generally are two types of XM programs_proprietary and non-proprietary. 2 In proprietary programs, XM treatment is given to intermarket positions in proprietary ( i.e. , non-customer) accounts maintained by participating clearing members. With non-proprietary XM programs, XM treatment is given at the clearing organization level for intermarket positions maintained by clearing members for market professionals. 2 The Commission has approved a number of proprietary XM programs between futures clearing organizations and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), a clearing organization for options listed on the American Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, Pacific Stock Exchange and Philadelphia Stock Exchange. To date, the Commission has approved proprietary XM programs between the OCC and the following futures clearing organizations: Intermarket Clearing Corporation (ICC) (June 1, 1988); Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) (September 26, 1989); Board of Trade Clearing Corporation (BOTCC) (October 31, 1991); Kansas City Board of Trade Clearing Corporation (KCBTCC) (February 25, 1992); and Comex Clearing Association (September 9, 1992). The Commission has also approved trilateral proprietary XM programs among the CME, ICC and OCC (June 2, 1993) and among the Commodity Clearing Corporation (CCC), ICC and OCC (December 28, 1993). Similarly, the Commission has approved non-proprietary XM programs between OCC and the following futures clearing organizations: CME (November 26, 1991); ICC (November 26, 1991); BOTCC (July 21, 1993); and KCBTCC (July 21, 1993). The Commission has also approved trilateral non-proprietary XM programs among CME, ICC and OCC (June 2, 1993) and among CCC, ICC and OCC (December 28, 1993). III. Previous Bankruptcy Distribution in the Context of XM Programs Under the various non-proprietary XM programs, the futures trades and securities positions of eligible market professionals are deemed to be customer property under section 4d(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act 3 and any customer net equity claim which a participating market professional has in respect of XM property held by a clearing firm in a non-proprietary XM account must be treated as a customer net equity claim under part 190 of the Commission's rules 4 and subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (the commodity broker liquidation provisions). 5 In the case of an FCM bankruptcy, the commodity broker liquidation provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and part 190 of the Commission's rules provide for a pro rata distribution of assets among the section 4d(2) customers whose accounts are carried by such FCM. Thus, absent some provision to the contrary, if a participating clearing member defaulted due to losses in its non-proprietary XM account, non-XM customers could be forced to share in those losses. 6 3 7 U.S.C. 6d(2) (1988). 4 17 CFR part 190. 5 Without some contrary provision, the assets of a securities broker-dealer who cleared the options trades of a cross-margining market professional would be distributed in the event of a bankruptcy pursuant to subchapter III of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 741&hyph;752 (1988), or the Securities Investors Protection Act (SIPA), 15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq. (1988). In order for a securities broker-dealer to participate in a non-proprietary XM program, it must elect customer property treatment under part 190 of the Commission's rules in lieu of under SIPA, as further discussed below. 6 11 U.S.C. 761&hyph;766 (1988).
