RAS Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Novosibirsk, Russia] [Abstract] Silicon samples, implanted by [.sup]40[/] Ar[.sup]+[/] (10[.sup]15[/]cm[.sup]-2[/] dose) ions and P[.sup]+[/] (10[.sup]16[/] cm[.sup]-2[/] dose) ions with 40 keV energy, were examined employing the methods of multiangular ellipsometry and selective moistening with a layer-by-layer removal of the implanted section using anode oxidation. With implantation by Ar[.sup]+[/] ions, the maxima of the experimentally obtained profiles _th_, n and k lie nearer to the surface, than with implantation by ions Ar[.sup]+[/]. This can be explained by the fact that the mass of Ar[.sup]+[/][[.sup]2[/]] ions is greater, and the implantation dose is slightly smaller than for P[.sup]+[/]. With implantation by Ar[.sup]+[/], as well as by P[.sup]+[/] ions, the profiles _th_ and k are identical, and correspond to the defects' distribution profile in the implanted layer. The profile of the n changes is, probably, determined by a joint action of the defects and impurity. Figures 3, references 20: 16 Russian, 4 Western.
