It should also be sent to the European Parliament and the parliaments of all the countries in order to find the indispensable international support for a correct solution of the Kosova question. I think that a parliamentary commission must be created to prepare the statement which then will be discussed and adopted by the parliament. Secondly, I think it is necessary to juridically denounce the bloody communist Enverist dictatorship not only for the monstrous crimes it committed to the Albanian people but for the real threat that danger that its offsprings are posting to democracy. The problems which need indispensably be solved are: 1. Enverian dictatorship should be juridically denounced. 2. Antinational criminal figures such as Enver Hoxha and the main former communist leaders should be brought to court for their crimes to the Albanian people. 3. The titles "Hero of the People" and attributions stemming from it entitled so far to persons that are responsible for grave crimes towards the Albanian people, should be lifted. It is a pity that this title has not yet been removed from the hangsman Enver Hoxha. At the same time it is a paradox that Shefqet Peci, a criminal notorious for the massacres and sentences without trial in Gjirokaster, Libohove, Mirdite, Kukes, and Kosova [as received]. Peci should be sent to trial and not be a "Hero of the People." 4. Although our parliament has renounced the prescription for the crimes, no judicial process have yet been held for the crimes committed during the 50 year communist regime by criminals such as Ramiz Alia, Aranit Cela, Manush Myftiu, and former interior ministers, who besides the crimes, they have also ordered the elimination of the documents in the archives of the Republic of Albania. Ramiz Alia is not only co-responsible with Enver Hoxha, but he also is to be blamed for the violence over the pioneers of democracy, for murders in the border which he himself has ordered during his rule over Albania. Ramiz Alia ordered that fire be opened against the refugees, he ordered arrests and imprisonments, maltreatments and the sending to psychiatric hospitals of those who took part in the demonstrations and who toppled the busts of the dictators. Ramiz Alia ordered for the April 2 massacre and many others. The democratic states in the world have punished and continue to punish the Nazi criminals and the past and present terrors. We do not urge political trials but trials against illegal and inhuman state crime, genocide and massive terror exercised by the hangmen who not only do not apologise but yet continue their efforts to deny the present democracy. There has not been and will not yet be any Nurenberg in the postcommunist Albania although there is enough evidence for the crimes and criminals on national scale. The Albanian people terrorized by the communist dictatorship, the formerly politically persecuted and their families have not manifested any sign of revenge, but they demand justice. They are convinced that the parliament and the Albanian democratic state will solve this question. The abuse must not be everlasting because the entire persecuted Albanian people need relief from the extraordinary hatred accumulated by the 50 year violations, they need peace and spiritual harmony, stability and love for one another, national spirit and consciousness, on order that they be able to work and live in democracy.
