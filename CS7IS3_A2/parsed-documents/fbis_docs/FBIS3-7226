This was the first time the ruling parties held a dialogue with the U.S. Government on this issue. Mondale said during the meeting, "We are interested in policy, and not in market share," expressing high expectations on the policy package to expand domestic demand and liberalize the market that the Japanese Government is working on. The ruling parties expressed the opinion that the United States should change its attitude of asking for immediate action, saying "the U.S. Government should attach importance to the negotiation process, and not to the results." However, the ambassador said, "The United States is not satisfied with the process of Japan-U.S. economic negotiations so far. We need an early solution." He reiterated a call on the Japanese Government to come up quickly with radical measures to effect a breakthrough in bilateral relations. At the meeting, Mondale also commented on the issue of nuclear inspections in the DPRK (North Korea). He expressed his concern, saying: "The (North Korean) leaders are isolated. We have worked hard to reach a peaceful solution. This situation is indeed distressing." Regarding steps to be taken from now on, he said, "The deployment of Patriot missiles is purely defensive. While I am in favor of conducting the Team Spirit exercises, this will not be the solution. It is one of the options." He also stated that "economic sanctions may have to be imposed."
