The kuna and the [smaller denomination] lipa have not yet arrived in the markets and shops. However, the withdrawal of the Croatian dinar from circulation has started at the financial transactions bureau. All those with accounts with the bureau are paying their last deposits in Croatian dinars and are drawing cash in kunas. This is why it is so busy at the bureau's main Mostar branch. While citizens are curiously comparing the new currency note with that of the German mark, and some even with the old kuna, it has to be said that from tomorrow they will be able to change dinars for kunas in business banks. The exchange will be possible until 5 June and the Croatian dinar will finally be withdrawn from circulation on 30 June, according to the Herceg-Bosna government's decision. Also according to the government's decision, the German mark and the U.S. dollar will be official means of payment, together with the kuna.
