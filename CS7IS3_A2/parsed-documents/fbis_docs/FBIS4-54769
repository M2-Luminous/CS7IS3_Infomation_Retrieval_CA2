Speaking with journalists after a government session, he said that in the article he was preparing for the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY he would engage in a polemic with those "who express their aversion of profitability through non-profitability." Klaus said that in the title of his article, which will read "The More Non-Profit Organisations, the More Democracy," he would quote an unnamed author. He dismissed speculation that the unnamed author was President Vaclav Havel who had often taken up the status and role of non-profit organisations. At a press conference on March 26, Havel said that he considered non-profit organisations one of the instruments of building a civic society. "The social organism must be immune to the excessive concentration of political power and it is necessary to prevent that any change following elections produce a windstorm and that it shake the whole state," Havel said at the press conference. Culture Minister Pavel Tigrid said after his meeting with Havel yesterday that Havel wanted to discuss the drafting of a bill on non-profit organisations in a public television debate. Havel has been eagerly pushing for the law, while Klaus and some other leading officials have been rather reserved on the problem fearing big tax evasions.
