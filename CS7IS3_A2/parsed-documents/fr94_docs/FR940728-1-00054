FR940728-1-00054 FR940728-1-00015 With this notice, the Service announces a positive 90-day finding on the petition that the following actions may be warranted for the Dakota skipper: Elevation to Category 1 status and subsequent listing as an endangered or threatened species. The Service solicits further information regarding occurrence and distribution of the species, threats to its continued existence, and any additional comments and suggestions from the public, other concerned government agencies, the scientific community, industry, and any other parties. The following issues are of particular interest to the Service: 1. Additional historic and current population data which may assist in determining long term population trends; 2. Management methods used on substantial tracts of native prairie that include actions such as burning, haying, insect and plant control, plowing, and grazing, but which do not adversely affect the Dakota skipper and its habitat; and 3. Data pertaining to existing available prairie habitat which may be suitable Dakota skipper habitat and present and/or possible future disturbance to those areas. After consideration of additional information submitted during the indicated time period (See DATES section), the Service will prepare a 12-month finding. The petitioner also requested that critical habitat be designated. If the 12-month finding determines that the petitioned action to list the Dakota skipper as an endangered or threatened species is warranted, then the designation of critical habitat would be addressed in the subsequent proposed rule.
