On the contrary, it has brought about only destruction, rift, suffering, hardship, misery, disgrace, and despair to our Cambodia, our nation, and especially our poor and innocent people. In my capacity as the father of the nation and the Prince Father of all Cambodians, male and female alike and from all political parties and factions, I appeal to the Royal Government on the one side and the PDK [Party of Democratic Kampuchea] and DK national forces on the other to immediately and urgently cease fire on all battlefields in the entire Cambodia. I appeal to all of you to agree to reconcile fully without any preconditions. I appeal to all children to build peace and live peacefully together eternally now and in the future. Peace in Cambodia is the life, the happiness, the prosperity, and the glory of our nation and motherland. War is the death of our Cambodia and our race. The one and only way to settle all the problems remaining between the Royal Government and the PDK is through peaceful means. I appeal to the Royal Government and the PDK to please bring full peace to our motherland, because only with full peace will our motherland have the capability (?to carry out reconstruction for) our people; and only when this is achieved can our people live in peace, happily with honor and freedom, and relieved from their misery and hardship. [Dated] The General Hospital in Beijing, 8 March 1994
