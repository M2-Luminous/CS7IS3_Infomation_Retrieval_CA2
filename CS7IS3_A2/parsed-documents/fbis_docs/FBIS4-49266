Speaking at the meeting, Commission Vice Minister Liu Zhifeng said: In light of their actual conditions, all localities should learn from the corporation's experiences and expand on them by conducting bold explorations and constantly making innovations. In conjunction with the experiment in setting up modern enterprises, the economic restructuring commissions of provinces and cities should concentrate on the experiment in conducting reform in a coordinated way. The meeting -- in which directors of the provincial and autonomous regional economic restructuring commissions throughout the country, the leaders of the relevant central departments, and the principal leaders of cities directly under the central government participated -- was held to study ways to upgrade the state-owned sector of the economy, to advance reform of state-owned enterprises in a coordinated way, to increase the value of state-owned assets, to optimize the industrial structure, to transform the functions of government departments, to change the operating mechanisms of enterprises, and to train and distribute surplus workers and staff members so as to promote the establishment of a modern enterprise system. At the meeting, Cui Zhian, chairman of the board of directors of the corporation, briefed the participants on its experiences by delivering a report entitled "Actively Push Ahead Coordinated Reform To Explore New Ways for Invigorating State-Owned Enterprises." The meeting was presided over by Huo Guanghui, vice minister of the State Economic Restructuring Commission. Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan also spoke at the meeting. Cui Zhian said: Confronted with three problems -- a shortage of funds, too many employees, and difficulties in taking an inventory of assets -- the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation explored many new paths in the course of deepening enterprise reform: It developed high-grade light industrial products; it shifted from developing secondary industries to developing tertiary industries by building the China Glass Center; it changed its operating mechanism by allowing a state-owned company to be run by private manager on a trial basis; it readjusted its structure by developing marketable products; it changed its business operations in accordance with the demands of a market economy. The explorations have yielded preliminary results, which have promoted its expansion and its economic performance. Last year, while a large number of state-owned light industrial enterprises were having difficulties, the corporation's output value was 2.98 billion yuan, up 6.8 percent over the previous year; its sales income was 3.49 billion yuan, up 24.2 percent over the previous year; it paid 236 million yuan in taxes to the state, an increase of 16.3 percent; it made 167 million yuan in profit, up 61.7 percent, ranking first in profit growth rate among light industrial enterprises in Beijing and the rest of the country. Cui Zhian said: We have gained a five-point experience from our reform in the past year: First, to solve the deep-seated problems in state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to conduct reform in a coordinated way. Second, the nucleus of building a market economic system is the optimization of resource allocation. Third, once a reform program is drawn up, it must be implemented in a down-to-earth way. Fourth, good ideological-political work is the guarantee of coordinated reform. Fifth, coordinated reform must be supported in a coordinated way. Expounding on the basic reform experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation, Liu Zhifeng, vice minister of the State Economic Restructuring Commission, said: Viewed from the overall effort of deepening the reform of the economic structure, the corporation's basic reform experience has three outstanding features: First, in line with the requirements for establishing a socialist market economic structure, the corporation has given full play to the basic role of the market in allocating resources under state macroeconomic regulation and control. Second, it has organically integrated reform with development and stability. In the course of deepening reform, the corporation made vigorous efforts to resolve the contradictions brought about by the readjustment of power and interests, thus preserving social stability. Third, proceeding from the deep-seated problems in state-owned enterprises, the corporation carried out a systematic and coordinated reform while at the same time solving problems in other areas, thus achieving good results and pushing reform to a new level. On how to learn from and apply the corporation's reform experiences, Liu Zhifeng said: We should thoroughly understand and master the corporation's basic experience and decide on a specific program for readjusting economic structures and transforming enterprises' operating mechanisms in light of the local conditions; we should draw up a plan and implement it step by step. In carrying out coordinated reform, local authorities should draw up a unified plan and implement it in a unified way under the unified leadership of city governments, and must guard against rushing into mass action. In authorizing the management of state-owned assets, it is necessary to proceed from reality and to separate government functions from enterprise management. We should do our best to innovate and transform operating mechanisms. We should support coordinated reform in a coordinated way. The principal leaders of governments and economic restructuring departments, as well as other relevant departments, should coordinate in advancing the reform.
