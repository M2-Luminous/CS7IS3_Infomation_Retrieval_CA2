Shen Guofang said: The direction is that of safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and promoting its denuclearization. China hopes that all the parties concerned work toward these two basic goals, will continue to seek a peaceful way to properly solve the DPRK nuclear issue, and will refrain from practices that may intensify the contradiction. Shen said: There is still room and the possibility of a proper solution despite the present difficulties with the DPRK nuclear issue. Therefore, China does not favor the involvement of the UN Security Council in the DPRK nuclear issue and does not agree to sanctions against the DPRK because that will push all sides concerned toward the brink of confrontation, which may cause consequences no side wishes to see. Shen said: China is not clear about the details of the DPRK nuclear development program, and it is hard for China to predict what moves the DPRK will make once sanctions are imposed. But sanctions are not a good method. Experience in solving international issues tells us that sanctions often intensify contradictions and lead to conflict. He stressed: There are many complicated factors in the DPRK nuclear issue. Two things are very important in solving this problem: Patience and a certain amount of time. China hopes all the parties concerned remain calm and maintain restraint and do not close the door on negotiations so easily. Efforts over the last year show that there will be progress if talks between the four corners and the three sides are resumed, and a crisis if talks stop. Shen Guofang also revealed details about this morning's working meeting between the Chinese and ROK foreign ministers, saying that the two sides exchanged their views on the situation in great depth. There is some common ground: They both hope that the trend toward peace and stability on the Korean peninsula can be maintained, neither wants to see any serious consequences, and they agreed that further efforts are required to solve the DPRK nuclear issue.
