"If we do not work to hold clean elections, there will be those ready to mar the process and set the stage for conflicts and negotiations outside the law," Colosio has told his party members in Colula, a town in Puebla State, central Mexico. The presidential elections assumed a new meaning after the Indian uprising that took place on 1 January in Chiapas State, southeastern Mexico. The Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) declared war on the government to demand solutions to poverty and other matters of political concern related to the presidential elections. In the 21 August elections, approximately 42 million registered Mexican voters will elect the president, 300 deputies, and 126 senators among the candidates of nine political parties. Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, spokesman of the third parliamentary bloc, the opposition PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], told EFE today the electoral environment "is weak, given an outdated legislations was enacted to favor the government party." Ramirez added: "The current legislation approved in 1993 allows electoral manipulation by the government and its party." The spokesman has reiterated the need to convene the Mexican Congress to special sessions to revise the rules on which the elections are based and to sign an agreement that will guarantee calm elections. According to Ramirez Cuellar, the financial ceiling set for the electoral campaign, fixed at $40 million for each candidate, "is still too high; besides, there is no strict control" of this. Another aspect that contributes to the weakening of the electoral environment, he said, is the media's partiality "to the extent that we want the media to be regulated so that equal access" is allowed to all political parties. PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo has said the debate on political reforms would help the negotiators in Chiapas achieve true and lasting peace, based on clear and open elections. Meanwhile, PRI Deputy Juan Ramiro Robledo says his party is willing to discuss the possibility of holding special sessions, because "we have a responsibility, and we must find points of consensus." The deterioration of the electoral environment increased after the daily LA JORNADA received anonymous threats from an anticommunist front for being considered an EZLN mouthpiece. After the threats, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari expressed his solidarity with the daily. The Mexican presidential candidates are Luis Dolando Colosio, PRI; Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action Party; Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD; Pablo Emilio Madero of the National Opposition Union; and Cecilia Sot, of the Labor Party; Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party; Jorge Gonzalez Torres, Mexican Green Ecologist Party; Marcela Lombardo Toledado, Popular Socialist Party; and Alvaro Perez Trevino, Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution.
