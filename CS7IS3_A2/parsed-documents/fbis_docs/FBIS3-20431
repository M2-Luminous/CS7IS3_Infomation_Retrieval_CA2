In recent years, weakened social controls or being out of control in some areas have been a major cause of consistently high juvenile deliquency. 1. The weakened internal control function of the party and government organizations has brought on rampant corruption, causing many youths to be antagonistic toward social production, a key reason for delinquency. As everyone knows, for a long time now there have been no effective control or check on party and government organization corruption. Many officials use authority to seek private gain, accept bribes and dinner invitations, seek high class enjoyment, or even gain items by force or trickery. The 8 April 1993 edition of WENZHAI BAO said that China spends more than 100 billion yuan of public funds annually on food, drink and travel. It may not be an exaggeration to say that, at present, in general, dinner invitations and gifts are a common occurrence -- not at all strange. Direct monetary or high-class commodity gifts are nothing new. In some departments, it has practically reached the stage where nothing gets done unless favors are given. Although the party and government have repeatedly punished such actions, corruption is always prohibited to no end and even gets stronger. The masses have reacted strongly to this. Party and government corruption and degeneracy are the source of social impropriety. Internal party and government corruption is always a visible or invisible example or suggestion to youths. It makes them feel that they can get money by any means and that there is nothing that money cannot do. Directness and malleability are characteristics of the juvenile socialization process. In this process, the role of social examples often precedes all others. In particular, the behavior of those in authority who dominate society is directly perceived and important in affecting youth. 2. A major cause of rising juvenile delinquency is weakened judicial control functions, meaning the loss of legal weaponry's proper deterrence. The principle requirement of implementing China's socialist laws is the stipulation that all citizens must equally be responsible for executing the constitution and legal regulations; no citizen is permitted to have special powers superseding the constitution or law. "There are laws which can be obeyed, and there are laws which must be obeyed; they must be enacted strictly and transgressors of the law must be investigated." However, for various reasons, in recent years some judicial departments have disobeyed the law, not enacted it strictly, not investigated transgressors and even bent the law for relatives and friends. A weakened judicial control function has made some of the masses, in particular, those who have been harmed, opposed to those departments which implement the law. This has helped engender juvenile delinquency and dampened the enthusiasm of the masses to struggle against transgressing criminal elements. 3. Discipline is commonly lax in various social organizations. Organization is slack, meaning constituent member law abiding consciousness is not properly strengthened. Some even take the criminal road. The evolutionary process of many juvenile delinquents proves that crime always begins by disobeying disciplinary constraints. In China in the 1950s and early 1960s, management was orderly, discipline tight, and ideological and political work deeply entered people's thinking nationwide at all levels of party, government and social organization. This transformed many negative elements and constrained some illegal crimes. The current situation is very different. In some departments management is lax, discipline is slack and managment systems are weak. Bad things are listened to without being heard and perceived without being seen. This provides some youths with conditions for illegal crimes. 4. Weakened social and moral control functions bring on a more faint public opinion atmosphere for censuring bad people and bad things. It instigates some youths to lawless and wild illegal criminal behavior. Morals are social standards. In a certain sense, their constraining role on people's behavior is broader and stronger than that of the law. When some bad action encroaches on another person or the interests of society yet does not constitute a crime, morals can use powerful public opinion to intervene and condemn it, containing some who carry out or plan to carry out bad acts to have some scruples under positive mass pressure. In recent years an undeniable result of the development of a commodity economy has been social prosperity and wealth. It has greatly enhanced the vitality of the entire society. However, another undeniable aspect is that people really feel bitter hatred regarding society's morals. It seems that the entire society puts money above all. Isn't money always exciting someones nerves? To get money by any means, some can cheat, swindle, ignore national and personal dignity and morals and disregard national laws. In such soil, the propagation and spread of juvenile delinquency toxins is unavoidable. 5. Weakened family educational and control functions over children is the first lost line of defense against juvenile delinquency. The family is a social cell. Parents are a child's first teachers. When most youths leave family supervision and prior to living on their own, most of their time is spent alongside their parents. The family is their main living space. Therefore, parental teaching and the influence of the family are of utmost importance to their growth. In particular, the family's restraining and correcting role when a child first has a tendency to do bad are irreplaceable by any other organization or individual. At present, the function of family teaching and control clearly are weakened and hindered under conditions of youth's earlier physiological maturity and a great number of bad enticements in the external society. In some families, children grow up getting everything they want. They neglect character training and only look at test scores, pampering their children who become spoiled or are simple and rude. When children act bad they are beat instead of taught, are treated overleniently or winked at to shield their shortcomings. Some parents only worry about earning money and do not care a bit about the children's education or studies. Some parents or other family members have poor schooling themselves or behave improperly. This directly affects and instigates children and siblings to delinquency. Some families only blindly grumble about poor social mores while neglecting or casting off their restraining responsibility over children. The bad thinking and behavior of some youths have reached a certain stage due to such weak family training and control that it is hard to avoid overstepping the limits of the law and becoming delinquent.
