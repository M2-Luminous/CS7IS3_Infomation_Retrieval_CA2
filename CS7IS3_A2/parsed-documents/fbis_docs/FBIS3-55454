They trade in everything they can manage to carry out of their "coupon-economy" and "counter-economy" states. The Russian ruble, only recently dubbed "the wooden currency," has suddenly become an object of passionate desire for citizens of the former Union republics. For the sake of acquiring the ruble thousands of people are giving up their homes and families, going without sleep for days on end, and standing for days in the winter mud of Moscow's streets.... A Cosy Breeding Ground for Crime... The Tashinka market has its own laws which effectively conform not at all to the generally accepted laws, and no one here is worried about concepts such as licensing, quality control, and health norms. Only Muscovites for whom prices at central stores are too dear now come to the dilapidated market; vendors are divided into two categories -- dealers in old rags and nails and sellers of food. The first category of trade "workers" are of interest to no one except scrap metal merchants. But the second, dubbed "the Belarusian trade mafia" in the neighboring homesteads, are of interest to everyone. To exact a tribute from a Belarusian who has arrived in Tashinka Square is as easy as picking up money off the street -- only the lazy or very scrupulous do not do it. The first to rush to the ranks of traders are representatives of the market administration -- the janitors. In return for 2,000 rubles [R] they give the vendors something like a little table or market stall and an oral guarantee of freedom to trade within the perimeter of Tashinka Square. There are no visiting traders in the market itself -- their potential customers hardly go there at all. But here they sell almost everything in which fraternal Belarus abounds: soap, brassieres, milk, cottage cheese, soda, cranberries, meat, cured fish, and even beer from the bottle -- at R100 per glass. They can even pour you a drop of vodka. Prices on Tashinka Square are indeed low: Boiled ham goes for R1,500-R2,000. Smoked meat sells for between R3,000 and R4,000. Smoked ham goes for around R4,000, and lightly smoked ham for R3,000 per kilogram. Cranberries and apples cost R1,200 and R1,300 respectively. Soda, which is not to be found in Moscow, costs R250 a packet. Children's soap sells for R75, whereas the state food store in the neighborhood sells only "Camay" at 10 times the price. Despite fears, no incidents of food poisoning from goods from Belarus or the pharmaceutical preparations which sell abundantly here were recorded over the past year in Krasnopresnenskiy Rayon. True, the traders here bring product quality to mind only when the local health and epidemological monitoring service puts in an appearance, but that is not more than once a month. Hence to the question "Where does this meat or cheese come from?" the traders usually answer: "From Brest." But this is only for those who recall that half of Belarus' oblasts have been contaminated by Chernobyl. For those who can only afford to buy "poshekhonskiy" cheese [low-quality provincial cheese] here at R2,500 instead of "Suluguni" -- R1,500 dearer in the state trade network -- this is not a question of fundamental importance. A different kind of quality control appear on Tashinka Square from 1000 hours -- officers of the militia's 88th department. The guardians of order walk in twos and regularly check documents, something that is especially topical following the restrictions introduced by the capital's mayor on foreigners from the former republics entering and residing in the city. The militia officers have trained eyes, and both sergeants skirted past an old man dealing in cranberries; but they at once became interested in two women selling walnuts. The brassiere dealers did not escape their attention either. The militia officer aptly dubbed the contents of the bags "Chernobyl umbrellas." And for some reason he took R4,000. "That is their tax," the traders explained to me. "They don't issue receipts." The third set of "controllers" of the square's bazaar were Azerbaijani kids who flocked from the market gates. "These kids take money on a fair basis: How much each man can afford," the old man with the cranberries says, whether in jest or in earnest. Probably a sense of justice has indeed developed among racketeers, because yet again nothing was taken from the old man. "I got nothing," as the old man himself said in Ukrainian. On the other hand the brassiere sellers once again had to cough up "5 grand" and unhappily started to gather up their wares. Traders from Belarus frequently come in order to buy cheap audio and visual equipment in Russia with their hard-earned rubles. They stay with friends and relatives. They are convinced that "it is more profitable to work in Russia today than in Poland." The second group of traders are those for whom it is more profitable to "work" in Poland, but more convenient to sell in Russia. In their native Belarus they earn less from brassieres, and the taxes there, it seems, are higher. And the third group -- the largest -- are people stopping off in Moscow on their way to visit relatives in the Russian heartlands, or in countries of the former republics. For them Moscow is the place to convert their native "counters" into a more stable currency. This kind of trader finds out about Tashinka Square accidentally, from friends, or even at Belorusskiy Station, where they spend the night for free and live for several days. On the whole, the militia's 88th department told me, Tashinka Square is "a cosy breeding ground for crime." Six Pay Packets for Four Trips Every morning an avalanche of speculators with heavy bags descends from the trains arriving at Moscow's Kiev Railway Station. Having negotiated the barriers at the doors and turnstiles they rapidly disperse among the capital's flea markets. But the bulk of them stop in the immediate vicinity of the station -- at the Dorogomilovskiy market. Just as at Tashinka, the enterprising citizens from the coupon-economy state are not allowed underneath the arched vault of the market. Here citizens of Azerbaijan trading in tropical fruits have long since firmly established themselves. Hence, despite the rules on trade, for several hours a day Kievskaya Ulitsa is transformed into a huge flea market. The Christmas vacation, we discovered, does not extend to the private sector. Thousands of street traders, mixing Russian and Ukrainian words, were vying with one another in extolling their wares. Squeezing my way through the crowd with difficulty and, so as to avoid trouble, clutching my bag closely, I looked over the range of goods available. It was inexhaustible: women's blouses embroidered with glass beads, large axes, peacock feathers, bodices, sausage meat, pickles, preserves, and so on and so forth. All this magnificence lay strewn not very esthetically on bushes beside the road or was piled high in dirty boxes. But still more amazing were the prices -- two-thirds to one-half the Moscow average. The customer in this flea market also has his own character. They are people who as a rule are poorly dressed; many are elderly. "Aren't you afraid of being poisoned?" we asked a woman for whom a guy in a greasy quilted jacket was fetching a "stick" of sausage meat from his rucksack. "What do you mean," she replies, "I have been buying from him for a long time. Excellent Ukrainian sausage meat, for which in a store you pay not R2,000, like here, but R4,000-6,000." The sausage meat seller is from near Chernigovo. He works in a cooperative, but he makes up the bulk of his family budget, in his own words, through shuttle trips to Russia. "For four trips to Moscow I get six monthly pay packets," he says. "The coupon is now 35-40 times more `lightweight' than the ruble. One trip -- 40 kilograms of lightly smoked sausage meat. This is snatched up within three hours; I change the rubles for coupons, or else I buy goods here to sell at home." "But surely the goods are confiscated by Ukrainian customs officials?" "Of course not, pal -- we give them all a little extra to keep them sweet! And if some crank takes the rucksack -- it's no big loss: I return home for another consignment of sausage meat." The mechanics of the flea market are elementary: The dealer, arriving in the capital at, say, 0800, has already gotten rid of his wares by midday. Two-three hours are spend on the purchase of consignments of imported cigarettes or chocolate from small wholesalers (on the square by the station the wholesale market is the cheapest in Moscow). And later on the same day the evening train carries the breadwinner back to his native peasant house. "You force down prices on the Moscow markets" -- we are talking to the same trader. "Haven't your competitors tried to punish you for this?" "There has been no such incident in my time. The problem lies elsewhere: Often some boys `call round' and demand money for the space. We pay them R4,000-5,000 a time. All the same we do not go away with empty pockets." The customer and the trader at the local flea market, all the indications suggest, are entirely happy with one another. But at the 123d militia department they believe that the spontaneous congregation of thousands of people in this area creates a dangerous breeding ground for crime. Pickpockets, muggers, and small-time racketeers gather here like flies around honey. It is very difficult to combat them, because regulars to the market, preferring "not to get involved," refuse to complain to the militia. "All we can do is curse under our breath," Oleg Sharov, deputy chief of the militia's 123d department, says. "Nevertheless, in the last six months we have caught 150 pickpockets and roughly the same number of muggers at the market. But, of course, this is just a drop in the ocean." Sharov calls his detectives "the paperwork brigade": They barely have time to fill out their official reports. Some days the number of detainees reaches hundreds! Yet aside from the market, they have to watch over order on the square in the station precincts. Four criminal groups keep tabs on the commercial kiosks on this square, and they are repeatedly organizing bloody affrays between one another. Sooner or later the patience of the militia or the health and epidemological station will snap. The Ukrainian traders will be arrested and fined, and then they will move to Tashinka Square -- which is where we began this report....
