The Joint Budget Committee has released a note of "clarification to the nation" in which it denounces the government as the branch "exclusively" responsible for the lack of a budget law, directly harming the health, education, transport, and agriculture sectors. The note is signed by the representatives of eight parties, in addition to the committee's president and rapporteur, Senator Raimundo Lira (PFL-PB) [Liberal Front Party-Paraiba State] and Deputy Marcelo Barbieri (PMDB-SP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Sao Paulo State]. Of the country's main parties, only the representatives of the PFL and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] did not sign the note of criticism. According to one congressman, the note was due to the "hasty attitude" of the rapporteur. Barbieri stated that the motive behind the note was the "overall lack of satisfaction" on the part of the public administration with the "penury" of the resources that are released by the Treasury. "There are several sectors that are functioning precariously, and they visit Congress to complain about the lack of funds. The note is to make it clear to the government that it has not submitted its proposals for study and voting," Barbieri said. According to the deputy, the government is "clearly not interested" in approving the budget. "It is very easy for the government to constrict resources, but in the end it will be even more expensive with an increase in epidemics and the closing of hospitals," he said. In Rio de Janeiro, where he spent the day visiting the BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social Development], Planning Minister Beni Veras dictated to his adviser an answer for the committee. He guarantees that the vital sectors will have their resources guaranteed through Provisional Measure No. 441, which grants one-twelfth per month of the funds for the sectors pertaining to personnel, social charges, pension benefits, educational books, scholarships, and the payment of the public debt. He also states that the payments to hospitals that have an agreement with Inamps [National Institute for Social Security Medical Assistance] was attended to through opening an extraordinary 232 billion cruzeiro line of credit, in accordance with Provisional Measure No. 447 that was signed on 12 March by Deputy Inocencio de Oliveira, when he was acting president. The authors of the Joint Committee's note obtained on 17 March the signatures of the leaders of the main political parties, with the exception of the PSDB, for urgent voting on Provisional Measure No. 441. Deputy Joao Paulo (PT-MG) [Workers Party-Minas Gerais State] believes that the government acts in an "illegal and disrespectful" way in order to "belittle" Congress. "The provisional measure has an article that allows for the readjustment of the first budget project up to a month before the resources are released. With this article in hand, a budget is not needed," he said.
