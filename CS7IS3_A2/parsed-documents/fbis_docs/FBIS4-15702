He described his visit to Spain as important and emphasized the serious preparation of the documents, including the treaty on friendship and cooperation. [Begin Yeltsin recording] These documents which are to be signed give the green light to a rapid development of cooperation between our countries. So far it has been, one must say frankly, slow, though our two countries have great potential both for developing bilateral relations and for influencing the policy in Europe and in the world. [end recording] Asked about Russia's stand regarding the NATO air strike against the Bosnian Serbs and about his conversation early this morning with U.S. President Clinton, Boris Yeltsin said: [Begin Yeltsin recording] Everything must be in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations. He did not answer my question this morning about whether the UN secretary general had given the go-ahead for this. We advocate discussion of this issue in the Security Council -- without doubt. Speaking to Clinton, I insisted again and again that it is impossible to make decisions on such issues without prior consultations between the United States and Russia. It is impossible, and that will be our stand. [end recording] [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0604 GMT on 11 April adds, in a report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova on the Yeltsin-Clinton phone conversation: "The Russian president pointed out that he had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton `at six in the morning today.' According to Boris Yeltsin, `Bill Clinton was unable to reply whether the U.N. Secretary-General gave a go-ahead to the strikes.' Boris Yeltsin is convinced that `all problems should be resolved strictly in accordance with U.N. decisions." Yeltsin said "Russia favours discussing this issue in the U.N. Security Council.'] [Moscow INTERFAX in English at 1120 GMT on 11 April adds: "Before flying to Spain on an official visit Yeltsin told journalists that Clinton had not said whether the UN secretary general had given his go ahead to the NATO air strike against Bosnian Serb positions in the vicinity of Gorazde. `This is important to know because the air strike took place at night. Such actions should not be taken unless authorized by the UN,' Yeltsin said. `It is also important to know what targets were destroyed. If only two tanks, it's one thing; if the civilian population suffered, it's another. In any case this incident has to be debated by the UN Security Council. I insisted that such decisions should not be made without Russia. This is our firm position.']
