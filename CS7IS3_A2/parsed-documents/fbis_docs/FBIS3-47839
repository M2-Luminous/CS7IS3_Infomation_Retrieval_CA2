The author of the article says: Whether the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is resolved or not is a matter concerning the survival and ruin of the Korean people. It was entirely caused by the U.S. policy of turning South Korea into its nuclear base. In July 1957 the U.S. Army officially announced the start of the nuclear armament of its troops in South Korea. After that nearly all types nuclear weapons produced in the United States were deployed in South Korea, and their number exceeded 1,000. From 1976 the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, a test nuclear war, have been staged every year in South Korea with nuclear weapons hurled into them. Though the U.S. declared the withdrawal of nuclear weapons, they are left intact in South Korea. If they are used, the Korean nation will be the first sufferer. The nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula must be solved soon for peace and security in Asia and the world. The United States is using the nuclear weapons as the main means of executing its dominationist policy. The nuclear weapons in South Korea can not be an exception. If the nuclear issue becomes acute on the Korean peninsula and nuclear weapons are used, many countries would suffer the holocaust. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula can be solved only through dialogue and negotiation between the DPRK and the USA. It will be fundamentally solved, if the third-round DPRK-USA talks are opened with sincere will of dialogue and fair attitude toward talks and the formula of package deal is adopted there, as agreed upon at the contact on December 29 last year.
