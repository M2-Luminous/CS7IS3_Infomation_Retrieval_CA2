On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans (sections 404 (b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act). On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced utilization issues. In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below, EPA approves for 1995&hyph;1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996&hyph;1999 in the draft permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated to each unit for 1995&hyph;1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft permits. The additional allowances discussed below, according to the settlement, are a one-time allocation and entail a simultaneous deduction of an equal number of allowances in a future year. Upon activation of conditionally-approved plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the remaining years the plan is in effect. EPA issues the following permits: Brayton Point in Massachusetts. Mount Tom in Massachusetts: 10,708 substitution allowances for each year and 736 additional allowances to unit 1 upon activation of substitution plan, and 736 additional allowances if the unit becomes affected for nitrogen oxides (NO X ).
