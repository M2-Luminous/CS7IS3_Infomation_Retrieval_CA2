Compared with last year, the number of victims of this dangerous disease has increased by more than 40 percent. If in the past TB was thought to be a disease of the poor, now the TB lists have representatives of all sections of society. The city's medical workers have been particularly alarmed by a high number of cases at Vladivostok's higher educational establishments. According to the medical workers at the city TB clinic, alongside students' traditional untidiness and their unwillingness to undergo regular checks, low living standards and overcrowding in hostels are aggravating the situation. Foreigners who have literally flooded Vladivostok have become a special risk group. Thousands of citizens of Korea, Vietnam, and especially China who arrive here for seasonal work do not have preliminary medical checks. And the city's markets, overcrowded by them, have turned into places of scandalous anti-sanitation.
