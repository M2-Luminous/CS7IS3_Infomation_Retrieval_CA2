(NTT) on Wednesday [6 April] sought government understanding on its plan to raise some telephone charges. NTT did all it could do to streamline its business, including man power cuts and a reduction in facility expenses, Masashi Kojima, president of the telecommunications giant, told a biweekly news conference. Kojima also tried to justify NTT's rate hike plan submitted to the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry last week by citing a cumulative 1 trillion yen in rate discounts made in the recent past. NTT plans to raise monthly basic charges from October by an average 18 percent per household and double a directory assistance service rate for two or more uses for any one month from the same telephone number from 30 yen to 60 yen per call. The step, designed to improve the battered financial standing of NTT, would yield additional revenue of 93.2 billion yen to the company for fiscal 1994 started April 1. But the government is considering postponing enforcement of the increases apparently in response to a barrage of public criticism of the recent rate hike plans for utilities, public transportations and telephones. NTT, privatized in 1985, should not be treated equally with other companies providing services with public nature, Kojima said. Kojima criticized the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) for citing unsatisfactory American access to NTT business in its latest report on foreign trade barriers. Under the current business conditions, it is impossible for NTT to expand equipment purchases from U.S. makers, Kojima said. Rather than focusing on purchases of foreign products, NTT is willing to form a joint venture with U.S. companies to create new business chances both for NTT and foreign firms, Kojima said. The annual USTR report released last week urged more efforts by NTT to expand buying of telecommunications equipment from U.S. makers, claiming the American share was unfairly small in view of the international competitiveness of U.S. products. On a new portable phone system now on a test run, Kojima said NTT plans to offer the service at more reasonable charges than the current pay telephone rate of 10 yen per minute for local calls. Kojima said the government should not impose strict business licensing and other regulations on the new service and other multimedia-related business expected to burgeon toward the next century.
