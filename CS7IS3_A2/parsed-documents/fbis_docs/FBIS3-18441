Writer Stefan Heym, 80, felt as if he were back in his former job as a U.S. Army sergeant during World War II: "I am engaged in psychological warfare." So Heym permitted rumors to circulate for months on whether or not he would be a Bundestag candidate for the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. He will. Last Sunday [6 February], the heirs of the Honecker party proudly presented Heym as their direct candidate for the Berlin-Center/Prenzlauer Berg electoral district. Says flashy PDS man Gregor Gysi: "A great thing." And eternal illusionist Heym in the lightning storm of flashbulbs: "I run as an independent candidate." The two have arranged a mutually beneficial deal: The man of letters is assured of media attention, and the PDS can hope for a few more votes in the Bundestag election. So far, however, almost all opinion researchers see little chance for the SED [Socialist Unity Party] successors to get above the 5-percent hurdle in October; the prognoses fluctuate between 3 and 4 percent of the votes. But Gysi and comrades bank on the PDS gaining at least three direct mandates; then the party would be sure of its Bundestag presence even below the 5-percent cutoff. The strategy is "Illustrious Names for Direct Election"--a will-o'-the-wisp like Guenther Maleuda, whom the SED had promoted as high as deputy chairman of the Council of State, let himself be wooed and won. With someone like Stefan Heym, the PDS could actually outrun the competition in eastern Berlin. According to a Forsa poll, 31 percent of the voters there will "definitely" vote for "prominent direct candidates" of the PDS, and 13 percent "perhaps." According to election campaign manager Andre Brie, in the race for ballots the PDS seeks to win above all protest voters and "people attached to the GDR." So it is raging nostalgia for which Stefan Heym, the cool observer and critic of the GDR, becomes a willing tool. At any rate, his sharp eye has dimmed increasingly since German unification. "The old SED had me censored, watched and harassed," Heym sums up the years after he had graduated from the "eternal beating around the bush" and could publish bestsellers such as his novel "Collin" (1979) only in the West. The Stasi spied on the writer even in his bedroom. The bestknown nonperson of the GDR after Wolf Biermann, he now shows leniency. With its offer the PDS signals not only "that its members have found a very different relationship with me than the crusty old comrades formerly had." At the same time, the PDS "makes clear that it is undergoing a process of internal change." So quickly do Honecker's heirs purify themselves. The writer does not want to report on a PDS meeting where he could have tested his judgment. Instead Heym proclaims "in the interest of the citizens of the GDR" a "true, strong, left opposition," together with the new fellow travelers. Most of all he would like to have along the SPD [Social Democratic Party], quite in line with the People's Front ideology, "if you will." Since the turnaround, the mulish "superior Ossi" [eastern German] has called several times for similarly successful projects. On legendary 4 November 1989, speaker Heym believed that hundreds of thousands of East Berliners had assembled in Alexander Square not only "of their own free will for freedom and democracy," but also "for a socialism worthy of the name." Shortly thereafter, after the opening of the Wall, Heym was shocked by a "fierce horde"--debased by the West--"which, pushing backs against bellies, streamed to Hertie and Bilka [department stores] in the chase of glittering junk." Heym and other intellectuals, who had been permitted to get to know the West despite the Wall, protected themselves from the new, complicated reality. In the proclamation "For Our Country" they still saw a chance at the end of November 1989 "to develop a socialist alternative to the Federal Republic." Later, it seemed sometimes as if the grand old man wanted to own up that the new reality overtaxes him. He once admitted in a small circle debating unification, crisis and the Stasi: "All that bores me." What does he find fascinating? Terse answer: "Myself." But he did not withdraw to edit his novel about communist Karl Radek. In summer of 1992, the much-practiced first signatory lent his name once more, this time to the "Committee for Justice," founded jointly by Gysi and the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] grumbler, Peter-Michael Diestel. "Everyone in this country has a lobby," said Heym at the time, "only the people have none. We want to create that possibility now." The people rejected it, so its new wannabe tribune now himself looks for access to the rostrum. "If you call that vanity--I am so vain that I want to test whether people really like me." Some are worried about the outcome of the experiment. For example, Lothar de Maiziere, the last GDR president, warned his friend Gysi: "Must you deface a monument?" Deputy SPD Chairman Wolfgang Thierse, who is a candidate in the same electoral district as Heym, also questions whether his competitor "knows what he is doing to himself and his admirers by changing sides." His rival evidently considers such friendly objections by politician and Germanic linguist Thierse a misunderstanding: Admirers are "buyers of my books"--and there were plenty of them. Heym cannot see a change in sides: Like the PDS, he had "always been for democracy and socialism, and I still am." The 80-year-old candidate does not want to proclaim great tidings, and he promises nothing. Heym even distanced himself from the idea of at least assuring the voters: "I will not bore you." The gray panther is looking forward with devilish glee to being able to open the 13th legislative period as president by age with a tremendous speech. Unless another party "finds an even nicer elderly gentleman than myself."
