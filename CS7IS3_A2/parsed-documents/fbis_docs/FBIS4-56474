FBIS4-56474 "drlat086_q_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Paraquay Cattle Exchanged for High-Grade Bolivian Cocaine Cattle Exchanged for High-Grade Bolivian Cocaine PY0405011094 Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish 3 May 94 p 91 PY0405011094 Asuncion ABC COLOR Spanish BFN [Text] The 290 kg of crystallized cocaine that National Narcotics Directorate (Dinar) personnel recently seized in Vallemi is allegedly linked to the ongoing exchange of Paraguayan cattle for high-grade Bolivian cocaine. Police sources released this information yesterday, adding that the backgrounds of several local cattle breeders are currently under investigation. It is assumed that the cocaine is being brought into Paraguay and exchanged for cattle, preferably cows capable of surviving and reproducing in the Bolivian climate, so as to replenish Bolivia's cattle stock. Drug enforcement agents arrested Paraguayans Victoriano Gomez, 41, ID card No. 2,919,135; and Juan Albino Frutos, 44, a tradesman born in Bahia Negra, ID card No. 1,788,598. The two were carrying 20 kg of crystallized cocaine en route to Europe, where the black market value of the shipment is over $20 million. Initial reports indicated that the discovery and seizure of the narcotics was possible thanks to information that the U.S. Embassy in Asuncion supplied to Dinar. According to rumors, the U.S. Embassy received encrypted information on this affair via satellite from the Department of State in Washington, following an investigation ordered by the Pentagon. Reliable sources have indicated that the Clinton administration is closely following South American drug enforcement programs, especially in Bolivia and Paraguay, an area which is considered to be "of interest for the security of the United States." It would seem that the recent seizure in Vallemi awakened a great deal of interest among Washington officials because the "cattle meat" connection is involved, sources close to the case said. Meanwhile, Dinar sources have been saying that the seizure in Vallemi was the result of patient investigations carried out in Fuerte Olimpo and Bahia Negra.
