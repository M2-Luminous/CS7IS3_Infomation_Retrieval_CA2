And God loveth not those who do mischief.) [Koranic verse] God says: (Not will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can. [Koranic verse] While the Zionist enemy is waving the mirage of peace, an officer from the occupation army stormed into the al-Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today to kill more than 90 unarmed worshipers kneeling in prayer. The treacherous occupation army finished off the rest, thus raising the number of the massacre victims. The Muslim Brotherhood strongly condemns this ugly criminal incident which shows the perfidious and corrupt nature inherent in the treacherous enemy. They call on the international community to hold an urgent Security Council session to discuss the status of the Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem; to place these areas under international supervision; and to send international forces to protect unarmed civilians, women, and children and protect the Islamic and Christian holy places. They also call for holding free elections under neutral international supervision to choose representatives of the Palestinian people in this part of Palestine, which the United Nations admits is under occupation, so as to govern these areas, protect its people, and manage their affairs. They demand that no agreement, which has been drawn without their will and where their opinion has not been legitimately sought, be imposed on this people. This ugly incident clearly indicates the aggressive nature of the Zionist enemy who has gathered [the Jews] scattered all over the world, usurped the country, and expelled its owners who have become either refugees or displaced persons, or are living under repression and occupation. This is a racist, aggressive, and expansionist entity that does not acknowledge or seek peace and waves the banners of peace only to deceive and to achieve further expansion and superiority. The Arab and Islamic nation is called upon at this critical time to rally under the banner of Islam (And hold fast, all together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided among yourselves) [Koranic verse], make ready your strength to the utmost to deter aggression and protect the innocent, and not to slip into the false mirage. The continued full boycott of the Zionist enemy is a pressing demand under these circumstances until the full rights of the Arab and Islamic people in the land of Palestine are restored. O Islamic peoples. The path of Islam is the path to deliverance. Applying God Almighty's shari'ah is the way to retrieve rights and attain sovereignty. O steadfast Palestinian people: Hold on to your religion. Hold on to your land. Lift up the intifadah all over Palestine. Raise the banner of jihad because it is the only way to attain glory, dignity, independence, and life. (So lose no heart, nor fall into despair: for ye must gain mastery if ye are true in Faith) (If a wound hath touched you, be sure a similar wound hath touched the others) [Koranic verses] Know ye that the Islamic nation in general and the Arab one in particular are supporting you with all their might and resources and their hearts are with you. They are waiting for the day when they break the shackles that are preventing them from participating effectively with you in liberating the whole holy land. Tomorrow is not that far away. And God hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not. [Koranic verse] God is great. Thanks be to God and God's prayers and peace be with our master Muhammad, his scion, and his companions. [Signed] Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr. General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood.
