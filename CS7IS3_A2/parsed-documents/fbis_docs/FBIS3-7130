Minister Uthai made the remarks in his speech to about 600 representatives from 21 countries in Asia and the Pacific at the conference held in Malaysia during 22 to 24 March 1994. He said while countries in the world have moved since 1980 toward groupings as regional trade blocs and Europe has already declared its single market in 1990, the Asian region should consider the ASEAN Free Trade Area, or AFTA, to increase its efficiency to survive and take advantage of the ASEAN wide market. He recommended that AFTA be a potential tool for trade promotion in the region. He said that the free trade system will lead the Asian region and ASEAN to the world market as well as to induce foreign investors to the region.
