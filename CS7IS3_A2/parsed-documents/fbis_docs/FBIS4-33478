Our Islamic and national culture is too strong to be negatively affected by such minor issues...." We too fully agree with the remarks by the esteemed Majles speaker, that our country has a rich and strong Islamic and national culture. But contrary to his view, we are extremely concerned over the importation of some American goods and the bad effects that this may have, and we believe that this issue should be studied from several aspects. In our opinion, we should pose this question from another angle and ask the esteemed Majles speaker: What vital need does our country have for American soft drinks and cigarettes? And what dangers can the banning of such imports have on our Islamic homeland? We should also recall that during last year's session of the G-7, the Americans placed the topic of banning the export of technology to Iran on their agenda and insisted--together with the British Government--that this decision be approved. And today, if in some part of the industrial world there is a country or a company that is transferring technology to Islamic Iran, it becomes the target of strong criticisms by the American bully.... And finally, the esteemed Majles speaker, who is a revolutionary figure with a bright record, definitely knows that the sale of American technology and of the diplomacy of exploiting this technology go hand in hand, as do their arms sales and arms policy. This point is so clear that it does not need any further explanation. Therefore, if "some American goods" means items like Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, cigarettes, chocolate, chips, and so on--that is, items for which the country has no need--the importation and sale of these items is an insult to the Muslim nation and to those who have shed their blood for this nation. And if American goods means technological products, then the Americans sell such products only if this sale is coupled with the acceptance--by the buyer--of the policy that they want to be accepted. But this is only one side of the coin. The other side of the coin should be sought in the views of our late imam, may his soul be sanctified, when he boycotted American imports. We believe that opening up the market of Islamic Iran to American goods will fill the pockets of the bloodthirsty and plundering capitalists of that country with astronomical profits, and will greatly harm our economy, while also helping the Americans do what they usually do in other countries--that is, couple the export of their products with the export of their culture and influence. But the sagacious view of our late imam, may his soul be sanctified, on the significance of boycotting American products is much more profound than this. A mere part of what he meant can be seen in his remarks that: The boycotting of American products will keep alive the deep hostility and spite as well as the memory of the crimes perpetrated by the Americans against our Muslim and oppressed nation in the minds of future generations and will prevent them from forgetting this hatred. On the other hand, Islamic Iran has been recognized as the standard-bearer of pure Mohammedan Islam among the Muslim nations, and all facts show that the other Muslims consider Islamic Iran's actions to be an acceptable pattern that they too can follow. The boycotting of American products is tantamount to a line that is drawn between Islam and its major enemy--America. The answer to the question of why Islamic Iran has boycotted American goods shows the true identity of the great satan; and this is what our generation needs today. Finally, we are well aware of the fact that the esteemed Majles speaker's remarks did not mean that he was issuing a permit for the import and sale of American goods, but that they referred to the wealth of our Islamic and national culture and an effort to remove any misgivings that the import of some American goods means that we will ignore the principle of not having relations with America. In another part of his news conference he also explicitly referred to this issue. However, the concern does exist that there will be some who will exploit part of his remarks.
