Not even a Social Democrat of the superoptimistic variety can interpret the voters' searing blow in the European Union [EU] election as a victory for the prime minister, his party, or his government. The fact that Nyrup Rasmussen was nevertheless not in full mourning is due first and foremost to the fact that the election result -- no matter how demoralizing it may be for the Social Democratic Party [SDP] -- nevertheless contains some encouraging elements for the prime minister. Or it does so at least if he performs the experiment of shifting the voters' judgment over to the Folketing election, which lies only a few months into the future. Prior to this election the major unknown is: Will the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progress Party achieve an absolute majority? -- a question that the prime minister in particular can be expected to be much concerned with in the months ahead. In the light of this it is probably not incorrect to assume that Nyrup Rasmussen and his advisers yesterday did some sums of their own. Like adding together the percentage support for the Liberal Party, the Conservative People's Party, and the Progress Party in the EU election. The answer to this sum is 44.4 percent -- that is, a good way below 50 percent of votes. So even if it is humiliating for the Social Democrats to be overtaken by their archrivals, the Liberals and Conservatives, in the European Parliament, there is hope for Nyrup Rasmussen. In this context he can take pleasure in the fact that a large number of the lost Social Democratic votes went to parties and movements that either will not run in the Folketing elections or are to be considered "friends." The Social Democrats have, therefore, every justification to expect that some of the Social Democrats who chose to vote for the June Movement or the People's Movement [Against the EC] will return "home" in the Folketing elections. At the same time the EU election has acted as a sort of safety valve for Social Democrats frustrated by the EU: Now their dissatisfaction has been demonstrated and beginning with the Folketing elections it will again be domestic political issues that determine where they place their crosses. Or this is what Nyrup Rasmussen hopes at least. Nevertheless the election must give the prime minister one or two things to think about -- also from the domestic viewpoint. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen must think not least about what is wrong with the Social Democratic election machine. Before the EU election it was the general assumption that the Social Democrats' enormous machine would through an effective election campaign be able to win some of the doubters over into the fold. As we now know, the maneuver did not succeed very well. And this despite the fact that in the last weeks of the election campaign Nyrup Rasmussen invested all his authority as prime minister in it. Not even his confrontations on television with [Liberal Party leader] Uffe Ellemann-Jensen were much help. This depressing fact must result in some wrinkling of the foreheads among the Social Democrats. For even if their list of candidates was not dominated by the great personalities, the inescapable question thrusts itself on party activists -- and partners in government: If Nyrup could not give us a good election this time -- who says that he will be able to do so next time? And the fact that the Social Democratic Party's coffers are not exactly full on the eve of the Folketing elections must further contribute to the nervousness. But the biggest worry for the Social Democrats is of course the gulf between the party's official European stance and its core voters' more than skeptical view of the EU. And given the emphatic demonstration of the Social Democratic opposition to the EU Poul Nyrup Rasmussen will now be forced to adjust his policy in the European sphere. Where the prime minister would have preferred much great freedom of action in the run-up to the decisive intergovernmental conference in 1996, his hands are in reality now firmly tied by the blow he received from the voters yesterday. To put it briefly: He has no option other than a particularly defensive European strategy. The voters' judgment on this point cannot be misunderstood. Now the prime minister needs time to digest the signal. And then strategy must be adjusted accordingly. In the light of this at least the Folketing election -- the date of which is still not known -- has not come any closer. And in addition, the prime minister has his own psychological reasons for wanting a very late election: The odor of defeat that the EU election has inflicted on the Social Democrats must be gone before Poul Nyrup Rasmussen goes out to meet the voters in what will probably be the most open and decisive Folketing elections for many years.
