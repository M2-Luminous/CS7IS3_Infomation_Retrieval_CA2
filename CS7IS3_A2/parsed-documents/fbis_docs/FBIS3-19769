The young pilots are to arrive at the Lufthansa passenger plane pilot school in Phoenix, Arizona, by the end of this month. The tender was issued by Air China, the largest of the seven Chinese airlines. Lufthansa hopes that it will subsequently be able to take over the training program for the Boeing 737, which would be held in Bremen. Since aviation is increasing in China, thousands of pilots have to be trained, a Lufthansa spokesman said. At the end of the 1980's, the passenger plane pilot school took over consulting tasks at the pilot school in central China.
