[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is "entering the arena" in Rome, while [League Secretary] Bossi "presides" in Milan. From Tuscany northward the League will control 70 percent of the single-candidate constituencies of the north (which total 360 between the lower house and the Senate) and is offering Berlusconi and the other allies 30 percent. An exception is being made for Lombardy (including Milan), where Forza Italia will have 40 percent, taking on the Christian Democratic Center (Mastella and Casini), the former Liberals, the former Pact members, and the Pannella group. From Tuscany southward, Forza Italia, [National Alliance leader] Fini and the alliance that is joining the north agreed and signed a parallel and similar accord last night (Berlusconi was absent and was represented by the loyal Marcello Dell'Utri). It included the fielding of a single symbol in the constituencies of central and southern Italy. As expected, matters of form have been "salvaged": Berlusconi is represented (together with the centrist vestiges of the former five-party alliance) throughout Italy. He is strengthened separately in the north by Bossi's League and in the south by Fini's National Alliance. Silvio Berlusconi run for a single-candidate constituency in central Rome and in three proportional constituencies in Rome, Naples, and Palermo. The distribution of candidates is gradually taking shape, amid disputes and minor agreements. Here are the latest developments in detail. Progressive forces -- There have been periods of conflict and pacifications. Negotiations are resuming in Sicily following the dispute between the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and Rete. The battle over the distribution of candidates seems to have ended, and now "each party at the negotiating table will have made some small or major sacrifice on behalf of this extraordinary project, without jeopardizing the radicalism we so cherish," Rete's Pippo Russo explained. The negotiations continued Sunday [13 February]. The issue remains entirely unresolved in Tuscany. "Unfortunately we are proceeding with a system very similar to the old cronyism, with no renewal and no consideration for the quality of the candidates," according to the Democratic Alliance's Willer Bordon. "There are too many bureaucrats around. If we are not satisfied we will not conclude the negotiations regardless of the cost." Amid the flurry of ultimatums, there is strong competition for the safest constituencies -- often those of the PDS. This is nothing new. The Greens' Stefano Apuzzo took issue with the "antireformers" who draw up "losing lists of apparatchiks, disreputable faces and gray phantom officials, party bureaucrats." The progressive forces' negotiations "are carefully planning the defeat of the left-wing forces." Enzo Mattina (Socialist Renewal) issued this protest after abandoning the Lazio progressive forces grouping, and did not rule out "autonomous lists." He described it as a matter of "pride and dignity." He challenged the PDS' "excessive hegemony, which gives preference to the Social Christian group, whose strength and support are still entirely unproven," to the detriment of the socialist component. In Umbria the negotiations ended with no candidates for the Greens and Rete (which failed to secure acceptance for Mario Capanna). The following are running under the progressive banner: Walter Veltroni, Mauro Agostini, Maria Rita Lorenzetti, Guido De Guidi, Carlo Carpinelli, journalists Ferdinando Adornato, Paolo Raffaelli, and Giuseppe Giulietti (RAI [state broadcasting service] staff union members), Carlo Gubbini, Leonardo Caponi, Fabrizio Bracco, and Antonietta Modolo. Representing the entertainment industry, director Giuseppe Tornatore (Palermo) declined (because of work commitments), while disc jockey Jovanotti (Milan) passed up the offer of "an alignment toward which I feel well disposed." Center -- [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni asked two television news reporters to run in Florentine constituencies: Federico Scoiano agreed, while Vittorio Citterich remains undecided. Producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori is standing as a PPI candidate in Florence. The former Liberal attorney Piero Milio is running for the Senate in Palermo with the Pact group; he has defended not only Bruno Contrada (Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security Service]) but also Tano Grasso and Boris Giuliano's family. Right -- The League will again filed almost all its outgoing members of the lower house and the Senate, with a couple of exceptions. Bossi is running in Milan (single-candidate constituency) and in Lombardy 2 (proportional); [league lower house floor leader] Maroni in Varese and Lombardy; and Fassino in Turin. Bossi's doctor, Binaghi, is also standing in the same city. Forza Italia is fielding Fininvest attorney Vittorio Dotti in Milan; criminal lawyer Della Valle in Monza; Ombretta Colli (Gaber's wife) in Saronno. Among the Liberals, Minister Costa is running in Mondovi, Alfredo Biondi in Genoa, and economist Scognamiglio in Milan 3.
