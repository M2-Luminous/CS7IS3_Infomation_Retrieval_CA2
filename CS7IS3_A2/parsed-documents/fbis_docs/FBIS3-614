[Canana] We do not have updated information on that matter, but it is possible that some 100,000 people continue to stay in Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia. [Elias] We have learned in Catandica that people who return via United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR]-organized repatriation continue to receive aid for 18 months. However, those who return by their own means -- and we believe that is the majority -- do not benefit from such aid. It is rather senseless discrimination.... [Canana] I do not know. Any person who arrives, be it officially or informally, receives the same treatment once inside this country. What may well happen is that one family arrives and it does not register immediately. When that happens, the authorities have no idea who or where those people are. This is why we have registry personnel in every district and administrative area. They are there principally to deal with unofficial arrivals. They go from village to village registering the arrivals of families. Then, they take that information to the district which, in turn, provides aid. They receive exactly the same aid that is given to those who arrive officially. Where the difference lies is that the people who return officially do receive some items at departure points, notably household goods. Those who arrive unofficially do not receive those things. That is a difference, but they all get aid for the same 18-month period. We still reach Mossurize through Zimbabwe [Elias] What is the government's concrete role in the aid given to those refugees, over and above the support granted by the nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]? [Canana] Even the aid by the NGO's is already an action on the part of the government. The NGO's do not discover what needs to be done. They go about their work after preliminary contacts with us. We have some infrastructure that needs rehabilitating, so we negotiate with those organizations and each one of them does what it can in accordance with its capabilities. We share and we define priorities, notably in the water, roads, health, and education sectors. Each NGO does what it can within that framework and whatever is outstanding is financed by the State Budget. [Elias] Do you think that all of Manica Province's secondary and tertiary roads will be open to use before elections are due to be held? [Canana] I do not think so. Our capabilities do not match the great requirements or the volume of work at hand. We only have one specialized enterprise and that is ECMEP [expansion unknown]. In addition to that enterprise's technical weaknesses, there is also the problem of financial incapacity. On the basis of the work that has been done in this province, it is our belief that we will only be able to complete the rehabilitation of all access routes by 1996 and that only if there are no other obstacles. Last year's road rehabilitation plan was fulfilled and we have already started implementing the plan for this year. [Elias] Is road rehabilitation work being done without any problems in Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]-controlled areas? [Canana] We have had problems in those areas and we continue to have them. Immediately after the cease-fire accord was signed, we decided that priority should be given to the rehabilitation of roads leading to areas which had been inaccessible during the war. One example is Mossurize District. However, even now we must still go through Zimbabwean territory to get to Mossurize. We have not found common ground with Renamo concerning reopening the national road to that district. Rather, I should say that we were forbidden to do so. We had also given priority to the road to Dombe, but they also stopped us from rehabilitating it. We have found another road to Dombe, along National Route One, but it is a much longer route, something like 100 km more. We are working in other areas where there are no restrictions. The parties must prove they are serious [Elias] Many people view the country's central region as the region where Renamo enjoys most influence. If that is true, do you think that it will be possible for the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party to win in Manica Province in the upcoming October elections? [Canana] Well, that is one reading of the situation. Each person reads it in his or her own way. Like all the other parties, Renamo and Frelimo must prove to the people that they are serious. I do not want to think like the population. [sentence as published] They know whether Renamo has done good or bad. The Frelimo Party also knows, and I think it has done well. It is not the accused that goes on the stand to declare that it has won. You must wait for the judge. The people are the ones who must say whether Renamo is dominant in the central region. We are going to wait for our opportunity. The people know what Renamo is, and they know what Frelimo is. It knows the people, it works with them. Renamo has done a lot of work here. It has worked very hard, but only the people can tell whether it was good or bad work. The Frelimo Party is present throughout the country. Only the people know whether we are doing well or poorly and only they will be able to answer that question. Let us wait and see. Ask me that question again in November, once elections are behind us. [Elias] What space have the other "unarmed" parties been gaining in Manica Province? [Canana] I do not believe they can do more than they have so far. Those parties that are represented here are making an effort to get through to the masses. I would not expect more than that. Their penetration hinges on their conditions, their skills, their work, their publicity, and their knowledge about the population. That is not something that you can acquire from one day to the next. That is something that takes time. I believe that the formerly emergent parties now should have another name because they have taken cognizance of that reality. They are not managing the sort of penetration we have had. That is impossible. We have the years that we have behind us. It would be like expecting you to have as much grey hair as your father. Your father gets grey hair as a result of many years of life. We have the penetration we have thanks to our years. When those parties become more mature, then, sure, they will also be sufficiently well known. We have our years and we are proud of them. [Elias] Those "unarmed" parties are virtually unknown out here.... [Canana] They are not particularly well known, but they are known. [Elias] In October of last year, MEDIAFAX published an opinion poll by Gestinform which suggested that your work in this province is viewed unfavorably.... [Canana] I am not commenting. They talked with the people. I think that it is only natural that this person or that should not like my work. They want me to do my work in some other way. Nonetheless, I am calm, I know my duties as a governor, and I know I am fulfilling them in accordance with the means and the capabilities the state has been making available to me. That opinion poll is just an opinion poll. It may, or may not, be right. Whether it is right or not, it is just an opinion poll. The fact is that I do not feel that citizens lack trust in me. [Elias] Does it perhaps not have to do with the fact that you were not born in Manica Province? [Canana] I can tell you that I have been a public servant for close on 25 years, of which I only worked five in the province where I was born. I always worked away from it as an assistant and then in more senior capacities. I have never felt any rejection on account of the fact that I was not born in the place where I was working and the same thing happens here in Manica Province. I have never felt that this or that citizen disliked me because I am not from here. I am not here to represent the interests of some ethnic group. I am here to ensure that laws are complied with and that citizens are afforded protection. I do what I possibly can to fulfill those goals. [Elias] Perhaps you have concluded that the opinion poll was not done correctly. [Canana] Correctly or otherwise, I do not know. I do not know why we should arrive at such a conclusion. Perhaps it was conducted in a correct manner. I would not like to assess it myself. I am also not going to comment on an assessment that is somewhat secretive. If something should happen, the citizens already have that information. The citizens talk, and we always talk with the people. When the people have a problem, they approach the official and say that his work is not to their benefit. If they continue to be displeased about the work done by that official, the people have the chance to complain about him to a more senior official when the latter comes around. I think that people have something to say, whether in a secretive or in an open system. Has the electoral campaign not begun? [Elias] What will be your role in the electoral campaign as a member of the Frelimo Party? [Canana] As a provincial governor, I do not have a specific role within Frelimo. As a member of the Frelimo Party Central Committee, I might be given certain tasks by my party. [Elias] Have you not started playing that role yet, seeing that you are a Frelimo Party Central Committee member? [Canana] As you are aware, the electoral campaign has not begun yet. [Elias] But it is difficult to see that there will be a day when it will be declared that the electoral campaign begins today.... [Canana] Whether directly or indirectly, we in the Frelimo Party are generally contributing toward the successful implementation of the peace process in all its spheres and that necessarily includes creating the conditions needed for general elections. As a governor, it is my duty to select cadres for the provincial commission. Infrastructure must be created for the provincial commission and the technical secretariat to function. Technical cadres must also be chosen for the electoral census. By law, that must be done by the governor. That work is specifically intended for the elections and not for the electoral campaign. As a member of the Frelimo Party Central Committee I might, however, be awarded a different task in terms of the electoral campaign. I expect I will be given such tasks quite soon. The Electoral Law does not forbid me, as a government official, from participating in my party's electoral campaign. [Elias] We have learned that Mr. Coelho, the owner of the Garuzo tourist resort, has been ordered by the Interior Ministry to leave the country in 24 hours. He appealed to the provincial government, which reconsidered the measure.... [Canana] That is not true. Coelho has been a resident in this country for many years, and, as far as I know, he does not have any problems. Those who have problems are his daughter and his son-in-law, and those are problems they did not get into in this province. I do not know exactly where they got into those problems, but it seems that it was up in Nampula Province. It was for that reason that their residence permits were not extended.
