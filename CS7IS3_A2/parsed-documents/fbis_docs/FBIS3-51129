It was a "marvelous visit which our delegation greatly appreciated," Savage said at a news conference. The Canadian official was accompanied by a large group of businessmen from 17 firms from the important Canadian Atlantic region. During the visit, which the prime minister termed as "very successful," several trade agreements were reached and enterprise projects with Canadian capital were drafted in the areas of industry, agriculture, tourism, and services. "From our viewpoint, and that of the delegation, the trip was very advantageous and it was really worthwhile," said the Canadian politician, who won the post of Nova Scotian prime minister for the Liberal Party last May. Savage, a medical doctor who is the first Canadian provincial prime minister to visit Cuba in 17 years, described Fidel Castro as a "hospitable, very vigorous" man and a politician "with a vast knowledge and with a wide range of topics to discuss. "It was a fluid, light, and interesting conversation which we enjoyed greatly," the Nova Scotia prime minister added. Meanwhile, Dr. Patricia Lane, president of Lane Environment Ltd. consulting firm, told PRENSA LATINA about her satisfaction with the meeting with Fidel Castro, during which she was "greatly impressed," she said. "I have known and met with many outstanding politicians and I have worked in many countries, but I have never met a world leader with so much knowledge about the environment and sustainable development," the businesswoman said. Her company agreed to work in association with the Cubans in the development of ecological tourism, a form of tourism that is currently gaining popularity in the world, "to which Cuba has much to contribute because of its wealth of natural resources."
