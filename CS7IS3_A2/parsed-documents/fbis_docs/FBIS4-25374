[Reporter] Mr Ambassador, what comments would you like to make about Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's visit to China? [Rogachev] The visit achieved substantial results and was constructive. The two countries signed seven agreements with extensive content. This further strengthened the legal foundation for the friendly cooperation between the two countries, and was a giant step forward in our bilateral relations. I deeply appreciate President Jiang Zemin's opinion on the need to have foresight in Russian-Chinese relations. President Jiang Zemin will visit Russia in the autumn of this year, and this will become another major milestone in the annals of Russian-Chinese relations. [Reporter] Recently, Chinese and Russian leaders both stressed the need to face the 21st century and to consider and handle bilateral relations from this high plain. The Russian side also proposed the establishment of a "constructive partnership" with China. Mr Ambassador, would you please further explanation this? [Rogachev] The proposal about the "constructive partnership" was put forth by President Yeltsin early this year. Recently, when meeting Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, President Jiang Zemin said: China thought that the Russian proposal was close to the five principles of peaceful coexistence China maintains for the development of state-to-state relations. The Russian side also agreed that the Chinese position coincided with with the Russian conception about the "constructive partnership." By "constructive partnership," we mean that as two great countries, Russia and China are completely equal, and there is no such thing as a "big brother" and a "little brother." Russia and China are both big powers in the world and share the same objectives of peace, security, and cooperation in international affairs. We hope to build close cooperative relations with China on the international stage and, first of all, in the Asia-Pacific region. The "constructive partnership" between the two countries should not harm the interests of any third country. [Reporter] Mr Ambassador, in what ways do you think that Mr Prime Minister's visit to China has promoted the further development of Sino-Russian economic and trade relations? [Rogachev] This time, the two countries signed a series of economic agreements on preventing double taxation and tax evasion. This will ensure the further development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. In addition, the joint committee of the two countries for economic, trade, scientific and technological cooperation also formulated a series of measures for resolving problems appearing in the course of bilateral economic and trade cooperation. [Reporter] Last year, the volume of bilateral trade between China and Russia reached an all-time high, but it declined somewhat in the first quarter of this year as compared with the same period last year. How should this phenomenon be viewed? [Rogachev] In my opinion, we should not exaggerate the seriousness of this issue. This was related to the economic conditions of the two countries. For example, the period of barter trade has come to an end. The two sides have to immediately take measures for the transition to a better-organized form of trade based on cash settlement. Of course, bilateral trade is also constrained by some other factors. For example, the banking system is still rather weak, and relevant laws and regulations have yet to be further improved. [Reporter] In your opinion, what measures should be adopted in order to push Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation to a new stage? [Rogachev] We hope that China will increase investment in Russia, and the Russian side also plans to increase use of China's labor resources to develop infrastructural facilities in the Far East region. We shall also provide high and new technologies for your country in energy and other fields. Russian entrepreneurs hope to have the opportunity to participate in the Three Gorges project and other major construction projects in China. We have not yet made full use of the advantageous geographical condition of two countries which are adjacent to each other. The two governments should create better conditions for economic and trade cooperation at the border areas on both sides and should increase cooperation in the field of production. [Reporter] Mr Ambassador, would you please describe the development prospects of Sino-Russian relations? [Rogachev] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin said in Beijing that the two countries should work out an intermediate and long-term program for economic, trade, scientific, and technological cooperation. China and the Soviet Union have signed documents of this type in the past, but things have changed so greatly that we should update such documents on the basis of giving consideration to the wishes of Russia's Far East region and China's Northeast region. I believe that our two countries will make great developments and achievements in cooperation extending beyond the 21st century.
