Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said he or Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev intended to travel to NATO headquarters here at an undetermined date to sign both documents at once. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been pressing Russia to join the Partnership For Peace (PFP) programme of military cooperation between NATO and former communist countries. But Moscow has indicated it will sign the partnership programme only if NATO agrees to a parallel accord of political cooperation between Russia and the Western Alliance. Grachev said he would be presenting Russia's proposals for the partnership, plus "concept" proposals for a bilateral relationship, to NATO here Wednesday. "In principle we are ready to sign (the partnership) even if it is not a Russian initiative," he said, but suggested strongly that Moscow would not accept the PFP without the separate bilateral accord. Grachev was speaking ahead of a meeting with the NATO defence ministers to present Russia's long-awaited new military doctrine to replace the security blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union. NATO has said it is particularly anxious to find out how Russia intends to treat its "near abroad" -- other republics of the former Soviet Union with Russian minorities.
