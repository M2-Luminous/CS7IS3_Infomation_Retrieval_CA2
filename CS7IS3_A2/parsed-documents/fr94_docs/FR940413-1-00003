FR940413-1-00003 FR940413-1-00001 Current statutes provide that only commodities produced in the U.S. may be considered eligible for use in U.S. Government-assisted export programs. These programs have proved to be an important vehicle for developing commercial export markets, meeting humanitarian food needs, and spurring economic and agricultural growth in developing countries. In essence, the programs help U.S. agricultural producers by developing and expanding export markets for their commodities and improving the competitiveness of those commodities in world markets. For example, in the case of wheat, approximately 80 percent of U.S. wheat exported in recent years was done so under at least one of USDA's export programs. Given that the U.S. is striving toward a free and fair environment for the trade of agricultural commodities in North America (e.g., through NAFTA and Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)), the Congress, recognizing the important role that U.S. Government-assisted export programs play in the U.S. economy, has approved legislation which endeavors to ensure the integrity of such programs. The main question this notice poses is: What type of end-use certificate system will best accomplish the objective of helping ensure that foreign agricultural commodities are not used in U.S. Government-assisted export programs while still maintaining compatibility with the grain merchandising system of the U.S.? Are current handling and reporting requirements such that the gathering of additional information on the use of imported grain will be sufficient to meet U.S. origin requirements of Government-assisted export programs? Or are more stringent handling requirements necessary to ensure that imported grain will not be used in U.S. Government-assisted export programs? While one of several alternative systems could be implemented, all systems have advantages and disadvantages. Thus, consideration must be given to the effects such a system will have on U.S. producers, importers, warehouses, grain handlers, millers, processors, exporters, feedlot operators, and ultimately, U.S. consumers. II. U.S. Grain System vs. Canadian Grain System Because Canada is the only country currently requiring end-use certificates, a comparison of the U.S. and Canadian marketing systems is helpful. The handling and distribution of grain in the U.S. is based on blending various grades and qualities from different locations to reach the quality attributes desired by the buyer. The Canadian grain handling and distribution system is quite different. That system preserves the origin and, in some cases, the variety of Canadian grain. Blending and commingling different lots of grain are not part of normal commercial practices in Canada. III. Canadian End-Use System The Canadian end-use system reflects their marketing system. The Government of Canada (GOC) requires that U.S. milling wheat and barley imported into Canada be accompanied by an end-use certificate. This is to ensure that non-Canadian grain does not become commingled with Canadian grain. The GOC position is that it wants to protect Canada's strict varietal licensing system which has been designed to select what they view as superior quality grain varieties. In addition, mirroring U.S. concern, the GOC wants to avoid any concern that U.S. grain might take advantage of GOC domestic or export programs, such as the Western Grain Transportation Act. When a U.S. grain exporter wants to ship grain to Canada, an end-user (the consignee) must be identified. The U.S. grain must be consigned directly to a milling, manufacturing, brewing, distilling, or other processing facility for consumption at that facility. Three months after the Canadian consignee receives the imported U.S. grain, the consignee is required to file quarterly reports until the imported grain has been fully consumed as a food or feed ingredient. After the grain has arrived at the location specified in the end-use certificate, it must be stored and handled separately and cannot be moved or used for any other purpose than that specified in the end-use certificate without the permission of the GOC. Grain imported into Canada for direct feed-use must be ``denatured'' before it can be transported across the border. GOC regulations define ``denatured'' as any lot containing at least 10 percent permanently colored kernels. IV. Alternatives for a U.S. End-Use System
