What the IAEA wants from North Korea exceeds the IAEA's powers. North Korea will not permit this. This represents interference in North Korea's internal affairs, it was said. North Korea refers to a special status, which it allegedly has because of the latest agreements with the IAEA. The IAEA categorically rejects such a special status by North Korea. [passage omitted] In the afternoon the IAEA General Council will meet in Vienna. It is not expected that the IAEA will resign itself to North Korea's attitude. [passage omitted]
