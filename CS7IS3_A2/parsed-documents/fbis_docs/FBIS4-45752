The delegation, led by Shi Jianmin, vice minister of China's State Planning Commission, arrived in Japan on Sunday. It is scheduled to meet with several governmental and business organizations including the Foreign Ministry, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
