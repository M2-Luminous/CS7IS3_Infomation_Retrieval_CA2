The multipurpose plants they exported were not especially constructed for the production of chemical weapons, it was stated. In its opinion, the court referred to unfit penal provisions. The proceedings led to the "bitter finding" that the FRG had made the export of weapons-grade chemical plants possible for 30 years. Four other employees of the firm will be sentenced today. With three managers of the former firm WET in Hamburg, one of the acquitted persons still has to answer for the export of an alleged bomb production line.
