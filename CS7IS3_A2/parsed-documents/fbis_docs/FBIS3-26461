The mission to initially establish a socialist market economic structure by the end of this century, as proposed by the party's central committee, is magnificent and achievable through hard work. After 14 years of market-oriented reform and opening up, by and large, we possess the basic conditions for moving over to a socialist market economy. Some localities in Fujian, Quanzhou City for instance, which have been advancing at a faster development pace, have positively conducted comprehensive experiments with reform and opening up with markets as an orientation for many years, gradually smashed the bonds of the traditional planned economy, and initially presented the embryonic form of a socialist market economic structure. To sum up, it has been propped up by the following six basic pillars. First, economic sectors have become diversified. An economic structure, with the sector under public ownership as a main body and the multiple sectors coexisting, is a prerequisite for the development of the socialist market economy. Public ownership is the core of the socialist economic system. Practicing a market economy under socialist conditions should and must always stick to the principle of taking the public sector as a main body and properly combining public ownership with the market economy. However, it is impossible for a unitary ownership to develop into a market economy. If there is only one ownership by the whole people, or there is only one owner -- the state then, in the entire economic operation, there will not be real commodities, exchange of commodities, and markets in a strict sense. Hence, in practicing a market economy under socialist conditions, it is a correct direction to stick to the principle of having multiple economic sectors with the public sector as the main body. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, people in Quanzhou have aimed at one principle -- they will courageously experiment on and put into practice everything that is beneficial to the development of socialist productive forces. They took the lead in breaking through the model of unitary public ownership, explored the possibility of practicing the ownership structure with the public sector as a main body and the coexistence of the multiple sectors, and encouraged the simultaneous development of state-owned, collective, individual, private, and foreign-funded economic sectors so that its economic pattern has undergone gradual changes. In the industrial area, township and town enterprises have sprung up everywhere and foreign-invested, individual, and private enterprises of nonpublic sectors have emerged in large multitudes. In 1992, there were 27,807 industrial enterprises with 847,200 employees throughout the city, their total output value reached 15 billion yuan, and their taxes handed over to the state totalled 1.268 billion yuan. In the commercial area, they have also broken through the situation wherein business was monopolized by state and cooperative commercial sectors and individual business households and urban and rural trade fairs have been flourishing. Second, markets are holding an increasingly important position in economic operations. Market mechanisms have exercised the role of a foundation in the allocation of resources, which is a major content of the socialist market economy. The market economy takes market as a foundation, a center, as well as an orientation. It calls for all economic activities to be directly or indirectly related to markets and regulated by market mechanisms. Fundamentally speaking, the transition from a planned to a market economic structure is a change in the pattern of resource allocation. Under the planned economic structure, the allocation of resources was achieved by a series of mandatory administrative plans. Under the conditions of a market economy, however, production is decided by social demands and the rational allocation of resources is achieved by markets in conjunction with production, circulation, distribution, and consumption. In the reform which takes the market as an orientation, Quanzhou paid attention to exercising the regulatory role of market mechanisms and gradually reduced the scope and changed the mode of planned management. In particular, as soon as township and town enterprises were set up, they were guided by markets, their essential elements including funds, technology, raw and semifinished materials, labor power, and so on were allocated and regulated through markets and their operational activities were targeted at markets. At present, the industrial products produced under mandatory planning in Quanzhou have been reduced from the previous 60 to two categories -- cigarettes and salt, and those produced under guidance planning have been reduced from 23 to eight categories. In agricultural production, planning according to different varieties and seasons has been canceled except for the control of total demand and supply. The price formative mechanism was generally based on markets. Except for a small number of important commodities and labor services the prices of which were set by the state, most of the other commodities and labor services were regulated by markets. The prices of agricultural and sideline products, except for some traditional Chinese medicines, were all set by the markets, the control of grain prices was completely lifted, and the prices of industrial means of production were unified. In 1992, the portion of prices set by the state only accounted for 2.7 percent in the retail volume of social commodities, while the portion regulated by markets was 97 percent. Markets are carriers [zai ti 6528 7555] of the operation of market mechanisms and the perfection of market mechanisms depends on a sound market system. In the market system, all commodities and production factors including land, funds, labor power, and technology must all enter the markets. Without a well-developed commodity market and a perfect market of production factors, there will not be a modern market economy. For many years, Quanzhou persisted in proceeding from the reality, mobilized the strength from various quarters in society, and dedicated itself to the cultivation and construction of markets. The commodity markets are being perfected day by day and a number of large-scale, powerful, and well-known specialized markets have been formed one after another, which have registered an annual transaction volume of several hundred million yuan and held a certain share in both domestic and foreign markets. Greater progress has also been made in the growth of markets of production factors including labor services, technology, information, funds, real estate, and so on. A fair, competitive, and orderly market system is being established deliberately. Third, enterprises are operating more and more independently. Enterprises are the main body of a market economy and the independent operational activities of enterprises are an internal requirement for the development of a socialist market economic structure. Under the market economic structure, each enterprise is an independent producer and operator, which is a legal person that breaks away from its dependent relations with the government, operates independently, assumes sole responsibility for its own profits and losses, and effects self-development and self-constraint. All the principal parties which participate in market competition are equal. While giving a free hand to developing nonstate economic sectors, Quanzhou has positively promoted the transformation of operational mechanism in state-owned enterprises, further straightened out the relations between ownership and management, and enabled enterprises to enter the "ocean" of markets from the "embrace" of the government so that they will really become the main body of markets, operating independently and assuming sole responsibility for their own profits and losses. The city authority selected a large number of state-owned enterprises and pushed them into commodity markets, production factor markets, and property rights trading markets through contracts, leasing, auctions, grafting together by means of foreign capital, and transformation of operational mechanisms, thereby initially changing the situation whereby the government took up all responsibility for the state-owned enterprises. Up to now, 90 percent of the state-owned enterprises throughout the city have practiced a contract system; 729 state and cooperative commercial enterprises have put into effect the policy of relaxing government control over operation, pricing, distribution, and employment; 21 enterprises have adopted the management methods of foreign-invested enterprises and township and town enterprises; 10 state-owned enterprises have practiced the system under which shares are held by staff and workers as well as legal persons within the enterprises; and 48 enterprises have become joint-ventures, of which 41 state-owned enterprises took the lead in the country in undergoing package transformation to have foreign capital grafted unto them. In this way, they have blazed a new path of transforming operational mechanisms for state-owned enterprises. While exploring ways to establish a modern enterprise system, Quanzhou also positively explored effective organizational forms for state assets suited to the market economy, in accordance with the principle of separating government administration from enterprise and separating ownership from management. The city authorities have set up a state assets management committee and its working body, led by the mayor as committee director and participated in by various economic departments. Besides, a company to carry on the business of state assets has also been set up, so that a new-type state assets operation and management system has been initially established. Fourth, the economy is advancing in the direction of indirect macroscopic regulation and control. Exercising macroscopic regulation and control by the government through economic policies and levers is a necessary means to guarantee the orderly and healthy growth of the market economy. The development of the socialist market economy calls for governments at all levels to conscientiously change government administrative functions and to change from: Relying mainly on direct to mainly on indirect regulation and control; relying mainly on management by mandatory planning to mainly on guidance planning; relying mainly on the use of administrative fiats to mainly on economic policies; relying mainly on the self-development of markets to mainly on the cultivation and organization of markets; and from relying mainly on divisions of money, resources, and targets to mainly on provision of guidance, consultancy, and services. On the basis of understanding market laws, the government should better use such economic levers as prices, interest rates, tariffs, and others as well as legal means to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control. In the course of market economic development, Quanzhou has seriously heeded economic laws and conscientiously brought about the transformation of government functions while pushing enterprises into the markets. It has defined the government functions as "planning, coordination, supervision, and service" and vividly summarized the government's relationship with enterprises as "welcoming their investment, collecting taxes for their profits, checking and acting upon their lawbreaking activities, and offering sympathy whey they become bankrupt." The government has provided services to enterprises chiefly in the areas of policies, infrastructure facilities, soft investment environment, and the building of spiritual civilization. In the course of separating government administration from enterprises, the city authorities have delegated administrative powers to lower levels, adopted the practice of making policy decisions and exercising regulation and control at different levels, returned powers to enterprises, let grass-roots units enjoy certain powers, and expanded the limits of authority for counties and townships in their economic management. Meanwhile, it also streamlined the administrative structure and diverted personnel to other jobs in light of the requirements for the development of the market economy. Across the city, 193 nonstanding bodies have been dissolved, more than 20 government departments and institutions have set up entities, and 494 people have been dismissed from government organs or institutions to work elsewhere. While transforming government functions and streamlining the administrative structure, the city has established 37 intermediary organizations including technical and vocational training centers, offices for lawyers, accountants, and auditors, and so on. In addition, it has paid attention to exercising the role of chambers of commerce, associations of foreign entrepreneurs, and 160 trade associations, strengthened and perfected the management of trades, and provided enterprises with all kinds of services. Fifth, the economy is oriented to exports. Openness is an essential characteristic of the market economy. The development of the socialist market economy must unswervingly practice the national policy of opening to the outside world, link the domestic market with the international market as quickly as possible, effect a two-way flow of various natural resources, let enterprises participate in international competition of their own accord, fully take the comparative advantage of international division of work and international exchanges, and form an extensively open pattern characterized by multiple levels, channels, and directions. Since reform and opening up, Quanzhou has fully exploited the advantages of being a well-known hometown of Overseas Chinese and its extremely close relations with foreign countries. It widely opened the gate and paved the way to attract foreign investors from Taiwan and other places through the help of Overseas Chinese, tapped both internal and external resources, combined foreign capital with foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation, vigorously developed the export- oriented economy, and blazed a new trial that "started from the path of three forms of import processing and compensation trade, got onto the way of township and town enterprises, embarked on the road of foreign-invested enterprises, proceeded to open up stretches upon stretches of land development, and finally led to a magnificent blueprint of a regional economy." By the end of 1992, a grand total of 2,398 foreign-invested enterprises had been approved throughout the city, with a total investment amount of 12.615 billion yuan and a contract foreign investment amount of $1.888 billion. The scope and areas of foreign investment have been repeatedly expanded, the channels for absorbing foreign capital have continuously increased, township and town enterprises that have foreign capital grafted onto them have grown rapidly, and a major breakthrough has been made in the transformation of state-owned enterprises using foreign capital. In the course of increasing the use of foreign capital, relatively great development has also been attained in foreign trade. In 1992, the city's total value of export goods amounted to 3.11 billion yuan, representing an increase of 37 times as against 1979. The proportion of total export value in the city's GNP has been elevated from 6.61 percent in 1979 to 27 percent today. There are a dozen categories of products with export value exceeding 100 million yuan, including garments, packing materials, shoes, umbrellas, ceramics, knitwear, plastic articles, electronic and electrical appliances, leatherware, gloves, stone products, tea, among other things. Quanzhou's export-oriented economy accounts for over 50 percent of its national economy as a whole and its economic activities depend more and more on the international markets. Sixth, the process of standardized social management has begun. A market economy is, in essence, an economy of laws. A complete legal system and a perfect social insurance system are reliable guarantees for the institution of a socialist market economic structure. Ruling by law is an inherent requirement as well as an organic component of market economic order. In the arena of markets, the authority and responsibility of enterprises and individuals should be confirmed and protected by laws, the market order should be standardized and maintained by laws, and the state's regulation and control over markets should also be achieved on the strength of laws. At present, a legal system that is adapted to the socialist market economic structure has not been completely instituted, the market rules are far from sound, and there is even a total blank in some areas. In developing the socialist market economy, Quanzhou has experienced a development course from a confused to orderly and from an unstandardized to standardized progress. According to the principle of giving consideration to "development first and standardization later, relaxation first and perfection later, and support first and profit later," the city has persisted in making experiments in everything, conscientiously summing up experiences, correcting mistakes in good time, standardizing measures in an appropriate manner, and deliberately bringing the market economy into the orbit of standardization and legalization. The institution of a social insurance system is an objective requirement of the socialist market economic development. Without a sound social insurance system, it will be difficult to bring about unity of efficiency and fairness. In the course of developing the socialist market economy, Quanzhou has always taken the institution of a social insurance system as an important task. In 1986, it started insurance for job awaiting and retirement for enterprises and, on this basis, gradually expanded the social insurance business to radiate in all directions and at deep levels. At present, the city's insurance business has a coverage of 131 items in three major categories including the insurance of job awaiting. A total of 1,672 state-owned, collective, and foreign- invested enterprises have offered unified social retirement insurance to 105,000 personnel, 108,700 staff and workers from 1,248 enterprises participated in job awaiting insurance, and 12,500 staff and workers from 313 foreign-invested enterprises participated in employer responsibility insurance. There are 10 insurance companies in the city. The social insurance system has gradually solidified and is advancing in the direction of socialization and standardization. Quanzhou's courageous exploration into the direction of the socialist market economy has initially broken a path for the development of this economy and, at the same time, remarkably augmented its economic strength. During the past 14 years from 1978 to 1992, the city's GNP and total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 5.59 and 7.01 times respectively and its national income and financial revenues increased by 5.2 and 11.68 times respectively, showing a yearly average increase of 14.42, 16.02, 13.92, and 19.89 percent respectively. The city's GNP quadrupled that of 1978 in 1992. Since 1993, particularly since the implementation of the important central measure of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control, the city has focused its attention on expediting development by deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, transforming mechanisms, optimizing structures, and enhancing economic results, with a view to continuously maintaining the vigorous development momentum in the national economy. Today, the people throughout the city are full of confidence in their advance toward the goal of moderate prosperity by 1995 and the strategic objective of further quadrupling the GNP by the year 2000. As a national comprehensive experimental reform and opening up zone, Fujian has conscientiously summed up the successful experience obtained in Quanzhou and other localities in exercising the role of markets. After audacious experiments and explorations, it should and can accelerate its pace in establishing the socialist market economic structure. We are now seriously studying and implementing the guidelines of the "Decisions" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; stepping up formulation of an overall plan for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure in the province; concentrating efforts on furthering reform; expediting the transformation of operational mechanisms; positively cultivating a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market system; conscientiously changing government functions; pushing forward organizational reform; taking proper control of instituting a legal system and a social insurance system; and vigorously intensifying the building of spiritual civilization suited to the socialist market economy, to lay down a solid foundation for initially establishing the socialist market economic structure in Fujian by the end of this century.
