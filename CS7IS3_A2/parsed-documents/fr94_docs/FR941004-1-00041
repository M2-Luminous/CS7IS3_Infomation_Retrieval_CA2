FR941004-1-00041 FR941004-1-00014 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Part 242 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Production Surveillance AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Proposed rule with request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council is proposing changes to the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) to revise the criteria for determining when to perform on-site technical production surveillance. DATES: Comments on the proposed rule should be submitted to the address shown below on or before December 5, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: Defense Acquisition Regulations Directorate, ATT: IMD 3D139, PDUSD (A&T), 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 20301&hyph;3062, FAX (703) 697&hyph;5971. Please cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D003 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 0 Mr. Owen Green; (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The proposed rule revised DFARS 242.1104 by replacing the current system of determining the type of production surveillance to be performed. Under current procedures, contracts are placed into categories 1, 2, and 3 which determine the level of surveillance the contract will receive. The proposed revisions would simplify the method of determining when the contract would receive pre-delivery telephone surveillance or pre-delivery on-site production surveillance. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ., because the frequency of on-site surveillance is not expected to change. The proposed rule merely simplifies the method used by the Government to determine when on-site surveillance will be performed. An initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS Subparts will be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite DAR Case 93&hyph;D003 in all correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) does not apply because the proposed rule imposes no reporting and recordkeeping requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.

Therefore it is proposed that 48 CFR Part 242 be amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for 48 CFR Part 242 continues to read as follows: Authority: 41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR Part 1.
