Reports suggested that 200 people were sleeping in the five-storey building in Longgang, near Shenzhen, when it collapsed at 7.30 am -- and the death toll seems certain to rise today as rescuers delve further into the debris. Hospitals said 63 people, mostly women aged between 15 and 25, were injured in the tragedy. Nine were in a critical condition. Chinese officials claimed that the building, the Xie Cheng toy factory, was owned by a Hong Kong businessman known as Mr Wong. It had been built without permission, they said. Last night reports said he had been arrested by Shenzhen police, although workers at the site maintained the owner was from Fujian. Local government spokesman Huang Xinhua said: "We have learned that the factory boss had not obtained permission to build and had not taken out insurance for the work. "Workers, mostly women from the countryside, were sleeping in the building when the disaster occurred." The factory comprised about 2,000 square metres and was situated about 40 kilometres from Shenzhen, outside the Special Economic Zone. Li Xiaogan, a spokesman for Shenzhen Municipal Government, said the rescue effort would continue overnight and into today. He said construction of the building began about two months ago. Three storeys had been completed and work had started on the remaining two. Most of the workers, believed to have come from Sichuan, Hunan, Henan and Anhui provinces, were given temporary accommodation on the first and second floors. As a result, said Mr Li, identification of the dead could take some time. Shenzhen's mayor, Li You-wei, rushed to the scene to help organise the rescue effort as soon as details of the tragedy emerged. Weeping eyewitness Deng Suo, 20, who was employed at the factory, recalled the fatal moment when she lost many of her friends and colleagues. "I heard a very big crash when I was waking up. I knew something terrible must have happened. I rushed out and saw the five-storey building collapse into rubble," she said. "I didn't know what to do. My friends were inside. We sent someone to call the police and did what we could to help." Deng Suo said there was so much chaos and heavy masonry that they were powerless to help. Some people were so distraught they just clasped each other and cried. Another eyewitness, Deng Maoling, 19, said she felt the ground move when the building collapsed. "I felt the ground shake. I thought I was in a dream. When I realised what had actually happened, it was worse than a nightmare," she said. The development originally comprised one five-storey block, accommodating more than 1,000 workers, she said. The ground floor was used as a factory and the upper four floors were dormitories. "The owner wanted to develop the business and was trying to employ more workers. So they started to build a new block two months ago. They moved more than 200 workers from the original block to the second floor of the new building which was still under construction," she said. Deng Maoling said she had been waiting 10 hours to see if any of her friends would come out alive. She claimed she had counted many people, including six dead bodies, being brought out. "I'm sure many of them are still in the rubble," she added. Victims were taken to Longgang County Number Two People's Hospital, the biggest in the area. An employee there said some were seriously injured, suffering broken arms and legs. One victim was seen in the casualty ward lying motionless on a stretcher with his head bandaged and bleeding profusely from the nose. Further eyewitness accounts were prevented by Public Security Bureau officials "acting on orders from above," who briefly detained reporters and confiscated film. The accident is expected to renew debate over the safety of factories -- particularly those owned by Hong Kong entrepreneurs -- in China. Last November, 84 people died in a blaze which swept through a toy factory owned by a Hong Kong businessman in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. The businessman, Lo Chiu-chuen, is currently in jail in China awaiting trial.
