The host and guests exchanged views on bilateral relations and on other issues of common interest. Liu Huaqing said to Brown: Ten years ago when you were U.S. secretary of defense, you made positive contributions to developing friendship between the two countries and our two armed forces. He noted that Brown's current visit to China will be conducive to developing Sino-U.S. relations. Liu Huaqing said: China and the United States have no fundamental conflicts of interest. The two armed forces should maintain regular contacts. Bilateral contacts, however, are now fairly limited owing to reasons on the U.S. side. He noted that he welcomed more U.S. friends to visit China to have a look. He said: The 21st century is not far away. China hopes that the next century will be one of peace and development. Both China and the United State should make common efforts to contribute to realizing this goal. Liu Huaqing said: The Chinese Armed Forces are responsible for defending the national sovereignty and territorial integrity and for maintaining national security and stability. He stressed that China's military strategy is purely defensive. As for the Korean nuclear issue, Liu Huaqing reiterated that China hopes to see a stable Korean peninsula. He said that China has consistently stood for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and for the settlement of the nuclear issue through patient dialogue between all the relevant parties. He added that imposing pressure can only make things more complicated. Brown expressed the hope that China and the United States will continue to improve their relations and strengthen bilateral cooperation in regional, international security, and other areas. Also in the afternoon, Zhang Wannian, chief of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Staff, met with Brown and his party. Brown and the other U.S. guests are visiting China at the invitation of the China Center for International Studies.
