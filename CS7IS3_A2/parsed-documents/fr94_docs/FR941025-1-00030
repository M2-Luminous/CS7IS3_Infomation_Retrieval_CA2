FR941025-1-00030 FR941025-1-00006 The Commission also observes that in 1970, sales of all children's sleepwear garments averaged about one and one-half garments per child (14), (15). The average number of sleepwear garments purchased per child each year has not changed appreciably since 1970 (14), (15). Because it is reasonable to assume that children use several garments as sleepwear during the course of a year, a logical inference is that children have probably always used more non-sleepwear garments for sleeping than garments manufactured to comply with the children's sleepwear standards (14). Consequently, providing an exemption from the requirements of the standards for a limited class of sleepwear garments in infant sizes and tight-fitting garments is not expected to increase risks of burn deaths and injuries associated with children's sleepwear. 3. Existing Standards and Statements of Intent To Develop a Voluntary Standard No existing standard was submitted for publication as the proposed standard in response to the ANPR. No statement of intent to develop or modify a voluntary standard was submitted in response to the ANPR. 4. Alternatives to the Proposed Amendments a. Make No Change to the Standards There would be no change in burn deaths and injuries to children which might otherwise be attributable to the proposed amendments. Consumers would forgo all potential benefits of increased choice of children's sleepwear garments and reductions in prices that might result from issuance of the proposed amendments (14). b. Do Not Amend the Standards; Issue a Statement of Policy to the Effect That the Commission Will Not Apply the Standards to Garments in Infant Sizes or Tight-fitting Sleepwear Garments While this alternative might result in some benefits of increased choice and lower prices to consumers, domestic manufacturers and importers might be reluctant to change business practices in reliance on such a policy statement because of uncertainty about future Commission decisions to change that policy. Such uncertainty might result in continued low levels of imported sleepwear garments and little if any domestic production of exempted garments subject to the provisions of the policy statement (14). G. Impact on Small Businesses In accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission hereby certifies that the amendments to the children's sleepwear standards proposed below will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, including small businesses, if issued on a final basis (14). The amendments proposed below would provide an exemption from the requirements of the children's sleepwear standards for certain sleepwear garments in infant sizes and certain tight-fitting sleepwear garments. However, no importer or domestic manufacturer is required to produce the exempted garments. Consequently, any economic impact of the proposed amendments, either positive or negative, will result from business decisions of regulated firms rather than any provision of the proposed amendments (14). H. Environmental Considerations The proposed amendments fall within the categories of Commission actions described at 16 CFR 1021.5(c) that have little or no potential for affecting the human environment. Because the proposed amendments, if issued on a final basis, will not change any aspect of the testing required by the standard, the proposed action does not have any potential to produce significant environmental effects. For that reason, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

Conclusion Therefore, pursuant to the authority of section 30(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2079(b)) and section 4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1193), the Commission hereby proposes to amend title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Parts 1615 and 1616 to read as follows:
