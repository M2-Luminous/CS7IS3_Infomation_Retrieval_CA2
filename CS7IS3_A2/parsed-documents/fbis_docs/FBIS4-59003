He said that convening such a summit now is difficult and that it will be held only when all outstanding issues among the Arab countries are settled. In an interview with AL-DUSTUR at the end of his Jordan visit, Dr. Sidqi said Egypt welcomes reviving Arab solidarity among the fraternal Arab countries and unifiying efforts in this respect. He said his country supports the efforts the Arab League, in the person of its secretary general, has exerted to mend the rift among these fraternal countries. On whether there are any new Egyptian moves to activate the peace process on the Arab-Israeli tracks following the successful signing of the Cairo agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said Egypt continues to exert efforts because it seeks a comprehensive and just settlement for the cause. He said: What has been achieved on the Palestinian-Israeli track is a step on the road to a just and comprehensive settlement on all tracks. On the efforts and contacts to contain the Yemeni crisis, Dr. Sidqi said he has been in contact with the Jordanian officials during his stay in Amman to contain this fighting. He said: The bleeding started while we were in Jordan. He added: We in Egypt carry out an important role through personal envoys of President Husni Mubarak to Yemen and to other important parties to settle this crisis. Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said: In light of our general policy, our stand is that we do not like to see Arabs use weapons against other Arabs. That's why our stand in Egypt in such cases is to try to have the parties negotiate to bring their viewpoints closer together in a peaceful, objective, and constructive manner. [passage omitted]
