How do you explain these results and what effect will they have on your relations with other countries? [Melescanu] Our country's leadership has been concerned with halting the economic decline since 1990, but due to the existing internal and external conditions, this goal was only achieved in 1993. It happened because of the continuous efforts to restructure and technologically reequip our industrial enterprises, to privatize whole sectors of our national economy, such as trade, tourism, and construction, and to return the land to the peasants. At the same time, we completed a restructuring of the banking system, decentralized foreign trade, and supported free enterprise in the small industry and services sectors. This year we plan to carry out a major privatization of industry. These results can increase the confidence of business circles in the developed states in the opportunities for cooperation with Romania, which for us will lead to an increase in foreign investments and support from the international financial organizations. [Gotev] How do you view the prospects for the development of Bulgarian-Romanian relations, which includes taking joint foreign policy initiatives in the Balkans and the Black Sea zone? [Melescanu] Romania ascribes particular importance to comprehensively developing its relations with Bulgaria. No disputed or unresolved problems remain between our countries. Since 1990, Romanian-Bulgarian cooperation has been progressing positively in all fields. Despite the fact that we have no top-level official contacts for one year, I am sure that the relations of cooperation and good-neighborliness between Romania and Bulgaria will continue to advance further in the interest of both countries, so as to provide a model of stability in the Balkans. At the same time, I think that Romania and Bulgaria should actively cooperate in formulating a coordinated foreign policy line for cooperation in the Balkans and the Black Sea zone. Our country will use every occasion to hold consultations with Bulgaria with a view to adopting decisions to the benefit of stability, trust, and prosperity in our region. [Gotev] Where do Romania's preferences lie: toward the European alternative, or toward affiliation to the Balkan Orthodox region? [Melescanu] The point of European and Euro-Atlantic integration is precisely to develop a united, stable, democratic, and prosperous Europe. As far as the Central and Eastern European countries are concerned, this is the only way to confirm and consolidate their national, political, economic, and security interests. It is evident that regional and sub regional cooperation has a very important part to play within the all-European architectural framework. Projects such as the Central European initiative, Black Sea economic cooperation, and Balkan cooperation when the tragic Bosnian conflict ends are a necessary complement to the our state's efforts toward European integration. The tracing of new lines of demarcation in Europe, whether based on ethnic, religious, economic, or security criteria, may become a risk factor for our continent's stability. Romania has constantly and firmly spoken out for averting such artificial barriers, which can only become substitutes for the ideological barriers with which we are so familiar. [Gotev] What priorities does Romanian diplomacy have for 1994? [Melescanu] Our priorities may be defined as lying in three complementary directions. First, we want to continue the process of integration with the political, economic, and security structures of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic alliance. Ratifying and bringing into effect the association treaty with the EU, concluding a treaty with NATO within the Partnership for Peace Initiative, establishing long-term relations with the Western European Union, and switching over to a "permanent route forward" within the Council of Europe -- these are only some of the goals we have set ourselves for the near future. Second, we want to impart fresh dynamism to our relations with neighboring states and other countries in the region. The conclusion of basic political treaties with states like Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine can assist the ascending development of Romania's relations with these states, and at the same time create a favorable political climate. Third, in our foreign policy efforts we want to expand and diversify our relations with states or groups of states in other geographical zones with which Romania maintains permanent and fruitful relations.
