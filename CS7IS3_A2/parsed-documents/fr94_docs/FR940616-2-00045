In its application, National proposes to abandon Well 2314 and its Well Line Q&hyph;W2314 located in National's Queen Storage Field in Hickory Township, Forest County, Pennsylvania. National states that after the field was converted to gas storage, Well 2314 was used as a storage observation well and that its present condition is such that it must be reworked or plugged. National proposes to abandon Well 2314 at an estimated total cost of $20,000. National also proposes to abandon Wells 412&hyph;P, 413&hyph;P and 415&hyph;P, and Well Lines S&hyph;W413, S&hyph;W415, S&hyph;W416 and S&hyph;W418, all located in National's Swede Hill Storage Field in Hamilton Township, McKean County, Pennsylvania. National states that these wells and lines are located in a poor deliverability area of the Swede Hill reservoir and are no longer being utilized. National estimates the total cost of this abandonment to be $75,000. National states that services to its customers and the performance of these storage fields would not be diminished by these abandonments. Comment date: June 30, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should, on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).
