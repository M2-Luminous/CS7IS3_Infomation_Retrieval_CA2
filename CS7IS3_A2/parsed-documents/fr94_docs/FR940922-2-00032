FR940922-2-00032 FR940922-2-00011 Corps of Engineers Intent To Prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Proposed Buckhorn Reservoir Expansion Project in Wilson County, NC AGENCY: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wilmington District, DOD. ACTION: Notice of Intent. SUMMARY: The city of Wilson, North Carolina, has made application for a Clean Water Act, Department of the Army Section 404 permit, to discharge fill material for the construction of a dam to impound water on Contentnea Creek, Wilson County, North Carolina. The proposed dam would be located immediately downstream of the existing Buckhorn Reservoir dam and would inundate the existing reservoir site. The existing reservoir is no longer adequate to meet the water supply needs of the city of Wilson. The proposed reservoir would meet the projected water supply needs of the city for the next 50 years. addresses: Wilmington District, Corps of Engineers, Environmental Resources Branch, P.O. Box 1890, Wilmington, North Carolina 28402&hyph;1890. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. William F. Adams, Environmental Resources Branch, (910) 251&hyph;4748 or Mr. David Franklin, Regulatory Branch, (910) 251&hyph;4952. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Construction of the proposed dam and reservoir requires a Clean Water Act, Department of the Army Section 404 permit, from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 1. The proposed dam and reservoir would expand the existing municipal water supply reservoir. The proposed reservoir would inundate a total of 2,303 acres, including the existing 740-acre Buckhorn Water Supply Reservoir, with a normal pool at elevation 148 feet mean sea level, and provide a 29.0-million gallons per day safe yield of raw water for the city water supply. 2. The DEIS is being prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and will address the project's relationship to all other applicable Federal and State laws and Executive Orders. The DEIS will contain no designation of an alternative preferred by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The decision on the Department of the Army section 404 permit application will be made with full consideration of the public interest after the comment period on the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) and the Section 404 public notice has concluded. 3. The scoping process has consisted of an interagency scoping meeting on November 6, 1990, to allow opportunity for agencies to identify issues, studies needed, and alternatives to be addressed. In addition, a Draft Environmental Assessment was sent to Federal and State agencies for review and comment on August 8, 1991. 4. The significant issues that will be addressed in the DEIS are the impacts of the proposed project on wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat, endangered species, and the social and economic considerations. 5. Fourteen alternatives to the proposed action are being evaluated including the no action alternative. 6. The DEIS is currently scheduled for distribution to the public in November 1994 and the FEIS is scheduled for distribution in June 1995. Kenneth L. Denton, Army Federal Register Liaison Officer.
