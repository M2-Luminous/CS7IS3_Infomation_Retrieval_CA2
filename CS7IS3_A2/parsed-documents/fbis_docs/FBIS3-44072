FBIS3-44072 "drafr015_c_94029" FBIS-AFR-94-015 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 23 Jan MB2301123594 MB2301123594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] SUNDAY TIMES ANC Program--"Nelson Mandela's call this week for an end to the rent boycotts that have crippled the administration of the townships" marks "the transition of the ANC [African National Congress] from liberation movement to government-in-waiting," the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English editorial on 23 January on page 20 notes. The editorial describes the ANC's program of reconstructiona and development as a "desperate, amateurish first attempts to come to grips with the needs of 40-million people, half of them illiterate and two-thirds impoverished." Referring to the ANC program's "economic babble," the editorial notes that "all this well-meaning babble is difficult to connect to the immense and very real problems facing the ANC. Peace, or the restoration of law and order, will be the work of a decade, and it will not be accomplished unless the ANC learns to treat its opponents with greater tolerance than the township self-defense units show." "As for jobs, education, health, housing, the ANC will not only need the help of existing `power structures,' but it will be hard put simply to avoid disastrous error." SUNDAY NATION ANC Candidates--An editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 23 January on page 8 notes that the ANC list of 200 candidates for the National Assembly is "remarkable" in that the ANC "lived up to its democratic tradition in the process of nominating people as its membership from the grassroots became directly involved." "Also noteworthy is the fact that they were able to pull together a large section of the South African society into its list." The editorial hopes that "the same process, or even a more improved one, is going to be followed for the local government elections." However "the list represents more of a popularity poll and a strategy to win more votes rather than a selection of people who will perform particular tasks once they are in Parliament." "Of more concern is the fact that certain people on the list are not known to be loyal to ANC policy" and some "are even regarded as enemies by people who live near them." BEELD East Rand Cancer Must Not Spread--The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 20 January says in a page-10 editorial: "Whether the black residential areas of the East Rand are officially declared disaster areas is of purely academic interest. For all practical purposes they have been disaster areas for a long time already. They are also battlefields, where people are murdered daily as a result of the bloody political struggle between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party. How leaders of these two groups can allow their supporters to create such a situation is inconceivable." "The infrastructure there has been totally destroyed, vandalism and anarchy prevail, the hostility and suspicion between groups is tangible, and the image of the security forces as maintainers of law and order has been totally shattered." "Now is not the time for political parties to be blaming one another as to who is responsible. Now is the time to rescue what can be rescued." BEELD concludes: "If political opponents can be drawn into such a plan and the community does its part, this ulcer on the East Rand can be excised. It is a cancer which must not be allowed to spread." Self-Interested People Sabotage Their Own Future--A second editorial of the 20 January BEELD on page 10 points out: "The disruption of medical services as has happened at Kalafong Hospital outside Pretoria resembles in several aspects last year's catastrophic disruption of black education. In both cases the disruption was caused by people responsible for the care of those who in civilized society would be protected--in one case children, in the other, the sick." "In both cases the motive was self- interest." "Both cases represent a disruption of essential services to a community which can ill afford it, by people from the same community. In this way people are sabotaging their own future." Mandela Must Count His Words--A third editorial says: "Mr. Nelson Mandela certainly had no ulterior motive when he said that it could be in the country's interests to have a non-ANC president, even if the ANC wins the April election. He was probably only being generous. But Mr. Mandela should realize that because of his position as the leader of what seems to be the strongest political grouping in the country, he has a particular duty to consider his words carefully. He cannot utter such a far-reaching statement and simply walk away without indicating who he had in mind. What his followers think of such a statement, only he could know. But one can guess that there would be shock and confusion. The electorate have an absolute right to know for whom and for what they are going to vote. Indeed, their vote is not a mandate for politicians to appoint people for whom they did not vote. Times are simply too serious for this kind of loose talk. Politicans must make it their duty to reduce, not increase, the confusion."
