Diplomats and politicians engaged in intense backroom wrangling over the succession to French Socialist Jacques Delors as President of the European Commission. Gathering in huddles, journalists talked of little else. "Sometimes, the interests of the media and the interests of political people do meet," Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen told reporters here. "I'm afraid that today they don't. And I'd rather prefer if we talk about unemployment or how to make concrete means available to ordinary people." The economy was the main topic of discussion at the afternoon session of talks between EU leaders, British officials stressed Friday. "And we have talked about unemployment many times in the past." The discussions among leaders and finance ministers concentrated on four main topics, the British said. - Macroeconomic policy, covering price stability, sound public finances and labour market flexibility. - A report by European Commissioner Martin Bangemann on liberalisation of the markets, particularly in telecommunications. - Discussion of ways to implement the European Commission's Trans European Networks proposals, covering 11 road, rail and telecommunications projects across Europe. - And a German proposal to set up a task force on deregulation, tackling the "difficulties of creating jobs in Europe, and for small- and medium-sized businesses." The projects for Trans European Networks formed a key element in Delors' white paper on unemployment, issued last year, which set out a massive investment programme for the community. At a Brussels press conference earlier this week, Delors was critical of "two or perhaps three EU countries," which have blocked his plan for significant public sector involvement in funding the projects. This was a reference to Britain, France and Germany, which do not want to raise their public debt in order to pay for an ambitious multimillion dollar investment programme for transport, energy and telecom networks. Delors said he feared that EU leaders might ditch a Commission proposal for measures to increase competitiveness and create jobs, because of signs that their countries were emerging economic recession. Even annual economic growth of 2.5 or three percent was not enough to bring down unemployment which is expected to peak at 11.6 percent in 1995 -- meaning nearly 20 million people will be out of work, he said. Officials close to Delors admit that the Commission's plans -- to pay for the investment programme and to reduce social charges levied to pay for social programmes and raise the money through a new energy tax -- have been largely gutted. Of the 11 projects which were expected to be approved at the summit, many have already been all but decided, and they represent just a small slice of Delors' original plans, Commission officials said. "Unemployment has not been dropped from the summit. It is just that the ideas coming to the fore are of a different political complexion than those that were previously in the front," a source close to the Commission said.
