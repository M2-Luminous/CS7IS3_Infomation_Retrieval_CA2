FBIS4-59173 "drnes091_k_94030" FBIS-NES-94-091 Daily Report 6 May 1994 IRAQ Coalition's `Silence' on Kurdish Fighting Criticized Coalition's `Silence' on Kurdish Fighting Criticized JN0605115494 Baghdad INA in Arabic 0938 GMT 6 May 94 JN0605115494 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Baghdad, 6 May (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has said the coalition forces' silence on the massacres of Iraq's Kurds, represented by the conflict between the Talabani and Barzani groups, exposes the false humanitarian slogans Washington and its allies used as a cover to enter into Kurdistan. In its editorial today, the paper emphasizes that the continued annihilation of Kurds in the fierce and ongoing confrontations between the Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani groups sheds light on the serious conspiracy concocted by the colonialist and Zionist circles against Iraq and its people. AL-'IRAQ adds that the comprehensive and large-scale fighting between the Talabani and Barzani gangs reflects the miserable situation created by the erroneous circumstances in the absence of order and law in the area. The paper wonders about foreign forces' role in confronting the scandals and terrible crimes to which the sons of Kurdistan are being subjected. These forces came on the pretext of immediately intervening and protecting the Kurds, if they are subjected to any military operation. Suffice it to say that turning a blind eye to the ongoing massacres of Iraq's Kurds is a flagrant war against the Kurds targeting their lives, existence, fate, and their future, the paper notes. AL-'IRAQ describes the position of the foreign forces, which are idly watching the slaughtering of Iraq's Kurds at the hands of the Talabani and Barzani gangs, as a new formula of imperialist-Zionist hypocrisy and a form of intrigue, lies, distortion, falsification, reversal of realities, and concealment of facts away from the world public opinion.
