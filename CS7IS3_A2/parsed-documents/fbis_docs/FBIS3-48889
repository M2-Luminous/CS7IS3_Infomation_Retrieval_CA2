However, it is another thing if his thinking can gain easy acceptance with the climate of Nagata-cho and with Japanese society. He refers to a disparity between the views that one expresses officially and that one really holds at heart. [Ozawa] I decided not to meet reporters on their evening and morning rounds. I have observed this policy since the general election in July, but there seems to be some misunderstanding in this regard. At any rate, while making evening and morning rounds, political reporters thus far clung to politicians and walked on their heels to cover news. However, this kind of practice is meaningful only in Japanese-style politics, where it has been common for politicians to hold both official views and real views and choose to use either of them according to circumstances. They cannot express their real heartfelt views in public, but instead reveal them in places where there are only a few intimate reporters. Reporters hear the real views and use them as reference, but they do not report the portions mentioned off the record. This is not just the case in politics, but also in the entire society of Japan. Citing a company for example, at a conference of directors, they talk only about official positions and wrap up the meeting quickly. They instead conduct varied talks on other occasons and shape up positions through backstage maneuvers. Politics is typical of this practice. However, politics, economics, and daily life in Japan have now reached a point where they can no longer allow such a Japanese way of conduct and contrivances. One should clearly be allowed to express views and make decisions, but also accept one's own responsibility squarely. One should quit telling lies as a result of selectively using official or real views to suit the circumstances. By so doing, one has to get along well with others in the upcoming new era, particularly in international society. This is why I am saying that political reform is linked to reform of Japanese consciousness. I do not tell things that should not be revealed, and I also do not selectively use real or official views according to circumstances. Therefore, it is meaningless for reporters to cling fast to me from morning till night. I quit the membership formula and instead decided to go public so that I will become accessible to anybody who visits me for an interview and so that I can talk about as many things as possible. Abolition of the reporters' on-duty system arouses, in a sense, questions about the reason for the existence of the political desk. However, mass media were accustomed to such an old system, thereby saving politicians from showing their clear views on each separate issue. For example, when Mr. Hosokawa was asked what was the difference between his government and the past Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] regime, he clearly answered that he will accept the responsibility if the political reform-related bills did not pass. In politics thus far, no one has clearly said that he will take the responsibility and quit should he fail to achieve this task. In a nutshell, no one has ever clarified where his own responsibility lies. Or, we may say that no one has ever been so self-assertive. This is a tremendous change in politics. I was deeply impressed by the Mr. Hosokawa's attitude when he clarified where his responsibility lay, and I think that we did not err when we recommended him for his post. [Kobayashi] In his book Blueprint for Building a New Japan, Mr. Ozawa is advocating the need to reform all political, economic, and social structures. What is it that has made Mr. Ozawa really feel Japan's crisis and driven him toward reform? [Ozawa] It was the Lockheed scandal that made me think that Japan would go wrong if left as it was. I got a horrible shock emotionally. I have kept calling for system reform since I was first elected. When I saw my boss, who was so close to me, arrested, I was further prompted to consolidate my thoughts. I thought I had to do something. I also entertained doubts about how the court of law should be. It is no good to grumble about the judicature because it is one of the three powers, but it, including the court, committed acts transcending the law during the investigation into the Lockheed scandal. Japan is a law-governed country, but the judicature committed acts which could not be allowed within the bounds of Japanese law. If things transcending the law are allowed because a case involves the prime minister's scandal, it means that the judicature can exercise its influence arbitrarily. I thought at that time that such a practice would really mislead democracy. For example, the other party implicated was questioned after being given immunity at a meeting of judges, and what was obtained from the questioning [in the United States] was used as evidence. There is no such rule in Japanese law. That was when Mr. Miki was governing. That way of politics in the style of Mr. Miki and such a way of administering justice made me think about many things. [Kobayashi] In the Lockheed scandal, when asked by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office to interrogate those involved from the U.S. side, the U.S. Department of Justice sought their testimony after giving immunity from criminal charges. Mr. Ozawa calls former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka father. In the Marubeni Route case of the scandal, in which this father was accused of accepting a bribe, Mr. Ozawa attended all of the 191 public trial sessions from the first public hearing (27 January 1977) to the first trial ruling (12 October 1983). Why did he need to attend them? [Ozawa] That's what made me think about politics. Why did such a thing happen to my father? I suspected that the political mechanism itself might be the reason for it. Politics really requires money. However, its mechanism fails to ensure the way to obtain money properly. It requires money, but it is quite difficult to obtain donations because there are such things as the Political Fund Control Law enacted in the name of principled policies. Accordingly, that created spots where money secretly flows in and out. After all, since people could not get necessary money, they seeked it secretly. Such was also the case with Mr. Kanemaru. I doubted if, with all this, Japan's entire democratic system, including its politics, would still be all right. Since then, I have kept thinking that if I ever come to the position where I can push for reform, I will act one way or another to that end. [Kobayashi] The forces for defense of the Constitution are opposed to Mr. Ozawa, calling him "a nationalist" and taking issue with his strong arguments for the dispatch of the Self-Defense Forces to UN peacekeeping operations and with his position for a single-seat constituency system. What is Mr. Ozawa himself thinking about this? [Ozawa] It is a totally absurd assertion that I have nationalistic thoughts, aim to build a superpower, or a minipower, and do not attach importance to the livelihood of ordinary working citizens. I would have to accept such a view if I were asserting that we, as a nation, should exercise more political or military influence on the world even at the cost of lowering the people's living standards and victimizing them. However, I am not saying such a thing at all. Japan is enjoying an affluent, happy, and peaceful life. The people all wish to continue such a life for long. In other words, it is the role and goal of politicians to realize this wish. Therefore, the question is what we should do to this end. During the Tokugawa era, when the people were living in isloation on the four islands of the Japanese archipelago, Japan had a population of 30 million and people still had a hard time feeding themselves. However, at present our 120 million people are enjoying an abundance of food. How has Japan, which is totally dependent on foreign countries in terms of resources and markets, been able to reach the present status? It is because it has been able to maintain friendly relations with various foreign countries and because the world has been peaceful. Conversely, Japan will have to lose all it has gained and return to the Tokugawa era if it cannot maintain cooperative relations with foreign countries; that is, if Japan gets isolated in the international community. If people say such a situation is okay with them, that is another story, but as long as they wish to maintain affluence, happiness, and peace, they have to act in such a way that various foreign countries consider Japan as one of their fellow associates. This is my assertion. Of all relations, the relations with the United States are the most important to Japan. Will relations keep moving for the better as they do now? Or will they move for the worse along a mistaken course in history? We are now at the crossroads in this regard. I believe that the situation is far more critical than others think. The United States still exists as the number-one country, but its power has gradually been weakening in a relative sense. It is natural that the country make more demands as it gets weaker. After our defeat in the war, the United States protected Japan across the board. It afforded us generous assistance and furnished us with broad markets. It told us to make utmost efforts only in the economic field, promising that in other areas the United States would do all things for Japan. Such a generous country as the United States has been weakening and making various demands. Not all of the demands are just, but it is now Japan's turn to cooperate. I think that we have to respond to these demands as best as we can as long as it is the precondition for Japan's existence that Japan gets along well with nations in the world and with the United States. A certain expert said: Japan should straighten itself up in response while the United States is clamorously making various demands. It might soon stop making any demands at all. The time may come soon when it says to Japan, "Do as you like. You are no longer my associate and so I will make no request to you. Just live by yourself." I shuddered and was seized with fear at his remarks. Fortunately, things may not be too serious yet because the country is still levying complaints against us; however, I think we have to take proper responsive measures before it is too late. Last time, I said that the collapse of the LDP government and the Meiji Restoration bear a resemblance to each other. What symbolizes the black ships this time is the collapse of the cold war structure, is it not? The other party is still the United States. That is why I am warning so much. Our opposite number was the United States at the time of the black ships and at the time of the Pacific war as well. And this time again....
