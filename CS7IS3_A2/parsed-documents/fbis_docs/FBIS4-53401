Swomley, executive director of the American Committee on Korea, after visiting Panmunjom at the head of a delegation of the committee. Noting that propaganda against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is going on unabated in the United States, he said Americans are not well informed about the existence of the concrete wall dividing Korea into North and South. He contended that the United States should pull its forces and nuclear weapons out of South Korea, saying the U.S. Forces have not withdrawn from South Korea still today when the "Cold War" has come to an end.
