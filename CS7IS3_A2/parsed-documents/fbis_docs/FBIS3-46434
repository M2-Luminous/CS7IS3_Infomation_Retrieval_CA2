The Industrial and Commercial Bank, China's largest specialized bank, has taken the lead in the computerization of Chinese banks. At the end of last year, the bank signed a contract with Unix China Ltd. for the purchase of 2,000 sets of the Unix SVR 4.2/CE system valued at Rmb [renminbi] 3 million yuan. Unix China Ltd. is a joint venture between companies from the U.S., Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. The SVR 4.2 system was developed by the U.S. partners. Jia Yaoliang, president of Unix China Ltd., said at today's press conference that the Industrial and Commercial Bank is the first large-scale state-owned Chinese financial enterprise to purchase licensed software in batches. He also noted that the bank's purchase of licensed software will reflect China's implementation of regulations for software protection, as well as establish China's software industry and promote international cooperation.
