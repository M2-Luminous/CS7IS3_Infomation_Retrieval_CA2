As you probably know, Poland had its own vision of a future security structure in Europe. How does Romania assess the "Partnership for Peace" plan? [Spiroiu] I think the NATO proposal is a good resolution for our part of Europe, for all countries of the former communist bloc. It does not single out or discriminate against anyone, and, first of all, it does not draw any new borders or a new geopolitical divisions within Europe. The Romanian Army seeks integration with NATO. This is in line with our foreign policy, the key goal of which is the preservation of peace and stability in the region. I would like to stress that all political forces agree on this. Romania is not interested in conflicts with any country. On the contrary, it longs to see peace in the Balkans, in the former Yugoslavia. I would like to remind everyone that due to the embargo imposed on our exports to the new Yugoslavia, our state loses millions of dollars annually. Romania understands, however, that there is no other way to achieve peace in the former Yugoslavia than through dialogue. Despite great losses endured through support for such policy, Romania will not break free from the group of countries observing these sanctions. I suppose, however, that the "Partnership for Peace" in its current form does not satisfy all countries or meet all their expectations -- particularly in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. I understand that, for example, German policy seeks to move NATO's borders farther to eastward. However, what might be good for Germany does not mean that it could meet the expectations of all Central and East European countries. Romania speaks out for the creation of a security structure throughout Europe that would eliminate the fear of new conflicts and treat all states on an equal footing, without any privileges. [Malik] At the same time, you support Russia's position, which blocked Poland's admission to NATO.... [Spiroiu] I also understand Russian fears of NATO expansion with new members. Such an outcome would serve all those who oppose the continuation of the democratic process in Russia begun by President Boris Yeltsin, all conservative and pro-imperialist forces. It would be grist for the mill of such people as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. In this situation, "Partnership for Peace" is the optimal but not the final solution. It is also a good endeavor for another reason -- it coincides with the period of transformation that our part of Europe is now experiencing, and the changes in NATO which is trying to find a place for itself after the end of the Cold War. [Malik] Prior to the NATO meeting in January, President Ion Iliescu criticized the proposal of joint guarantees for Central and East European countries provided by the Americans and Russians. Do you not think that such guarantees would actually mean a new Yalta? [Spiroiu] I will respond briefly: Politics is decided by the strongest. [Malik] Over recent years, Romania, like other countries of the former communist bloc, has changed its foreign and defense policies. What changes have occurred in the Army? [Spiroiu] Following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the socialist bloc, we began to adjust the Army to meet the new situation. Under the agreement on conventional armed forces, the Romanian Army can retain the maximum number of 230,000 servicemen. We predict that in the future it will be an Army based on professional soldiers to a great extent. "Partnership for Peace" meets our expectations and as it confirms the expediency of the covered course concerning the reorganization of the Army. The aim of this reorganization was to adjust our military structures to West European standards, particularly to NATO structures. [Malik] Polish-Romanian relations are not assessed as very good, and I became convinced of this during a visit of mine to Bucharest. How does military cooperation look against this backdrop? [Spiroiu] Good and friendly relations have existed between Romanian and Polish citizens, as well as between our states, throughout history. Over the last two years, we have begun the restoration of the ties we severed after the changes in both countries. I believe that our armies should also have good relations. I am saying with regret, however, that currently there is no closer cooperation despite a number of initiatives undertaken since 1991. Some unforeseen circumstances have always hampered the conclusion of such an agreement, for example, the replacement of the Polish defense minister, and last year's elections in Poland. I hope that a relevant agreement will be signed shortly.
