In a statement issued at 8:00 p.m (1800 GMT), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation command said the plane and a second aircraft were patrolling over Moslem enclave when the downing occurred. The Southern Command said the pilot was "reported to be safe and not seriously injured after he ejected from his jet while he was responding to a (United Nations Protection Force) request for close air support in the Gorazde area." The statement added: "The Sea Harrier was flying from the (British aircraft) carrier HMS Ark Royal. The pilot of another Sea Harrier observed the pilot ejecting from his aircraft and parachuting to the ground." NATO added that the two aircraft "were attempting to conduct a close air support mission against a tank reported to have been firing directly into Gorazde," stressing that no NATO air strikes were launched. The statement added: "Information avalaible to this headquarters suggests the situation around Gorazde is quiet at this time." Earlier Saturday afternoon in Zagreb, a source close to UNPROFOR said air strikes were underway at 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) Saturday around the enclave. But the source later said that the NATO air manoeuvres around the besieged enclave had been flights providing close air support and not bombing raids. The UNPROFOR source, who declined to be named, said no Serb target had been destroyed.
