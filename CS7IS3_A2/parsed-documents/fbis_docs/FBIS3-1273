Addressing IEC Chairman Justice Johann Kriegler and his delegation in the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly, Mr Buthelezi said: "You have come today with a long list of requests for full participation in preparation for elections and the holding of elections, with which we disagree". He explained that the IFP had advised its members not to vote in the poll, while Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini had also desisted from advising his subjects to vote. "We now face the difficult realities that these decisions...are now going to have to be adjusted to meet the requirements of your commission," he told Judge Kriegler. Mr Buthelezi said however that he was aware that the IEC Chairman "can bring the full might of the law to bear upon us". But, "nothing would suit the purposes of destabilising kwaZulu more than IEC action against myself, the kwaZulu government, and the IFP". In terms of the IEC operating in the territory, the kwaZulu cabinet had resolved, among others, that: - government buildings could be made available for election purposes on a selective basis. This excluded buildings used for essential services; - community based institutions and tribal authority buildings could only be used if those communities or tribal authorities gave their blessing; - damage to kwaZulu government property during elections would be the responsibility of the IEC; and, - both the kwaZulu Police and the SA Police jointly man polling stations. Mr Buthelezi was at pains to explain his difficulty in trying to reconcile his party position against the April poll and the IEC's interests to secure free and fair elections for those who wanted the vote.
