It is a blessed act for which we commend Saudi Arabia--king, government, and people. As Muslims, we consider the Shura a positive value and a shari'ah obligation. There is no dispute about Shura being a characteristic of fundamentalist believers, because God has imposed it as an obligatory duty which must be pursued, or rather, He coupled it with belief in Him, and with the obligation of prayer. He said: "Those who respond to their Lord and keep up prayer, and whose affairs are (decided) by counsel among themselves, and who spend out of what we have given them." Shura is not merely a transitory idea or an emergency measure. On the contrary, it is a deep-rooted precept in our awareness and behavior. However, the events that have occurred have been far removed from the spirit of religion and, consequently, we were cut off from the principles, values, and morals of our religion, including the principle of Shura. When Shura is absent from our reality, our lives become troubled and controlled by high-handedness and individual hegemony. Because of that, corruption, tyranny, and difficulties of life spread. With this position that Shura occupies in our heritage, and with this conscious understanding of its beneficial effects and positive results, we are aware that Shura is nothing new to us. It is no alien import from the West. But the break with this principle for centuries has made it appear to be a modern form, as if it were new to us, while it is "our goods that have returned to us." Therefore, Shura is our precept or fundamental principle. Its application has, in fact, taken various forms and methods including, most importantly, representation in the form of parliamentary and representative councils, as well as consultative, as a means of representation. The highest expression of Shura application is in representative councils, which are considered a true and realistic expression of the meaning of Shura, which has remained blocked-off in letter and theory. Shura is now changing in practice, through "representative" consultative councils, from the stage of principle to the stage of practical application. Moreover, even though Shura is obligatory in principle, it has not been confined to a rigid framework, in terms of methods and forms. It carries the concept of collectivism, consultation, and the exchange of ideas, free from absolutism in points of view or adherence to special positions. In terms of ways to apply it in practice, one should benefit from the experience and expertise of others. This strengthens its correctness and success. Islam leaves that to theological judgement and interpretation by changes and modifications. `Saudi Role in Gulf Scene Strengthens Its Arab Leadership' by al-Shadhili al-Qulaybi After the convulsion that began in the summer of 1990, which shook the Arab nation from one end to the other, our people have remained upset, at odds over diverging views, differing in what constitutes best interests, with a prevailing malaise here and there. Should our people remain waiting for whatever an international system might provide them three years after that hurricane, which destroyed structures, wasted resources, and monopolized the senses? Should they wait for it to rescue them from the fall and, possibly, save our countries from circumstances that prevent our society from resuming the building of its honor? The answer to those questions is that, no matter what developments occur in the world, a system will not emerge that is based on anything other than the old system that the world has offered. This system is that the strongest benefit, and the interests of the major powers get the highest attention. It has been said that nations have no friendship, only interests. We could add to that: "Interests of the major powers always precede all principles and values." We should not be blind, in any time or place, to the congruence between the interests of the strongest and the principles of international law. They are circumstantial and transient. One should not rely on them as permanent, fixed principles, because international politics is unjust by nature, by virtue of the tyranny of national interests. They rise above principles and values, whenever incompatibility occurs between them. We have seen that in many regional crises, the most recent and ugly in the tragedy of Bosnia. In this regard, many of those with international influence were in collusion to enable the Serbian side, at stage after stage, to continue its campaign of murder and population displacement, which could have been stopped in the beginning if the so-called leading nations had the political will for international action. This was the truth once, but is it not the duty of our countries, despite all the negative aspects of mutual action--at the Gulf, Arab, and Islamic levels; and is it not also in our people's interests, despite the continuation of dashed hopes, and despite the violent storms that still rage around them; is it not the duty and in our best interests to rely on ourselves, to rescue our present from sliding more and more into the abyss, to bear the responsibility for our future until we achieve the prosperity, strength, and honor we desire? Therefore, we are in urgent need of an awakening that possesses clarity of vision in thinking and derives determination from our collective pride. Our people are always in the position of "low hand" in the international community. However, this matter requires some explanation, especially after the violent winds that blew away the concepts of "Arabism" and "ummah" [Arab Islamic community as a whole]. Before any other consideration, Arabism is a cultural bond between the peoples who chose this affiliation and the source of this gift, the Arabian Peninsula. It fashioned this miraculous language that we have used for more than 14 centuries. It is still in constant development, but maintains its fundamental components. These peoples, West and East, both black and the white races, chose to be Arab. Many times, many of them tarnished its image. It is incumbent upon our countries to do everything possible to remove from our people the blemish of backwardness, not only to defend Arab honor, but also so that our people will share in prosperity and progress. Therefore, one should review, at the outset, how we have gone astray, both in the past and now, in regard to the concept of ummah and mutual Arab action. In the past, the concept of Arabism--or the Arab ummah--was misused at times. We should not necessarily be led into discarding this marvelous bond or into renouncing its duties. The defect does not lie in the reality of this bond, but rather in the method of comprehending and dealing with its development. One of the lessons of the past is that--in the future--we must not rely on some idea or malign some principle without closely examining the results, analyzing the consequences, and agreeing on means of implementation, so that concepts are clear and satisfy--solidly and firmly--the principles that govern our acts. The Arab decision should be guaranteed implementation, because of the vision and profound dialogue that preceded it. We accept the profoundness and value of the historic and cultural bond that cements some of our people to others. We must be persuaded that our destinies should be closely bound together in prosperity and adversity, both as regards our affairs inside the region and in our relations with the rest of the world. At this point, one must offer a number of observations: - Removing the blemish of backwardness from Arabs in general will not be what keeps the Arab people as one. They may be marked by that. There is no room for egoism in our war against backwardness. It is an all-out war, whose only meaning is its universality for all peoples affiliated with Arabism. - The issue of Palestine is not a regional issue, not an issue of its leadership, but rather, it is an issue of one of our peoples in trust to all of us. Would we be satisfied with history holding us accountable for the loss of Palestine, as it held our forefathers accountable for the loss of Andalusia? Therefore, acceptance of the importance of the Palestinian negotiator--or the Syrian, Lebanese, or Jordanian--is only defending the Arab right, so that we can regain the most that is possible. - Then, with the regaining of Palestine, or most of Palestine, Israel will still remain a tyrannical power in the region, displaying animosity to all Arabs and on guard against them. As a result, our countries will continue to squander our vast wealth on armament and security, which will only result in our being distracted from the substantive. The substantive is the issue of growth. The nation whose ruler took the initiative that led to the Fez peace plan can only play a major role in support of the efforts aimed at peace. I do not say a "just peace," but one can only accept it and be reassured. - Coming out of backwardness is not only one of the duties of Arab honor; it is also a requirement of Arab security. The more our people have command of the sciences and different kinds of technology, the more they will be able to protect their security themselves. - Our people must choose the specific nature of their destiny: Are they content to always remain a geographic region in the path of violent international interests? Or, do they want to have self-identity, effectively making decisions with regard to their own affairs, and a voice to be heard in international assemblies? - One cannot ignore the past. We will have wasted its lessons if we treat it with forgetfulness. However, the past must not fetter us, but should open windows of the future for us. What concerns our people and their security is the revival of their present situation and excellent preparation for their future. This is what is required from us, we are not prisoners of past negative factors. We must head into the future with all the insight, courage, and enthusiasm that we have. Other than that will keep our people in positions of weakness and fragmented ideas. Their efforts will fail and they will go with the wind. It behooves our countries to work within these crucial facts, no matter how powerful past experiences were, and no matter how shaken their confidence in their "brother" Arabs. For all these considerations, a true awakening must encompass the entire Arab nation, from the Gulf to the Atlantic. So that this necessary awakening will occur, there must be strong leadership to take charge. Capabilities must be gathered, and a call put forth for the "Great Jihad": the jihad of the spirit, in which rancor and separatist inclinations are spreading; the jihad against backwardness, because of which our people suffered for centuries from the woes of defeats and humiliations. Leadership in this awesome matter must be able to assume responsibility for coordinating viewpoints, rallying spirits, and directing efforts. The drive will only come from one of our countries, or a group of countries, with a decisive stand that is adopted from our religious past, and which is pursued on a new course to open the gates of the future. In the first rank of those qualified to assume this role is, without a doubt, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by virtue of its traditional Arab role of strengthening developmental efforts in various countries, and because of the astonishing leap forward that it has made in this regard in basic fields, such as education, forming highly-trained brilliant cadres in administrative and social, economic, and political affairs. By looking at the high percentage of cohesion that surrounds our people, thanks to the comprehensive development policy for all areas of the kingdom and all its social groups, there is no doubt that the new measures pertaining to the Consultative Council [Shura] and to government in the kingdom's provinces, will strengthen the cohesion of the kingdom's people, by supporting methods and techniques of Shura and broadening its area. They will also strengthen the organization of governmental powers, since the usefulness of the government's work will be doubled. Shura will increase its influence and credibility with public opinion. It is certain that these measures--and those that will doubtlessly follow--will cause the governmental system to keep more and more in step with the social and intellectual awakening that has been spreading throughout the country for the past two or three decades. It is also certain that the role that the kingdom plays on the Gulf scene is influential in solidifying the Gulf's Arab leadership. All indicators point to the fact that this role will increase in importance in the future, because of the magnitude of the kingdom's size, the enormity of its wealth over the long term, the ancestral heritage of its state, and the importance of its population numbers. These are some of the considerations that gives it its power inside the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], gives it its influence, and makes it a mediator and authority. Many observers from outside the Gulf, even non-Arab observers, expect positive developments in view of this, which will enable the GCC to overcome its preoccupation with long, slow-moving "approaches." In taking a decisive step toward some form of federation, much time, effort, and money could be saved, and the long line of security and defense plans avoided. A responsible, effective, cohesive power in the area and inside the Arab family could be formed from that, within the framework of the Islamic community. This would increase the kingdom's fitness for leadership responsibilities, for which it stands alone on the international scene, with an increasingly effective role in economic, financial, and political areas. Our Arab people, east and west, are Islamic as a whole, either by embracing Islam as a religion, or by feeling at ease with it culturally. The overwhelming majority of our Christian citizens confirm this, in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine, and also in Lebanon, despite the tragedy suffered by the Lebanese. This is also confirmed by many Jews who have settled among them in 10 good Arab nations, the likes of which they did not find--not in the past nor in modern times--in the European areas that allege today to be for human rights. Our peoples' relationship with Islam makes them responsible for the renaissance of Islamic society, so that its first emergence, which fashioned that great civilization and created that comprehensive culture, is renewed. Within that culture, the idea of adopting the causes of progress and development matured. The Islamic society will only be able to attain a renewed emergence by reviving the principles that were one of the factors of its power and the brilliance of its direction. They are: - The principle of ijtihad [independent legal judgement], through acts of opinion and use of reason in religious and worldly affairs. - Quest of knowledge: This is obligatory on individuals and the group "even if in China." - Hard work and labor, to earn one's livelihood and sustain the needs of the ummah. - Solidarity among individuals and peoples alike. - Shura, so that the ummah is safe from civil strife and the disaster of tyranny and absolutism in opinion. - Tolerance, which has made one of our Arab capitals a unique model for peaceful coexistence of people of various religious sects. With these principles, the Islamic society was a power, its various groups cohesive, and the sciences and their technologies flourished, so that the authority which was Europe borrowed from it. Whenever we lose those principles, power and sovereignty slip away, economic prosperity declines in our countries, intellectual movement in our societies stagnates, and the true sciences are suppressed in our educational institutions. Our peoples' conditions worsen, and they are dominated by those nations that acquired sciences and culture from them, because they adopted the same principles that had made us the leaders and that--today--strengthen the nations that lead the international community. We are more deserving of these principles, because they were originally in our doctrine, one of the pillars of our civilization. We would not have needed someone else's enlightenment to discover them, if there had been no inclination to replace this important part of our intellectual and cultural heritage. Today, our people need to awaken from their cultural slumber and return to their first way of life, with regard to judgement in the rest of their affairs, in order to return to a place of honor among nations. But we must, therefore, be able to stop the civil strife that gnaws at some of our countries, threatens to spread into others, and is on the verge of destroying the costly gains that we cherish. All our Arab and Islamic nations must heed this call, which requires universal effort and multiple directions and levels: in the framework of education, on the cultural and intellectual level, and in areas of social and economic reorganizations. All of that rests on each country equally, through collective labor in which all our nations participate, with the required effectiveness and breadth of vision. In this noble work, the kingdom's role will be distinctive, thanks to the sum of the factors to which I referred earlier, in addition to the honor of embracing the two holy mosques. It is a responsibility that the kingdom bears in the most admirable manner, and from which King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz derives his title. We believe that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in firm cooperation with other of our prominent nations, will be able to drive the process of cultural revival, in which religious duty, moral restraint, and best interests must coincide, now and in the future. People will only rally around a noble idea that will drive intellectual efforts and rally spiritual energies. At this stage of our people's history, the big undertaking is the ability to bring them together and revive their enthusiasm anew, revive the Arab, Islamic civilization and to plan for a cultural "revolution" aimed at attaining progress, prosperity, and honor, starting from our fundamental cultural principles and our high spiritual values. `Concerning Shura and Change,' by Munah al-Solh, Lebanese politician and writer Government is choice. The custodian of the two holy mosques has chosen to give Shura. This is an Islamic principle and the method in force in the kingdom is a kind of council, with its form, personnel, and bases for action, within a framework of process of change. This was chosen as the method by King Fahd from the start of his exercise of official responsibility, even before he became king. His decision was made within local, Arab, and Islamic circumstances. The purpose was to generate confidence in abilities and capabilities and in the maturity to develop the Saudi society. This began with the reign of King 'Abd-al-'Aziz and has continued through the reign of King Fahd. In this stage, building and modernization has burst forth, marked by broad, comprehensive change in the growth of human capabilities, professional qualifications, and progress, in addition to the material infrastructure. All of this develops at a time when the kingdom's role in Arab, Islamic, and international circles is being comprehensively expanded through friendships and despite enmities. The spotlight points basically toward Islam, with its holy places, and on Arabism in the cradle of its inception. These intentions and manifestations have been nurtured in the hearts of the kingdom's mature people, who have grown in society, with a collective decision to heed the call of duty, since it is for king, nation, Arabism, and Islam. Naturally, the guardian of the two holy mosques was the first to perceive this historic maturity. He is the one who guided and watched over the growth of Saudi capabilities. He searched for and encouraged them in various fields. The four royal decrees, which arose from tangible and developed facts, rest on King Fahd's wager on the maturity of his people, especially the professional and intellectual elite of these people, to carry all the burdens of a institutionalization stage. Proof of this is the order to create the Consultative Council and the other orders for change. These orders, and the direct changes they contain for the kingdom's people and society, have received support and admiration from every Arab and Muslim and every impartial objective observer in the world. These changes are recognized again as the lofty spirit of Islam--more open than any other at any time or place, able to keep pace with developments, believing in science, a friend of mankind, unlimited in its excellent abilities. They are the spirit the Muslims adopt as their way toward progress and renewal of their historic role in the guidance of mankind. This spirit, which the Arab and Islamic ummah--and the Arabian Peninsula itself--extended at another time, and the capability to continue the renewal, is behind the decision to create the Consultative Council, which in all the world has had the best reverberations. In fact, it deserves more praise than the world has given it, in view of its importance and the values that it encompasses, in terms of a spirit of justice, openness, and wisdom. It is its nature to serve the Islamic reputation at a time in which Islam is being buffeted by campaigns directed from abroad, with their racist and greedy initiatives, benefiting from the errors and wrongs perpetrated by certain Muslims, whose actions and behavior leave a false impression regarding the spirit and goals of Islam. The truth is that every Arab and Muslim should thank King Fahd for this step, which will make the kingdom--domestically and abroad--spiritually stronger, with friendship and solidarity, and will give more opportunity for the capabilities and wills of Arabs and Muslims to serve and participate. `Concerning Shura and the System of Government,' by Mustafa Ahmad Ibn Halim, former Libyan prime minister Certain Arab intellectuals, influenced by Western culture, call for imitating the Western system, either in sum or in detail (perhaps, this call confirms the view of the great Islamic scholar, 'Abd-al-Rahman Ibn Khaldun, who said in his famous preface: "The vanquished often copy the victor.") In my humble opinion, we should not imitate the Western parliamentary system and interpose it into Islamic countries without any consideration for the words of God's book and the sunna of His Prophet, in terms of the lofty principles and precedents as established by the orthodox caliphs pertaining to systems of government, Shura, human rights, and high values in the ruler's dealings with citizens. I say that this imitating exceeds the bounds and is erroneous. Therefore, it behooves us to turn back to that valuable treasure, those noble Islamic concepts and practices, and extract a system of Shura from our shari'ah and legacy, which will regulate the affairs of government and provide the Islamic peoples with freedom, justice, and the opportunity for growth and prosperity. From history and fact, I would say that Western democracy, which some in our Arab world try to imitate, is a recent occurrence that the Western peoples produced after bloody, political uprisings, ruinous wars, and violent revolutions over many centuries. Moreover, contemporary, Western democratic systems only completed their growth and development in the first part of this century, after five centuries of bitter strife between the rigidity of the Catholic Church and the trends of liberating thought. These ideas seeped into Europe after the writings of Andalusian Arabs were translated into Latin and distributed in centers of European thought, especially the writings of Abi Walid Ibn Rushd (1126-1198). Why should we imitate Westerners in a system that was established to deal with their traditions, values, and aspirations, which differ from our traditions, values, and aspirations? Why should we not return to our Arab, Islamic roots, the shari'ah, sunna, heritage, values, and experience after practical applications? From all of this, we can derive a system of Islamic, consultative government, which will promote justice, security, and safety, protect human rights and integrity, open horizons for our Islamic peoples to progress and prosperity, hasten their way on their cultural journey, and strengthen and organize their standing and effectiveness within the new world order. It is correct to say that the equitable, fair standard by which any system of government should be evaluated lies in the degree of stability, security, safety, and opportunity for progress and prosperity that this system provides its people; the climate of freedom, justice, and human rights that the people enjoy; and the harmony and solidarity between ruler and the masses of people in the course of cultural progress. By this equitable standard, there is no doubt that the Saudi people are, in fact, proud of and devoted to their judicious, rightly-guided system. They are in harmony and solidarity with their brilliant leaders who have steered them--for generations--toward the highest stages of progress and the broadest horizons of culture, in an atmosphere of freedom, justice, and stability. The Saudi people have come to enjoy security, freedom, privileges, and comforts seldom found in any country similar to Saudi Arabia in the circumstances of its establishment and development. From that magnificent day on which the late King 'Abd-al-'Aziz unified the Saudi country and established a true, Islamic system of government, the course of rapid progress and judicious development continued in firm steps toward higher stages of civilization and prosperity, despite the fact the journey began from virtually nothing. With regard to where this blessed journey began, perhaps it would be appropriate to mention here what I heard from my late father upon his return from his last pilgrimage in 1938. He compared that pilgrimage with his first one in 1912, during the Hashemite rule of the Hijaz. He told me that the first thing he did in preparing for his first trip to Mecca was to buy a gun to protect himself and his companions against highway robbers, especially on the caravan route between Mecca and Medina. However, on his last pilgrimage, he felt safe and secure. The regime provided him and the rest of the pilgrims with the necessary facilities and basic services. He performed his obligation in ease and comfort. This was in regard to security and safety. As for civilized development, it is worth pointing out the basic fact that God did not afflict Saudi Arabia with the wrath of colonialism but, on the other hand, it did not enjoy some of the "privileges of colonialism!" (The reader may think it odd that I would say that colonialism had certain privileges. I am from a country and generation both of whom suffered from the woes of odious colonialism.) Colonialism might have had some benefits, as happened in my first country, Libya. The Italians erected many buildings and built most of the public facilities, including roads, ports, hospitals, electricity and telephone networks, etc. But, the colonialists built the buildings and constructed the public facilities to be enjoyed by the children of their countrymen, the Italian settlers. However, God's power is great; the Italians were defeated and the Libyans inherited those facilities and buildings, in spite of the colonialists. We had begun our civilizing journey in Libya. The country's public facilities and its infrastructure were sound, save for some war damage. In Saudi Arabia, the journey toward prosperity started from zero. I personally saw some of the effects of this fact on my first visit to Saudi Arabia in October 1957, at the kind invitation of the late King Sa'ud. On that visit, my attention was drawn to the fact that that journey toward civilization was still in its first stages. The city of Riyadh did not compare at all with West Tripoli, for example. The public services--electricity, telephone, water and sewage extensions--did not compare with their counterparts in Libya. I mentioned that I saluted King Sa'ud, because he invited the late Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab 'Azzam to help him establish the first university in the kingdom, while the first Libyan university was built and began operation in 1955 in Benghazi, specifically in the al-Manar Castle, which the late King Idris had abandoned and which, in fact, had been headquarters for the Italian governor general. We inherited it as part of our inheritance from the Italians. I should not fail to mention that oil would not be discovered in Libya until 1957. Today the level of progress in Saudi Arabia has reached an astonishing degree. Construction and the major development of public facilities has spread, until it can be compared with its counterparts in America and Europe. Saudi cities, especially Jiddah and Riyadh, have reached a level of organization, prosperity, and expansion commensurate with the foremost cities of the world. Universities have multiplied; there are now seven, including departments that provide higher education (masters degrees and doctorates). The number of graduates has multiplied and totals tens of thousands. Specialized hospitals are located throughout the kingdom. The number of students in elementary, preparatory, and secondary schools is in the millions. Saudi Arabia has also become a major source for agricultural products. I could go on and on, describing the situation in Saudi Arabia today, fairly and accurately. Let us now quickly compare the situations of the Saudi and Libyan peoples. Despite the fact that the ruling regime in Libya has earned oil revenues over the past 20 years that exceed $250 billion, after the discovery of oil in Libya during the previous monarchy, and the successes of discovering oil riches with a speed that is nearly miraculous, and the explosion of that ideal capability from oil profits during the monarchy, the truth seeker has the right to question what this enormous wealth has done for the Libyan people. How much progress, prosperity, freedom, and security do they enjoy? So that I may be fair, I will cite here a literal translation of our article published in the famous economic magazine, THE ECONOMIST, about Libya. We said: "Despite the fact that there is wide latitude for action in projects to improve health and education services, a comparison of the simplest measures of economic and social progress shows that, after 40 years of independence, after 30 years of oil revenues and especially after 20 years of oil income to a utopian degree, Libya still occupies its humble position among the poorest countries of the world, as concerns education, the average age for Libyans, and their nutrition and health. In these areas, Libya also occupies the lowest level among the OPEC nations, or rather, the worst level. In some aspects of public services, which touch the lives of all individuals, the level of those services in Libya is lower than that in Tunisia and the Arab Republic of Egypt. According to well-known facts that we have, and according to our expectations, the gap between Libya and the advanced countries will constantly increase, until, at least, 2000." This is a part of our article in THE ECONOMIST, in its supplement issued in April 1990. This quick comparison between the system of government in Saudi Arabia and its effect on the condition of the Saudi people, and the system of government in Libya and its effect on the Libyan people, confirms that the most important element of the causes of progress and prosperity of any people lies in the quality of the people's leadership. If God blesses any people with wise leadership, in which there are ample qualities of mental acuteness, sincerity, self-sacrifice, long-range planning, perspicacity, and insight into events, then that leadership will be able to lead the people along paths of progress and upper mobility, toward horizons of prosperity and freedom. The people would sense justice, stability, and enjoyment of their rights. They would fulfill their national duty in harmony and satisfaction, increasing their cohesiveness and confidence in their leadership. This is what has happened in Saudi Arabia, which God blessed with wise leadership that has taken the people by the hand to higher levels, has developed their affairs to a high level in a short time, and has relied on a constitution derived from the Koran and the Prophet's sunna and, then, God bestowed the major oil wealth, which has been used for the benefit of the people. If leaders are bad and their quality sinks to a level of ignorance, deception, and irresponsibility, and their rule is oppressive, not consultative nor democratic, and if they only rely on hollow slogans to call for the people to close ranks and mobilize their efforts to combat corruption, expedite liberation, and catch up with civilized progress, all experience has proved the failure of those systems to attain the objectives they call for. On the contrary, those leaders only increase people's problems, make their problems more complex, make them poorer, and increase their wretchedness. I saw what happened in my first country, Libya, at the hands of the new regime. The people's funds and treasure went up in smoke. The proteges plunder, and the rest of the people sink under the burden of poverty, oppression, and need. This quick comparison contains a warning: systems of government that God blesses with judicious and wise leadership steer their people rapidly toward horizons of prosperity, construction, and progress, in a climate of freedom, justice, and equality. As for those to whom God has given childish rulers, ignorant and deceptive, they will lead their people with hollow slogans toward desolation in poverty, oppression, and absolutism. In short, we do not need to imitate the West and its traditions. In our religion, history, heritage, and values, we have valuable roots to enable us to devise a Shura system appropriate for our circumstances and commensurate with our traditions, which will give us the opportunity of cultural progress, and economic prosperity in an atmosphere of freedom and human integrity. This is what King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques, has done with his recent declaration about organizing a cabinet and creating the Consultative Council. This is a wise and blessed step, and a far-reaching political decision, anchored to the fundamentals of an Islamic system of government. God caused the custodian of the two holy mosques to be successful in choosing a distinguished elite, those with correct views, superior intelligence, good reputation, and high educational qualifications. The Consultative Council, composed of this chosen elite, reflects the main characteristics of Saudi society and will easily interact with its aspirations and hopes. `Building of Man Before Building Institutions in Saudi Arabia,' by Khalid al-Hasan, member of FATAH's Central Committee The [formation of the] Consultative Council [Shura], announced in Saudi Arabia, is a major step forward. It is a specific leap in the relationship between problems and the ability to solve them on the desired level. The essential reason behind that is the multiplicity of qualifications in many of the people who have become members of the Shura Council. People qualified in each subject are the first to offer opinions, concerns, and suggestions concerning the subject that concerns them, i.e., the doctor in the case of health, teacher in the case of education, the businessman regarding the economy, and the judge or Islamic jurist concerning legislation. Then, discussion takes place through the full council, in order to crystallize the matter by study and discussion from various angles. Through a method like this, the superficial and simplistic in discussing matters can be overcome. Frequently, ailments befall certain parliaments, so that it is not necessary for each of those who are elected to have the ability to participate in specialized debate. Shura has existed since Islam existed. But, the Islamic shari'ah did not set the specificity of Shura. Shura was explained in the Koranic verses: "Consult them in (important) matters", and "Their affairs are (decided) by council among themselves." These two basic verses set the relationship between the ruler [Wali al-Amr] and the people. As for the form of Shura and its methods, this is left to the people, but within precepts pertaining to the Islamic revelation and the Islamic milieu. This is the matter that might require clarification. Rule in Islamic society is by the shari'ah and not by man. Compliance with the shari'ah is the focal point of thought in society. One of the ruler's responsibilities is to supervise implementation of the shari'ah. After that, but implied in it, comes Shura. The Consultative Council's mission is to scrutinize the carrying out of shari'ah laws by the various agencies. In Islamic history, there was the so-called "Office of Iniquities." This office was a center and headquarters to look into disputes between persons or between persons and government, whether the government was a city or district or regional. The matter of Shura is ancient, but its forms are multiple. It develops or changes with the development of society and its changes. Medina's society, which contained a few thousand people, could apply Shura there directly and daily, but the situation is different with a society like Saudi Arabia today, which contains a number of cities and a population of several million. Moreover, the situation differs when the matter of Shura forms in the Islamic world as a whole is studied. Because of these differences, the shari'ah left the form of Shura to changing circumstances and situations, on the basis of the Islamic jurisprudent principle; "Do not disavow changing of precepts with changing times." Procedural matters might be changed, but the important thing is that Shura occur and occur in a sound form. However, the way to apply Shura is left to circumstances. It must not be a leap from reality, nor a rush to burn previous stages. The Arabian Peninsula was nothing but a group of clashing tribes, before its unification and before the creation of modern Saudi Arabia under the authority of the late King 'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud. With the beginning of unification, the establishment of central authority began. In the early days, it was focused on providing the security that was lacking, and from which travellers suffered, even the pilgrims at times. It goes without saying that the establishment of central authority was not done overnight, and it also need not be mentioned that the matter of Shura--at that time--had to take an appropriate form for that stage. After the reign of the founder, King 'Abd-al-'Aziz, his successors continued to develop and expand the forms of Shura as well. Then came the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin 'Abd-al-'Aziz, during whose reign the kingdom has reached an extremely advanced state. At this point, I must point out that Saudi progress is often described as being slow, but I believe that this slowness was a kind of deliberateness, out of awareness of the difficulties of the situation, out of a policy of deliberateness toward change. In this way, change would be accepted and understood by the people, without convulsions pushing society toward the unknown. However, this slowness was crystallized in turn by a social revolution, considered to be the pearl of revolutions among Third World countries. It is sufficient to note the development of communications in Saudi Arabia, from overland roads to airports and railroads. We can see how that has led to unifying the structure of a tribal society and facilitating its domestic efficiency, since vast distances precluded that before. Moreover, a look at development in building schools, and education in general, from the elementary stage to girls' education, from seven universities to academic studies to obtain higher degrees abroad, shows us the kind of change that occurred in building the Saudi citizen. No less creative a matter is what happened in health and hospitals, agriculture and production in an arid desert environment, and the spread of radio, television, and the press as instruments of mass communication. All of these factors join together, shaping Saudi progress, thanks to the custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, whose share in this progress is especially distinguished, from overseeing education affairs to running the kingdom. As a result of this deliberate, gradual and, at the same time, profound change, it has been possible for Shura to reach the level of an announcement that the "Consultative Council" has been formed. The coming of this council is the result of this stage, after most of the manifestations of life in the kingdom have been developed, and after the Saudi citizen has been developed, educated and cultured, specialized and committed to his heritage. Shura came as a result of change, not as an artificial decree from above. It came as an expression of societal concepts, which were built through Saudi experience, not as a means to resolve clashes among suicidal groups, as has happened in certain experiences of other countries. Election I know that there are Western claims circulating about the matter of elections. They consider elections to be the sole province of democracy only. We must not fall prisoner to this kind of moral pressure. In many Third World countries circumstances have not as yet allowed implementation of the idea of elections. The concept of elections must be preceded by a societal concept. This concept only comes through a process of long-term growth and change in the economic and social structure. When society is divided into two major tribes for example, as is the case in certain African countries, and one of the two is larger than the other, the result of elections--by virtue of this tribal situation--will be victory for the candidates of the major tribe and defeat for candidates of the smaller tribe. This causes various types and forms of civil war, as is occurring at the present time in Nigeria and Angola. Elections, in a situation like this, are harmful to the country concerned that has not yet been prepared for the concept of elections, or in which elections are merely a form of, or cover for, the victory of tribal candidates on the basis of tribalism. Here, the West applauds, because the form has been implemented without concern for substance. Our goal is not to satisfy the West, but rather to develop our country. From this premise, we must discuss our procedures. As Muslims, we must turn our attention to the substance that will benefit the citizens, as well as making sure the substance is harmonious with our Islamic cultural and legal heritage. We must not merely imitate the West and fall into its secular, ideological framework. Democracy Another question that requires looking into is the question of democracy. At this point, we must also not fall prisoner to the moral pressure exercised by the West with regard to this concept. Democracy is not one idea or one form. Democracy was born and developed in the West in multiple forms. The West's positions vis-a-vis democracy are filled with contradictions. The democracy that started from the Greek ideas, which are the basis for Western thought, had racist beginnings. Democracy belonged to the masters who ruled the slaves; Islam rejected that from the beginning. Democracy in Israel today is democracy that the West introduced to it. It is also democracy based on race. The Jew enjoys democracy; the non-Jew has no right to it, while the oriental Jew has a reduced kind. The West today pursues a selective position vis-a-vis democracy. It demands it in any country if its interests require it, but ignores a dictatorship in another country if its interests require. It treats democracy as a means of pressure, not as a general principle for the good of mankind. Even democracy in the West has passed through numerous changes and conditions. Sometimes only landowners may vote. Sometimes only taxpayers may vote. Sometimes only men and not women may vote. This matter has not been free from bloody revolutions en route to democratic change. This confirms the connection between the idea of democracy and the degree of social development; it cannot be discussed outside this framework or in a general way. We should not allow ourselves to be gripped by an inferiority complex by the use of the word "democracy" instead of Shura. We must always insist on using the terminology whose substance is in harmony with our Islamic culture. Legislation We must examine one last subject, which is that many of our problems in Islamic societies result from our not having applied laws that have been derived from our Islamic heritage. Instead of that, we turn to the adoption of Western laws. We must make an effort to understand what we have, so that we may recognize that what we have has been valuable all along. We have three distinguished legislative principles: - The first principle is that--basically--matters are permitted, unless evidence arises to prohibit them. This means the horizon before us is open. - The second principle is that the violation exists with the rule. If the violation exists, the rule exists, and if the violation vanishes, the rule vanishes. That is, if the circumstance changes for which the rule was made, the rule must be changed. - The third principle is that the purpose of the shari'ah is to prevent the causes of corruption and promote the good, and to prevent the cause of corruption from gaining advantages. Principles such as these not only achieve justice, but also achieve openness, on the basis of not disavowing the changing of laws with changing times. I only mention that so that I can stress that our judicial heritage is excellent, rich, and deep-rooted. Even senior secularist jurists recognize that. Therefore, we must not be a prisoner to the mentality of imitating the West. Man is the product of his past, and the past cannot be annulled, except by our inability to build the future constructively. `Significance of Decision To Create Saudi Shura Council,' by Ahmad 'Abbas Salih The issue of modernization has been the major topic in Arab and Islamic societies for more than two centuries. During this period, it became clear to the Arabs especially that they had missed the train and that Europe had taken over the situation and was able to move forward in areas of science and technology. This gave Europe military and economic power, as well as being reflected in social concepts and political systems. The Arabs understood that they must regain the old situation, when Arab and Islamic civilization held the reins of progress in science, technology, and organization. For that purpose, a number of revolutionary movements were established in the region. The Ottoman Caliphate was completely worn out, bribery and corruption were rampant, and culture had degenerated in all facets of life. This was even reflected in religious tenets and customs. The Arabs--in some way--felt that they were responsible for purifying their religious beliefs of the contamination that was attached to them. This had resulted in a state of social malaise and cultural deterioration, leading to the general deterioration experienced by the region. Of course, the Arabs thought that they were capable of carrying out a corrective movement, since they were products of the cradle of Islam. In fact, a major religious movement, led by Imam Muhammad Ibn 'Abd-al-Wahhab, was established, aimed at purifying religious beliefs of the contamination that had seeped into them, and returning religion to its pure fundamentals. This was considered the start of a new rational stage, able to overcome the existing deterioration and catch the train of progress. This was not easy. At this time, European expansion was sweeping the world. It was plucking weak fruit and eating away at the Ottoman Empire, which was ruling in the name of Islam. Naturally, Europe was compelled to take into account the modernization movements in the Arab world. These major powers were responsible for suppressing and thwarting the modernization movements. Nevertheless, the modernization movements were reflected in various forms from the Maghreb nations to the eastern countries. In Egypt, a strong modernization movement was led by Imam Muhammad 'Abdu, which had a connection with what was, at that time, called the Wahabiyya Movement, especially on the rational side, which eschewed the superstitions that had been affixed to the religious beliefs of the Muslim masses. These superstitions had almost led to a kind of paganism that relied on extreme backwardness. Aside from religious modernization movements, there were feelings of partition and division in the Arab world. The modernization movement in the Arabian Peninsula was based on two focal points: religion and political reorganization. The basic political thought was peninsular unity. The unity would have been impossible to achieve, were it not for the latent feelings within the people of the peninsula with regard to the need for unity and its importance. The idea of modernization imposes itself, when foreign powers and their domestic allies create obstacles that oppose it. Many of the obstacles and subterfuges that reactionary forces in Europe used against the modernization movement were borrowed to block the Arab, Islamic movement. Most of the allegations that were raised in this regard, either on the Saudi scene or in other Arab arenas, and some of the erroneous ideas, claimed that progress and modernity were two Western, Christian processes, and were anti-Islam. People feared the modernization movements and created a state of satisfied alienation around themselves, which led to the belief that adherence to the existing backward conditions was adherence to the correct religious beliefs. Therefore, they made Islam to look as if it were against progress. They invalidated all the brilliant history, in which Islam led the world--in its glorious ages--to all manner of progress in thought, philosophy, and pure sciences and technology. Therefore, the modernization movement is the fundamental movement; it is progress itself, escape from backwardness, ignorance, and subservience. It is the closest to the Islamic concept, benefiting from the events of history, and from the flourishing of that call throughout the world and within masses of its people. The measurement of progress, the measure of modernization, is the basic measure. With this measurement, people can deal directly with tangible events. The fact is that Saudi Arabia has benefited from oil prosperity and from the legacy of the religious and political modernization movement. It has been able to achieve, through education, great leaps forward and has changed the nature of the political composition. After less than 50 years, it has specialized cadres in all fields. Those who take a look at the Saudi condition will find that the most prominent manifestation is the cultural movement. That is expressed through the number of universities that have been built in a short time, as well as the revolutionary explosion in the media field, represented notably by press editions and data communication centers. Saudi Arabian society has, therefore, gone far beyond the movement and works hard to absorb many of the movement's complications resulting from the rapid pace of modernization processes which, at times, resembles cultural shock. In situations like these, people must hold on to the land and remember their popular roots in arts, crafts, and customs. That can be expressed in festivals that are held to recall ancient ways that are rapidly becoming extinct before their eyes, such as arts, crafts, and popular aesthetics. The [Janadariyah] festivals are proof of that. Saudi Arabia is going through what the Japanese society went through. The rapid Japanese modernization movement was responsible for many changes in educational, social, and cultural life in general. The Japanese people had to find sound ways to avoid the complications of modernization. One of the most important method was through nostalgia, or feelings of longing for the past. The same thing is happening in Saudi Arabia; the flourishing educational movement understands that and tries to absorb it by cultural means, by considering its various aspects, and by comprehensive understanding. The Consultative [Shura] Council, and the accompanying law concerning Cabinet responsibilities and work regulations, is a natural acceleration of the modernization process, complements previous actions and accomplishments, and responds to its requirements. One of the notable matters concerning the new council is the quality of its members. Those who read the names and know the details will understand that the Saudi intelligentsia is entering the decision-making arena, as if it were called to participate, to be at the heart of the modernization process that began--in fact--several decades ago. One of its results is the emergence of this huge number of intellectuals, experts, and specialists. Any modernization movement, in any society, requires foundations and institutions. Saudi Arabia had reached the stage where its modernization movement needed to expand in terms of cadres and organizations. The emergence of the institution of the Shura Council and, then, the Cabinet and the Royal Secretariat, as well as the media establishment and other organizations in agriculture, trade, industry, and education, is clear proof of conditions inside Saudi Arabia and the spread of a new cultural pattern. The fact is that the Saudi modernization movement has great historic responsibility. It is proof of progress in various fields, including expansion in civilizing institutions, not the destabilizing of previous traditions and concepts. It has become a movement of major accomplishments, by which Islam and world Arabs have been enriched. Fortunately, the material resources and fair distribution of wealth in Saudi Arabia has greatly decreased the acuteness of side effects that usually result from the pace of modernization, and its impact on people and various social forces, which linger here and there by virtue of their cultural or social composition. In any event, the modernization movement is not proceeding in haste, nor at a headlong clip, but rather, it proceeds--in fact--step by step, practical and reasonable, understanding the dimensions of the model toward which it is headed. Through this practical process, which will open new horizons, opportunities and difficulties, successes and failures will emerge. The mission of the group of the new intelligentsia, and especially the members of the Shura Council, will be to overcome all these problems, develop the role of Shura, and participate effectively in the modernization movement that is in full swing. A glance at human history in its different transformations makes it clear that wealth is a basic factor for progress. All changes in the entire world were the result of having wealth, no matter what its source. One example could be the emergence of the importance of commerce to a specific society. Whether discovering natural wealth, or possessing tremendous scientific, technical, and psychological capabilities, the society spends it for progress and expansion. Wealth is the basis for progress, but wealth alone does not create progress. The discovery of coal in Britain was the main reason for its progress and wealth but, aside from that, there was the constructive will, social desire, and prudent use of that wealth. Saudi Arabia has the necessary structure that resurgent societies rely upon, and it has used that to create an enormous development process. This process has led to the emergence of broad population segments of expertise and the institutions required for progress. Apart from that, the Saudi people are building on their extremely important historical glory. It is well known that from the heart of this land, from a vegetation-less wadi, the greatest, most magnificent unification movement in the world began. It changed the face of the land and spread justice, freedom, and morality. It tore down the rule of false gods and opened minds to study and discovery. It brought peace and order to all the land. The present process of social growth in Saudi Arabia relies on a splendid heritage, practical reality and, before all, a wonderful opportunity for maturity. Creating the Shura Council, and the changes preceding and following this action, is an indication of the soundness of these trends and the achievement of aspirations. Perhaps, this is the simplest significance that the neutral observer can deduce from this decision.
