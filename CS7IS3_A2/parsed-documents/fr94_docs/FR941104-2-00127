FR941104-2-00127 FR941104-2-00076 ``*␣*␣* Provided further, That of the funds provided, $7,500,000 shall remain available until expended, for the Indian Self-Determination Fund, which shall be available for the transitional cost of initial or expanded tribal contracts, grants or cooperative agreements with the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination Act.'' In addition, the Conference Report accompanying the FY 1995 Interior Appropriations Act states: ``Modified language proposed by the Senate to place a cap on the amount of funding to be made available for fiscal year 1995 and to separate the amount of contract support for ongoing self-determination agreements entered into prior to fiscal year 1995 from that provided for new awards first entered into during fiscal year 1995. The purpose of separating the amount available for ongoing agreements from that for new and expanded agreements is to stabilize the fund for ongoing awards and still provide contract support funding for new and expanded contracts. The Bureau is expected to implement procedures for administering the new Indian Self-Determination Fund, for which $7,500,000 is provided, consistent with those of the Indian Health Service. The Bureau should fund new contracts at the 100 percent level. ``The Bureau is expected to begin developing procedures for eventual transfer of contract support into each tribe's tribal priority allocation. Once this has been accomplished, the tribes will be able to manage their total program costs within their overall funding allocation. ``The cap is not intended to limit the flexibility of tribes to reprogram within tribal priority allocations to obtain full recovery of indirect costs if a shortfall in contract support were to occur. Accordingly, the managers anticipate that tribes, individually or in agreement with other tribes may reprogram within tribal priority allocations without regard to the contract support ceiling. Reprogramming on a Bureau-wide basis is not authorized for this purpose.'' Summary Statement A total of $103,125,653 is available for contract support requirements (excluding construction contracts) during FY 1995. Of this amount $95,639,978 is available for contract support requirements associated with the FY 1995 costs of ongoing self-determination and self-governance awards for programs under contract prior to FY 1995. The balance of $7,485,675 is provided to establish an Indian Self-Determination (ISD) Fund to provide contract support for new and expanded contracts first entered into in FY 1995. These amounts include the general reduction of 0.191 percent, in accordance with the Title III General Provisions §313, Public Law 103&hyph;332. Each BIA Area Office and the Office of Self-Governance (hereinafter office) has the responsibility for tribes located within their respective area to work with the tribes in identifying existing and new and expanded contracts and reporting this information to the Division of Self-Determination Services as specified in this announcement. CSF shall be added to awards made under §102 and Title III of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended. Awards made under the authority of §103 of this Act shall not receive CSF to meet indirect costs, as contract support provisions do not apply to §103 grants. Basis for Payment of CSF The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will utilize tribal indirect cost rates to determine the amount of CSF to be paid to eligible contracting tribes and tribal organizations. In determining legitimate FY 1995 indirect cost requirements each office should fund only those contracting or compacting tribal organizations that have approved FY 1994 or 1995 indirect cost rates or current indirect cost proposals being considered by the Bureau or to be negotiated by the Inspector General. Current proposals means proposals for FY 1995 scheduled for active consideration which are pending before the Inspector General on or before June 30, 1995. Ongoing/Existing Contracts Each office will be suballotted 75 percent of the total amount reported as contract support needs for FY 1994 as soon as funds become available. Each office is to award 75 percent of required contract support to each award meeting the criteria established below as of the beginning date of the annual funding period for such awards. Contractors with approved FY 1994 indirect cost rates, but without current proposals pending before the Inspector General, are eligible for 50 percent of the required contract support for such awards. Additional CSF shall not be provided until such time as a current proposal is received by the Inspector General.
