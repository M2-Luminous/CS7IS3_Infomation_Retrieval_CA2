This is because Israel was not content with the horrible Hebron massacre; it added to the many killed worshipers, who were praying to God at the Ibrahimi Mosque, at least 30 other martyrs, who were killed by the Israeli army's bullets, in addition to hundreds of wounded. Yesterday, Israel, using anti-tank rockets, destroyed a number of houses in Dayr al-Balah, deployed large military forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip cities, closed Jerusalem, denied worshipers access to the places of worship, and turned the entire occupied homeland into a large battlefield. Meanwhile, and out of persistence in provoking our kinsfolk under the hateful occupation, new groups of Zionist settlers have headed for Hebron. All this is taking in front of the international community and the Security Council which failed to condemn Israel and end its criminal acts that conflict with UN principles, the Geneva agreements, and human rights. It is strange that some parties in the international community are talking and clamoring about human right violations in many countries while at the same time they are turning a blind eye to the Israelis' crimes and the serious Hebron massacre which claimed the lives of more than 50 innocent Palestinian citizens. Therefore, it seems that the policy of double standards continues to be the prevailing practice. This arbitrary policy, however, cannot make a stable and secure world that would be kept away from wars and threats. It is sufficient for us to examine the UN reports, the testimonies of UN observers, and the resolutions passed by the Security Council and the UN General Assembly since 1947 to clearly sense that the Zionist military organizations -- and afterward Israel, which was recognized by many states in 1948 as an independent entity -- have committed disgraceful massacres and crimes. Some 46 years have passed since Israel's establishment and incorporation into the United Nations. However, Israel still flagrantly violates the UN principles. A crystal-clear example of this was the Hebron Mosque massacre. But, has Israel ever been punished? Has the international community championed its own principles and the values of justice? In an attempt to justify the international community's inefficiency, the powerful western states in the Security Council have claimed that Arabs reject peace with Israel. More than two years have passed since the Madrid conference convened; the Washington talks have entered their third year; and the Arab delegations have continuously frequented Washington without any result. Moreover, Syria submitted a document of principles, which the entire world regarded as a historic event because it contained positive, constructive, and balanced proposals. Israel, however, rejected this document because it provides for exchanging land for peace. Israel wants land first, in addition to Arab recognition of Israel and the relinquishment of their own lands and rights. In other words, Israel wants to entrench occupation, usurpation, and the policy of expulsions and aggression as a consistent attitude in the Middle East. The international community should have strongly and firmly intervened to impose a just and comprehensive peace in the region. However, nothing has happened in this regard. This is because the international community has not yet gone beyond the phase of wishing that Israel would pursue the peace process. Everything is taking place as if Israel is above the international law and agreements. It is thus natural that the instincts of haughtiness and arrogance are overwhelming the Israeli rulers, so they reject peace, persist in the policy of killings, annihilation, and expulsions, and seriously pursue the policies of the old Nazis, knowing that these rulers have long claimed they were victims to Nazi policy. The Middle East is still a powder keg. If this keg explodes, its repercussions will affect the region and the whole world. Now that the Middle East situation is serious, the United States has given priority to achieving a just and comprehensive solution on all fronts of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The United States made an initiative which the Arabs accepted. But Israel has not yet accepted it. Israel will definitely not comply with this initiative if the two cosponsors of the peace process, along with the international community, do not intervene to rectify matters and consecrate the Security Council's principles and resolutions as the only basis for a just and comprehensive solution. The question posed is: When will the international community move and assume its responsibilities, knowing that the Hebron massacre was a rare opportunity for this council to impose its authority and consecrate its principles?
