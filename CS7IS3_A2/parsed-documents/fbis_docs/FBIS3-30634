But these unsuccessful efforts prove that the option of dividing Bosnia will not help stop the war there, which is aggravating confrontation, the crisis in the Balkans, insecurity in the region, contradictions and opposition in the international community. Therefore, I think that this option should be replaced with another which will be in accord with all international laws and rules, on which the peace and security of each country is based and which does not compensate the aggressor. There is only one option which is based on this principle, which may prove to be successful and will put an end, in the international aspect, to the numerous approaches and practices which have so far been an obstacle. This option will impose agreement on belligerent factions and withdrawal on the aggressor. But, Mr. Berisha said, besides Bosnia, Kosova is still a major problem to be solved in the context of the Balkan crisis. To this end, a meeting of Belgrade authorities with the legitimate representative of Kosova, Mr. Rugova, in the presence of a third party, would be welcome and useful. It would also be of a special value if in the documents of the European Union, along with the resolution of the question of Bosnia, a "modus vivendi" be also found for Kosova. With regard to the lifting of the embargo against Serbia, it should be totally linked with the solution of this problem because any facilitation of the embargo may lead to a spillover of the Balkan conflict towards the south. Further on, President Berisha underlined that the relations of Albania with Macedonia are strengthening continuously. We have been and are for a close cooperation with Macedonia. The question of arms trafficking is an old matter with which the Albanian democratic government has no connection at all and all necessary documents exist to prove it. In the mean time, we have welcome the decision of the Macedonian Government for the census in a near future. Signs of progress have also been noticed in our relations with Montenegro," Mr. Berisha said in conclusion. In his address, Lord Owen presented a panorama of the efforts of negotiators to find an acceptable solution for all sides. He considered peace an indispensability for the region and for Albania. It is high time, he said, that the question of Kosova be treated in the talks as a part of this crisis. In the context of the efforts to find out a solution, Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg stressed the need of a regional conference with the participation of all countries which are slightly or largely affected by this crisis. President Berisha supported the idea for the regional meeting in the framework of the Geneva Conference and emphasized that Albania will always be open to dialogue and interested to contribute to peace and stability in the region.
