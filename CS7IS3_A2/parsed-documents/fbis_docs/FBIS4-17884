The Israeli prime minister believes that by making its actions in the international arena more active last month, our country is entering a new period of foreign and domestic policy. As far as the Middle East settlement is concerned, Yitzhaq Rabin highly estimated the role of Russia and the United States as mediators in the progress of the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. However, he believes the solution of the problem depends, above all, on the sides involved in the conflict. The prime minister expressed Israel's interest in extending bilateral contacts with Russia and said in future they will spread to the military sphere. Yitzhaq Rabin believes the forthcoming visit by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to Tel Aviv will be the first step in the development of Israeli-Russian cooperation in this field.
