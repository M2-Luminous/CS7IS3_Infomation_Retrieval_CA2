FR940830-2-00010 FR940830-2-00004 Soil Conservation Service Moxee Watershed Project, Yakima County, WA AGENCY: Soil Conservation Service. ACTION: Notice of finding of no significant impact. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR part 1500); and the Soil Conservation Service Regulations (7 CFR part 650); the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, gives notice that an environmental impact statement is not being prepared for the Moxee Watershed Project, Yakima County, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lynn A. Brown, State Conservationist, Soil Conservation Service, Rock Pointe Tower, West 316 Boone Ave., Suite # 450, Spokane, Washington 99201. Telephone: (509) 353&hyph;2337. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicated that the project will not cause significant local, regional, or national adverse impacts to the environment. As a result of these findings, Lynn A. Brown, State Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement is not needed for this project. The project purpose is to improve the water quality of the Yakima River. The major practice proposed is the conversion of surface irrigation to drip irrigation on approximately 5,000 acres. This practice will virtually eliminate tailwater from these fields therefore eliminating irrigation induced erosion which has contributed to poor water quality in the Yakima River. The other proposed conservation practices include: irrigation water management, nutrient management, and pesticide management. The North Yakima Conservation District will be sponsors of the proposed project. They will encourage development and installation of conservation plans on all eligible land within the watershed. They will provide leadership through an aggressive information and education program to encourage the application of land treatment measures necessary for the success of this plan. The Notice of a Finding Of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Frank R. Easter, Assistant State Conservationist (Programs). No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication in the Federal Register . Dated: August 23, 1994. Lynn A. Brown, State Conservationist. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21305 Filed 8&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;16&hyph;M
