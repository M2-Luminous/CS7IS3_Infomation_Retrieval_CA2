No, he can tell the press nothing. "You have to see the interministerial commission in charge of the inquiry." Nevertheless the director of the Tazoult prison confirmed for us that he had sent several reports to the justice minister in which he alerted the agency that he reported to about the urgency of improving security at the Lambese prison. The first of his letters was dated two years ago and thus coincides with the emergence of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. Faced with this phenomenon, which was becoming greater and greater, and even attacking several prisons, it was necessary, he wrote, to step up security measures. Despite the precedents of Sidi-Ghiles and the Batna prison from which Islamic fundamentalist prisoners were reported to have escaped in 1983, according to the local newspaper EL- ATLAS, and despite the revolts and attacks on prisoner convoys, the director of the Tazoult prison got no response. None. All the same, that silence was disturbing when you consider that that prison housed hardened terrorists while maintaining an absolutely ordinary security force. Recently the cries for help from Tazoult's director had become urgent. He frankly feared what finally happened: a full-fledged attack on the prison. What in particular had added urgency to his alarm? Besides the general security situation, persistent rumors had reached him describing imminent attacks on the prison in which Islamic fundamentalist prisoners serve their sentences. These rumors even specified the date of the "release" operations: they were scheduled initially for 27 December, in commemoration of the so-called clean and honest elections. Why, given current political and security conditions, were these things not taken seriously? "I do not understand," the director says simply. Returning to the circumstances of the attack and breakout, he told us that he was with his family in their home at the prison when the first gunshots were fired. "I had just broken the fast when armed men, whose number I cannot give precisely, began their assault." The vehicles used (light ones or trucks), he would continue, remained outside, whereas the police station and gendarme brigade were under siege and the village surrounded. "They had taken up their positions all around in the various neighborhoods and were letting off rounds of gunfire as a diversion at the time we were attacked." Outside reinforcements, coming basically from Batna, he added, "only arrived on the scene at around 2100. Over 3 or 4 km, the road was torn up in places and strewn with nails in others. Vehicles left on the pavement also blocked the road." But this, in his eyes, does not justify such a delay, all the more so, he went on to tell us, because in the city of Batna there are air forces. "The two helicopters they have there could easily get to the village in the space of two or three minutes and step in, but that did not happen." In his reports to the Justice Ministry, the director of the prison mentioned his suspicions with regard to certain guards. These suspicions turned out to be well founded: five of the guards took the key to the grounds with the attackers and the terrorist prisoners. Tazoult's director is sure of it: these five guards were accomplices; they took part in the attack. So they are not hostages, as the laconic communique from the Justice Ministry stated. Yes, everything seems highly unusual, beginning with the huge delay the security forces took before stepping in. Returning to the breakout, only the prison's two small gates had been opened by staff who were accomplices. It was at that moment that certain guards and the prison director himself, from his home, tried to resist, but the attackers outnumbered them: "one of my men would die in the scuffle and three others were wounded." The gunshots of the attackers were interspersed, according to our informant, by shouts of "Allahu Akbar, We will live or we will die." "I don't understand a thing," the director repeats. No one understands how this announced attack on a prison that was supposed to be impregnable, and in which the most dangerous terrorists, those from Guemmar and Bechar, were incarcerated, could have been carried off with such alarming ease. Yes, highly unusual.
