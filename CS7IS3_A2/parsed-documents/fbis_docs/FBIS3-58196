It only became more dangerous. Good election outcomes usually have an immediate effect on the opposition within a political party. Large portions disappear. Not so with the opposition within the governing party. It takes part of the credit for the Storting election victory, and since then has established itself as a separate organization within the labor movement. This has laid the basis for a power struggle that will take place as much outside of, as in, the spotlight of the media. On the surface it might appear that SME (Social Democrats Against EC) has not accomplished much in the months since its establishment. About the only thing the public has seen of the organization was its victory in the vote in the Storting just before Christmas [a vote for all four EC applicant countries to conduct their referendums on the same date]. In view of the fact that practically all EC opponents in the Labor Party and in the Labor Confederation belong to SME, it might seem strange that we hear so little about the organization in these days of summing up 1993 politically. It will be very different come this time next year. The SME strategists want a low public profile. To them the most important thing is avoiding the accusations of promoting factionalism for the purpose of undermining the national party congress's resolution to vote yes to the EC. As a result, they take every opportunity to emphasize that they are working quite openly and that they are only concerned with speaking for all those EC opponents who voted for the Labor Party in the election. They are so concerned about loyalty that it is almost comical. Take a really close look at [Labor Party leader] Thorbjorn Jagland and [SME leader] Hallvard Bakke the next time they are asked to comment on the handling of the EC issue in the Labor Party: They both say there is no disagreement between them as far as the rules of the game go. Bakke says that of course he respects the party's chosen leaders and program resolutions. Jagland says that of course one is allowed to work against EC membership as a Labor Party member. But behind these pretty words are hard-as-nails realities. Labor leader Jagland is bound to be just as exasperated over the SME as the prime minister is. She spoke her mind about its activities in the Storting just before Christmas. But Jagland cannot express the same sentiment without risking giving the impression that he is trying to drive the EC opponents from the party. Real conflicts that are swept under the rug do not go away. Instead new arenas and single-subject issues are produced that can be fought without disturbing the public peace and quiet too much. That makes the power struggle more murky. The need for political savvy and experience increases. At this point it would be difficult to say which of the parties has the better tactical skills.
