The speakers at a meeting held at Kim Chaek University of Technology on April 11 said the opening of agricultural market is a brazen-faced act which can be perpetrated only by such fellows as the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who makes no bones of treachery and disguise and does not hesitate at betraying the interests of the country and the nation, motivated by a lust for power. They said the South Korean rulers have offered not only the rice market but also all the human and material resources of South Korea for the U.S. policy of aggression on Korea and have exacerbated North-South confrontation and pushed ahead with preparations for a war against the North, according to the U.S. strategy aimed at stifling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The speakers at meetings held at the Haksan Cooperative Farm, Hyongjesan district, and the Chilgol Cooperative Farm, Mangyongdae District, Pyongyang, branded Kim Yong-sam, who has throttled the peasants and devastated agriculture, as the most heinous traitor to the nation. They called on the peasants and other people of South Korea to invigorate the struggle against the opening of the rice market throughout South Korea so as to decisively smash the Kim Yong-sam group's anti-national moves and finally defend the rice market.
