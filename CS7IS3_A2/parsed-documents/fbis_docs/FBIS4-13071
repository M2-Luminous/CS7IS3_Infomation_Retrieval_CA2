FBIS4-13071 "drnes074dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Quray' Offers Views on Paris, Cairo Talks Quray' Offers Views on Paris, Cairo Talks JN1704202394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1430 GMT 17 Apr 94 JN1704202394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO Economic Department, by unidentified reporter, in the studio, place and date not given; from the "With the Events" program -- recorded] [Text] [Reporter] Good evening. [Quray'] Good evening to you. [Reporter] How true is the report that an economic agreement between Israel and the PLO is likely next week? [Quray'] I think both sides want to see these negotiations wrapped up, after the two sides have probed each other's position. I hope the next round of talks will see us reach an agreement. There still are some fundamental issues pending... [Reporter, interrupting] In which areas? [Quray'] The question of imports is presenting difficulties. For the Palestinian side this is of vital importance, since it has an Arab dimension and affects Palestinian relations with the Arab states. The imports issue also bears on the difficult circumstances under which the Palestinians are living and coming up against in Israeli rules and regulations. There are other issues like the monetary system and what currencies will be legal tender. Insurance and tourism also have yet to be addressed. [Reporter] Will the current water-sharing talks in Muscat have a positive impact on economic talks that will open in Paris tomorrow? [Quray'] The two sets of talks are unconnected. The Muscat talks are mulitlateral, the Paris talks are bilateral, addressing economic concerns. [Reporter] But cooperation on the wider front of the Middle East may help along the bilateral ties between Israel and the PLO. [Quray'] We have an agreement that we are working to put in place. Regarding Israel's relations with the Arab world, this issue remains tied to a wider durable and comprehensive peace with all the Arab parties and to Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories in the Golan Heights, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza. When this kind of peace comes, the climate will recommend itself to rearranging the regional landscape so as to ensure security, stability, and prosperity for this region that has long suffered from wars. [Reporter] You are in touch with Palestinian negotiators in Cairo. Does it look that these talks will be completed soon? [Quray'] I hope that agreement will be reached soon there, now that the issues have been defined. There are not many controversial issues left. Most of the issues have more or less been settled. With questions of the Palestinian police and security now virtually settled, I think it will be possible to sort out the issues that remain if Israel is willing. [Reporter] As long as there is a Palestinian willingness to reach agreement, I think there is a possibility. [Quray'] We have the will to reach an agreement and get to the territories. An agreement cannot be viable and credible before the withdrawal begins and the Palestinian delegation arrives in the land. [Reporter] When we were in Washington, you promised that you would be here in the country no later than February. Is there a set date for the PLO leadership to arrive in Gaza and Jericho? [Quray'] If the Cairo talks and the economic agreement are completed, I think it will be a matter of days before the Palestinians enter Gaza and Jericho. We hope this will be in early May. I am not setting a fixed date. However, further postponement will help neither the agreement nor the peace process. [Reporter] Mr. Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO's Economic Department, thank you. [Quray'] Thank you.
