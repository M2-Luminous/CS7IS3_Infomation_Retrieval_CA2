They are all in a great hurry and want to go faster. But we do not. [Delors] No, because the economic conditions must be fulfilled. Otherwise, they will be crushed by the might of our economies. [Giesbert] But is it not scandalous to leave them at the door, as we are doing, when they are knocking so loudly? [Delors] If we accepted them tomorrow, they would face insurmountable economic problems, and that would mean a financial cost to us, in other words, to our taxpayers, and I am not sure that those who are saying today they have to come in immediately would be able to defend this stand tomorrow to the public. [Giesbert] But is there not a danger of pushing them toward the East, toward adventurism, or toward Russia, or the Ukraine? [Delors] No, because we have contracts of association with them, which enable us to work together and to ask them their opinions in the political, cultural, and economic fields. But the most important thing, you know, the thing that has to be understood is the historic duty of our generation, the one in charge at the moment, is to spread the values of peace, mutual understanding, and cooperation -- which, after all, have led to the success of this Europe -- to Europe as a whole, and hence to those countries. [Giesbert] With all these countries joining and planning to join the European Union, we are moving toward a greater Europe, a mega-Europe, a Europe with 20 members; 12 was complicated enough, but 20? Will it not give you an amazing amount of work? [Delors] It was complicated, but in spite of everything, there were happy moments. When you see, for example, that the events connected with German unification or with Yugoslavia did not lead to the resurgence of old antagonisms between Germany and its former opponents, that is grounds for satisfaction and shows that the fathers of Europe were right. But now, there is a contradiction that has to be overcome. You are right. How can we simultaneously build a political Europe, in other words, made up of countries that want to share part of their destiny because they think they will build it better if they are together, given the amazing changes happening in the world, and the new risks, with a Europe made up of 22 or 24 countries? [sentence as heard] [passage omitted] [Giesbert] When do you envisage a Europe with the countries of East Europe? [Delors] Oh, around the turn of the century. [Giesbert] So it is a long way off? [Delors] Yes. [Giesbert] In the latest edition of the British magazine THE ECONOMIST, there is an interesting article that says that if Europe wants to exist, it should make examples of the troublemakers of Europe -- of whom there are quite a few. It suggests several candidates for expulsion: Greece, Greece, Greece, and then there is also Greece. Is this a good idea? [Delors] No. You know, you have to distinguish between family spirit and disputes. [Giesbert] But Greece is the bad pupil at the moment? [Delors] No. Europe is based on a family spirit. In other words, we have decided to live together -- not in all areas: there are a lot of things that fortunately still remain in the purview of the nation-states. This demands a certain frame of mind. At the beginning of the Greek presidency, this frame of mind had been forgotten by the other countries. Now it is Greece that is forgetting it, and has to get back to it. In a family, you can have quarrels, but there are some things you must not do. So Greece must pay heed, and for example, the embargo measures it has taken against the little republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM] are not acceptable. [Giesbert] The European Commission's white paper on employment and growth will go on sale today, published by Michel (?Lafon-Ramsay). It is called: Into the 21st Century. When you see the figures, is there not a European sickness of unemployment? [Delors] Yes, there is a European sickness of unemployment, and that is why, back in June, I took it upon myself to demonstrate to the heads of state and government at their meeting in Copenhagen -- and for some of them it was a real shock -- that Europe was losing its competitiveness, and if it continued in the same way it would be unable to ensure equality for all the young people in finding jobs. [Giesbert] With 16 million unemployed in Europe, is that not the result of inflexibility and obstacles everywhere? [Delors] There are several reasons I can sum up like this: insufficient economic growth, insufficient competitiveness with regard to the outside world -- and we have new competitors coming in from Asia and the Pacific, and for that reason we have to think in the medium term -- and insufficient expertise in technical progress. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] You are proposing more flexibility. That is what is interesting. Are you not, in fact, making very liberal proposals for a socialist? [Delors] You know, for me, socialism means equality of opportunity and the opportunity for everyone to fulfill oneself by means of work in society. [passage omitted] I will tell you about two lessons in the white paper that can be drawn from the experiences of all the European countries. First, work is too highly taxed, in particular in France, where 80 percent of the financing of social security comes from wages. These contributions have to be brought down. It is ridiculous that the commodity that is in the shortest supply, the environment, is not taxed, while we need a healthy environment, for our health among other things, and that the resource that is in the greatest supply, labor, is what is most highly taxed. [passage omitted] Second, society tomorrow will be a society of skills, and therefore, of people who have both knowledge and skill, and knowledge and skill both demand a good education and high pay. [Giesbert] Mr. Delors, you will leave the presidency of the Commission at the end of the year. Your successor will be appointed in June. It is said that Leon Brittan is a good candidate. Would that be a good thing? [Delors] It is not for me to comment on that. It is up to the 12 heads of government to appoint my successor. I have been preparing the way for him as well as I can, leaving him with margins for maneuver so that he, in turn, can put his mark on the construction of Europe. [passage omitted]
