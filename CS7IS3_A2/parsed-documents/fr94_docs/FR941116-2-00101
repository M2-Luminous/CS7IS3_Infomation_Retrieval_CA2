FR941116-2-00101 FR941116-2-00076 In addition, the Commission believes that the proposal will facilitate transactions in securities and promote competition among options markets by placing the PSE in an equal competitive posture with the other options exchanges when competing for order flow in equity options. In this regard, the Commission notes that the American Stock Exchange's and the Chicago Board Options Exchange's automatic execution systems both have Commission approval to accommodate public customer equity option orders of up to 20 contracts, and that the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's automatic execution system has Commission approval to accommodate public customer equity option orders of up to 25 contracts. 12 Accordingly, the Commission believes that the PSE's proposal is consistent with the Act because it eliminates constraints in the PSE's rules that restrict the Exchange's ability to compete for order flow in equity options. The Commission believes that enhanced competition among the exchanges for options order flow, in turn, should benefit public investors and the public interest. 12 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32906 (September 15, 1993) 58 FR 49345 (September 22, 1993) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;92&hyph;38); 28411 (September 6, 1990), 55 FR 49345 (September 13, 1990) (order approving File Nos. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;89&hyph;27 and 89&hyph;29); and 24899 (September 10, 1987), 52 FR 35012 (September 16, 1987) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;87&hyph;21). Finally, the Commission believes, based on representations by the Exchange, that expanding the order eligibility size of Auto-Ex to 20 contracts for all equity options will not expose the PSE's options markets or equity markets to risk of failure or operational break-down. The Exchange also states that the OFTC will determine that adequate market making capacity exists prior to increasing the order size eligibility for any issue pursuant to the proposal. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 13 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;18) is approved. 13 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2). (1982). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 14 14 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
