FR941230-0-00096 FR941230-0-00019 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission today is making final the interim rules governing the submission of documents filed via the EDGAR system, effective January 30, 1995, which will be made applicable to all domestic registrants and parties making filings with respect to those registrants (``third party filers'') in accordance with an updated phase-in schedule. This action is being taken to fully implement mandated electronic filing in light of the experience of the staff since the interim rules implementing the EDGAR system were adopted in February 1993. 1 The Commission also is adopting minor and technical amendments, as proposed in July 1994, 2 to the electronic filing provisions in Regulation S&hyph;B, 3 Regulation S&hyph;K, 4 the Rules and Regulations 5 under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), 6 Regulation S&hyph;T, 7 the Forms under the Securities Act, 8 the Rules, Regulations and Schedules 9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), 10 the Forms under the Exchange Act, 11 the Rules 12 and Forms 13 under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (``Public Utility Act''), 14 and the Rules 15 under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (``Trust Indenture Act''). 16 1 The EDGAR rules were adopted in four releases: Release No. 33&hyph;6977 (February 23, 1993) [58 FR 14628] (containing a general description of the EDGAR system, Regulation S&hyph;T (the electronic filing regulation) [17 CFR Part 232], and the rules applicable to filings processed by the Division of Corporation Finance); Release No. IC&hyph;19284 (February 23, 1993) [58 FR 14848] (relating to rules specific to investment companies and institutional investment managers); Release No. 35&hyph;25746 (February 23, 1993) [58 FR 14999] (relating to rules specific to public utility holding companies); and Release No. 33&hyph;6980 (February 23, 1993) [58 FR 15009] (instructions for filing fees). 2 Release No. 33&hyph;7074 (July 8, 1994) [59 FR 36265]. 3 17 CFR Part 228. 4 17 CFR Part 229. 5 17 CFR Part 230. 6 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. 7 17 CFR Part 232. 8 17 CFR Part 239. 9 17 CFR Part 240. 10 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. 11 17 CFR Part 249. 12 17 CFR Part 250. 13 17 CFR Part 259. 14 15 U.S.C. 79a et seq. 15 17 CFR Part 260. 16 15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq. I. Background In 1987, Congress enacted Section 35A of the Exchange Act, which requires the Commission to certify to the Congress that it will not adopt any rule requiring electronic filing by all registrants until mandatory electronic filings from a significant test group of registrants have been received and reviewed by the Commission for a period of at least six months. 17 The Commission so certified in a letter to the House Committee on Government Operations dated December 27, 1988. Following the conclusion of a successful voluntary pilot electronic filing program, 18 in February 1993, the Commission adopted interim rules governing mandated electronic filing to begin implementation of the operational EDGAR system 19 Those rules consist of Regulation S&hyph;T, the regulatory cornerstone of the Commission's electronic filing framework, and a number of related provisions in the Commission's rules, schedules and forms. 17 15 U.S.C. 78ll (c)(5). 18 Development of an electronic disclosure system was undertaken by the Commission in 1983, and construction of a pilot system to develop and test an electronic system was commenced in May 1984. The first filings were received on the pilot system on September 24, 1984, and through its closing, the Commission received over 116,000 electronic filings from over 1,800 filers. On July 14, 1992, the pilot project was closed and replaced by the operational EDGAR system, with the pilot participants continuing as volunteers on the new system. 19 See n., above. On April 26, 1993, the date the interim rules became effective, 20 the first of the participants in the Congressionally-mandated significant test group became subject to mandated electronic filing. Additional participants were phased in until December 1993, when the significant test group, consisting of approximately 3,500 filers, was complete. 21 In keeping with the Commission's certification to Congress, no additional registrants were phased in to mandated electronic filing after that point, although a number of registrants voluntarily became electronic filers since the formation of the significant test group. Approximately 39,790 live filings and 23,335 test submissions were received by EDGAR during the six-month significant test period (January 1 through June 30, 1994). As discussed below, an evaluation of the significant test period was conducted in order to determine whether the staff should recommend that the Commission make the interim rules final and applicable to all registrants, as planned, including those in the significant test group, and proceed with the phase-in process. 20 The Financial Data Schedule provisions were implemented on September 1, 1994. See Release No. 33&hyph;7072 (July 8, 1994) [59 FR 36258]. Financial Data Schedules are exhibits that contain financial information extracted or derived from financial data within a filing that is marked to allow electronic manipulation of such information. For a complete discussion of Financial Data Schedules, see Release No. 33&hyph;7072, Section IV.D of Release No. 33&hyph;6977, Section IV.D of Release No. IC&hyph;19284, and Section IV of Release No. 35&hyph;25746. 21 The test group includes about 1000 investment company filers who, because some of them issue many separately registered series, account for approximately 8,500 individual registrants.
