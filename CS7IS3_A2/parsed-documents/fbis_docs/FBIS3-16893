In the article he discussed the forthcoming Russo-U.S. joint exercises. The article contained a series of gross distortions. The author of the article, who does not have true information on the planned exercises, casts doubt on the military-political expediency of them and, at the same time, of the whole range of Russo-U.S. relations in the military sphere. The publication distorts the scale and nature of the planned exercises. In particular, the author asserts that the U.S. 3d Infantry Division and the Russian Armed Forces 27th Motorized Rifle Division are being drafted into this event in their full complement. In fact the plan is not to stage troop exercises involving all the personnel of the two divisions together with their combat hardware and weapons but merely a command and staff exercise with a very limited number of personnel (up to 250 men per side) and vehicles. Parts of the forthcoming exercise will indeed be rehearsed at the Totskiy test range. This is due to the fact that the 27th Motorized Rifle Division is stationed in the area of the test range and a center for training peacekeeping forces, the only one of its kind in the Russian Armed forces at present, has been created here. As for the cost of holding the exercise, the United States is prepared to bear that in full (up to $2 million). For the Russian side this is a planned exercise and does not entail any additional costs. The main aim of this joint measure is to rehearse questions of cooperation in the performance of peacekeeping operations. The forthcoming command and staff exercise should make a real contribution to the cause of international cooperation in the settlement of conflicts in trouble spots and to the preservation of world peace.
