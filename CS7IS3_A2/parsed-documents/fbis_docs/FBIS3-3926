This year, except for the financial structural reforms in taxation, pricing, banking, foreign trade, investment, and so on, which must be put into effect, other reforms may be postponed for the time being after consultation, if people really have misgivings about them. However, the authoritative source did not give details about which reforms would be put off. According to the source, this is the latest guideline from the CPC hierarchy on reform issues this year, after listening to opinions from various quarters including deputies to the National People's Congress, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committee members, and so on, in order to maintain a stable situation wherein everybody has peace of mind. The source quoted the senior CPC leader as saying: When discussing the reforms for this year, in view of the fact that the reform measures will be more vigorous and the reform content more comprehensive, the central authorities are worried about the issue of tolerance and, accordingly, have set out this principle: All reform measures which can be introduced should be put into practice as soon as possible but the risks from should be assessed and those measures lacking the confidence of success can be postponed for the time being. The senior leader stressed that the financial structural reforms in taxation, pricing, banking, foreign trade, investment, and so on should be carried out this year. Otherwise, reforms will never be accomplished. Since China now wants to establish a market economy, these issues must be settled sooner or later. As to how to get things done in a safer way, we must be very careful indeed, in handling the issues. Regarding those issues which people are really worried about, these can be put off for the time being after consultation. The central authorities have clarified the point that, in future, the following two principles relating to reform and opening up should be adhered to: 1) the people as a whole should receive benefits, which means that the introduction of any reform measure must bring benefits rather than losses to the majority of the masses; and 2) taken as a whole, all reform measures must be tolerable for the masses and, if they are intolerable, they must not be introduced even though they are correct. The question of when they should be introduced should be decided in accordance with actual conditions. The CPC leader maintained that the guiding ideology for reforms this year is to exercise prudence in introducing reform measures. If reform measures adopted this years are successfully implemented, that will be a very important advance toward the establishment of the market economy. Although we must be on the alert against a number of issues, some of them being comparatively serious, the central authorities are still optimistic that reforms will meet with success. First, the central leadership is relatively sober-minded as it has kept a constant watch on the issue of overall benefits and tolerance. Secondly, the current conditions are different from those in 1988, as there are more commodities in the markets and the tolerance of the masses is also much greater. Thirdly, the leading cadres in localities have preparations, aspirations, and demands for accelerating in-depth reforms, so that some tough reform problems can be tackled effectively together with the central authorities with concerted efforts. The central authorities call on leading cadres at all levels to be prepared for danger in times of peace despite the exceptionally favorable situation.
