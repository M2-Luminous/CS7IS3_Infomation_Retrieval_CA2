While the Federation of Economic Organizations [Keidanren] and other business associations had been urging an abolition of the law, the joint panel decided not to do so. Instead the panel prepared a revision bill for relaxing restrictions on large stores. The law currently requires difficult procedures for opening stores larger than 500 square meters, but liberalizes in principle the opening of stores smaller than 1,000 square meters. Also, the bill relaxes restrictions on business hours and days. The joint council is expected to provide the final draft of the bill on 28 January, but the revision may face rough going due to opposition from smaller retail stores. Presently MITI's Large Retail Store Council controls the opening of retail stores larger than 500 square meters. The bill still has the 500-square-meters rule, but adds a provision that the opening of stores smaller than 1,000 square meters should not be intended for governmental inspection unless local business communities complain. The bill also seeks deregulation for large retail stores by: 1) while the regulation in effect urges all large stores to close at 1900 hours, business hours will be extended to 2000 hours; and 2) the annual off-business days for restricted large stores will be reduced from 44 to 24.
