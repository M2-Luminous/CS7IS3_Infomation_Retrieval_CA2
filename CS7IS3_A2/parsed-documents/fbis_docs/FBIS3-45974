Great changes have taken place in China over the past 15 years, Qiao said during a meeting with Gret Haller, president of the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland. "We will try our best to attain the second strategic goal and bring the Chinese people a comparatively comfortable life by the end of this century," Qiao told Haller. "Judging from the present situation, we can say that the goal is bound to be realized," he said. Qiao said China's reform measures for 1993 brought about fruitful results, which are well recognized world-wide. To maintain its political stability, he said, China should foster the development of its legal system. China should draw up many new laws while some of the existing laws may need to be revised, he said. The NPC, as the legislative body, and its Standing Committee, face arduous tasks in this regard. In addition, Qiao said, the central and local governments plan to formulate some badly-needed administrative and local regulations. Qiao said China's status as a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has not been resumed yet, but its economic reform in various fields should be converged with the commonly used norms and methods in the world. Haller said that as Switzerland and China are far apart geographically and differ in culture, the exchanges between the two countries' parliaments are more important. Haller, who visited China in 1976, said she very much admired the tremendous achievements China has made in economic development and other fields. Qiao said he hoped that Haller would visit China again.
