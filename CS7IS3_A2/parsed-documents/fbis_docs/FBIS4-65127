I have yet to hear a leading EU politician say that the EU should develop into a state formation similar to the United States. That will simply not happen and this is not strange when we look at the history of Europe," Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland writes. Where does Norway belong in a changing Europe? That is the question many people will be preoccupied with this year. Starting in 1995 the EU could include almost all of West Europe and over 95 percent of the Nordic population. The membership applications of Hungary and Poland open the possibility of an expansion to the east. At the end of the century we could see an EU made up of 20 countries. Such an EU will be a diverse community. If the EU can contain outlying countries like Greece and Ireland, big countries like Germany and France, small countries like Denmark and Luxembourg, and new democracies like Hungary and Poland, it can also contain Norway, Sweden, and Finland. But do we need the EU, can't we just cooperate on a case-by-case basis? As I see it, the idea that each country can manage alone has never been as remote as it is today. That is because we are so strongly influenced by what other countries do -- and do not do. Europe's land borders do not bar capital, trade, technology, pollution, or crime. Our right to national self-government is not enough in itself to ensure our national future. We are linked with the countries around us in a common destiny, whether we like it or not. Therefore Europe needs binding cooperation to resolve all the questions resulting from common interests and conflicts of interest. A hundred years ago opposing interests between nations could lead to war, if worst came to worst. Today nations can take care of special national and regional interests and at the same time resolve shared concerns in a peaceful and democratic way in the EU. What do the people who say they would like to see the EU disbanded envision as an alternative? Does it ensure peace if each country assumes sole responsibility for its own security? Will jobs be more secure if each country builds protective barriers around its own market? Will the environment be better if each country determines emission levels? We must consider the answers to such questions carefully. Many people ask what role a country like Norway can play in the EU. To answer that we must first look at the nature of the cooperation. The EU consists of independent and sovereign states that want to solve certain problems as a group. They have chosen this cooperation voluntarily. This involves a supplementary democracy -- which gives us possibilities beyond those we can manage on our own. When the constitutional court in Germany reviewed the Maastricht treaty it stressed that the EU is the member nations' tool for solving problems they cannot handle alone. I have yet to hear a leading EU politician say that the EU should develop into a state formation similar to the United States. That will simply not happen, and this is not strange when we look at the history of Europe. Can anyone imagine that countries like France, Belgium, Denmark, or Spain would give up their independence? Every six months the EU countries take turns leading the cooperation. In this way Luxembourg and Germany have an equal opportunity to influence the agenda at the outset. In an EU with 16 members, a Nordic country will have the chairmanship every fourth six-month period on the average. If we have faith in what we stand for, membership will provide us with entirely new opportunities for impressing our values on the European cooperation. When decisions are made, states with smaller populations have greater influence than the population figures might indicate. Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark with their 25 million inhabitants would have a bigger combined voting weight in the Council of Ministers (13 votes) than Germany with its 80 million inhabitants (10 votes). Some people advise against joint policy when it comes to such things as the economy, currency, foreign policy, and security policy. I have a different view: It is a big step forward that the European countries can talk about joint policy in these areas. It would be a poor alternative if they each went their own way. That does not serve peace, jobs, or the environment. Why does Norway have an interest in an economic and monetary union that will eventually lead to a common currency? Primarily because we, perhaps more than others, need stability in the market that buys 90 percent of our exports. We saw this when the value of the Finnish markka and the Swedish krona fell sharply in 1992. That had a direct effect on Norwegian jobs. We were adversely affected by the instability. A common currency means that we know what a krona, a mark, and a franc are worth, both now and several months from now. Until 1971 we had a common currency in practice as long as each country's monetary unit had a fixed exchange rate in relation to the U.S. dollar. This stability was a prerequisite for the period of growth we experienced then. To achieve the goal of balanced economic development and a high employment level the countries must aim at low inflation and limits on budget deficits and national debts. These are goals we are very familiar with in Norway. They have been important basic elements in the policy the government has pursued in recent years, with support from the Christian People's Party (KrF) and the Center Party. We have strengthened Norway's economy and done well in the fight against unemployment. We can continue to pursue this policy in the EU and at the same time contribute to a stronger coordination of initiatives and investments that will provide more jobs. What then is involved in a joint policy in the area of foreign and security policy? The treaty says that the countries will gradually implement joint initiatives in the areas where they have common interests, such as arms reduction, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, and steps within the CSCE framework. But in order for such steps to be taken everyone must agree on the guidelines. This means that a country cannot be forced to accept a policy it basically disagrees with. But at the same time we should realize that in a cooperation in which everyone must agree it is often those who want the least who set the pace. In many areas, such as the environment, foreign aid, and peacekeeping actions, Norway is a proponent of stronger international cooperation and joint solutions. Here we would want a greater degree of binding cooperation. Many people ask: What will happen in the future, do we have guarantees for how the EU will develop, and can we rely on the agreements we have entered into? No one can guarantee the future, either for Norway or for the EU countries. But we can reduce the uncertainty. In my opinion we can do this best by ensuring our participation and influence in the organization where the most important decisions are made. When we enter into agreements we have a basic trust that the other party will respect them. Without such trust all cooperation is meaningless. We take it for granted that NATO membership gives us a security guarantee because we have confidence that the member countries stand by the agreement they have entered into. Eleven out of the 12 EU countries are our NATO allies. When we trust them in the NATO context, we must also be able to trust them in the EU context. Therefore our basic assumption is that the EU countries will respect the agreements they have entered into, whether they concern fishing administration in the north, subsidies for northern agriculture, or guaranteed Norwegian sovereignty over Norwegian energy resources. Many have doubts about the EU. There are no definitive answers. But those who are in doubt must be aware that both a yes and a no vote will have consequences. Either way we stand at a crossroads. A no vote is not an affirmation that everything will stay the same. A new situation will arise if everyone else, including our Nordic neighbors, chooses cooperation while we remain outside. It will change our relations with the EU and our Nordic neighbors. Sweden and Finland will be linked more closely to European cooperation than Norway, and the boundary between Norway and the EU will be drawn along the Swedish border, the longest land border in Europe. EU opponents call for answers to every conceivable and inconceivable future development. But we have not yet heard their alternative and their answer to how we will otherwise strengthen our ability to cooperate and take joint action when challenges make this necessary. As far as I can see it will not provide greater security to leave this responsibility to other nations and rely on them to speak on our behalf.
