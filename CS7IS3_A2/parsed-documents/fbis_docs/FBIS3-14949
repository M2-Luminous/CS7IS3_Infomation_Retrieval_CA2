We won't judge the political aspect of the event. We will verify the document's legality. What do jurists say? Anatoliy Sobchak, St. Petersburg mayor and a lawyer: "The Duma's decision is unlawful. Only those who have acknowledged their guilt in the commission of a crime and on whom judgment has already been passed can be amnestied. If someone does not acknowledge his guilt (and the participants in the events of 1991 and 1993 have, by all accounts, not done so), how can they be amnestied?" Tamara Morshchakova, judge of the Constitutional Court: "I can say only that the act of amnesty differs from a pardon in that the latter is individualized. An amnesty may be granted regardless of the stage of the proceedings in the case. Moreover, it may also be applied to actions into which no criminal proceedings have been instituted at the moment of the promulgation of the act of amnesty." Richard Pipes, professor at Harvard University: "This decision demonstrates that the concept of a rule-of-law state is very underdeveloped in Russia. How can you amnesty people who have not been tried at all and when no one even knows whether they are guilty or not. It is a political move and has nothing at all to do with the law." Aleksey Kazannik, general prosecutor of Russia: "Each of the defendants subject to the amnesty will be informed of the content of the Duma decree. If they are in agreement with the Duma decision, I will issue a decree halting criminal proceedings." As you can see, the legal and political impasse is obvious. The two branches of power have gotten into this impasse. This is the consequence of the ill-considered and mutually destructive decisions that were made in the fall of 1993. The sides have now tried to find a compromise. The president would not want the creation of a parliamentary commission to investigate the tragic events of October. The Duma went along with him, as it were, and revoked the decision to set up a commission. But it immediately made up the ground ceded by adopting the amnesty act. As is becoming clear, this is not a compromise capable of reassuring society. The house we live in has clearly not become more peaceful. The Constitutional Court could act as arbiter in the conflict situation, but it currently is literally `outlawed,' as the law on the Constitutional Court has not yet been adopted. The president revoked the old Law "On the Constitutional Court" by his well-known Edict No. 1,400, so the main arbiter remains offside. What have the politicians been fighting for?
