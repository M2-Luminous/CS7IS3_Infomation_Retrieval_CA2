The talks, which are to be resumed, as is known, at the initiative of the Russian side, will be based on a draft agreement on a cease-fire drawn up by specialists from UN peace-making forces. The Croat delegation is expected to be led by Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the republic's security service, and the Serb delegation by Rear Admiral Dusan Rakic, defense minister of the Serb Republic of Krajina which Croatia does not recognize. Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian president, the Russian and U.S. ambassadors in Croatia as well as officials from UN peace-making forces and the international conference on former Yugoslavia are to attend the talks as mediators. The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from trustworthy sources in Zagreb that the basic content of the draft agreement boils down to the following: - The sides agree to cease armed operations forthwith and also to cease fire on all lines of contact as of a date to be agreed; - The tactical deployment of the armed forces which are situated along the line of contact and within a radius of 10 km in all directions relative to the line of contact will be frozen on the day the agreement is signed and movement of military units and sub-units will be banned; - All targetable weapons will be deployed outside the region of the line of contact: mortars and antiaircraft guns at least 10 km and artillery and tanks at least 20 km; - All sub-units to be withdrawn from the line of contact by at least 1,000 meters; - Observance of the cease-fire is to be monitored by the UNPROFOR and the EC observer mission; - Joint commissions are being set up at all levels and their main task is to mark the terrain where the sides' disengagement lines are situated and to investigate any cease-fire violations; - A certain number of checkpoints will be opened along the entire line of contact. Conditions for the joint commissions to meet at the checkpoints will be created. A separate point treats the need for the sides to meet to discuss the conditions for the reduction of the armed forces within the 10 km security zone. On the eve of the talks Vitaliy Churkin is holding intensive consultations in Zagreb with the highest UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] officials and with representatives of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia.
