Brazil and Malaysia began to import Russian arms. Russia signed agreements with them in early June. The Russian military-industrial complex is able to restore its prestige of a reliable exporter of arms and military equipment, ITAR-TASS was told in the main agency for international cooperation of the Russian Defence Ministry. In the 70's-80's, the USSR ranked first in the world for the sale of conventional armaments. The peak of the Soviet export of arms was reached in 1987 when armaments worth 22.6 billion dollars were sold by the USSR. The USSR then accounted for 38 percent of world trade in arms. According to foreign sources, Russia's share now amounts to 17 percent. From 1990 Russia reduced arms export to almost one-fifth of the volume, yielding the lead to the United States which now controls almost 60 percent of the world export of arms. Russia's positions weakened in markets of Eastern Europe it once dominated. East European countries now consider purchasing NATO armaments. Russia's arms export to Nicaragua, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam petered out. Joining United Nations sanction banning arms sales to troubled areas, Russia discontinued the export of arms to a dozen countries. Russia now sells arms to some 50 countries. According to military experts, the Russian military-industrial complex can sell up to 30 billion dollars worth of arms a year, earning 10-12 billion dollars on new armaments. Russia began to sell arms to Brazil from June 3. Under the contract, Russia is to deliver to Brazil before the end of the year a consignment of antiaircraft missile complexes "Igla" with 110 ground-to-air missiles. These missiles are regarded in Brazil to be the cheapest missiles in the world market of arms. They have proved their effectiveness. The possibility of buying other military equipment from Russia, including armoured carriers, is considered in Brazil. The contract for Brazil's purchases of "Igla" complexes was signed in the framework of the trade agreement between Russia and Brazil concluded last year. The agreement will be effective for four years. The total volume of deals for this period is envisaged at two billion dollars. Under the agreement, Brazil supplies to Russia coffee, sugar, soybeans in return for Russian goods, including arms. With the conclusion on June 7 of a contract to deliver 18 MiG-29 fighter planes Russia entered armaments market in South-East Asia. MiG planes, for which there was a demand abroad and Kalashnikov submachine guns accounted for 20 percent of the Soviet export of arms. The deal with Malaysia is valued at 550.5 million dollars. The first plane of the batch will be delivered next April. The other planes will be supplied within eleven months. There are plans to perfect the plane. Refuelling in mid-air will be made possible. The planes will be armed with "air-to-air" missiles. The bombing load will be increased from two to three tonnes. Russia will help Malaysia train pilots. A centre for maintenance of MiG planes will be set up. Russia will also help Malaysia develop the airospace, defence and other industries. Under the contract, 25 percent of the planes' cost will be repaid wilh palm oil products. The Middle East market of arms remains the biggest market for Russian armaments. Saudi Arabia and the Arab Emirates are interested in purchasing new kinds of arms from Russia.
