FBIS4-27796 "dreas108__a94027" FBIS-EAS-94-108-A Daily Report 25 May 1994 ANNEX Japan MOPT Increases Foreign Exchange Services MOPT Increases Foreign Exchange Services 942A0272A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 May 94 p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0272A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Effective 1 July, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] will increase to 300 the number of post offices handling foreign exchange conversions, an increase of 40. The change represents one phase of the MOPT's globalization strategy and its aim is to boost customer services in competition with privately operated banks. The post offices providing the new services will convert currencies between the Japanese yen and seven other currencies, including U.S. dollar, French franc, and British pound; they are also scheduled to sell and cash travelers' checks in eight currencies, including the yen. Based on a 12-region breakdown of the country, post offices newly designated to provide the money-conversion services include 10 each for Kanto and Tokyo, seven for Kinki, and six for Tokai, mostly in urban areas. Others included one each for Hokkaido, Tohoku, Shinetsu, Hokuriku, Chugoku, Shikoku, and Kyushu, and none for Okinawa. Sources at the International Operations Section of the Postal Savings Bureau explain, "These figures reflect the selection of post offices on the basis of the number of people who travel overseas, demand for currency conversion, and regional balance." According to the MOPT, the majority of individuals who need to convert foreign currencies or to buy or cash travelers' checks are about 20 years old, but few of them have an occasion to use a post office. The goal for the increase in the number of post offices handling foreign exchange services is to boost the patronage of post offices by individuals in that age category. Privately operated banks doubled the number of bank branches offering such services on a nationwide basis to about 8,500 in the four-year period ending in 1992 and the MOPT decided to increase the number of post offices handling the services from a total of 100 three years ago. The MOPT not only plans to increase the number of post offices offering foreign exchange conversion services, but to expand its international remittance services.
