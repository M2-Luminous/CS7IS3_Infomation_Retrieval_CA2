This was disclosed today at a plenary meeting held in this city by the Communist Party Provincial Committee and attended by officials from the enterprises that manufacture these goods. The government recently adopted an increase in the prices of liquor and cigarettes as part of a plan to cleanse national finances, which are being affected by a surplus of money in circulation estimated at $11 million. Some 428,000 cigarette boxes, which will be sold freely, aside from the quotas assigned by ration cards, as well as over 24 million liters of rum and other alcoholic beverages, will be available to the population this year. This effort to reduce money in circulation will be added to the revenues collected, with the same objective in mind, through increases in the prices of other nonbasic products.
