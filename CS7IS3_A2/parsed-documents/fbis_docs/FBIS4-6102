Information has come from a police-related source that because of the increase in new parties, the shortage of SP (security police) has been aggravated, and as result SP who had been assigned to former prime ministers have been removed. One of them is former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu. What is different about him when there are persons who are assigned guards even now?

Institute Director Noboru Suzuki of Nippon Secret Service, a private-sector personal-security company, explains the arrangement in that area: A former member of the Metropolitan Police Department, Suzuki devoted himself to guarding for about 20 years, from the time when SP were still called "bodyguards" and retired from government service in 1986. At Nippon Secret Service, he is called "the very spirit of guarding" and is the kind of person who embodies the history of the security police, so to speak. He says, "The National Police Agency in the guarding of VIP's, and the Metropolitan Police Department in regard to successive prime ministers, consider by their own judgment such things as political influence, and assign security police to those persons for whom they think it necessary from the standpoint of safety." In the case of Nakasone and Takeshita, it is probably judged that they are persons for whom there is fear of their being harmed.

The hard part of the job is that it is not enough to just be on guard; one must constantly strain one's nerves. Words of advice like this are said to have been handed down among them in the past. "Never fall down even if you are hit by five bullets," "Be devoted to your partners," and "Don't look at your watch." "It means that security police must be prepared to lay down their lives by becoming a bullet shield for the person they are guarding, should the occasion arise. Furthermore, they must anticipate the course along which the person they are guarding will travel and confirm beforehand that it will be safe; therefore, they must have good communication with their partners. In addition, never relax your guard" (Suzuki). I don't believe that all those guarded by the SP appreciate this kind of arduous work....
