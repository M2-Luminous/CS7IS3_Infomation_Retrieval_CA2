Nizhenko, L.I. Floka and G.P. Khilya [Problems of Material Science Institute (Kiev) under the ``Research Methods and Properties of Powder Materials rubric''; received May 18,1992; UDC 541.11] [Abstract] The objective of the work was to obtain new information on the composition and property of the surface layer of binary metal melts containing iron, cobalt and nickel, which form the basis of most composite materials for structural and tool applications. Experimental data necessary for analyzing the surface layer of the studied melts are presented in a table. The obtained data make it possible to assume that for iron metals family based melts with negative deviation from perfection a monatomic model of thickness of the surface layer is correct. For melts with positive deviation the model of a variable thickness surface layer is correct. But for the most important concentration region from 0 to 0.05 of molar share the monatomic model is applicable. It is concluded that in the case of metal melts of systems with positive deviations from perfection the surface layer is more perfect in terms of its behavior than the volume of the melt.
