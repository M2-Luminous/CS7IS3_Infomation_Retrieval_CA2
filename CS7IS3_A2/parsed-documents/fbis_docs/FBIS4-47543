V. Latyshko, T. L. Levitina, O. S. Miroshnichenko, L. V. Gudkova, E. A. Kozlov; UDC 577.112.5] [Abstract] A solution of dry P. vitale catalase and 0.2 n NaOH was separated through dialysis in 0.1 n NH4HCO3 overnight at 8�C. Miles (England) staphylococcus proteinase was added to the dialyzate, which was then allowed to stand for 6 h at 37�C. The resulting sediment was centrifuged off, and the process liquid lyophilized. A total of 38 peptides were isolated through gel filtration on a Pharmacia (Sweden) G-50 sephadex, ion-exchange chromatography using Toyo-Soda (Japan) DEAE resin and Filtrak (Germany) FN-17 paper, and high-voltage electrophoresis using Filtrak (Germany) FN-17 paper. The amino-acid composition was determined with an AAA-339 analyzer made in the Czech Republic. Dansylation was used for N-end analysis. The peptides contained a total of 578 amino acids constituting 83% of the catalase's peptide chain, which has 670 amino acid residues according to x-ray crystallography data.
