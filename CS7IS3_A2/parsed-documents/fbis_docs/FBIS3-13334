In a national address marking the end of the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan, he said: "We must not tolerate any attempts to break the country's unity or to provoke sedition or war." North and South Yemen were unified in May 1990, but a crisis broke out in August when Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding major political and economic reforms. Salih, a northerner, added: "Those who think Yemen's problems can be solved by dividing (the country) are wrong." He called for talks to resolve all differences with al-Bid, his main political rival. Tensions have been building in Yemen in recent weeks between rival north and south armies, despite a February 20 reconciliation accord.
