Kim made the proposal during a breakfast meeting at the guest house with Korean correspondents stationed here. Declaring that Korea, Japan and China are the three most important nations in Asia, Kim said they must undertake joint study of their common culture based on Chinese characters. As China is rapidly undergoing industrialization, Kim said the Yangtse River, which runs into the West Sea, is becoming more polluted and the three countries must tackle the problem immediately. The Chinese Government has already agreed to his proposal at the working level, Kim said.
