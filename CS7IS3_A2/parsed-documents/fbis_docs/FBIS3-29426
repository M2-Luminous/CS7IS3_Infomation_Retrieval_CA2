Clinton failed to resolve differences with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa during a summit meeting last Friday over U.S. demands for reducing Japan's trade surplus and increasing the sale of foreign goods in Japan. "Ever since the talks I had with Prime Minister Hosokawa, we've been reviewing our options, consulting with our friends, trying to assess what course we ought to take," Clinton said. "I think sometime in the next few days, my economic team... [ellipses as received] and our national security team will come back with a set of options and recommendations to me and then I'll have something to say," he told reporters during a White House ceremony announcing a 6 billion dollar sale of civilian aircraft to Saudi Arabia. Clinton said the policy measures under review are different from the sanctions the U.S. Government announced Tuesday over a dispute with Japan on access to the Japanese cellular phone market. "That's an issue of longstanding development," he said. The policy options under consideration reportedly include the resurrection of a U.S. trade law that allows punitive measures against countries which refuse to change what Washington deems unfair trade practices. U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the "Super 301" trade measure through executive order is imminent, possibly by Thursday. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said the White House has made no decision on the "Super 301" measure but predicted that Clinton will take some kind of action against Japan. "We are absolutely bound to act. We are reviewing options now," Brown said in a television interview. Asked about the possibility of a trade war with Japan, Brown said, "We don't even like to use that kind of language." Brown said the United States is faced with "a very difficult situation" but reiterated that the Clinton administration is determined to "open (Japanese) markets to American goods, products and services." "We're going to do everything we can to get that done." He said. "We have said to Japan, `we have to have measurable, monitorable results. Your markets must be opened because American exports mean American jobs.'"
