FBIS3-9957 "drlat039_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 Feb 1994 Peru Demonstration Rejects Impunity in Case PA2602200794 Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0154 GMT 26 Feb 94 PA2602200794 Hamburg DPA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Lima, 25 Feb (DPA) -- A massive gathering in Lima this evening repudiated the "impunity" which prevailed concerning the assassination of 10 persons, given a military court's decision not to punish the people who reportedly planned the massacre. The gathering occurred on the same day the European Union stated in a letter to the Peruvian Government its concern about the way in which the case had been handled -- a concern that has already been stated by the United States. Today's event, held at San Martin Square in downtown Lima, was convoked by relatives of the 10 victims in the so-called "La Cantuta Case," and it received the support of human rights groups, student associations, professional colleges, and popular organizations. Gisela Ortiz, spokesperson of the victims' relatives, said the event was a protest against the "complicity" of the government, which created the conditions so the case could be handled by a military court rather than a civilian court, as hoped by relatives, the opposition, and independent observers. The different speakers who addressed hundreds of demonstrators agreed in demanding the annulment of the controversial law which allowed a military court to handle the case and the subsequent annulment of the military trial which ended this week with sentences for nine of the people involved in the case. Ortiz also said the relatives will continue to "stand around" indefinitely in front of the Justice Palace one and a half hours every Wednesday to protest against what has happened. Today's event, which was carried out peacefully, was limited to a gathering at San Martin Square because the organizers could not get a permit to march from the 2 May Square to the Justice Palace, which was their goal. Following a verbal trial which barely lasted four days, on Monday a military court passed sentences ranging between 15 and 20 years for two Army majors and four NCO's, who, according to the evidence, actively participated in the event. It handed down sentences ranging between one and five years for three officers who were charged with negligence. The ruling, currently being reviewed by the Supreme Military Justice Court's examiner board because all the defendants appealed the sentence, was rejected by the victims' relatives and various groups because it fails to punish the people who planned the massacre and it states that the assassins acted on their own. The massacre was perpetrated on 18 July 1992 by military personnel who seized the student residences at the state-owned La Cantuta University and kidnapped a professor and nine students. They were later assassinated and buried on the city's outskirts. Prosecutor Victor Cubas, who was in charge of the case until the controversial law turned the case over to a military court, confirmed today that the operation had included the participation of at least 45 military personnel. Therefore, he cannot understand why sentences were only given to six persons.
