"I hope the president was aware of the consequences of his move when he made it," said Kwasniewski. Another leader of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy played down yesterday's comments from his party colleague Marek Borowski who termed Walesa's veto a declaration of war on the ruling coalition. Oleksy said he believed the presidential decision had a broader meaning than just opposing the law on wage controls. What it means we will have to find out, Oleksy said.
