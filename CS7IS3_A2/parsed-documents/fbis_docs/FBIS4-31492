"I believe that this policy glaringly contradicts the Slovaks' interests," he adds. "The chairman of the HZDS (Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) has taken to discrediting, grossly slandering, and challenging his political opponents and splitting political parties which are not obedient or compete with him. In a way, I understand Meciar's attacks against our party. The SDL is, in fact, the only political party he has not managed to split," Weiss says in reaction to Meciar's recent statement that the SDL rank and file should put their leadership in order. "As we are the most serious rival to the HZDS in the elections (September 30-October 1), Meciar, indulging in his old style, has over and over again fabricated rumors about sharp feuds in the SDL leadership. I would like to send a message to Mr. Meciar that it was not the SDL group of deputies, but that of the HZDS which was abandoned by a quarter of its deputies! He should perhaps first tidy up his own backyard," Weiss said. "Due to the HZDS and SNS (Slovak National Party) and, unfortunately, also a part of ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles [Coexistence] movement, the signpost law (stipulating that towns and villages with at least 20 percent of ethnic population should have bilingual signposts) has become a political problem, although at the beginning it was more of a legislative issue. Some politicians are evidently engaging in provoking a nationalist mood. This is the main reason why the law was not passed. The HZDS and SNS on the one hand, and a part of the Egyutteles, on the other, simply were not interested in a compromise," Weiss states. "If Miklos Duray, chairman of the Egyutteles, chooses confrontation, he will only confirm the statement which appeared early this year: Meciar cannot be without Duray nor Duray without Meciar," Weiss adds. "The SNS Komarno congress has sent a clear message that the party of Jan Slota has opted for extreme nationalism. The attempt to exclude legally elected deputies of the Slovak Parliament of Hungarian nationality from political decision-making is against the spirit of the Slovak Constitution for which also the SNS deputies had voted, which I would like to emphasize," Weiss says. "As the SDL is a left-wing party, it is pushing for the principle of social justice, equal opportunities for all, and equal distribution of the costs necessary for restructuring the economy," Weiss says.
