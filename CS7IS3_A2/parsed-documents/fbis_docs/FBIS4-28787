Yet, this must go in accordance with the trend of the society and reflect the desire of the majority -- a true majority, and not a majority by some who claim to represent the people since that would be a distortion of the democratic principle. We disagree with the prime minister's stand concerning the current situation. He said that government decisions must be used as guidance whereas resolutions of political parties can be taken into account as composite. We, on the other hand, think that, in the present situation, the government decision, which mainly reflects the thinking of the Democrat Party, rather serves to "block" than "solve" the current crisis. It is different in nature from the motion proposed by the Phalang Tham Party that a committee be set up to compile and rewrite a draft constitution, or the proposal made by the New Aspiration Party that Article 211 of the Constitution be amended to pave the way for the appointment of a constitution drafting council. The Democrat Party has been trying to block all passages leading to a solution to the problem. It pressured the Phalang Tham Party to have the party withdraw its motion, claiming political etiquette as a pretext. It also tried to confuse the public about the New Aspiration Party's proposal to amend Article 211 of the Constitution saying the move was illegal and that the party should have proposed such an amendment to the Special House Committee Scrutinizing the Draft Constitution. By talking about political etiquette and appealing for proper steps to be followed to solve the problem, the Democrat Party made us realize that it has lost sight of the real problem; the nation has already been divided into two lines of thinking with a tendency towards violence at any time. This is not the right time to interpret the Constitution by the letters of the words -- what is legal or illegal. At this moment, we must join together in order to find a solution to avoid confrontation. We support the move taken by the Organization for Political Reforms that undesirable violence must be avoided at all costs. We support the organization's appeal to the speaker of the House of Representatives to table the Phalang Tham Party's motion on agenda for deliberations at the earliest, either on Wednesday or Thursday. We call on the parliamentarians to approve the motion in order to pave the way for the drafting of a constitution of the people. This may seem difficult to materialize, but the process will enable the people to see more clearly the true color of political parties prior to another general election. No matter what the option -- the Phalang Tham Party's motion or the proposal by the New Aspiration Party, it is quite clear now that the government will not be able to control the majority in the parliament. In the name of the people of a country under a democratic government, we would like to ask the government to return the "power" to the people so that they can make a decision by themselves in keeping with the trend of society. That would be the most correct way to solve this national crisis at the time we are experiencing the absence of "leadership."
