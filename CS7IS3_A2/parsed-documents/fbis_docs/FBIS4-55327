Mr. Zubak, let me start by asking you about the four agreements that have been reached. The first agreement is about the president of the future Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who will be a Croatian. Will you be the first president of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Zubak] Well, we did not discuss the persons who will be president, for instance the vice president, but we agreed that a Croatian will be the president during the first six months of the transitional period. According to the transitional provisions of the Federation's constitution, the constitution should be implemented within a period of six months. However, it is obvious that this period is too short and we are already behind schedule as far as the election of the Federation's president is concerned. We were supposed to elect the president of the Federation within 30 days but we did not reach a political agreement and that period was prolonged. Everything should be implemented within six months, but realistically this period will last a bit longer. However, we agreed that a Croatian would be the president over the initial six months. If the constitution of the Federation is not entirely implemented within this period, then the next president will be a Bosniak-Muslim. We also agreed that the first president during the period after the Federal elections should be a Bosniak-Muslim. I would like to say that we signed the drafts of the documents today, and that the documents will we verified and signed as draft agreements on Saturday 14 May in Geneva. In this form of proposals, they will be offered for adoption to the constitutional parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted] [Announcer] I would like to ask Croatian Foreign Minister Granic: What is your impression of this latest map of the internal political organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Does it appear to you that a good political compromise has been reached? [Granic] A very good compromise; it is a huge step forward in the implementation of the Washington agreement. It is also a just one. This is a compromise that paves the way ahead. It benefits the Bosniak as well as the Croatian people, it benefits the federation. It also benefits our future confederal partners, the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatia, as well as the whole world, has a great deal of interest in the materialization of this agreement. I can say, for example, that the United States' Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher phoned several times during the day to ask about our progress. In any case, the agreement was met with a great deal of interest and satisfaction. All the more so, since it took place before Friday, before the talks in Geneva. Many things are clearer now. [Announcer] I would like you to comment on the statement we heard tonight made by U.S. special envoy Redman, according to which the talks yielded a different result from what had been expected, but that this result is better. [Granic] This refers to the formation of cantons six and seven, as they surely speed up the organization of the Federation. This is a great step forward. This obliterates some problems; for example, it is going to be far easier for the EU [European Union] to take over the town of Mostar. There will no longer be [word indistinct] problems. The EU intends to restore the town fast, to revive its life, to return its refugees. It will of course be the center of the canton, as Mr. Zubak said. Hence the fact that this agreement has been reached is of exceptional importance for Croatia. One should bear in mind that now policies will be coordinated. This is something which is already being carried out, not only as regards some individual current issues such as communications, refugees, and education, but many strategic issues, too. [Announcer] Mr Zubak, these eight cantons we have seen, do they constitute those 58 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory with which the Croat-Muslim-Bosniak side jointly embarks on negotiations with the Serbian side. [Zubak] This percentage does not include...[pauses] This also includes the area of the city of Sarajevo, about 3 percent of territory. Its special status ought to be under UN administration. Hence, the cantons account for 55 percent. [Announcer] Apart from these four agreements, is there any agreement now on, is there a firm approach to negotiations with the Serbian side? [Zubak] As you can see, having established the agreement on the external borders of the federation we departed from the following principle: In those areas where the Bosniak and the Croatian people are in the majority, they are really and objectively entitled to demand that those areas should be within our future commom state, our federation. We drafted such a territorial organization of the federation, which includes 58 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the proviso that it should be pointed out that not even this covers all those areas where these two peoples are in the absolute majority. Let's take the example of Bijeljina: In total the Croatian and Bosniak population is in the majority, but these people have not been included in the federation. [Announcer] Let's go back again to the second agreement out of the four, the agreement on the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It will be headed by a prime minister from the ranks of the Bosniak Muslim people, and out of its 17 members, 6 will be Croatians. Does it mean at least 6 or up to 6? [Zubak] Well, you see, we came to a preliminary political agreement in Sarajevo to have a 15-member government, including the prime minister and his deputy. However, during the talks and negotiations in Vienna we came to the conclusion that it would be more opportune to have a 17-member government. As a result, we came to a new political agreement, under which 6 government ministers would come from the ranks of the Croatian people. Since we agreed that the prime minister should come from the ranks of the Bosniak Muslim people, his deputy, under the constitution, will at the same time be the defense minister. In other words, the Croats have been given the right to nominate their candidate for this post. We also agreed that another four ministers, including one without portfolio, should be from the ranks of the Croatian people. Why is this necessary? We need this in order to ensure that the Croats are given the opportunity to realize their constitutional right of insisting, when they deem it necessary, that in other words one-third of the ministers will have the right to ask that, in the case of issues considered to be of vital importance, decisions be made through voting and consensus. It was therefore necessary to ensure that one-third of the government comprises Croatians, providing one of them is prime minister or rather deputy prime minister. [Announcer] To continue in the same vein, can you tell us how the implementation of the agreement will proceed. [Zubak] When we first of all signed the framework and then the entire agreement in Washington, various comments were made, various views and forecasts expressed, various expectations were voiced, about how the agreement could be implemented on the ground. Through organized political action we have succeeded in persuading and explaining to the people on the ground all the advantages of the agreement, that it is an historical necessity, that it will be instrumental in realizing all the political goals of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of the Croatian people in general. With this approach we succeeded in persuading the people that this is the best solution and, at the current juncture, of historic importance for the Croatian people. I believe that through a politically synchronized and coordinated action we shall succeed in explaining and persuading the people, political officials, and leaders of the people that this solution -- the cantonal arrangement -- will serve the political and all other interests of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the same time, the cantonal arrangement neither threatens nor questions the interests of the Bosniak people. In the areas where we failed to achieve greater territorial divisions, tensions between the two peoples would most likely have deepened if a solution had not been reached. We see this as a compromise that will make it impossible for either one or the other people to be outvoted. They are both absolutely equal and in such an atmsophere... [Announcer, interrupting] In other words, you do not expect changes or problems on the ground? [Zubak] Well, there will probably be resistance. However, as I said, through a synchornized, coordinated, and planned action, I think we will succeed in explaining and persuading the people that this solution is a good one. [Announcer] Mr. Granic, a new ministerial conference is expected in Geneva on Friday in which America, Russia, the EU, and the United Nations are to take part. What is the importance of this agreement, its completion, and its signing, for further peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Granic] The picture now is more complete. In any case, it will help in achieving a final solution. Without this agreement the issue would have remained less clear. In light of this agreement, it is certain that the position of the United States, which has invested most to have this agreement reached, and of some other states, especially Germany, will be clearer in the search for a final solution. This means that the pressure on the Serbs will definitely be stronger. [Announcer] What can we expect now? It seems that it is the Serbians in Bosnia-Herzegovina who are under greatest pressure. A fresh conference is being prepared, the Croats and Bosniak Muslims have reached an agreement. Do you feel that this is the turning point and that the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina is about to be solved? [Granic] Well, in the light of our experience of many conferences, it is nevertheless realistic to expect that this will be the most serious of the meetings, that it has been approached seriously, and that it takes place with an agreement in place between the Bosniaks and the Croatians. In other words, preconditions exist for a serious conference. I would like to add that, as far as the Republic of Croatia is concerned, this agreement will considerably strengthen the position of the Republic of Croatia, in particular in its negotiations with the international financial institutions, with the EU, and that in any case, this is yet another step further in strengthening Croatia's international position, since Croatia is seen here as a confederal partner. Of course, the negotiations were between the Croatians and the Bosniaks, Mr. Silajdzic and Mr. Zubak, but we are cosignatories of both the preliminary and the final Washington agreement. Accordingly, our responsiblity for implementing this agreement is great. [Announcer] Mr. Granic and Mr. Zubak, thank you for taking part in this evening's edition of Picture versus Picture. I wish you a great deal of success in implementing the Vienna agreement.
