ACTION: Public Land Order. SUMMARY: This order revokes an Executive order insofar as it affects 15 acres of public land withdrawn for the Bureau of Land Management's Phosphate Reserve No. 7. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. The revocation is needed to permit disposal of the land through exchange. This action will open the land to surface entry and nonmetalliferous mining. The land has been and remains open to mineral leasing. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 12, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sandra Ward, BLM Montana State Office, P.O. Box 36800, Billings, Montana 59107, 406&hyph;255&hyph;2949. By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988), it is ordered as follows: 1. The Executive Order dated January 12, 1911, which withdrew public land for the Bureau of Land Management's Phosphate Reserve No. 7, is hereby revoked insofar as it affects the following described land: Principal Meridian, Montana T. 1 S., R. 9 W., Sec. 32, SW1/4SW1/4NW1/4 and W1/2SE1/4SW1/4NW1/4. The area described contains 15 acres in Beaverhead and Silver Bow Counties. 2. At 9 a.m. on January 12, 1995, the land will be opened to the operation of the public land laws generally, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. All valid applications received at or prior to 9 a.m. on January 12, 1995, shall be considered as simultaneously filed at that time. Those received thereafter shall be considered in the order of filing. 3. At 9 a.m. on January 12, 1995, the land will be opened to location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation of any of the land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempting adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. Dated: December 1, 1994. Bob Armstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30561 Filed 12&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;DN&hyph;P
