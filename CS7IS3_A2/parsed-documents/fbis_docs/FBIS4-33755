Salinas will arrive in this capital on Monday, 1100 local time, where he will devote most of his time to an interview with Cuban President Fidel Castro. With Castro, he will engage in an overall analysis of the bilateral political, economic, cultural, and trade relations, a high-ranking Cuban Foreign Ministry official indicated. Jorge Bolanos, deputy foreign relations minister, emphasized in an interview with PRENSA LATINA that Salinas' presence in Cuba represents the continuation of relations that historically have been maintained at a high level. Bolanos, who counts on a 30-year diplomatic career, also highlighted the independent nature of Mexico's foreign policy and the priority Cuba puts in these relations. Bolanos disclosed that the preparatory mission of Mexican officials, led by General Director of Protocol Ricardo Ampudia, has concluded its meeting with the local Foreign Ministry, during which they agreed that the visit should concentrate on the official conversations of both high-level delegations. He highlighted the importance of Salinas' presence in Cuba at a time when the United States is attempting to reinforce the economic blockade, considering this a sign of political willingness on the part of Mexican authorities to reaffirm their relations with the Island and to continue developing these in the future. Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello Macias gave a similar opinion, emphasizing that the conversations at the highest levels between both nations will be intense and multifaceted. New ideas and initiatives will emerge from this dialogue to continue the momentum of bilateral ties, Tello told PRENSA LATINA. Another important aspect of the dialogue between the presidents of Cuba and Mexico will be the exchange of points of view on the Ibero-American summit to be held on 14-15 June in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Mexico was the only Latin American nation that decided to maintain its relations with Cuba in 1962 when the OAS ruled, under Washington's pressure, to have its member nations break ties with the Island.
