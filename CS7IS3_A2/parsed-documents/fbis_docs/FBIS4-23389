There have been continuing battles between rival wings of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], with Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces driven out of their headquarters at Tubmaburg by Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn troops. Flare-ups have continued between Charles Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] and the Armed Forces of Liberia, AFL, and the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and the UN are increasingly exasperated. Well, the factions did send representatives to the TA yesterday, and it seems some were eager to shift the blame. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: At the meeting were Alhaji Koromah, leader of ULIMO's Mandingo faction; Hezekiah Bowen, chief of the AFL; and John Richardson, who was representing Charles Taylor's NPFL. Richardson told the assembly that the reluctance to disarm is a result of the failure of the transition government to assert itself in Liberia. General Bowen of the AFL said his fighters were delaying disarmament due to advancement on their positions by the NPFL, especially in the Harbel area. He said the AFL is ready to disarm as soon as the NPFL withdraws to its original positions. Alhaji Koromah said the ongoing war between the Krahn and Mandingo factions of ULIMO was preventing his fighters from laying down their arms. Meanwhile, for the first time since the ULIMO conflict broke out, the leader of the Krahn faction, Roosevelt Johnson, has travelled out of Monrovia to Tubmanburg. ULIMO's Krahn faction captured Tubmanburg from the Mandingo faction a few days ago. Johnson is expected to set up an administrative structure in Tubmanburg. UN sources here confirm that Johnson's motorcade drove into the city amidst cheers from his Krahn fighters. A local journalist who travelled with Johnson said bodies littered the outskirts of the city. He said the city center was completely deserted, and that homes of Alhaji Koromah and some of his key commanders had been blown up by rocket-propelled grenades.
