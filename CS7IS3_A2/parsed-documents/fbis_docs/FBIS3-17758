But at the present time it is not a matter of bloc membership, but of cooperation. Herein lies the meaning of us joining the Partnership for Peace program, which will take place in the near future. This was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev when explaining Russia's approach to interrelations with the North Atlantic Union during a brief conversation with Russian and Norwegian journalists. The minister also noted the contacts and ties between Russia and NATO, which are already developing ; the joint Pomor-94 naval exercises that ended recently were an example of this.
