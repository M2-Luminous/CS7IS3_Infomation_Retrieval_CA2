For what purpose? This time does the RPF want to do what it says it has never seriously tried in four years of war: To take the capital? "Yes," says the RPF spokesman in Brussels bluntly. "We are going to take Kigali in order to restore order and neutralize the extremists who are terrorizing and murdering our people." [passage omitted] "The new government consists exclusively of Hutu hawks," the RPF spokesman in Brussels said. "People who were on [former President] Habyarimana's side and who always boycotted the Arusha peace agreement. These are the people who have decimated the opposition. This is a government which is based on terror. We continue to stick by the three basic principles of Arusha: The goal of a state based on the rule of law, power sharing in a transitional period, and the merger of the two military forces into one army. In the interests of the peace agreement we are trying to take out the anti-Arusha forces. Indeed, we are doing that with arms in hand. Just as the Belgians and French are rushing to help their fellow countrymen, we are trying to save our people. And by our people, we do not just mean Tutsis by a long shot. The terror of recent days was directed against all those who were not extreme Hutu hawks. We are going to end this regime's potential to kill." [passage omitted]
