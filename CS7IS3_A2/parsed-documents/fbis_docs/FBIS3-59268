Should that be the case, people of all nationalities in China would still be under the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and our party would still be struggling arduously underground." (Footnote 1 -- Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 1975-1982, p 138) Deng Xiaoping's words are no exaggeration at all. A piece of vivid and clear evidence is the liberation of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang. A Wise Policy Leading to Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang Xinjiang has been an inseparable part of the territory of the fatherland since ancient times. In modern times, the various nationalities in Xinjiang had launched repeated indomitable struggles aimed at casting off the yoke of imperialist and feudal rule. Mao Zedong had the utmost concern for the historical destiny of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the CPC entered into a united front with a local strongman Sheng Shicai [4141 0013 2088]. Over 100 CPC members, including Chen Tanqu [7115 3389 4428] and Mao Zemin [3029 3419 3046] were sent to Xinjiang to work by Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee. They did numerous good deeds. Mao Zedong sacrificed a relative for the liberation of the various nationalities in Xinjiang; Mao Zemin, his younger brother, was murdered by Sheng Shicai. Tianshan was washed in blood, but his righteousness was awe-inspiring. The year 1945 saw the Chinese Revolution triumph on a national scale. People of all nationalities in Xinjiang had been looking forward to liberation with as much eagerness as people hit by a drought longing for clouds. Mao Zedong, profoundly conscious of the wishes of all nationalities in Xinjiang, devised a sensible strategy to bring about its peaceful liberation. During the Second Plenum of the Seventh CPC Central Committee in March 1949, Mao Zedong earnestly urged Wang Zhen [3769 7201] to continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of fighting heroically, undeterred by difficulty or hard work, as the latter made preparations to lead troops into Xinjiang and do more good deeds for the people of Xinjiang. After the CPC-KMT peace talks broke down in late April, the KMT regime's chief representative as well as its northwest military and political commander, Zhang Zhizhong [1728 3112 0022], stayed behind in Beijing. The CPC Central Committee considered using Zhang Zhizhong's connections to bring about the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang. In a telegram to Peng Dehuai [1756 1795 2037] on 28 April, Mao Zedong said, "Solve the northwest problem in a peaceful way. It seems that the possibility is there. Zhang Zhizhong and others have now decided to remain in Peiping and are edging closer to our side. Perhaps we need to consider solving the northwest problem peacefully with his help." (Footnote 2 -- "Selected Telegrams Relating to the War to Liberate the Great Northwest," from Party Documents, 1990, Vol 5) In early July 1949, Liu Shaoqi [0491 1421 1142] led a CPC delegation in a secret mission to the Soviet Union to discuss with Stalin a number of matters relating to the establishment of a people's republic in China. The Soviets raised the Xinjiang issue in the discussions and gave the Chinese some pointers. As the CPC poised itself to liberate the entire nation, the Soviet leader said, the Americans were cooking up a plot, specifically they were encouraging the five northwest warlords headed by Ma Bufang [7456 2975 5364] to withdraw their units to Xinjiang and set up a "Nation of Islam" in opposition to the Chinese Communists. Should the Americans succeed in their plot, China's civil war would become an international issue, which would complicate things. The Soviet Union therefore proposed that the CPC liberate Xinjiang ahead of time. The military commission under the CPC Central Committee had earlier decided to "begin working on Xinjiang" next spring. Armed with the information provided by the Soviet Union, and after analyzing the nation's situation comprehensively, the CPC Central Committee decided to tackle the Xinjiang situation earlier. On 6 July, Mao Zedong sent a telegram to Peng Dehuai in which he sketched a blueprint for solving the northwest issue, including the problem in Xinjiang. He wrote, "Besides the military solution, we also must try the political solution. What are your opinions? This is what we think. The northwest is vast in territory and is home to many nationalities. Furthermore, the number of party cadres of the Hui nationality who enjoy public trust are few and far between. The political solution, supplemented by combat, is the only way to solve the problem rapidly, properly, and thoroughly. Now that our troops have gained the upper hand, it will do more good than harm to combine the political solution with the military solution. Specifically, we should organize a military political committee bringing together KMT members who are leaning our way and our own people as an interim transitional body. The KMT people we have in mind are none other than Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi [0265 0155 5030], and Deng Baoshan [6772 1405 3790]." "Tao Zhiyue [7118 1492 1471] is now wavering and showing signs of leaning toward a peaceful solution for Xinjiang. We think we should ask Zhang Zhizhong to put together a Xinjiang military and political committee as an interim body, with himself as chairman and our man (is Wang Zhen going to Xinjiang?) as vice chairman. There should be one other vice chairman, someone from Yili." (Footnote 3 -- "Selected Telegrams Relating to the War To Liberate the Great Northwest," in Party Documents, 1990, Vol 5) On 23 July, Mao Zedong sent a telegram to Peng Dehuai about the offensive against the two Ma's and the issue of sending troops into Xinjiang, saying, "Wrap up the campaign against the Ma's by the first half of August and spend anywhere from half a month to one month for rest and reorganization. March westward in September and occupy Lanzhou, Xining, and the three prefectures of Gan, Liang, and Su in October. It may then be possible to capture Dihua in winter instead of waiting until next spring. Older Brother Chen (referring to the Soviet Union--ed.) is extremely anxious that we take over Xinjiang as soon as possible and may give us every assistance, including dozens of airplanes. Shaoqi, Gao Gang, and Jiaxiang are over there now. As soon as you finalize your military plan, they will consider the question of aid. In my opinion, provided the Pingliang battle wipes out the forces of the two Mas, then the military situation in the northwest would basically cease to be a problem. The occupation of the four provinces of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang would largely be a question of getting there and taking over, with no major combat involved. With Older Brother Chen's air force giving us assistance, it should not be hard to take over Xinjiang." (Footnote 4 --"Selected Telegrams Relating to the War To Liberate the Great Northwest," in Party Documents, 1990, Vol 5) Between 24 July and 11 August, the 1st Field Army of the PLA launched a battle of pursuit and attack in eastern Gansu (the Pingliang battle), tracking down the forces of Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui [7456 7703 6652] and liberating a vast stretch of land including Pingliang and Tianshui. On 4 August, Mao Zedong sent a telegram to Liu Shaoqi with the following message, "Since the main forces of Hu Zongnan [5170 1350 0589] were annihilated, the two Ma's retreated in defeat again and again. By taking Pingliang, one part of our troops has now consolidated their grip on the plains. The other part would occupy Tianshui within a few days and then move onto Lanzhou, which is expected to fall in late August or early September. We can then make preparations to advance to Xinjiang." (Footnote 5 -- "CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials Series," The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990, p 46) On the same day, Peng Dehuai issued a combat order to attack and take over Lanzhou and Xining. A decision was made to concentrate the best troops on the campaign against the forces of Ma Bufang. To coordinate with the PLA's march into the northwest, the Soviet Union on its own proposed a three-prefecture revolution in Xinjiang to take on the KMT. It suggested that the CPC send somebody to get in touch with the revolutionaries so as to pin down the KMT, which would help liberate Xinjiang. The CPC Central Committee figured there was not enough time to send somebody from outside the region to the northwest. Nor would it be easy for such a person to get there. So a tentative decision was made to order Deng Liqun [6772 0500 5028], political secretary to the delegation, to leave Moscow for Yining in his capacity as a liaison for the CPC Central Committee. Mao Zedong noted, "The key to solving the Xinjiang issue lies in close cooperation between our party and the Uygur nationality. Working on that basis, we can compel the KMT to give in and put Zhang Zhizhong, Tao Zhiyue, Liu Mengchen [0491 1322 4783] and others at our service. That way we can take over Xinjiang peacefully with a minimum of destruction and reorganize the KMT's forces in an orderly manner. (Footnote 6 -- CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials Series: The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 75) This can be described as the CPC Central Committee's basic policy for solving the Xinjiang issue. On 18 August, Mao Zedong, as chairman of the preparatory committee for the CPPCC, wrote Ahmetjon a letter inviting the three prefectures to send a Xinjiang representative to attend the CPPCC scheduled to be convened shortly. Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee thought highly of the revolution in the three prefectures, calling it "part of the democratic revolutionary movement of the Chinese people." "The struggle of the people of the three prefectures of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan is an essential contribution to the liberation of all Xinjiang and all China." (Footnote 7 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since the Founding of the PRC, Vol 1, p 82) He also said, "We consider the nationality army a well-trained people's army of the Uygur nationality. By pinning down 100,000 reactionary KMT troops with its own revolutionary activities in the past few years, it has played a major supporting role for the Chinese Revolution." (Footnote 8 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since the Founding of the PRC, Vol 1, p 87) As the PLA advanced in the northwest and across the nation triumphantly, Tao Zhiyue, commander in chief of the KMT garrison headquarters in Xinjiang; Bao Erhan [7637 1422 3352], chairman of the Xinjiang provisional government; and other patriotic generals and personalities realized that the "KMT is doomed and incapable of further military resistance. So they are inclined toward a peaceful solution and are working hard on its behalf" in an attempt to stage an uprising for peace. (Footnote 9 -- CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials Series: The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 219) In planning such an uprising, however, Tao Zhiyue however had to wage an uphill battle because he had no military forces at his command. At the time some of the KMT troops in Xinjiang were under Ma Bufang (reorganized as the First Mounted Division), but most belonged to Hu Zongnan (reorganized as the 78th Division and 42d Division). Commander Ma Chengxiang [7456 0701 4382] of the 1st Mounted Division, Commander Ye Cheng [0673 2052] of the 78th Division, and Commander Luo Shuren [5012 1859 0086] of the 179th Brigade under the 78th Division were staunchly in favor of resisting the communists. Ma Chengxiang was unshakable in his loyalty to Ma Bufang before the latter was routed. Nor did Ye Cheng and Luo Shuren vacillate before Hu Zongnan was cornered, so they were hardly open to persuasion by Tao Zhiyue. In plotting his uprising, therefore, Tao Zhiyue had to overcome many complications and move one step at a time. On 26 August, the PLA stormed and captured Lanzhou. On 5 September, Xining was liberated and the old den in which the Ma family had been entrenched for decades was utterly destroyed. The situation was getting more and more favorable for a peaceful uprising in Xinjiang. Under the pressure of events, Ma Chengxiang, Ye Cheng, and Luo Shuren "all agree to a peaceful transformation. But they balk at reorganization by the people from Yili and would rather go to Jiuquan and wait for reorganization by the PLA." (Footnote 10 -- CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials Series: The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 202) Tao Zhiyue and others approached Saveleyev, the Soviet consul general in Dihua (present-day Urumqi), pledging not to put up any resistance to the PLA and asking to get in touch and open negotiations with the CPC through the Soviet Union. On 6 September the troops under Ma Chengxiang and Ye Cheng in Suilai (now Manasi) and Qitai began withdrawing. Because of the historical understanding between nationalities, however, some members of the Hui and Han nationalities fled east following the retreating KMT units, while some members of other minority nationalities escaped to the sub-provincial administrative region. (Footnote 11 -- CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials Series: The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 219) Whatever their nationality, the masses were panic-stricken; everybody feared for his own life. Sensing the opportunity, Ma Chengxiang, Ye Cheng, and Luo Shuren vainly tried to launch a counterattack. Xinjiang was in the grip of a crisis. To hasten and bolster Tao Zhiyue's and Bao Erhan's peaceful uprising, Mao Zedong took a number of important decisions on the Xinjiang issue. First, in view of the strained relationship between Dihua, on the one hand, and the three prefectures, on the other, and considering the panicky mood among the masses, the CPC Central Committee did not adopt the suggestion by the three prefectures of sending minority troops to relieve the retreating KMT units. Moreover, it ordered forces under Tao Zhiyue to "remain on garrison duty in the various regions and counties as usual instead of coming together at a particular spot. Troop reorganization must wait until the PLA enters Xinjiang and relieves each garrison in order to avoid chaos." (Footnote 12 -- CPC Xinjiang Historical Materials Series: The Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1990 ed., p 61) Second, in a meeting with Zhang Zhizhong on 8 September, Mao Zedong told him that the liberation army had decided to enter Xinjiang along two routes, through Lanzhou and Qinghai, respectively, and expressed the hope that Zhang Zhizhong would telegram military and political leaders in Xinjiang to ask them to launch an uprising. Mao Zedong also said that provided Zhang Zhizhong sent them a telegram, the local leaders would surely go along. Zhang Zhizhong agreed readily and sent a telegram to Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan on 10 September, followed by another to Tao Zhiyue on the 11th. After receiving his telegram, Tao Zhiyue saw "a ray of hope on the horizon. Everything we do becomes infinitely more powerful. So we can press forward with an indomitable spirit." (Footnote 13 -- Brightness Bound: A Historical Record of the 25 September Uprising, Liaison Department of the Xinjiang Military Region, 1982 mimeograph ed.) Third, Mao Zedong sent a telegram to Peng Dehuai demanding that they concentrate on the march onto Xinjiang. On 10 September, the 1st Field Army of the PLA launched the Hexi battle. Xu Guangda [6079 0342 6671], commander of the 2d Corps, pursued and attacked in a northwesterly direction along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Highway. Wang Zhen, political commissar cum commander of the 1st Corps, led the 2d Army into Hexi by taking a shortcut through Qinghai and occupied Zhangye on 19 September. On the 20th, the 1st and 2nd Corps joined forces in Zhangye and continued to press onward to Jiuquan, practically knocking on Xinjiang's door. Fourthly, Mao Zedong sent a telegram to Deng Liqun demanding that the latter enter and garrison Dihua as soon as possible. Accompanied by Yeshyev, Soviet vice consul general in Dihua, Deng Liqun arrived in Dihua on 15 September and held talks with Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan on 16th. At the meeting he transmitted the instructions of the CPC Central Committee that Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan immediately send someone to Lanzhou to discuss with Peng Dehuai finding a peaceful solution for Xinjiang. Then a minor setback occurred. Alisituofu, the Soviet consul general in Yining, objected to Tao Zhiyue letting Ma Chengxiang and Yi Min [0122 2404] get away and demanded that the CPC Central Committee order Tao Zhiyue to take Ma Chengxiang and other reactionaries into custody. Let them go or detain them? In a telegram to Deng Liqun, Mao Zedong said, "Let bad elements like Ma Chengxiang, Luo Shuren, and Ye Cheng flee by plane. The more the escapees, the better." On 25 and 26 September, Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan issued separate telegrams announcing an uprising. On 28 September, Mao Zedong and Zhu De sent a telegram to Tao Zhiyue, Bao Erhan, and other political and military personnel in Xinjiang involved in the uprising, praising and encouraging them. At the same time, Mao Zedong ordered the PLA's 1st Corps to advance onto Xinjiang. With that peaceful liberation came to Xinjiang, opening a new chapter in its history. National Unity: Key To Solving Xinjiang Problem After the CPC and PLA entered and garrisoned Xinjiang, how did they lead the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to build a new Xinjiang? At the time all trades and industries were in a state of depression and a hundred tasks awaited to be done. Problems abounded. What was the key to solving the Xinjiang problem? In the opinion of Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee: "The key to solving the Xinjiang problem is close cooperation between our party and the Uygur nationality." On 23 October, Mao Zedong again stressed this point in the "Telegram of the CPC Central Committee to Peng Dehuai" drafted by himself, "Only by establishing a brotherly relationship with the Uygur nationality (and other nationalities) can the PLA build a new Xinjiang with people's democracy." (Footnote 14 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts since the Founding of the PRC, Vol 1, p 88. Zhongyang Wenxian Chubanshe, 1987, p 88) Xinjiang is inhabited by minority nationalities, of which the most important is the Uygur nationality. Thus national unity is critical and is a prerequisite for and a basic guarantee of every other undertaking. Mao Zedong said, "It would be impossible to totally resolve the nationalities issue and completely isolate the reactionaries among the minority nationalities without a large number of communist cadres from the minority nationalities." (Footnote 15 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since the Founding of the PRC," Vol 1, p 128. Zhongyang Wenxian Chubanshe, 1987) Owing to the longstanding influence of the Soviet Union and because of the fact that some minority members had studied in the Soviet Union and that the struggle had been going on for some time, there were already some advanced communists or sympathizers among the minority nationalities. Earlier they had put together an alliance of communists and then an alliance in defense of peace and democracy. So there already existed a solid base for setting up a communist organization among the minorities in Xinjiang. On 15 October 1949, Seipuddin Aziz submitted his application to join the CPC while attending the CPPCC in Beijing, at the same time conveying the strong desire of other comrades to do likewise. On 23 October, Chairman Mao Zedong wrote this comment on Seipuddin's party membership application, "I endorse Comrade Seipuddin's application to join the party. Have Seipuddin himself take this letter to Peng Dehuai for the latter's safe keeping. After the Xinjiang bureau comes into existence, Comrade Seipuddin can then complete the formalities by filling out a party membership application form and submitting it to the bureau." (Footnote 16 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since the Founding of the PRC, Vol 1, p 86. Zhongyang Wenxian Chubanshe, 1987) In late December 1949, the Xinjiang bureau admitted its first 15 party members with the approval of the CPC Central Committee. For starters, there were Seipudding Aziz of the Uygur nationality, who became a member on the recommendation of Wang Zhen and Deng Liqun; Bao Erhan (Uygur), on the recommendation of Wang Zhen and Xu Liqing [1776 4539 3237]; and Chen Xihua [7115 6932 5478] (Han) and Zhao Delin [6392 1795 2651] (Xibe), on the recommendation of Xu Liqing and Deng Liqun. They were followed by 11 other people, who joined the party on the recommendation of members of the bureau. They were Shu Mutong [5289 1970 0681] (Xibe), Maerguofu Yisihakefu [7456 1422 2654 1133 0181 2448 0761 4430 1133] (Tatar), Abdullah Muit [7093 0008 6757 3583 0678 3341 4476 5030 2251] (Uygur), Abdullah Zakrof [7093 0008 6757 2139 2089 0344 3157 1133] (Uygur), Anniyaer Jiakulin [1344 1441 1422 6328 1655 2651] (Kazak), Anniyaer Hanbaba [1344 1441 1422 3352 1572 1572] (Uzbek), Yibulayin Tuerdi [0122 0008 2139 7299 0685 1422 0966] (Uygur), Wuyiguer Shayiran [3527 0181 0657 1422 3097 0181 3544] (Uygur), and Abuliemiti Makesutuofu [7093 0008 0441 4717 2251 7456 0344 5685 2094 1133] (Uygur). Each of them submitted an application for examination and review, along with the recommendations of two full party members. Upon direct approval by the Xinjiang bureau, he became a member without going through a period of alternate membership first. These 15 party members represented seven nationalities and 14 of them were members of minority nationalities, including eight Uygurs. In early 1950, the Dihua municipal CPC committee and its counterparts in the various districts and prefectures began admitting party members directly. By late November 1950, 995 people had been accepted as party members, the vast majority of them being key elements of the revolution in the three prefectures and leaders of progressive organizations. To nurture minority cadres, Mao Zedong at the time demanded that provincial CPC committees in Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Shaanxi as well as the local CPC committees of all prefectures inhabited by minorities organize cadre training classes for minorities. He also demanded that Xinjiang turn out within three years about 10,000 minority cadres with a knowledge of policies who were also in close touch with the masses and were loyal to the people's interests. Acting on these demands, the Xinjiang CPC bureau immediately moved to put together local minority cadre training classes, the first one of which began in early April 1950. Addressing the opening ceremony of the first class, Wang Zhen compared such training classes to "factories producing people's cadres." (Footnote 17 -- Deng Liqun's "Xinjiang Memoirs," 17 February 1989, appearing in Xinjiang Party History Work Correspondence, 1989, Vol 2) Not only did the Xinjiang CPC bureau organize local cadre training classes for minority nationalities, but party committees in the various regions, prefectures, and counties also got into the act. After their graduation, the trainees participated in social reform on all fronts, tempering themselves and acquiring new skills in the process. Those who performed well were recruited into the party or Communist Youth League. In no time, the first generation of CPC-trained minority cadres emerged and became the backbone of leading groups at all levels. According to statistics as of October 1950, of the 165 commissioners, deputy commissioners, and county chiefs in all of Xinjiang, 107 were minority cadres. To solve the nationalities problem and achieve national unity, there is no alternative to doing more good deeds for the people of all nationalities. In accordance with Mao Zedong's instruction to the PLA stationed in Xinjiang--the main purpose of its being in Xinjiang was to do more good deeds for the people of various nationalities--and in keeping with its own fine tradition of being a working force and production force as well as a fighting force, the PLA units successfully suppressed the bandits and put down the rebels, protecting the people's lives and properties and stabilizing social order. (Footnote 18 -- Remembering Mao Zedong, Xinjiang Renmin Chubanshe, 1977, Vol 1, p 498) They took part in local party building and government building, putting an end to the historical oppression and enslavement of the various nationalities and turning them into the true masters of the nation and society. Under the leadership of General Wang Zhen, the PLA stationed in Xinjiang in particular responded to Mao Zedong's call to the military to participate in production by furthering the Yanan spirit and launching a mass production campaign. It was a huge success. Wang Zhen put it in no uncertain terms, "We do not compete with the people for grain. On the contrary, we help the people grow grain. We must demonstrate to the Xinjiang people the superiority of collective labor and the collective economy." (Footnote 19 -- Wang Zhen, "Production and Construction by the Military in Xinjiang: Principles and Tasks," in Selected Historical Materials on the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Vol 1, 16 January 1950) Taking a long-term view, Wang Zhen regarded the use of troops to open up the wasteland as a strategic measure that would develop the border, lessen the burden on the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang, strengthen national unity, and consolidate the new frontier. The troops participated in production to ease the burden on the people, According to calculations as of January 1950, it took 20,000 tons of grain imported from the Soviet Union in addition to the 20,000 tons shipped from the rest of the province to feed the 193,000 troops stationed in Xinjiang. At 3,000 rubles per ton, the imports cost at least 162 billion yuan (old currency), including freight costs. Because of the troops' involvement in production, they were able to grow their own grain by June and July, eliminating the need for imports and saving the nation a large sum of money. Meanwhile, grain shipments from the rest of the province also were reduced, easing the burden on the various nationalities. Under KMT rule, peasants parted with over 700,000 dan of grain in feudal land taxes an other additional levies. Even more onerous was "going on a public errand." The masses in southern Xinjiang had to transport military provisions to Dihua (now Urumqi) and northern Xinjiang using small donkeys. One round trip could take anywhere from a couple of months to half a year. To the man on the street, "going on a public errand" was something to be dreaded. After liberation, the units became self-sufficient in grain and the peasants turned over just 440,000 dan of grain in 1950. Public errands too were abolished. In other words, while the size of the units was doubled, the burden on the masses was cut by almost one-half. People of all nationalities in Xinjiang realized from this the spirit of the CPC-led people's army of wholeheartedly serving the people, which was totally different from KMT troops oppressing and plundering the people. Mao Zedong had high praise for the military, saying, "Wang Zhen's troops entered Xinjiang and wasted no time in devoting themselves to careful budgeting. By practicing self-reliance, they produce what they need. They are now solidly on the right track and have won the enthusiastic support of the minority nationalities." (Footnote 20 -- Mao Zedong Manuscripts Since the Founding of the Republic, Vol 3, p 384. Zhongyang Wenxian Chubanshe, 1989) Advance Steadily and Cautiously, Carry Out Social Reform Step By Step According to the Marxist view, social reform is indispensable to really solving the nationalities problem. Marx and Engels said, "Once the exploitation of man by man is eliminated, the exploitation of nationality by nationality will also be eliminated." "Once class antagonism within a nation disappears, the hostile relations among nations will also disappear." (Footnote 21 -- Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Renmin Chubanshe, 1972 ed., Vol 1, p 270) What direction then should social reform in minority-inhabited areas follow? In June 1950, Mao Zedong told the 3d Plenum of the 7th CPC Central Committee, "Social reform in minority-inhabited areas is a matter of utmost importance and must be handled carefully. Under no circumstances can we be impatient. If we get impatient, things may go wrong. If the conditions are not in place, don't reform. When only one condition is in place, don't reform either." "Don't engage in any reform of a mass nature without mass support, without the armed forces of the people, or when there are no cadres of the minority concerned." (Footnote 22 -- Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 5, p 23) Following the instructions of Mao Zedong and the CPC Central Committee, Xinjiang experimented with rent reduction in 147 villages in agricultural areas across the province between September 1950 and October 1951. Beginning in September 1951, a campaign was launched in all agrarian areas in Xinjiang to reduce rents and denounce local despots. By May 1952, the task of rent reduction and local despot denunciation was accomplished in over 1,500 villages with a combined population of almost 4 million in 58 counties in nine sub-provincial administrative regions, so it was a great success. But reducing rents and denouncing local despots weakened feudal forces without fundamentally changing the feudal land system. Many peasants said, "The landlord class and feudal land system are like a mountain. Local despots and other counter-revolutionaries are the wolves in the mountain. The campaign of reducing rents and denouncing local despots has gotten rid of the pack of wolves, but the mountain is still blocking our advance." (Footnote 23 -- "Report on Land Reform To Be Carried Out in Agrarian Areas This Winter and Next Spring," by Zhang Bangying [1728 6721 5391], 25 August 1952) This fully shows that the urgency of the peasants' demand for land in the wake of the campaign to reduce rents and denounce local despots. With Mao Zedong's approval, land reform was carried out in four stages in agrarian areas in Xinjiang between September 1952 and December 1953. The landlord class, which had lain like a dead weight upon the people of all nationalities for thousands of years, was overthrown, feudal land ownership was eradicated, and 3.45 million peasants divided 7.37 million mu of land among themselves. Not only did peasants of all nationalities succeed in casting off the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary Han ruling class, but the oppression and exploitation by feudal forces represented by the landlord class within a nationality also came to an end. Politically and economically the peasants had truly stood up. Peasants of all nationalities were encouraged and elated. At a meeting celebrating the victory of land reform on 23 March 1952, Uygur peasants in Paha Taikeli village in Shufu County wrote a letter--"Dedicated to Mao Zedong"--in the form of a poem to express their respect. In the letter they told of their suffering in the past, described the joy of land reform and standing up, and expressed their profound and unparalleled love for the CPC and Mao Zedong. They wrote, "In celebrating the victory, our village is a more lively and festive scene than it is when we celebrate a festival. Land reform has really done us a world of good. The person who has improved our well-being so much is none other than Savior Mao Zedong. Your ideological splendor shines all over Paha Taikeli." On 30 August, Mao Zedong wrote a letter in reply, "Thank you for the letter you wrote me in March as you celebrated the victory of land reform. You have been liberated from the bondage of feudal land ownership. I hope you will be even more united in response to the `Be patriotic, harvest bumper crops' slogan, apply yourselves to production, improve your own material lives, and, on that basis, elevate your cultural standard step by step." (Footnote 24 -- Selected Correspondence of Mao Zedong, p 440) By 1957, socialist transformation involving agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce had basically been accomplished in Xinjiang, signaling that Xinjiang had largely abolished the exploitation system and set up a socialist economy. The establishment of a socialist system opened up a brave new world for the political, economic, and cultural development of Xinjiang and for the achievement of equality, mutual aid, unity, cooperation, common prosperity, and happiness among the various nationalities. During the period of socialist transformation, by and large "our policy was quite cautious and reliable and had strong support among the various minority nationalities." (Footnote 25 -- Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol 5, p 277) People of all nationalities in Xinjiang were sincerely thankful to Mao Zedong for the new good life he brought them. Kuerban Tulumu, an elderly man from the Uygur nationality in Hetian prefecture, was determined to go to Beijing riding on a donkey to thank Mao Zedong and present to him the raisins he made and the coarse cloth he wove. For a time this incident was much talked about with fondness and had a profound effect on the public psychology. It fully revealed the unparalleled love and feelings for Mao Zedong on the part of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang. Development and Stability: Two Major Themes In Modern Xinjiang Today With the completion of the socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production and creation of a socialist system, what should be the focus of work in minority-inhabited areas? Or, should we say, what should be the top priority in such work? For a long time this question remained unanswered. Still, Mao Zedong demonstrated his usual theoretical wisdom on this matter as well. Nineteen sixty-two saw the Yili-Tacheng incident. In April 1962, 60,000 residents in the border area near Yili and Tacheng fled to the Soviet Union. On 29 May, a handful of hooligans went rioting in Yining. The main explanation for the Yili-Tacheng incident was the instigation planned and organized by the Soviet authorities over a number of years. Nevertheless, our failure to make proper or adequate provisions for the livelihood of the people of various nationalities also played an important part. Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the autonomous regional CPC committee and regional people's committee handled this matter correctly and resolutely. To stabilize Xinjiang, the CPC Central Committee ordered the production and construction corps in the Xinjiang Military Region to take over agricultural and pastoral production and other grassroots work left behind by the border people who had fled to the Soviet Union and set up state farms, pastoral areas, tree farms, and mines along the Sino-Soviet border. The events in Xinjiang set Mao Zedong thinking long and hard. On 27 September 1963, Chairman Mao Zedong issued important instructions on Xinjiang work at an enlarged meeting of the standing committee of the politbureau of the CPC Central Committee. In Xinjiang, he said, "We must first do a good job in economic work to keep agriculture, animal husbandry, and industry growing year after year. The economy must be more prosperous every year than the year before, and the people must live better every year than the year before." "It takes accumulation to pay for socialist construction, but accumulation must not be excessive. The state must procure grain from the peasants, but state purchase quotas must not be too burdensome. We must not go too far with state procurement. Lessen the burden on the people. Improve their lives." "Second, put politics in command. Step up ideological and political education." "Take pains to improve relations among the nationalities. Enhance national unity." Such were Mao Zedong's ardent expectations and immense concern for the rank-and-file cadres and the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang before he died, pointing up a direction for solving the Xinjiang issue. In fact, Mao Zedong's instructions identified the two major themes in modern Xinjiang, namely development and stability, which held the key to solving the Xinjiang problem. National unity and social stability are the prerequisites for economic development, without which we would be in no position to do anything. Ideological and political work, therefore, must be intensified and unity among the nationalities must be enhanced. On the other hand, only when production increases year after year, the economy becomes more and more prosperous, and the people's livelihood improves all the time can we really have solid national unity and social stability. Development is the most reliable guarantee of stability. The top priority in Xinjiang is economic development. This is why. First, Marxism attaches the utmost importance to the development of productive forces. In Marxism, productive forces are seen as the ultimate determining factor of all social development. Socialism, in particular, must devote itself to the development of productive forces. "The consolidation and development of the socialist system must also rely on the liberation and development of productive forces. Thus, putting economic development on the top of the agenda is consistent with the fundamental principle of Marxist historical materialism. Second, it is in line with the basic interests of the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to develop the economy and improve their lives. Xinjiang is a land of many nationalities. While inequality among the nationalities has been disappearing since the PRC was founded, there is no denying that economic and cultural gaps between minority-inhabited areas and places where the Han people live, between the west and the coastal region, remain very wide. Only a mighty push to develop the economy in minority-inhabited areas can gradually narrow the gaps and truly bring about prosperity for all nationalities and solidify national unity. Third, located on the fatherland's northwest frontier and bordering on five nations, namely the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, Xinjiang occupies a vital strategic position. Only when its production has taken off, its economy is booming, the people's livelihood has improved, and society has achieved stability can we have a strong border defense and demonstrate the superiority of Chinese socialism. In Xinjiang, whether the economy is growing and whether the people's livelihood is improving not only will impact national unity domestically but will also have direct international repercussions. Mao Zedong had said at the time that people of all nationalities in Xinjiang must live better than they did in the KMT era and even better than their counterparts did in the Soviet Union. Mao Zedong's instructions represented the first time he put forward the criterion of productive forces since 1945 when he made a similar point in "On Coalition Government." He wrote, "When all is said and done, whether the sum total of party and government policies in China and their implementation have been a good thing or bad for the Chinese people, whether they have had major or minor effects will depend on whether they have helped stimulate the development of productive forces of the Chinese people and by how much, whether they have hampered or liberated productive forces." (Footnote 26 -- Selected Works of Mao Zedong, 2d ed., Vol 3, p 1079) In his instructions, Mao Zedong did more than reiterate the productive forces criterion, he also refined it in a major way by demanding that we not only ask whether productive forces have been developing year after year, but also whether the people have been living a better life each year. The reason is that while the development of productive forces provides a material guarantee for an improved livelihood for the people, it does not automatically improve their living standards. If the people are saddled with a heavier burden because of high accumulation, high procurements, and indiscriminate fee collection, they would not lead a better life even if production is rising and the economy is booming. That Mao Zedong made the improvement of people's lives an important part of the criterion of productive forces, therefore, was both theoretically and practically significant. To improve the people's lives requires easing the burden on them as well as increasing output. Easing the burden on the people essentially means easing the burden on peasants. Without easing the burden on peasants, there can be no sustained developments in agriculture, in animal husbandry, and, ultimately, in industry, and no economic prosperity. The autonomous regional CPC committee and regional people's committee firmly implemented Mao Zedong's instructions. The autonomous regional CPC committee submitted two documents to the CPC Central Committee: "Report on Strengthening Economic Work in Compliance with Chairman Mao Zedong's Instructions on Xinjiang Work" and "Report on Putting Politics in Command in Compliance with Chairman Mao Zedong's Instructions on Xinjiang Work." These two documents focused on the dual themes of development and stability, respectively, and aside from a number of leftist ideas, were basically correct. As a result, the Xinjiang economy made rapid progress in the 1963-66 period. In the era of taking class struggle as the key link, however, one was not in a position to truly focus on economic work; given the prevailing historical circumstances, Mao Zedong's instructions were not carried through. Under the theoretical guidance of Deng Xiaoping's thesis of building socialism with Chinese characteristics since the 3d Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the Uygur Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and people's government have unwaveringly adhered to the basic line of concentrating on economic construction, upholding the four cardinal principles, and sticking with reform and the open policy. The result is a revitalized Xinjiang, a Xinjiang profoundly changed in many aspects. The economy is developing steadily and national unity has been strengthened. Be that as it may, the task of developing the economy and improving the people's livelihood in Xinjiang remains an arduous one. We need to keep up the hard work for a long time to come and Mao Zedong's instructions about development and stability will still be of immense instructive significance.
