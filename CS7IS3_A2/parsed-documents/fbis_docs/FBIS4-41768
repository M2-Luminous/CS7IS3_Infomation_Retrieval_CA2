Kolosova and others] [Text] The preliminary results of the presidential elections in Ukraine revealed diametrically opposed tendencies in the east and west of the country, which can ultimately lead to a split, a high-ranking Russian expert specializing in Russian-Ukrainian relations told INTERFAX on Monday [27 June]. He noted, though, that he expressed the opinion of a political scientist rather than a diplomat. What happened was easy to predict, he went on to say. The west voted for Leonid Kravchuk, who scored 90 percent of the votes in Lvov, for instance. The east, including Donbass, Zaporozhye and Crimea, voted for Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who is leading with an impressive preponderance. Obviously, the electors voted for the ideas expressed by the candidates, not for the candidates as such. Kravchuk symbolizes independence and gradual departure from Russia, while Kuchma -- independence and rapprochement with Russia, he said. He also noted that before the Soviet Union's breakup, Ukraine had never existed as an independent state. The west of Ukraine was initially part of Austro-Hungary and then Hungary and Poland, while the east had always gravitated to Russia. "The conventional border ran along the Dnieper. Hence, the left-bank (eastern) and right-bank (western) Ukraine," said the Russian expert. The preliminary results of the elections show that the historical division was still strongly influencing the alignment of political forces in Ukraine, he said. He said he did not want to make far-reaching conclusions. "One should not forget, however, that during the 1991 referendum, 90 percent of the Ukrainian residents voted for independence. The situation has changed since then. This is the only thing one can say with confidence," he said.
