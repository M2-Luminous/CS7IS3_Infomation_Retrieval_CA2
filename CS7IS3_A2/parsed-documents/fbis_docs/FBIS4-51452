Li noted that Hong Kong's public servants, who have rich administrative experience, had played an important role in achieving Hong Kong's prosperity. "We understand their predicament at present, and hope that they would continue to work with ease of mind," he said. "We also hope that they would make continued contribution to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong after 1997."
