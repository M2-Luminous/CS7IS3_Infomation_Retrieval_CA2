Although the composition and priorities of the new president's office are still under discussion, it is clear the building of the new South Africa will be high on its agenda and will receive Mandela's personal attention. Said the recently appointed director general of the President's Office, Jakes Gerwel: "I can't presume for the president, but he will most likely be interested in the RDP and nation-building." The choice of Gerwel director general is a clear indication of Mandela's personal commitment to ensuring old government structures change and the new government delivers. As rector of the University of the Western Cape for the seven years, Gerwel has first-hand experience of the difficulties of turning apartheid institutions around. He understands the problems the new government will encounter from its constituencies as well as those with other agendas. As director general, Gerwel will be heading the administration of the office and making further appointments. How effective the office will be depends largely on the style and priorities of Mandela and the people staffing his office. Others tipped for positions in the president's office are Rivonia trialist Ahmed Kathrada -- who was squeezed out of the cabinet to make room for smaller parties -- as parliamentary liaison, and human rights lawyer Fink Haysom as a constitutional and legal adviser. Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo, who will be overseeing the implementation of the RDP, will also operate from the President's Office. It is likely all ministries affected by the RDP will have to report to Naidoo, who will monitor the progress of the programme. The ANC's Women's Emancipation Committee has proposed the new president establish a cabinet committee, under his office, to ensure the advancement of women in government. There is little doubt the proposal will be accepted. Mandela is expected soon to announce five projects aimed at providing visible examples of the new government's commitment to improving the living standards of the poor. The projects will address the needs of those displaced by violence; of children; and the provision of facilities to townships. Those involved say the idea behind putting key development projects into the president's office is to give them clout and place them where the president can oversee them.
