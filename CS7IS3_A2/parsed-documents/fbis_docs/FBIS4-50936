Qiao spoke highly of the efforts Lissouba made for the establishment of Sino-Congolese diplomatic ties 30 years ago, and called him "an old friend of the Chinese people." China and the Congo, as developing countries, both faced the arduous tasks of developing their economy, Qiao said. "China, within its capability, would like to provide aid to all developing countries, including the Congo," he said. "Although the help is limited, it is an expression of friendship." He also stressed that all countries should develop their own countries according to their own situation. Lissouba said that the Congolese people would never forget the support and help from the Chinese people over the 30 years after the setting-up of bilateral diplomatic ties. The two leaders also exchanged views on issues of common concern.
