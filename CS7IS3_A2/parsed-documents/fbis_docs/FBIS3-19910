Vural Seker, 22, Iman Seker and Semsettin Yildirim, 31, who entered France in 1989, were arrested on Monday when they reported to the local police station after the Interior Ministry rejected their asylum request. They were put on a plane for Istanbul on Tuesday. The committee for the right of aslyum in Annecy condemned the deportations as "a veritable denial of human rights" and said the Kurds had been imprisoned and persecuted in Turkey. But local authority spokeswoman Patricia Mauroy-Willaert defended the decision, saying the Kurds were "potential illegal immigrants" and that if they had been informed of the decision in advance they would have disappeared. The Kurds' initial asylum request had been rejected and the refusal was confirmed on appeal.
