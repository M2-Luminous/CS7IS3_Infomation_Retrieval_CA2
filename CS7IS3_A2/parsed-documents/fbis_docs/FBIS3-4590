Breaking its previous practice of issuing visas only in Beijing, North Korea issued visas through the North Korean Embassy in Vienna on the afternoon of 26 February. Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna: [Begin Cha recording] The North Korean attitude toward the inspection team, which has been somewhat leery, is gradually relaxing. Breaking its previous practice of issuing visas only in Beijing, North Korea promptly issued visas through the North Korean Embassy in Vienna yesterday. In the past, when the number of inspection team members exceeded three, North Korea has demanded that the group be reduced. This time, however, North Korea issued visas to all seven members as demanded by the IAEA. The IAEA expressed satisfaction with the North Korean follow-up steps, although delayed, and expressed the hope that North Korea will actively cooperate with the inspection team's activities. The inspection team will depart Vienna for Beijing at 1040 tonight, Korean time, by Lufthansa, and will stay overnight in Beijing. The team will leave Beijing on 1 March by Koryo Airline and will arrive in Pyongyang at around 1730, Korean time. As soon as it arrives in Pyongyang, the inspection team will arrange the dates of inspection in Yongbyon and Pyongyang with relevant officials of the North Korean Ministry of Atomic Power Industry, and will launch a full-fledged two-week inspection of seven nuclear facilities beginning 2 March. This means that overall inspections of North Korea are revived and resumed nearly after a one year suspension. [end recording]
