FBIS3-58583 "drweu011_n_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-011 Document Type:Daily Report 18 Jan 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Finland Foreign Minister, Officials Comment on Russian Note LD1501212394 Helsinki Radio Finland in English 1930 GMT 15 Jan 94 LD1501212394 Helsinki Radio Finland Language: English Article Type:BFN [Excerpts] Russia has asked Finland for information on the activities of two Finnish organizations. HELSINGEN SANOMAT newspaper reported on Saturday [15 January] that the Russian Embassy in Helsinki had submitted a written note to the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, asking if the Patriotic National League, the IKL, and the Greater Finland Association were compatible with the stipulations of the Paris peace treaty. Under the terms of that agreement, Finland disbanded a number of nationalist and right-wing organizations which the Soviet Union considered to be fascist. The IKL is modeled after a political party that was banned after the last war. The initials of the organization are the same, however the name is slightly different. The Greater Finland organization has been collecting signatures on a petition calling for the return of territories ceded to the Soviet Union at the end of the war. Finland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Heikki Haavisto said the Russian note did not come as a surprise. Top Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials say the Russian note cannot be considered a serious issue. They say that when they answer the note, the Finns will say that the two organizations in question will be dealt with according to Finnish law alone and that the organizations do not violate the Paris peace treaty. Raimo Ilaskivo, the Conservative candidate in Finland's presidential election, expressed surprise about the Russian note, particularly concerning its timing, the day before the first round in the voting of the presidential election. He said one cannot avoid the question of whether or not the note is an attempt to influence the outcome of the voting. Prime Minister Esko Aho said he did not feel the note would have any impact on Finland's presidential election. Center Party presidential candidate Vayrynen, meanwhile, said he was surprised by the note, and did not feel the two organizations in question were in violation of the Paris peace treaty. Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn, the Swedish People's Party candidate, does not consider the note any interference in Finland's internal affairs. [passage omitted] Yuriy Deryabin, the Russian ambassador in Finland, insists that the note is not linked in any way to Sunday's presidential election or to the electoral success of Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. In an interview with YLE television news, Mr. Deryabin says that the first inquiry concerning the two organizations was made in May, and was repeated after no reply came to the first one. He also said the note does not call for disbanding the organizations and, contrary to the days of Soviet power, Russia does not interfere in Finland's internal affairs. On Friday, meanwhile, Andrey Nikolayev, the commander of Russia's border guard, denounced what he sees as nationalist forces in neighboring countries inciting anti-Russian sentiment. He said ultranationalist groups in Finland, the Baltic republics, and elsewhere are working to change the present borders. YLE political correspondent Pentti Lumme says the note is a reminder by Russia that the Paris peace treaty is still in force. Finland unilaterally canceled sections of the treaty, placing limits on its military, but other sections remain in force, including those banning fascist organizations.
