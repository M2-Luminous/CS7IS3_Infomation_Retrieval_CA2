Saito told a press conference that it is "clearly a misunderstanding" to assume that Japan has lost its drive in the trade talks. He pointed out that there is still a month before February 11 when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet in Washington. Japan and the United States have promised to come up with an agreement on the bilateral framework trade talks by then. Little progress has been reported so far on the talks, which is being held under the Japan-U.S. trade framework accord concluded last July. Saito also said the trade negotiations are "two-way talks" and are not aimed at having Japan alone make concessions. He said there are various points where the United States should compromise and called for Washington's continued efforts to boost its competition and to reduce its financial deficit. Specifically, Saito urged some U.S. states to further open their markets to foreign companies and businesses, saying markets in some of the U.S. states are "not as open as some foreign countries desire" because of the difference in systems from state to state.
