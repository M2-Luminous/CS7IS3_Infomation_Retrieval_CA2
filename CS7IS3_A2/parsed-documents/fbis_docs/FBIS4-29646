The eight of them, all representatives-elect are -- U N. Nang Gam of Machambaw Township, U Yau Si of Putao Township, U Marpan Sin of Khawbude Township, U Kya Mya of Mohnyin Township Constituency-2, U Kyaw Maung of Mohnyin Township Constituency-1, and U Min Swe and U Ba Win, organizers of the NLD of Kyunhla Township, Sagaing Division, and U Thein Aung, NLD organizer of Pinbaw Village-Tract, Mogaung Township. Of them, U N. Nang Gam, U Yau Si, U Marpan Sin, and U Kya Mya are said to have been organized by NLD organizers in charge of Kachin State U Tin Aung and U Yan Naung Myint, who are presently in Manerplaw, and went underground from Myitkyina on 22 December 1991. They arrived in Pajao region. U Kyaw Maung went underground on 6 January 1992 and followed them. U Min Swe, while serving as the township organizer of the Kyunhla Township NLD, came into contact with former teacher of Nyaungkaing Village, U Myint, and together with U Ba Win went underground on 9 January 1993. U Thein Aung, while serving as the organizer of the NLD at Bamagon Village, Pinbaw Village-Tract in Mogaung Township, took along with him Tha Din and Thaung Htwe who wanted to go underground and he also went underground. After arriving in the jungle, they formed the Northern NLD group also known as Underground NLD-North group at Pajao Camp during the last week of January 1992. The group was formed with U Tin Aung as chairman, U Kya Mya as secretary, and the remaining seven persons as organizing committee members. On receipt of letter of intimation sent by Dr. Sein Win from Manerplaw Camp of the expatriate group NCGUB [National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma] about the second week of April 1992, NLD-North Chairman U Tin Aung and member U N. Nang Gam left the Pajao Camp for the KNU [Karen National Union] Central Manerplaw Camp. On arrival at the Manerplaw Camp the National Council of the Union of Burma, NCUB, was formed and U Tin Aung was assigned the duties as secretary. U N. Nang Gam was attached to the NCGUB office for about one year and he became a member of the education committee which was formed in July 1993. In September 1993, Dr. Sein Win sent for the representatives at Pajao Camp to come to the Manerplaw Camp in order to expand the NCGUB group and U Kya Mya, U Kyaw Maung, U Marpan Sin, U Yau Si, and organizers U Yan Naung Myint and U Thaung Htwe arrived at Manerplaw Camp. As expatriate Sein Win and group had left for the United States, they had to wait there for nothing. Hearing that the KIO and the Government had made peace, their group left Manerplaw Camp and arrived at Pajao Camp on 13 March 1994. After holding consultations and discussions among themselves they completely dissolved the NLD-North group on 2 April and after submitting the matter to the KIO leaders they returned to the legal fold. When they arrived at the Manerplaw Camp, they learnt that one of the organizations of a foreign country provided assistance to Sein Win's NCGUB group. For the 1993 budget, a monetary assistance of 4.8 million Norwegian kroners [over US$ 600,000] was provided for education sector alone. It was said that they went to the jungles at the instigation of Kachin State organizer of the NLD U Tin Aung. However, only when they arrived there did they come to know that U Tin Aung had gone underground as he was in debt for 500,000 kyats in Mogaung. They also learnt that an annual fund of US$ 7,000 was provided by Sein Win's NCGUB to the NLD-North group and the travelling allowance of 100,000 bahts given for them to come from Pajao to Manerplaw were misused by U Tin Aung and that he had contacts with the former BCP [Burma Communist Party] group at the border with the other country. Thus, they at last distrusted in their leader U Tin Aung and they realized their mistake. When they arrived at Manerplaw Camp they saw for themselves that those who had absconded after the disturbances in 1988 and went underground were disunited and were engaged in power struggle, killed each other, misappropriated funds, were self seekers, and earned income through illegal means and were of loose character. Moreover, Sein Win's `parallel government' was nothing but just a name-sake. They also learnt that soon the NCGUB would merge with the armed groups in the jungles to form the "Federal Government of Burma, FGB" and began to hate and abhor them and they became frustrated. Having learnt the present situation that there is now peace and tranquillity in Kachin State and the KIO group is actively engaged, hand in hand with the government, in implementing regional development tasks, coming to have faith in the genuine goodwill and true attitude of the State Law and Order Restoration Council and experiencing the unscrupulous acts and atrocities of the armed groups in the jungles, they began to realize their mistakes and repent and returned to the legal fold.
