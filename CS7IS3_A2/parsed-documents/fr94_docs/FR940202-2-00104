FR940202-2-00104 FR940202-2-00071 B. Aspiration of Oropharyngeal and Gastric Flora Clinically significant aspiration usually occurs in patients who have one or more of the following conditions: a depressed level of consciousness, dysphagia due to neurologic or esophageal disorders, an endotracheal (naso- or oro-tracheal) and nasogastric tube in place, and receipt of enteral feeding. 35,79,80,172&hyph;176 Placement of nasogastric tube may increase nasopharyngeal colonization, cause reflux of gastric contents, or allow bacterial migration via the tube from the stomach to the upper airway. 173,176&hyph;178 When enteral feedings are administered, gross contamination of the enteral solution during preparation 179&hyph;181 and elevated gastric pH 67,182,183 may lead to gastric colonization with gram-negative bacilli. In addition, gastric reflux and aspiration may occur because of increased intragastric volume and pressure. 67,110,173 Prevention of pneumonia in such patients may be difficult, but methods that make regurgitation less likely, for example, placing the patient in a semirecumbent position by elevating the head of the bed, 175,184,185 administering enteral nutrition intermittently in small boluses rather than continuously, 67,183 using flexible, small-bore enteral tubes, 176,186 and witholding enteral feeding when the residual volume in the stomach is large or if bowel sounds are not heard upon auscultation of the abdomen, may be beneficial. 175,187,188 On the other hand, placing the enteral tube below the stomach (e.g. in the jejunum) has yielded equivocal results. 189,190 C. Mechanically Assisted Ventilation and Endotracheal Intubation Patients receiving continuous, mechanically assisted ventilation have 6&hyph;21 times the risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia compared with patients not receiving ventilatory support. 34,60,62,70 Data from the study by Fagon and co-workers indicate that the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia increases by 1% per day. 6 This increased risk is partly due to carriage of oropharyngeal organisms upon passage of the endotracheal tube into the trachea during intubation, as well as to depressed host defenses secondary to the patient's severe underlying illness. 7,34,35,191 In addition, bacteria can aggregate on the surface of the tube over time and form a glycocalyx (biofilm) that protects the bacteria from action of antimicrobial agents or host defenses. 192 Some investigators believe that these bacterial aggregates may become dislodged by ventilation flow, tube manipulation, or suctioning, and subsequently embolize into the lower respiratory tract and cause focal pneumonia. 193,194 Removing tracheal secretions by gentle suctioning and using aseptic technique to reduce cross-contamination from respiratory therapy equipment or hands of personnel have been utilized traditionally to help prevent pneumonia in patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation. The risk of pneumonia is also increased by the direct access of bacteria to the lower respiratory tract, often because of leakage around the endotracheal cuff, 195,196 which allows pooled secretions above the cuff to enter the trachea. 197 In one recent study, the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia was delayed and decreased in intubated patients whose endotracheal tubes had a separate dorsal lumen that allowed drainage (by suctioning) of secretions in the space above endotracheal cuff and below the glottis. 197 However, further studies are needed to determine the cost-benefit ratio of using this device. D. Cross-Colonization Via Hands of Personnel Pathogens causing nosocomial pneumonia, such as gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus , are ubiquitous in the hospital, especially in intensive or critical care areas. 198,199 Transmission of these microorganisms to patients frequently occurs via healthcare workers' hands that become contaminated or transiently colonized with the microorganisms. 200&hyph;205 Procedures such as tracheal suctioning and manipulation of ventilator circuit or endotracheal tubes increase the opportunity for cross-contamination. The risk of cross-contamination can be reduced by using aseptic technique and sterile or disinfected equipment when appropriate 62 and eliminating pathogens from the hands of personnel. 62,206&hyph;208 In theory, adequate handwashing is an effective way of removing transient bacteria from the hands, 207,208 but personnel compliance with handwashing has been generally poor, despite the best efforts at educating healthcare workers. 209&hyph;212 For this reason, the routine use of gloves has been advocated to help prevent cross-contamination. 213,214 Routine gloving (in addition to gowning) was associated with a decrease in the incidence of nosocomial respiratory-syncytial virus (RSV) 215 and other ICU infections. 216 It should be emphasized, however, that nosocomial pathogens can colonize gloves, 217 and that outbreaks have been traced to healthcare workers who did not change gloves after patient contact. 218 E. Contamination of Devices Used on the Respiratory Tract Devices used on the respiratory tract for respiratory therapy (e.g., nebulizer), diagnostic examination (e.g., bronchoscope or spirometer), and administration of anesthesia are potential reservoirs or vehicles for infectious microorganisms. 62,219&hyph;221 Routes of transmission may be from device to patient, 120,122,221&hyph;230 from one patient to another, or from one body site to the lower respiratory tract of the same patient via hand or device. 220,231,232 Contaminated nebulizer reservoirs can allow the growth of hydrophilic bacteria that may be subsequently aerosolized during device use. 119,122,123,228 Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas spp., Xanthomonas spp., Flavobacterium spp., Legionella spp., and nontuberculous mycobacteria can multiply to substantial concentrations in nebulizer fluid 227,233&hyph;235 and increase the patient's risk of acquiring pneumonia. 120&hyph;123,227,228,236,237
