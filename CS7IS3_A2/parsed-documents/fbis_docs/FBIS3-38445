Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque warned that Tuesday's shelling of the airport was a direct affront to the international community and recalled the recent decision by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to consider air strikes to ensure the reopening of the airport. The airport has been shut down since May 1992. Meanwhile, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana stopped briefly in Split Wednesday on his way to the southern Bosnian town of Medjugorje where he is to meet with the Spanish UN battalion based there. Solana said prior to his departure from Madrid that the Spanish troops would have to be redeployed to new positions in case of NATO air strikes. He added that although the Spanish troops would remain in the former Yugoslavia throughout the winter months, the Spanish Government may reconsider the situation if a peaceful solution to the conflict appears unlikely. "Perhaps after winter we should make an in-depth analysis of the situation with other countries involved and make a decision if a peaceful solution to the conflict has not been reached by then," he said. On Tuesday, the commander of Spanish troops in Bosnia, Colonel Luis Carvajal, said UN peacekeepers would be in danger in case of NATO air strikes as they are ill prepared to respond to any retaliatory attacks and Serb reaction to the strikes would be "unpredictable." Earlier this month, the opposition Popular Party in Spain also demanded the withdrawal of the Spanish troops from Bosnia since it said the situation on the ground there was becoming increasingly dangerous. Spain has 1,180 UN peacekeeping troops deployed in the former Yugoslavia.
