Their little intimate gathering at a business forum in Johannesburg went off well. President de Klerk joked about it, and after his speech he walked up to Mr. Makwetu. The two smiled broadly while shaking hands and posing for BEELD's photographer. They had met earlier in Swaziland. Mr. de Klerk was the speaker at a business forum last night for the magazine ENTERPRISE. Mr. Makwetu had attended the meeting as a member of the magazine's committee. President de Klerk apparently only became aware of Mr. Makwetu's presence in the audience when the announcer said he only wanted to say for the sake of Mr. de Klerk that Mr. Makwetu was also attending the occasion. President de Klerk said this was an indication of the change in the country that the two of them were in the same room. Not so long ago the policy of the PAC had always been that it would not meet President de Klerk in South Africa. In his speech President de Klerk attacked the ANC's [African National Congress] economic policy. He made a strong appeal for an economy based on private entrepreneurship. During question time Mr. Makwetu said he had promised himself he would not ask a question. But he had to put into the correct perspective certain utterances by Mr. de Klerk. He said the ANC's economic policy had not yet been implemented. No one, he said, could therefore say the ANC policy had already failed. Private entrepreneurship had failed through mismanagement. What guarantee was there that free entrepreneurship will not again be mismanaged? President de Klerk said in his reply he was looking forward to interesting discussions with Mr. Makwetu. South Africa did not implement true and full free entrepreneurship. A socialist policy had been applied in most cases, he said. People in the predominantly black audience reacted to his speech with laughter, particularly when he spoke about the National Party's economic policy or when he attacked the ANC. Mr. de Klerk said: "Your laughing is an indication that you are still caught up in the past. "It is a far-reaching experience for me as a white man to say that we have a common fate with black people.
