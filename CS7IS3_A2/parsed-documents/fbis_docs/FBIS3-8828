Updating the situation in Bugojno, Atif Agic says that "the chetniks from Donji Vakuf and Kupres have been shelling the town fiercely since this morning. The army groups from Operative Group West have been resisting all these attacks, and they even launched counterattacks on some parts of the front. As of today it is units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] Army that are in control of Mala Suljaga, where they have also seized one T-55 tank. These good fighters of the B-H Army have inflicted heavy losses on the chetniks in terms of manpower. In retaliation for this morning's defeats, the chetniks have turned their guns on the residential parts of Bugojno. The general alarm has already been sounded several times but the chetnik shells were faster with the result that one civilian has been killed and six wounded so far." As for Gornji Vakuf, he says "the cease-fire between the B-H Army and the HVO is holding surprisingly well." Enes Ratusic reports from the B-H Army 4th Corps that "there have been no serious military activities to violate the cease-fire between the B-H Army and the HVO in the 4th Corps' theater of operations. However, provocations by some extreme HVO individuals and groups have not entirely ceased." He says that "there has been some heavier fire in the northern sector, particularly in the area of (Bijelimici), where the chetniks used tanks against the defensive positions of the B-H Army and civilian targets in the surrounding villages." In his report from the Zvornik front, Nijaz Banjanovic says that "the chetnik artillery fell silent yesterday evening, so last night and this morning have been marked only by the usual small arms fire directed at the defense lines of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade."
