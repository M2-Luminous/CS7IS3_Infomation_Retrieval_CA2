They occupied the road in front of the embassy and denounced the United States for forcing agro-market opening and Kim Yong-sam the puppet for his treacherous compliance, shouting "oppose America forcing market opening" and "oppose Kim Yong-sam's sycophant diplomacy". Upset by the protests of the students, the fascist clique mobilized police to disperse the protesters by force.
