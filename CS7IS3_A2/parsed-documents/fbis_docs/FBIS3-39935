This was announced by Klaus Zwickel, chairman of the IG-Metall trade union, in the event that "the employers do not finally give up their demand for a wage suspension and abolition of the vacation bonus." The strike vote, scheduled for the first week of March, will result in at least 75 percent of IG-Metall members voting for a strike, Zwickel said, speaking to 3,500 members of his trade union at an action day of the IG-Metall district of Lower Saxony in Hannover. More than 1 million metal workers have proved their readiness for strike by staging warning strikes over the past two weeks. The IG-Metall chairman said the employers' plan to abolish the vacation bonus, along with a wage suspension, is "not only socially unacceptable but also economically irresponsible." The trade union does not want a strike, but it is necessary so that it can continue to represent the working people's interests. On Saturday [19 February], the employers of the west German metal and electrical industry warned IG-Metall against a "phantom strike." "One cannot gain employment security through strikes," Dieter Kirchner, the main manager of the Gesamtmetall employers' association, told WELT AM SONNTAG. The trade union wants to ensure employment through shorter working hours. However, working hours are regulated by uncanceled wage contracts. "Therefore, a change in working hours cannot be achieved through strikes," Kirchner stressed. IG-Metall can hold a legally permitted strike only for the canceled wage contracts on wages or the vacation bonus. These, however, are precisely the topics of a "small solution" that the employers have suggested. But IG-Metall does not want that, because this would not cover employment security. However, employment security can be achieved only through negotiations. Therefore, a strike would not be just an economic disaster. It must also "end in a disaster for IG-Metall, because it leads the striking people into battle for the wrong goals," Kirchner said. Kirchner does not believe that negotiations will still be held on a peaceful settlement of the wage conflict. In an interview with BILD AM SONNTAG Zwickel said a strike could still be prevented "if the employers' association makes a concrete offer for negotiations worthy of discussion." IG-Metall must pay 41 million marks for 100,000 striking people per week. "If we are forced to do so, we can hold out for weeks." Tomorrow IG-Metall leaders will decide on motions of the 14 wage districts concerning a failure of the current negotiations and the holding of strike votes. A strike in the west German metal and electrical industry, which has 3.6 million working people, could begin in March. The last big strike in the west German metal industry took place 10 years ago for the gradual introduction of the 35-hour work week. In his speech in Hannover, Juergen Peters, Lower Saxony's IG-Metall district chairman, threatened employers that the metal workers' patience has reached its limit. According to him, the wage contract is not "the nation's piggy-bank." Lower Saxony's Minister President Gerhard Schroeder (Social Democratic Party of Germany) appealed to the employers' reason: "Do not force IG-Metall to strike; this is something our economy does not need." The Social Democratic politician expressed the hope that a strike can still be avoided through reason.
