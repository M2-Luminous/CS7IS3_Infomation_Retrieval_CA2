Juergen Schrempp, the chairman of the board of the German Aerospace Company (DASA) in Munich leaves no doubt that further cuts in the military procurement budget will seriously jeopardize the existence of the defense technology industry in the aerospace branch and once again place thousands of jobs at risk. He said that DASA defense technology operations have already been cut back about 60 percent since 1990 and the workforce has been reduced from 16,000 to 9,000. Now many business sectors are already facing a "subcritical size." "After a certain point we can no longer maintain development and production capacities," Schrempp said. In some business sectors this point will be reached if the Defense Ministry actually cuts back the procurement budget, as planned, for 1994 from about DM8 billion this year to only DM5.1 billion. Since 1990 this budget has already been cut back 60 percent from DM18 billion. But not only is it raining in on the defense technology division of the Daimler-Benz Company subsidiary in Stuttgart; the weak aircraft market and Bonn's policy of support for civil aircraft is making it hard for the aviation division to manage. Schrempp reported that an agreement concluded by the government with the United States two years ago enables the aviation division to continue to obtain indirect support through government contracts, but it reduces the direct support for development of from 80 to 90 percent of development costs that used to be customary in Germany by two-thirds. Indirect aid to compensate for this loss is not available here at all. Moreover, the existing already small appropriation in the budget for aviation of DM60 million for new projects has recently been cut back to DM16 million for 1994. "And this," Schrempp said, "after CDU [Christian Democratic Union], CSU [Christian Social Union], and SPD [Socialist Party of Germany] politicians had shortly before admitted that there had been omissions as far as the aerospace industry is concerned and promised to provide political aid for it." Schrempp stressed the fact that the six plant closures announced in October and the reduction of personnel by a total of 16,000 to 70,000 is the minimum that is necessary under the present circumstances. He admitted that they should actually have begun to settle the matter of the all in all 52 plants (in connection with the merger with MBB [Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm Company]) sooner. Another two plants, among them the one in Dresden with 600 employees, are seriously endangered. As additionally, reported, the personnel measures planned up to now alone will cost DASA about DM800 million for social contribution plans and compensation in 1993. The consequence of the unpleasant basic conditions will not be that DASA no longer operates in the field of aerospace, Schrempp said, "but we don't know whether we'll still be operating in Germany." Even now many operations are only possible in connection with joint ventures--most of them with the French Aerospatiale. The following joint ventures and eliminations are planned: - The whole guided missile division will be moved to the joint subsidiary, Euromissile (with Aerospatiale) with its main office in Frankfurt. - The satellite division, which accounts for about 50 percent of DASA's space operations (2,000 employees), is to be brought into a joint venture (Eurosatellite) with Aerospatiale, probably with a German main office. - There is also talk of German-French cooperation on military satellites. - The 18-seat Dornier 228 propellor aircraft is being discontinued and is to be built only in China under license. - The new 30-seat Dornier 328 will in the long run also be brought into a European joint venture. - DASA subsidiary MTU [Motor and Turbine Union, Inc.] in Friedrichshafen (diesel engines) is to be transferred to AEG [General Power Company]. - DASA is withdrawing to a minority holding in microelectronics subsidiary Temic [Telefunken Microelectronics] (50 percent held by DASA and 50 percent by AEG).
