FR940707-2-00043 FR940707-2-00021 NorAm states that this application is being filed, under protest, in compliance with the Commission's May 27, 1994, order in Arkla Gathering Services Company, Docket No. CP94&hyph;36&hyph;000 and that the abandonment would not adversely affect NorAm's ability to continue to render certificated transportation services to its customers or its ability to meet fully its obligations under Order No. 636. NorAm also states that these facilities are gathering facilities but had been erroneously reported in NorAm's predecessors' year-end budgetary certificate reports, in spite of the fact that the facilities were not constructed under those budget-type certificates. Comment date: July 20, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 4. National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation [Docket No. CP94&hyph;629&hyph;000] Take notice that on June 24, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;629&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate a delivery point to provide service to an existing firm transportation customer, National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution), under National's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;4&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. National proposes to construct and operate a permanent delivery point on National's Line R&hyph;24 in Cattaraugus County, New York. National states that on June 20, 1994, Distribution began receiving emergency transportation service from National at this delivery point in order to maintain service to 300 customers who were in danger of losing service because Distribution had sustained a line hit on its Old Line R. National further states that Distribution then asked National to establish a permanent delivery point to Distribution from National's Line R&hyph;24 in Cattaraugus County, New York. It is stated that the total volumes to be delivered to Distribution will be 69,000 Mcf annually. It is further stated that Distribution constructed the necessary facilities at its expense to establish the new delivery point; therefore, National will incur no costs as a result of establishing the delivery point. Comment date: August 15, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs F.

If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing. G.
