The DPRK renewed its appeal after the United States accused the DPRK of "violating the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement" by creating a Korean People's Army (KPA) Mission to replace the DPRK's delegation to the Military Armistice Commission. "The U.S. side is well advised to choose to establish a new peace arrangement whereby the danger of war can be prevented and peace and security definitely guaranteed, instead of trying to revive the armistice mechanism whose function has been completely paralyzed by it," a spokesman for the KPA Mission said. On April 28, the DPRK issued a statement through its Foreign Ministry proposing the establishment of a new peace mechanism to replace the existing Military Armistice Commission (MAC), but the proposal was rejected by the United States. In late May, the DPRK recalled all the representatives of the KPA from the MAC and set up a KPA Mission at Panmunjom responsible for contact with American and South Korean military authorities. Earlier this month, a meeting of MAC secretaries was proposed by the United States, and the DPRK sent delegates to the meeting under the name of the KPA Mission. In response, the U.S. read a statement at the conference hall calling the DPRK's act a "violation of the armistice agreement." In today's statement the spokesman said, "The establishment of the KPA Mission at Panmunjom was a realistic and timely step taken to tide over the present situation in which the armistice agreement had been reduced to a mere sheet of paper and the MAC remained only in name due to the unreasonable behavior of the U.S. side." He also charged that because of the "query by the U.S. side," both the MAC and the neutral nations supervisory commission exist in name only, with no role to play. "Whether the U.S. accepts our new proposal or not is a touchstone for the fundamental question of war or peace," the spokesman said in the statement, released by the DPRK's official news agency, KCNA. The DPRK and Western countries have been locked in controversy over the DPRK's nuclear program. The DPRK says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only while Western countries, particularly the United States, have suspected the DPRK of trying to divert nuclear materials for other purposes. Today in Seoul, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, in a phone conversation with President Clinton, reiterated his country's policy of close cooperation with the United States in handling the nuclear issue. The U.S.and South Korea are attempting to seek U.N. sanctions against the DPRK, which has warned that imposition of sanctions would be considered as an act of war. On Thursday [9 June], former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said he and his wife will visit both the DPRK and South Korea next week as private citizens and that he hopes to discuss "important issues of the day with leaders." "The initiative for this trip has been from Korea, not Washington, and I will have no official status relating to the U.S. Government," Carter said.
