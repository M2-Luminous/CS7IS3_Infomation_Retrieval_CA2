Addressing on Thursday a meeting in Vitebsk with regional law-enforcement officers, the parliament chairman came out in favour of rebuilding a single industrial, energy, market and trade space with Russia, as well as of a single monetary system based on the Russian rouble. Hryb noted that Russia was the main supplier of energy resources and of a great variety of component parts for the Belarusian economy. When asked whether there was any alternative to a treaty with Russia, the speaker said: "First, we could agree to lift all customs barriers and duties, and then go ahead with further moves, bearing in mind that both economic and political sovereignty of the Belarusian state should be kept intact. This means that the Belarusian budget should by no means merge with that of Russia, nor the Republic's national bank can be absorbed," Hryb stressed.
