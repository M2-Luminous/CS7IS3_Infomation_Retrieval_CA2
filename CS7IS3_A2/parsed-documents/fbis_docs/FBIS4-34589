The report states that "five years after Law 1008" (the Repentance Law) "was implemented, the state and society have hardly benefited from the confiscated goods of millionaires, which because of inadequate government policy get lost irretrievably." Pando comments that "Law No. 1008 authorizes drug enforcement authorities to confiscate assets and investigate the origins of dubious fortunes, and in a few years has allowed the confiscation of mansions, farms, vehicles, aircraft, property, jewelry, and money worth more than $50 million, but unfortunately most of these goods have been stolen or misused." The report then notes that Santa Cruz District Attorney Francisco Borestein commented not long ago that the assets seized from drug traffickers were misused, and that there were questions as to how the large sums of money seized from drug traffickers have been used. He also said that many assets had disappeared, such as was the case with several vehicles, because of poor administration. The report then mentions Government Minister German Quiroga as having noted that the money seized from drug traffickers is placed into the hands of judicial authorities, while not long ago Attorney Ives Padilla said that the Office of the Attorney General is not in charge of administering and guarding confiscated assets because the Office of Confiscated Assets does that. After describing several cases in which public servants misused the assets confiscated from drug traffickers, the report mentions that according to recent information there are 214 confiscated vehicles and some 100 houses in Santa Cruz alone that run the risk of deteriorating or being looted by public servants.
