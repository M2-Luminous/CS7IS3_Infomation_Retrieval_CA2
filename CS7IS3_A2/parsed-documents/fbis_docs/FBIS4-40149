In an airport press conference prior to his departure for a local tour, Yeltsin said, "If North Korea tries to push ahead with its withdrawal from the NPT, Russia would convene an emergency international meeting and agree to phased sanctions against Pyongyang." He said he had a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday on the North Korean nuclear question and Korean situation. Russian televisions and radios reported that in their telephone talks, it was agreed that President Yeltsin would make an official visit to the United States in coming autumn. One of the major topics of the Yeltsin-Clinton meeting would be the North Korean nuclear question in addition to the issue of bilateral economic cooperation, they said. Meanwhile, an ITAR-TASS report said a senior Chinese Defense Ministry official on Monday gave a strong-worded message to Choe Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean People's Army, that North Korea should not depart from its being a non-nuclear country.
