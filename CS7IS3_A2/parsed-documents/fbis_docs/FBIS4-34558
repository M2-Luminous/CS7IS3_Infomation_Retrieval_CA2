Two Haitian deputies, including legislators from the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti and from the socialist group contacted by the Heritage Foundation, arrived in Washington on 19 June to meet U.S. democratic and republican congressmen. Haitian Deputies Duly Brutus and Datus Milcent will return to Port-au-Prince on 23 June. A Chamber of Deputies Office press release asks other legislators not to travel abroad in the interest of reserving, for the legislature, those decisions that only the legislature can make. It should be noted that recently, legislators denounced the authorities banning about 15 deputies from leaving Port-au-Prince airport, which the Chamber Office has denied. Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde explains: [Monde] The Heritage Foundation invited me and Deputy Duly Brutus to Washington for a five-day visit to improve their view and assessment of the Haitian crisis. My departure alarmed some deputies and politicians, so I stayed and sent Deputy Datus Milcent in my place. The meetings began this morning. Meetings with the Heritage Foundation and with democratic and republican legislators have been fruitful. [Jean] What is the Heritage Foundation? [Monde] A very conservative group, along the lines of the Center for Democracy. The Heritage Foundation is conservative and oriented toward the Republicans, while the Center for Democracy is oriented toward the Democrats. The Foundation has a very solid U.S. foreign policy reputation. It supports a better approach to the Haitian crisis. [Jean] So you think that the Chamber of Deputies has been represented fairly? Do you think that this delegation represents all of the factions? It does not include any National Front for Change and Democracy members. [Monde] The Chamber sends delegations for different reasons. The Chamber would normally send a delegation representing the various factions. In this case, Deputies Frantz Robert Monde and Duly Brutus received personal invitations. There is a big difference. It would not have been diplomatic for me to receive an invitation and then invite someone else. The deputies know this for they encounter the same thing. If they invite one deputy, another cannot tag along. That is not done. [Jean] What do you expect from these negotiations? Do you think they can influence the political juncture? [Monde] They are meeting high-level people. They will meet three former U.S. secretaries of state, people at Warren Christopher's level. They will meet some current and former U.S. congressmen. It is best to wait for the two deputies to return. We will not find a solution on the streets. The two deputies are competent and able. They are of good faith. They want to solve the crisis and to find an honorable solution for all the parties in the crisis. That is why they went. In particular, they will defend against those Americans who think they can intervene in Haiti.
