FR941202-0-00126 FR941202-0-00012 FHWA conducted a one-time special field study of compliance reports. In general compliance investigations of 4,967 interstate motor carrier drug testing programs in the first six months of FY 1993, 28,250 random tests were conducted. There were 878 verified positive results (3.11 percent). The audits represent less than 2 percent of the motor carriers subject to the FHWA rule. The FHWA selects interstate motor carriers for general safety rule compliance investigations by factors such as a safety rating or prior compliance problem. These compliance investigations do not offer scientific, statistically unbiased sampling methods. U.S. DOT Employees In the Department's federal employee testing program, the random testing rate of at least 50 percent was phased-in from 25 percent to 50 percent over the first year of the program and achieved at the end of FY 1988. A testing rate of at least 50 percent was maintained in FY 1989&hyph;1991. In FY 1992, the figures include testing over the first five months with a rate of at least 50 percent, followed by seven months of testing with a rate of at least 25 percent. FY 1993 figures reflect a full year of testing at 25 percent. The following table summarizes DOT federal employee random testing data. ␣ 1␣ 1FY88 1FY89 1FY90 1FY91 1FY92 1FY93 Total Number of Random Tests 5,047 17,926 19,103 18,671 12,454 9,433 Number of Positives 42 92 43 40 39 24 Percent Positive 0.83 0.51 0.23 0.21 0.31 0.25 As noted earlier, the USCG has been conducting random drug tests on its active duty and reserve uniformed personnel. Rather than setting a specific testing rate as a requirement at the beginning of the fiscal year, the USCG conducts the maximum number of tests possible from the funds that are appropriated. The percentage of positive results for random tests in each fiscal year and the approximate testing rate is as follows: ␣ 1␣ 11987 11988 11989 11990 11991 11992 11993 Percent Positive 1.57% 1.31% 0.68% 0.41% 0.41% 0.78% 0.75% Testing Rate 120% 95% 95% 95% 85% 85% 80% The Final Rule The final rule adopts the NPRM with one change. It provides that the Administrator or the Commandant may lower the minimum random drug testing rate to 25 percent if the industry-wide (e.g., aviation, rail) random positive rate is less than 1.0 percent (including refusals to be tested) for 2 consecutive calendar years while testing at 50 percent. The rate will return to 50 percent if the industry random positive rate is 1.0 percent or higher in any subsequent calendar year. The only change is a one-time adjustment for the two industries that have not yet fully implemented random drug testing. Under this provision, the FTA and/or FHWA Administrators may allow the testing rate for their regulated industry to be lowered based on 1995 and 1996 data from those entities required to report. The FTA Administrator will not have to wait until he has the first 2 years of data from small transit operators and the FHWA Administrator will not have to wait until he has the first two years of data from small intrastate motor carriers and motor coach operations before they can possibly lower the rate as proposed in the NPRM. Many of these decisions mirror the reasoning we used in the final rules concerning alcohol testing that were published on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7302).
