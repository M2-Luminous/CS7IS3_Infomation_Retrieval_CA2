This was confirmed on 7 April by Ayrton Cauby, the CNEN's Licensing and Control superintendent. He indicated that the United Nations has specific resources to help developing countries like Brazil to resolve their atomic waste problems. When dismantled, the plant itself will be stored in the silo. The atomic waste produced in the Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo axis will also be stored there. The Angra-1 reactor will remain in the Angra nuclear complex, wrapped in special layers of concrete. Cauby reported that experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- based in Vienna, Austria -- will visit Brazil in May to help choose the site for the silo. He said the CNEN also asked the IAEA for financial help. It released $100,000 (98.5 million cruzeiros) for the initial work that will be carried out in 1994 and 1995. Cauby said the CNEN's top priority is to develop the subterranean silo, which will not be constructed in Angra dos Reis (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro State]. He said: ``IAEA experts and technicians will choose the site for the silo to store the waste produced in Sao Paulo.''
