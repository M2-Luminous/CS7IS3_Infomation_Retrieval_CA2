The problem is staggering 3.5 millions housing units needed just to catch up with the backlog. Over 5 million people in misery in urban squatter camps and informal settlements, their numbers rising by over 200,000 a year; thousands more in unacceptable urban hostels; an unknown number in farm and rural slums. This is not something to be dealt with in some vote-catching `number contest', like that recently unveiled -- and then withdrawn -- by the NP [National Party] and Minister Shills. Housing the homeless will be one of the most critical challenges the new government will face. The ANC [African National Congress] in government will give it an urgent priority. An immediate start will have to be made on it as soon as the new government is formed. The framework of the ANC policy is clear. It rests on the ANC belief that all South Africans have a right to decent and affordable housing; that government must take on the responsibility of directing the management of the available financial, manpower and material resources in order to translate that right into actual homes. The programme we have adopted is also staggering. It proposes to speed up house building vastly so as to provide 1 million houses within the first five years; to achieve an annual rate of building of 350,000 houses a year, (compared with the NP government's record figure of 50,000 in 1992). That scale of action will provide affordable for low income families in town and country. It will break the backlog of homelessness and hostel squalor within ten years. No one should underestimate the magnitude of that task. But can it be done? We are confident that, with the ANC in the driving seat of government, it can. Our programme is not simply a set of aims. It is a realistic statement of the state action that will be taken during the early days of an ANC government. We propose to set up a single national housing department to replace the wasteful 14 departments left behind by the NP government. We propose to commit greatly increased funds to the housing programme, rising to 5 percent of the state budget with five years. We propose to challenge private financial institutions to match the state contribution of R[rand]50 billion over ten years, the funds to be vested in a housing finance bank which will co- ordinate housing subsidies and home loan guarantees. We will ensure that the available funds are used to meet national priorities, namely: (a) the provision of affordable public and subsidised housing together with a rented sector, especially for low-income families in town and country; (b) a thorough programme of reconstruction of urban hostels into acceptable standard family or single-person homes; (c) the upgrading of existing subsidised housing to meet agreed national minimum standards of construction and service provision. We will seek to persuade employers and trade unions to plan the provision of housing for their own employees, in reasonable proximity to the workplace. We will explore the possibilities of providing tax or other financial incentives to encourage acceptable schemes. In accordance with our overall democratic approach, we will strip away the existing covers of secrecy and confidentiality which should housing policies. We will insist on full public disclosure by all housing bodies of all information relating to plans and decisions; that policy making is open and transparent; that all housing organisations are publicly accountable for their actions; and that proper arrangements are made for public participation in policy planning at all levels. This will apply, inter alia, to the setting of minimum constructional standards, the selection of sites and appropriate services for new housing, the overall planning of housing schemes, the allocation of funds to both public and private sector schemes. We will ensure that the national priorities in other fields are taken fully into account in housing matters. Accordingly, wherever financial parameters can be maintained, we will insist that preference be given to labour intensive schemes in order to put the jobless back to work; and that preference in allotting contracts is given to small contractors and suppliers in order to redress past discrimination in favour of big business and white entrepreneurs. These are the basic elements of the ANC programme. It has been developed with inputs from many other organisations which are co-ordinated within the National Housing Forum. At this time it is possible that in that forum further specific propositions may emerge which will be incorporated in our actual programme in government. It is not yet clear which aspects of delivery and execution of a national housing programme will finally be devolved to regional or provincial government structures. But this statement sets out the ANC national programme. It will form the guidelines and set the parameters for all ANC members in public office at any level of the administration.
