This position, adopted by the Cameroonian Government, was clearly made known to the Nigerian delegation which visited Yaounde. As Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono put it, Cameroon expects Nigeria to make a goodwill gesture. His Nigerian counterpart, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, replied that there are various other goodwill gestures apart from troop withdrawal. President Paul Biya, clearly irritated by Nigeria's attitude, refused to meet Alhaji Kingibe during his visit to Yaounde. It is difficult, under these circumstances, to speak of any meeting whatsoever between the two heads of state. The conditions laid down by President Paul Biya for such a meeting is the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the Bakassi Peninsula. This is what Augustin Kouomegni, the Cameroonian minister in charge of communication told Raphael Mbadinga. [Begin recording] [Kouomegni] The Cameroonian head of state has said that he is prepared to meet the Nigerian head of state in Maiduguri, Nigeria, if Nigeria makes a goodwill gesture by withdrawing its troops from the Bakassi Peninsula. If the Nigerians do not comply with this prerequisite, he is still prepared to meet the Nigerian leader in a neutral country. The head of state and the Cameroonian diplomacy think Cameroonians would find it hard to understand that the president would visit Nigeria as if it were canossa [a place of submission] when Nigerian troops have occupied Cameroon. [Mbadinga] If Nigerians withdrew from Cameroonian territory now, what point would there be for President Biya and General Sani Abacha to hold a meeting? [Kouomegni] The meeting would enable them to tackle all the border problems between Nigeria and Cameroon because we share borders of about 1,600 km. There are problems and disagreements here and there. The two heads of state could, therefore, use the opportunity to find lasting solutions to these border problems, which run from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Chad. [end recording]
