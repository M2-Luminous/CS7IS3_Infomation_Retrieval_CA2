His priorities: to restore operational balance by the end of 1994, and to boost the manufacturer's sales. Jean-Marie Descarpentries, who was appointed Bull's chief executive officer [CEO] a little over 30 days ago, decided to reorganize Bull's operations in 12 divisions (see chart): seven for products and services, four for sales (organized in regional networks), and one for the group's industrial operations. Each division is responsible for its results worldwide and in charge of the partnerships required for its development. As a result of this rationalization of operations, research and development, and probably marketing and communications as well, will be split among the various entities. The new structure still has to be ratified by customers who, among other things, wish to deal with a single entity. The reorganization also separates Bull's various service activities, which has the advantage of making it easier to sell some high technology activities (such as artificial intelligence [AI], electronic data interchange [EDI], and micropackaging) or to assign them to future subsidiaries. The sale of Bull's in-house print shop is also being considered, as are the creation of a financial company and that of a logistics subsidiary. In singular contrast with his predecessor's style, the new CEO has engaged in psychological warfare with the market to persuade his customers that Bull is going to change. Never mind that Bull's reorganization project had been in the making for several months already: it now bears the Descarpentries imprint. "Daring to change Bull," such is the management's new motto, and to prove that they mean business they put forward the men who will effect the change. Actually, these are the same men as before, except for Thierry Breton who was appointed special advisor to the president, in charge of strategy, and head of the FM [facilities management] branch. An odd appointment, considering that he is also advisor to Alain Madelin, the minister of business and economic development! The group's new executive committee, renamed Bull Executive Board (BEB) for the occasion, will expand from nine to 11 members. Besides Thierry Breton, the newcomers include Alain Couder, Charles Dehelly, and Herve Hannebicque; Albert Levy-Soussan and Jacques Weber are leaving, the latter being appointed to the strategy department. The "commando" men will be supported by the Bull Operating Council (BOC), an advisory board consisting of up to 100 members, to be appointed on 26 November. This energy concentrate is expected to meet Jean-Marie Descarpentries' two challenges: to restore operational balance by the end of 1994, and to boost sales. In view of Bull's result for the first half of 1993 (1.98 billion francs [Fr] in net losses), this is a tall order, and one that will require overhauling the company's financial structure. Thus, around mid-December, Bull is expected to call in some capital in order to reduce its debt from Fr9.45 billion to Fr2.44 billion. Although the State and France Telecom promised to pay respectively Fr8.6 billion and Fr2.5 billion, the other two shareholders, NEC and IBM, reserved their decision until the end of the year. According to the NIHON KENZAI SHIMBUM, Bull asked NEC to increase its participation (currently 4.4 percent). The information was not confirmed. For the time being, the Bull CEO, who swore to improve the workforce productivity ratio (sales per employee amounted to Fr850,000 in 1992), will have to tackle layoffs and cost cutting. The management, which counted a net balance of 992 departure under its 1993 "employment plan," will not cancel the 2,850 layoffs planned in France by Bernard Pache; the program was implemented on 22 November. In addition, Jean-Bernard Pinatel (a member of the Bull Operating Council) was asked to prepare a plan to reduce non-wage costs.
