The unit has been functioning normally. The Daguangba water conservancy and hydropower hub project, located on the mainstream of the Changhua Jiang in Dongfang County in western Hainan Province, will be used for power, irrigation, flood control and tourism, and will generate 520 million kWh per year, irrigate 995,000 mu of land, and will have a 1.7 billion cubic meter reservoir. When completed, this project will alleviate the electric power bottleneck on Hainan, and will have great significance for the economic development of western Hainan. Although the installed capacity and output of this project will be in the lower range of large-size plants, its construction will provide valuable experience in terms of new technology in design and construction.
