FR940104-2-00100 FR940104-2-00057 (9) (10 points) The effectiveness of the applicant's strategy to provide assistance to Federally-designated empowerment zones and enterprise communities. In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's proposal addresses the following: (a) Identifies the empowerment zone or zones and enterprise communities it will serve; (b) delineates how it will help such zones and communities develop the required strategic plans; (c) outlines a clear program to help implement such plans; and (d) outlines an agenda to review effectiveness of such plans and their implementation and provides methods to overcome impediments. B. Selection Process Applications for funding under this NOFA will be evaluated competitively and points will be awarded as specified in the Rating Factors section described above. After assigning points based upon the factors all applications will be listed in rank order. Applications will then be funded in rank order until all available funds have been expended. However, in order to be funded, an applicant must receive a minimum score of 70. HUD reserves the right to fund all or portions of the proposed activities identified in each application, based upon the eligibility of the proposed activities. If two or more applications have the same number of points, the application with the most points for rating factor (8) shall be selected. If there is still a tie, the application with the most points for rating factor (7) shall be selected. If the amount of funds remaining after funding as many of the highest ranking applications as possible is insufficient for the next highest ranking application, HUD shall determine (based upon the proposed activities) if it is feasible to fund part of the application and offer a smaller grant to the applicant. If HUD determines that given the proposed activities a smaller grant amount would make the activities infeasible, or if the applicant turns down the reduced grant amount, HUD shall make the same determination for the next highest ranking application until all applications within the competitive range have been exhausted or available funds have been expended. If HUD receives an insufficient number of applications to expend all funds, or if funds remain after HUD approves all approvable applications, HUD may negotiate increased amounts of grant awards up to an additional $250,000. Increased grants will be offered in rank order to applicants in the competitive range. C. Geographic Distribution HUD reserves the right to make selections out of rank order to provide for a geographic distribution of funded centers. The geographic balance that HUD will use, if it decides to implement this option, will be based on a combination of two adjacent standard Federal regions (e.g., Southwest and Southeast Regions, Great Plains and Midwest Regions, etc.) If the rank order does not yield at least one fundable center within each two region combination, then HUD may select the highest ranking application from such a combination, as long as the minimum score of 70 is achieved. It is HUD's intent to fund at least one COPC that serves the colonias, as defined by section 916(d) of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act, as long as the applicant receives a minimum score of 70. It is HUD's intent to give preference to COPCs that serve Federally-designated empowerment zones or enterprise communities, as long as the applicant receives a minimum score of 70. III. Application Process A. Obtaining Applications Requests for an application kit (Request for Grant Application, RFGA), must be in writing to the Processing and Control Branch, Office of Community Planning and Development, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., room 7255, Washington, DC 20410.

The application deadline is firm as to date, hour and place. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems.
