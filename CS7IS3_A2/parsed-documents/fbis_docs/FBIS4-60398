In a statement, a copy of which was received by KUNA, the Embassy expresses "Kuwait's rejection of the attempt to link Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's tour and the message which the head of the Iraqi regime sent to the Algerian president." [passage omitted] The Embassy statement affirms that relations between the State of Kuwait and the Iraqi regime are ruled by international legal resolutions which Iraq must observe, instead of making open attempts to contain them and evade implementing them.
