He added, ``Nevertheless, our Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is a source of pride for our country, because it has shown enough results to prove that it is the best of the continent despite its technological limitations.'' Quiroga explained that there are some signs that the Cali cartel and other Colombian cartels are branching into Bolivia because of the pressure they are under in their own country. ``Because of the severe pressure they are under in Colombia, the cartels are moving into certain areas of the Chapare region. Bolivian intelligence services are evaluating this situation,'' the minister said. Quiroga added that the two large drug rings discovered in Bolivia this year, namely the Gutierrez affair in Santa Cruz and the Ferreira family in Cochabamba, indicate that there are connections with Colombian drug cartels. ``We hope that these people do not actually come down here, and if it does happen we will try to stop them,'' Quiroga added. According to Minister Quiroga the Chapare region in Cochabamba is divided into five areas which are full of coca plantations, way above the amount allowed for supplying the traditional use of coca leaves. In view of this Bolivia has made it clear to Edward Casey, U.S. assistant secretary of state for South American affairs, that it proposes to implement a policy of eradication taking into account the economic aspect of the issue. ``Unless we are able to find an economic solution to the resulting loss of income for the coca farmers there is very little we can do to move forward. Therefore, an aggressive policy of industrialization must be devised to foster crop substitution in the region,'' Quiroga said. He reiterated that approximately 90 percent of Chapare coca plantations are used to supply drug traffickers. Minister Quiroga stated that alternative development projects have made significant headway because otherwise coca cultivation would have experienced an impressive growth. ``Initial steps have been taken, and within the framework of the reorganization of the executive branch and of the rules and regulations on the duties of each ministry, the Alternative Development Fund has been restructured, establishing a board which has representatives from Chapare and Yungas,'' he added. The idea is to work together with this fund in order to implement eradication policies together with alternative development projects, an approach which is different from interdiction.
