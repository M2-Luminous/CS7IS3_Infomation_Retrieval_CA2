Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Duma, is heading the visit. The Russian delegation arrived in Beijing at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The visit is being carried out within the framework of the accords on the development of all-round ties between the two neighboring states--reached during the visit to China by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin in December 1992. In an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent at Shoudu airport, Rybkin said: "The purpose of the visit by the delegation from the State Duma is to promote the development of good relations at the executive level, as well as to promote legislative authority in the two great neighbors. Everything must be done to strengthen constructive cooperation between the State Duma and the Federation Council of Russia and the National People's Congress. There is enormous potential for cooperation between the two friendly states." The representative delegation of the State Duma will hold talks with (?Qiao Shi), chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and will familiarize itself with the law-making work of the PRC's supreme body of state authority in conditions of the transition to the market, while Chinese economic reform is in progress. It is expected that the Russian delegation, the members of which include representatives of practically all parliamentary factions, will be received by President Jiang Zemin and Li (?Lanquing), deputy premier of the PRC State Council. The delegation is scheduled to make a trip to Shanghai, as well as to the special economic zone at Shenzhen, in southern China. That is the site of an experimental laboratory for Chinese reforms and the policy of openness. The itinerary includes meetings and conversations with the heads of the national congresses of Shanghai and Shenzhen, visits to industrial and agricultural enterprises, trade and economic complexes, and familiarization with the work of the local bodies of state authority.
