"However, I have no idea about the composition of the planned international conference such as whether Indonesia will host it or not," Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said following the meeting between the two heads of state at Merdeka Palace here. Both leaders also agreed to open diplomatic relations but no decision was made on whether embassies will be established in Jakarta and Sarajevo. Arriving here on Tuesday, Izetbegovic will leave for India Wednesday to explain the latest situation in the embattled Bosnia. Suharto, as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), has asked the Indonesian ambassador to the United Nations in New York to contact the NAM Coordinating Bureau there about the possibility of holding the conference, said Murdiono. Izetbegovic called for an international conference to replace the Geneva talks which has so far failed to settle the crisis in Bosnia. According to Murdiono, Suharto welcomed Izetbegovic's effort to try to lift the UN arms embargo on Bosnia who is less equipped than the more militarily powerful Serbia and Croatia. "The president as NAM chairman will urge the world to treat Bosnia fairly in its fight against much stronger enemies," said Murdiono, adding that Suharto had expressed his support for the lifting of the embargo. Over 200,000 Bosnian Muslims have been killed and millions more expelled since Serb and Croatian aggressors occupied Bosnia. About 70 percent of Bosnia is now in the hands of its enemies. Izetbegovic said the ending of the embargo was necessary to balance the military strengths of all warring parties. A military balance is expected to help lead to peace. He also suggested an air strike on Serbia in a bid to pressure them into considering peace. "A combination of force and negotiations is necessary to stop the war," he said, adding that all forms of talks so far had focussed on Bosnia relinquishing parts of its territory. "But we cannot accept unjust division of our country," the Bosnian president argued. The UN Security Council mainly dominated by the United States, France, Britain, Russia, and China has issued 30 resolutions on the Bosnian war. However, none of them have been implemented accept the arms embargo. Commenting on the planned withdrawal of UN forces from Bosnia, Izetbegovic said it would create more difficulty in keeping peace. "If Europe wants to pull out some of its troops, then the United Nations should allow other non-European countries to replace them," he added. European officials recently reviewed the UN presence in Bosnia and UN sources in Sarajevo confirmed that plans to withdraw the peacekeepers and aid workers are underway. Turkey and Iran have offered to send troops to help Bosnia Muslims but the United Nations refused the proposal without providing an explanation. Before leaving Jakarta, the Bosnian delegation received U.S.$70,000 worth of humanitarian aid from the Indonesian Solidarity Committee for Bosnian Muslims. Also included in the package were 450 grams of gold and watches, and a cheque worth U.S. $24,600 from the Irsyad al-Islamiyyah religious association. Chairman of the Solidarity Committee Geys M. Amar explained that the gifts were spontaneous donations collected at mosques from Muslims all over the country.
