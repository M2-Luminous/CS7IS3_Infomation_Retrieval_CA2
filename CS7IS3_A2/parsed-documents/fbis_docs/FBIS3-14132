The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was signed by 114 nations on 15 December. Following that the Islamic Republic of Iran's membership in GATT has been seriously considered by our nation's policymakers and officials. Conflicting views and explanations have been presented on this matter. Firuz Dowlatabadi, the Foreign Ministry's economic adviser and chief of its Office of Economic and Strategic Coordination, gave an interview to our correspondent in which he presented his views on this matter, the details of which are presented for you below: The foreign minister's economic adviser discussed the effects and consequences of joining GATT. He said: International economic organizations cannot actually be evaluated on the basis of whether joining them has benefits or disadvantages. International organizations, especially international economic organizations, are formed on the basis of a win-win strategy. Therefore, consensus is a principle in these organizations, and without a consensus their decisions are not implemented. Dowlatabadi said: Membership in these organizations basically faces the profitability of the economic system of each country, and Iran will not be harmed by joining these organizations in the way that is being mentioned. However, one must assess the level of relative advantages in Iran and other nations of our country's steadfastness and determination and the level of the relative advantages that are in general unavailable to us and are available to the other member nations. What will the future of their behavior be towards us in accordance with the government's policies, whether financial, monetary, foreign exchange or in commercial policy, and how far behind are we in this matter, or how far ahead of them are we? The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and Strategic Cooperation emphasized: This kind of assesment is the basis for our estimate of the benefits or disadvantages to GATT membership. It is really improper for us to ask whether we will profit or lose by joining GATT, or to ask in what areas we will profit and in what areas we will lose. He said: Because our assessment of GATT membership has been mistaken, despite the fact that the question of joining GATT has been under discussion continuously for almost 20 years (since the time before the revolution), no suitable conclusion has been reached. The foreign minister's economic adviser noted: In international relations, if a country has the power to provide expert counsel and if it has more political and economic capacity, due to the fact that it has more factors for limiting trade, it will in turn make more profit. He noted: One reason we have not gotten the necessary prerogatives to match the nation's political capacity in economic negotiations is our weak foundation of expert knowledge (consultative). Our expert system does not have the necessary capacity. Because negotiations do not take place at the level of ministers, deputy ministers or general managers, the weakness of expert knowledge has kept us from having the power to do the necessary bargaining, and has prevented us from having the ability to make use of negotiations. The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and Strategic Cooperation added: Of course, GATT membership cannot be proposed as a means of overcoming this deficiency, but to compensate for this problem an acceptable level of privileges must be designated for the experts who participate in the negotiations, and they must not be allowed to depart from this framework. He said: During the process of joining, very close and active cooperation must exist between the legislative and executive powers. With support from the law makers we can make the process of joining GATT lawful. The foreign minister's economic adviser was asked whether there are obstacles to GATT membership in the Constitution. He said: There is no obstacle to GATT membership in the Constitution. Of course, support for some goods is provided in the Constitution and prohibitions are given on imports of some goods, and in this regard it is necessary to have cooperation between the legislative and executive powers. For example, the level of the Majles's willingness to support industries in this year's budget law was such that the Majles added 10 percent to the taxes on imported vehicles. He added: We will not be able to do this at this rate in the budget law if we join GATT, and if we join GATT any increase in tariffs will have to be done through negotiations with other members. Dowlatabadi was asked whether aggressor foreign countries would become active in our country's banking and service affairs in the event of our GATT membership. He said: If we become a member, foreign banks will not necessarily become active in our country. There are many countries, such as Pakistan and Malaysia, where foreign banks cannot operate despite the fact that those countries are GATT members. He emphasized: There are provisions in GATT that allow that in countries where there are legal obstacles negotiations will be held and they will be made exceptions to the list of provisions in the agreement. The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and Strategic Cooperation discussed the short-term and long-term effects of GATT membership. He said: Basically, the process of acquiring GATT membership is not a short-term process. It takes at least five years. There can, therefore, be no short-term analysis of this subject. This certainly has to do with our long-term behavior. Continuing, he added: In my view, our country will definitely profit from GATT membership and there will be no loss in the event we join. Dowlatabadi discussed the formation of a national committee to study Iran's membership in GATT. He said: I recommend that a group from the Majles become members of this committee and that the request for Iran's membership in GATT be pursued rapidly. The members of the expert negotiation team must be selected. Iran's strategy for GATT membership must be specified, especially in areas that have to do with our newly established support system for exports, production and industries, and it must be given to the expert team so they will know on the basis of which items to pursue negotiations. More important is that there must be continuous and active cooperation between the legislative and executive powers for the study of GATT membership. He emphasized: That illogical fear among policymakers and that illogical question concerning the profits and losses of GATT membership must be cleared from the minds of policymakers, and the process of GATT membership must be seriously pursued. Dowlatabadi was asked whether we should take fundamental steps in the nation's economy and then become a member of GATT, or whether we could join it under current circumstances. He said: Joining GATT is not dependent on any circumstances. Nations are members of this organization with the strongest and the weakest economic foundations. The economic structure of a nation is not something that can be strengthened in the short term. He was asked, in view of the fact that our country is mainly an importer of agricultural products and that our only export is oil, which is not related to GATT issues, and that in a few years the nation's import tariffs would have to be lowered and the payment of subsidies would gradually have to be stopped, whether joining would damage the nation's economy. He said: Our system of tariffs is not efficient, and our tariffs in the agricultural sector are quite low, even lower than GATT. At the same time, in other countries the existing tariff percentage is efficient and effective, and a decrease of several percentage points will have a great effect on the nation's economy, while this is not the case in our economy. Most of the tariff pressures are on the government itself. If we become a member of GATT we will be able to give greater support to the agricultural sector. He added: There is also a 10- to 15-year period allowed to reduce subsidies. In this regard it is much better for our economic system to be put under pressure and to bring itself to the designated stage by that time. The Foreign Ministry's economic adviser emphasized: There is no problem regarding the reduction of tariffs in Iran. Tariffs are no problem in our economic system. Even in a nontariff system, our nontariff supports are quite low compared to international members. The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and Strategic Coordination discussed the effects of this agreement on regional economic pacts such as ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization]. He said: GATT includes an exception for regional cooperation. These regional cooperation pacts can exist with any kind of preferential tariff. Therefore, there is no obstacle in this and it encourages GATT at the outset. At the same time our economic activity has not yet taken efficient shape in ECO or any other framework in which it is felt that GATT might be harmful. Dowlatabadi was asked whether the fact that America and the Zionist regime are GATT members with most-favored nation status might bring about the creation of relations with them. He said: In the preliminary negotiations one can make some countries exceptions to economic relations, and the membership of these two nations is no obstacle to joining GATT.
