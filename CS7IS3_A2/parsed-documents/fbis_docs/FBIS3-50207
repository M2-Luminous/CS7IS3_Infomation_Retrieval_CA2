Meeting with a small group of reporters, Boross recalled the promise he made just after the elections: That he would consult with the political parties which have appropriate political weight. Giving the reasons for his meeting with the NDSZ chairman, Boross said that although Imre Pozsgay voiced opposition in the parliamentary debate over the foundation of the new cabinet, he kept the country's stability in view and thus accepted the new prime minister and the program of his cabinet. Boross said he had not intended to hold discussions with every party represented in Parliament, but, if need be, he would consider their opinions. The prime minister informed his negotiating partners that early last week, in the Prague summit between the Visegrad four and U.S. President Bill Clinton, he mentioned Hungary's difficulties with regard to the UN embargo on Yugoslavia. He said the embargo had so far caused an almost unbearable damage of $1.3 billion to Hungary. The prime minister stressed that although Hungary would continue to observe the embargo, those concerned should in any case take steps to counterbalance its losses. It was emphasized in the talks that Hungary was pinning great hopes upon the conference on East European economies which was announced by President Clinton. The various sides discussed how soon before the elections Parliament should suspend its operation. The prime minister said he feels that Parliament should operate until mid-April. Although there is no deadline for passing any law, parliament needs to approve about 10 important bills, including those on land, police, and the export-import bank, he said. Boross confirmed that the government will submit a media bill to Parliament on February 7 at the latest. After that, the government will be prepared to coordinate with all parliamentary parties. He stressed that he would not propose any personnel changes in the management of Hungarian Radio and Television before the elections. The prime minister rejected opposition party leaders' recommendation that the government should not pass resolutions with long-term effects before the elections. "The cabinet is functioning without restraining itself because it has a full mandate. Nevertheless, we consider it our duty to inform the major parliamentary parties on long-term economic commitments," Boross said. The prime minister said he would inform the president of the republic in a letter about proposals for the date of the elections. "Under the Constitution, it falls upon the president to decide on the date," Boross said.
