With this, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT], Toyota Motor Corporation -- IDO's major shareholder -- and other concerned parties have begun discussing financial and other support measures, and there is now a strong possibility for IDO and Motorola to reach a final agreement early next week [week of 6 March]. As a result, the U.S. trade representative's (USTR) announcement of a list of Japanese products subject to trade sanctions under Provision 1377 (on telecommunications) of the U.S. Trade Act, originally scheduled for 17 March, can probably be avoided. Since U.S. President Bill Clinton has made the decision to revive the Super 301 Provision (on the identification of and sanctions against countries guilty of unfair trade practices) of the U.S. Trade Act on 3 March, and overall U.S. criticism of the closedness of the Japanese market is on the rise, Japan seems to have decided to make major concessions to avoid any further deterioration in Japan-U.S. relations. According to an informed source, IDO and Motorola, through their unofficial negotiations so far, have agreed that IDO would purchase Motorola-made equipment for 159 relay stations, which would be the basis for expanding business operations using the Motorola system, and install them in the IDO business areas, as Motorola demanded. They are further discussing the final details for: 1) IDO's reallocating a portion of the frequencies it uses to service NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation] system car and mobile phones for the Motorola system; and 2) IDO's purchase of around 100,000 units of Motorola car and mobile phones. In view of this development in IDO-Motorola negotiations, Toyota Motor and Tokyo Electric Power Company, Inc., IDO's major stockholders, and the MPT have entered into deliberations on the means for financial support. Concrete measures being considered include a debt guarantee for IDO's borrowings and offering low-interest loans from the Japan Development Bank. It is also reported that the USTR has likewise begun its final assessment and examination of the IDO-Motorola agreement, and will announce its decision on the imposition of sanctions against Japan in a few days. In late January, IDO proposed to build 134 additional relay stations for the Motorola system by the end of March 1997 to expand the Motorola-system service area to a size comparable to that of the NTT system. Motorola countered with a proposal for IDO to build 159 relay stations by February 1995, increase the number of its service frequencies, and purchase 225,000 Motorola cellular phones. IDO started its Motorola-system services as a result of the June 1989 Japan-U.S. telecommunications agreement. As of the end of 1993, the NTT system accounted for about 310,000 terminals, and the Motorola system, 10,000-odd units of all IDO subscribers. This became the basis for the USTR's 15 February claim that "the Japanese Government has violated the 1989 Japan-U.S. agreement." The USTR then indicated that the United States was considering a list of Japanese products to be subject to sanctions under the U.S. Trade Act. While the Japanese Government had refuted the charge, saying "the 1989 agreement merely provided for the allocation of frequencies," it has decided to compromise in the end to avoid a deterioration of bilateral relations.
