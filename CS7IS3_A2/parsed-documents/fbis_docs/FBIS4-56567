In other words, the crusade against the hoarders has just begun. [Rodriguez] I did not like that bit about crusade because that might give the impression of a campaign, something here today and perhaps gone tomorrow. I seems to me that this is precisely an act of national defense, wholly unrelated to a crusade or campaign. [Sexto] Then, do you believe the hoarders could reappear? Do you not believe that when the hoarders are crushed, and conditions are created so they do not reappear, this might have been a crusade, something we can file away in history as a gray period, a file on a social germ which arose before our noses and we rejected? [Rodriguez] When a farmer cuts down weeds, he does so hoping they will never grow again. However, during the next planting cycle, he has to do it all over again. He has to weed the crops. [Sexto] I believe that what has happened is that the hoarders have been allowed to flourish alone for too long because we lacked this legal tool made public today. [Rodriguez] We can all remember that there was a program against hoarders. However, our legislation only allowed for crime that was proven and therefore, today's decree-law on confiscation of ill-gotten goods is a new tool because this is also a new phenomenon. [Sexto] I used the term crusade in a semantic manner. The crusades of history were temporary, provisional processes; there was an initial boom that later faded away. Crusade has always been understood as the impetus of a certain campaign, action against specific phenomena, which later diminishes. What I mean is that Cuba, with this decree-law conducted as an act of national defense -- obviously, our society... [Rodriguez, interrupting] Excuse me, but let us replace crusade with: we are defending the nation even more. [Sexto] We are defending the nation even more. In other words, our country is confronting very powerful, strong, dire circumstances and hardships. Cuba needs above all to cleanse itself, to eliminate obstacles and roadblocks. Evidently, the proliferation, particularly during this time of crisis, of harmful, immoral, illegal elements was weighing down our people even further. It is one more element of deterioration and demobilization. [Rodriguez] Not only that, they are corrupt and corrupting elements. [Sexto] Corruptors and demobilizers. To date, there has been a certain impunity against [words indistinct] profiteering. [Rodriguez] In addition, they promote crime. [Sexto] I am not saying that that impunity was the result of laziness, carelessness, or indifference. I believe that under these dire circumstances, the nation has had to fight on many fronts. Therefore, in these periods of crisis, of shortages, these periods when self-confidence can be momentarily lost, it is logical for these manifestations of vice to proliferate and even increase because then the society is a medium for this to happen. I believe we are now reacting decisively, firmly, and physically. [Rodriguez] Although we have semantic differences, in general we fully agree. I believe that the decree-law on confiscation of ill-gotten goods is today applauded by the great majority of the people. Of course, those affected will never be able to applaud it. It is applauded above all because it responds to the clamor of the people. Recently, we spoke of the [words indistinct] and mentioned how far the workers' [words indistinct] reaches. This demonstrates that the Cuban Government does listen to its people, its workers; and acts on the basis of what the masses entrust it with. Therefore, the people do rule here. [Sexto] That clamor was very natural because despite the difficulties the Cuban people confront today, despite the difficulties that relax or stretch morals and values because we are even under survival conditions -- and morals have a certain relativity, are not absolute, fixed; they move according to prevailing material conditions in human societies -- anyhow, that clamor is logical because despite the fact that our people have great ethical reserves, our people are sickened by injustice, reject being exploited. We have not been resisting exploitation for so many years on a whim. We have been defending independence and social justice. This is precisely why I feel this is deep within the Cuban national character. [Rodriguez] There is also a practical consideration regarding the confiscation of ill-gotten goods. The people are concerned with how we are going to identify the hoarders. I think that we have to collectively participate in denouncing those who will quietly try to evade the law. I believe that in the neighborhoods, it is very hard not to know who those people are, those people who accumulate goods illicitly; who live above the means of his neighbors; and in addition, who sneer at the community around them; corrupt the community around them; have a group of collaborators; and I have been told -- although I have yet to see this -- that some even have bodyguards, in addition to many cars, and a lavish lifestyle. [Sexto] I do not think that it will be difficult to identify them because ostentation and vanity are inherent in this type of vice. Those who make money easily are given to vanity, luxury, ostentation; and I believe these are the marks each one of these hoarders leave on the rest of society. In other words, the product of their ostentation and vanity. I want to [words indistinct] it seems to me because one speaks with people, people call, write. I believe we have to be careful in identifying the hoarders. In other words, our people have a high concept of justice, but that justice has at times deviated toward egalitarian stands which are unfair per se. I believe it is good to stress that this decree is aimed at those who have profited illicitly. We cannot put in the same category workers who having given their intelligence, hard work, brilliance, and talents, have attained a higher standard of living because they have had many sources of income, salaries that are the product of honest work. We have to be careful with this. Here we are always going to refer to those who have profited by exploiting the needs of others. This is what we have to reject, condemn, and repress. [Rodriguez] I believe this warning you issue is very good because it has been said many times that hoarders are all those who have amounts of money and live above the means of the rest of the people. However, we have to acknowledge that there are people who have attained that money honestly. This decree-law very well specifies illicitly gotten goods because those attained through legitimate means -- for example, inheritances -- we have to point out that there are still families in Cuba who inherited money from their relatives from the capitalist era and are still living among us. Perhaps, they live in a large house, have a vehicle and a life-style well above that of the average people, but we cannot condemn them for having inherited that, or having obtained it through legitimate means. [Sexto] Of course, no one in Cuba is, nor can be against people having what their work allows them to attain. In other words, if I am very intelligent and hard-working, no one can reproach me for my higher income or lifestyle, over those who are not equally intelligent of hard-working. I am personalizing this. I am not that intelligent, nor that hard-working. This is clear. The listeners understand that. I am giving an example on a personal level. We have to be careful. In our society, work is the first duty of the citizen. It has to be a means for the citizen to hope for a better life as an individual. No one can condemn or reject this, nor harass anyone who is better off as result of his work. [Rodriguez] We also have to discuss a concern that numerous listeners and JUVENTUD REBELDE readers have expressed regarding the emergence of new legitimate hoarders on the basis of self-employment because self-employment work yields fairly high dividends in certain highly demanded sectors. I believe this concern of the people ought to be the focus of that group of measures begin taken today by the Cuban Government because it is an issue to everyone, according to their work, but excesses are not good either. I believe that self- employed workers ought to pay adjusted taxes according to their income. This will avoid the appearance of excessive wealth because these people also do not report practically anything to the people. I am referring to the hoarders, the ones [words indistinct]. [Sexto] Self-employment today in Cuba is as legitimate as collective, state, or social work. I also believe it is fair for these workers to pay an adjusted tax on their income. This is an effort to balance out the differences. Now, we have to remember that many of today's high prices are the result of the excess currency in circulation. In the same measure that the excess circulation diminishes, the prices will logically drop because the excess circulation affects every transaction in Cuba. [Rodriguez] Also, in the same measure that the presence of products increases, a competitiveness will take place and self-employed workers who today make perhaps tens of thousands of pesos in a year, will not make such excessive amounts. [Sexto] Of course, because all these exorbitant incomes correspond to economic conditions supporting them. However, this is temporary. In the measure to wh ich we overcome this situation, these prices will find their corresponding balance. [Rodriguez] In addition to this, in the measure that the offering of products and services improves in the state stores and facilities, this will increase competition and lower the prices and participation of self-employed workers in production.
