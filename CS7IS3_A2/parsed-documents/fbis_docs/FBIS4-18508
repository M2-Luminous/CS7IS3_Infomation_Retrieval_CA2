It has a left wing that is excitedly fluttering, an inflated belly, and a limply drooping right wing. This right wing must be strengthened again. Germany needs a democratically legitimated rightist party. This is us, the Republikaner. We understand ourselves as the party of social patriotism. We categorically reject any hoorah patriotism, which has not learned anything from history. When we demand that German identity must be preserved, this must not -- as the media constantly try to do -- be interpreted as xenophobia. But we do not want to become strangers in our own country. We also understand ourselves as the party of law and order. We do not want Germany to be liberalized to death. The increasing moral decay must be counteracted. Young people must be reminded of their responsibility toward their own people and toward the older generation. The pact between the generations has been virtually broken. People should not be guided by personal or group egotism but by the sense of responsibility toward a state, which, however, must not limit its citizens' democratic room for maneuver and must guarantee liberal basic rights.
