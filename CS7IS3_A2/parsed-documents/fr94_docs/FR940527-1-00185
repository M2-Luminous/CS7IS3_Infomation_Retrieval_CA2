FR940527-1-00185 FR940527-1-00014 The distributional effects of theses changes are to increase payments to rural hospitals by 0.5 percent and decrease urban hospitals' payments by 0.1 percent (that is, ^0.2 percent for large urban and ^0.1 percent for other urban). Rural hospitals clearly benefit from changing the per diem payment methodology. RAND found that rural hospitals as a whole transfer 4.5 percent of their patients, compared to 1.7 percent in large urban hospitals and 1.6 percent in other urban hospitals. Therefore, one would expect rural hospitals to benefit disproportionately from the change to the per diem payment methodology. The impact on small hospitals is also positive, consistent with RAND's finding that hospitals with fewer than 50 beds transfer 6.1 percent of their cases, and hospitals with 50 to 99 beds transfer 4.9 percent of cases. These groups also benefit relative to larger hospitals. Rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds receive a 0.9 percent increase in per case payments, and rural hospitals with 50 to 99 beds receive a 0.6 percent increase. Urban hospitals with fewer than 100 beds experience a 0.3 percent rise in payments. Among rural hospital groups, SCHs and current MDHs realize increases of 0.7 and 0.8 percent, respectively. Due to the much larger proportion of overall payments that go to urban hospitals, a smaller percentage change in their payments is enough to offset the higher payments going to hospitals that send out a relatively higher percentage of transfers. The reduction in payments for urban hospitals comes from the proposed change in the definition of transfers to include cases going to excluded hospitals and units, as well as other hospital settings such as Veterans Administration hospitals and nonparticipating hospitals. The hospital group with the largest single negative impact is the ``Unknown'' Medicare utilization category, a 0.6 percent decline. This is primarily due to two or three hospitals with 5.0 to 8.0 percent decreases in their per case payment level. The next largest negative impacts are among urban hospitals in the West North Central and West South Central census divisions, each with a ^0.3 percent change. F. Impacts of MGCRB Reclassifications (Column 5) By March 30 of each year, the MGCRB makes reclassification determinations that will be effective for the next fiscal year, which begins on October 1. The MGCRB may reclassify a hospital to an adjacent urban area or to a rural area with which it has a close proximity for the purposes of using the other area's standardized amount, wage index value, or both. (An RRC or an SCH may be redesignated to an area that is not an adjacent county.) To this point, all of the simulation models have assumed hospitals are paid on the basis of their geographic location (with the exception of ongoing policies that provide that certain hospitals receive payments on bases other than where they are geographically located, such as RRCs and hospitals in rural counties that are deemed urban under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act). The changes in column 5 reflect the per case payment impact of moving from this baseline to a simulation incorporating the MGCRB decisions for FY 1995. As noted above, these decisions affect hospitals' standardized amount and wage index area assignments. In addition, hospitals reclassified for the standardized amount also qualify to be treated as urban for purposes of the DSH adjustment. The proposed FY 1995 standardized payment amounts and wage index values incorporate all of the MGCRB's reclassification decisions that will be effective for FY 1995. The wage index values also reflect any decisions made by the HCFA Administrator through the appeals and review process for MGCRB decisions as of March 30, 1994. Additional changes that result from the Administrator's review of MGCRB decisions will be incorporated into the wage index values and standardized payment amounts published in the final rule implementing changes to the prospective payment system for FY 1995. The overall effect of geographic reclassification is required to be budget neutral by section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act. Prior to FY 1995, the Secretary was required to adjust the urban standardized amounts so as to ensure that total aggregate payments under the prospective payment system after geographic reclassification were equal to the aggregate payments that would have been made absent these provisions. The rural standardized amounts were also adjusted to ensure that aggregate payments to rural hospitals were not affected by reclassifications. Due to the elimination of the separate rural amount beginning October 1, 1994, the Secretary is required to provide a single budget neutrality adjustment to the standardized amounts for the effects of reclassification. We applied an adjustment of 0.993814 to ensure that the effects of reclassification are budget neutral. Rural hospitals benefit disproportionately from geographic reclassification. Their payments rise 2.3 percent, while payments to urban hospitals decline 0.4 percent. Rural referral centers experience a 4.3 percent increase overall as a result of reclassification. Of the 138 hospitals in this category, 52 are reclassified for the wage index. This positive impact on RRCs also appears in the category of rural hospitals with 200 or more beds, which have a 4.7 increase in payments.
