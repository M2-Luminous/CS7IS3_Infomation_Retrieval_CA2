Enterprises that have failed to make the change will be criticized and ordered to implement the practice within the shortest possible period, according to Lin Xiaoning, an official of the Ministry of Labour. Since the law took effect on March 1, the Beijing Labour Bureau has received over 20 complaints from workers, most of whom blamed their employers for forcing them to work overtime in violation of the government decree. Employees at the Shougang General Company (formally Capital Iron and Steel Company) complained last month to the mayor that they still were not getting two days off every other weekend. They said in addition to working the maximum 44 hours a week, they were also asked to spend another four hours on political study and training each week. Several days later, Shougang granted them their two days off every other weekend. Under the work-week law, which all companies were to comply with by May 1, workers must be paid overtime if they put in more than 44 hours per week. Extra hours may not exceed three hours per day. To ensure companies meet these requirements, Beijing will offer more subsidies to units such as the public buses that have a hard time providing normal services within the shortened work week. Trade unions have been asked to help supervise the new system to protect workers' rights, Lin said. China replaced the 48-hour week, practised nationwide for the past 40 years, with the 44-hour week on March 1. Companies had until May 1 to adopt the system. Lin was unclear about how well private and foreign-funded enterprises were complying with the law. Such companies employed 3 percent of China's 147 million urban workers as of the end of March this year. But Lin said many State and collective enterprises, including all 14 bureaus under the Ministry of Railways, have made great efforts to adopt the system. In Shanghai, where 1,727 enterprises started introducing a 44-hour work week beginning in 1992, worker productivity has risen by 10 to 30 percent, Lin said. The new work week has also been successfully introduced in most of Beijing's enterprises, institutions, hospitals and schools.
