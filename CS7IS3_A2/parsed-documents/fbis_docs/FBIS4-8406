Yesterday and on 10 April we had troops in pockets of Gorazde that came under unacceptable bombardment. Even after warnings. [Nakad] Michael Rose also asked the Bosnians to stop their provocations in Gorazde. He suspects that they shoot on the Serbs to step up the pressure and to obtain a fresh intervention from NATO.
