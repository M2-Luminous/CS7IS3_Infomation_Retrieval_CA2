NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA points out in this connection that, with the exception of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, the make-up of the new government is almost the same as that of the previous one. "If one bears in mind Gaydar's words that he could not influence the government's policy of late, as well as the fact that Fedorov said about the same thing, one may come to the conclusion that what we are having now is just the old cabinet, but free from political contradictions and psychological conflicts," the newspaper writes. "However, it is the old cabinet that was pursuing the reform policy without much success and without any system. Consequently, the old- new government, hastily made up, will pretty soon have either to be really renewed, or to renew (or rather define) its programme." Commenting on the resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov, the newspaper stresses that "all this produces the impression of a step, calculated beforehand." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes with reference to Boris Fedorov and Leonid Abalkin, a well-known economist: "A dramatic growth of inflation in the first quarter of this year was inevitable, and no government, whatever its make-up, could prevent it. It is noteworthy in this connection that both Yegor Gaydar, the 'motive force' of the reform, and Boris Fedorov, its ideologist, preferred to wash their hands of it and not to link themselves with the government any longer. Now that the radical democrats freed themselves of responsibility for the situation in the Russian economy, it is obvious that the renewed government will be held responsible for the overall economic disintegration." Commenting on the reorganisation of the government, IZVESTIYA writes that "the prime minister left the cabinet almost without the architects and active supporters of the previous policy and, at the same time, announced that the reform course would remain unchanged." The newspaper quotes the prime minister as saying that "we shall fight inflation by non-monetarist methods." "If the invariability of the policy consists in the transfer from monetarist to non- monetarist methods of fighting inflation, then new people will be really needed in the government. The impression is that we are on the threshold of a major turn towards old times." Pointing to the relative stabilisation of the Russian currency market, IZVESTIYA writes that the hope for the stabilisation of the exchange rate is based on the dramatic reduction of the demand for hard currency at the latest auction. "It stood at 67,100,000 dollars, while since the beginning of the year it had been almost all the time on the level of 150 million dollars. The inevitable result of the rush with the purchasing of hard currency was the depletion of the ruble resources of all participants in currency transactions. It is not accidental that only 66 banks took part in the latest auction, while the usual figure is 83-85." "Personal changes in the government invariably reflect political changes," KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA writes. Analysing the political situation in the country, the newspaper comes to the conclusion that, most probably, we shall witness in the future "the Ukrainian version of runaway inflation, the curtailment of production in all industries, the coming to power of a 'tough guy' and, in the long run, the retreat to previous positions." "Now there are grounds to believe that the cabinet has shifted from the right-wing liberal flank to the right-wing centre," PRAVDA writes. "Will the everyday work of the government confirm this supposition? If so, is it possible to say that we are witnessing the beginning of the political drift of state power towards the left and that it is coming closer to the real interests of working people?" "A lot of questions might be asked, but one thing is clear: the monetarist idea has lost its value." Touching upon the issues of the reorganisation of the government, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA points out that "although Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said he had had no special differences with the president, many observers believe that they did have a clash over the government make-up, which may trigger another political crisis in the top echelon. Even today many people regard Chernomyrdin as a politician, who is claiming an independent role in the political arena." TRUD frontpages an article dealing with the investigation into the crash of the Tu-154m plane belonging to the Baykal Air Company, that took place near Irkutsk on January 3. "The results of the work of the government commission will soon be made public. One thing is clear already: some time ago an utterly unwise decision was taken on the dissolution of Gosavianadzor, a unique control body. It actually kept under control the take-off of every plane. The dissolution of Gosavianadzor made passenger flights a very dangerous undertaking." SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA carry materials dealing with the 70th anniversary of Lenin's death. "On January 21 numerous representatives of communist and workers' parties, the young communist league (Komsomol), war and labour veterans, Muscovites and guests of the Russian capital came to the Red Square to pay tribute of respect to Lenin," PRAVDA writes.
