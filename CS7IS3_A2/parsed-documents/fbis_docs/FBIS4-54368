He said, in a Tokyo speech sponsored by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, that he is closely monitoring economic activities since April to determine whether recent signs of improvement were one-time factors to the March-end of fiscal year. "The basis for movement toward recovery is being prepared," he said. But he could not rule out the effect of fiscal year-end factors. Among the recent bright signs in Japan's economy, Mieno cited improving consumption and production trends, but said more time is needed to see if they continue and spread to a general recovery. The economy is in a better position than a year ago, when hopes of recovery were dashed by such factors as the soaring yen and bad weather, Mieno said, citing corporate stock adjustments, the support of fiscal and monetary stimulus and global economic improvement. But he repeated concerns about volatile currency movements, employment and continuing balance-sheet adjustments, which he said are only half-way through. He noted that capital spending continues to decline and said he could not rule out an economic effect from the long delay in enacting the fiscal 1994 national budget. Mieno also denied that leading industrial nations have a secret agreement to coordinate their interest rate policies, saying finance leaders of the Group of Seven (G-7) countries have been misunderstood. Within the broad goal of promoting sustainable growth without inflation, each G-7 central bank determines credit policy based on its own country's economic conditions, he stressed. G-7 finance ministers and central bankers agreed at a recent Washington meeting to stay in close contact and cooperate on their common aim, but Japan is "absolutely not following any other country's monetary policy," Mieno said. Market players have interpreted recent rate hikes in the United States, cuts in Germany and the Bank of Japan's guiding of market rates to record lows as a concerted effort to boost the dollar and curb the yen and mark.
