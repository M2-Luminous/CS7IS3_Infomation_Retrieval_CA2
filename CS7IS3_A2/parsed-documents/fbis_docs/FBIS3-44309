This goal of ours must, and can, be attained. The full text of Zhou Nan's New Year message is as follows: As it will soon be the fifth Spring Festival of the 1990's, let me extend my season's best wishes to all compatriots and foreign friends in Hong Kong. In the past year, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, more profound changes have taken place in China, eye-catching achievements have been scored in its reform and opening up to the outside world and economic construction, its stable and harmonious political situation has been further consolidated, and its international prestige has been enhanced. In the new year, China will continue to achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development with development as the goal, reform as the motive force, and stability as the condition, and forge ahead with great strides along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The vigorous development of the motherland has enabled Hong Kong to overcome some manmade, negative factors cropping up in the past year, thus maintaining its economic vitality. The compatriots in Hong Kong have come to realize more and more clearly that the fate of Hong Kong is more and more closely linked with that of the motherland, whose stability and development is the indispensable prerequisite for maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. In the past year, the Chinese side has made active and sincere efforts to strive to achieve an agreement with the British side on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong on the basis of the "three conformities" principle. However, quite regrettably, the British side insisted on its wrong position of "three violations," broke its promise by unilaterally tabling its package to the Legislative Council for discussion when no agreement had been reached between the two sides. As a result, the bilateral talks came to an end. Under such circumstances, we must, along with the Hong Kong residents, fully accelerate the preparatory work for the formation of the first government of the special administrative region to ensure the smooth transition in 1997 and Hong Kong's long- term stability and prosperity. This way of doing things conforms to the Hong Kong residents' long-term interests. We earnestly hope that people in various walks of life in Hong Kong will make concerted efforts, offer suggestions, actively participate in the preparatory work in various fields for the formation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR], and continue to contribute their bit to the maintenance of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. With the strong backing of the motherland and the powerful support of the 1.2 billion people including compatriots in Hong Kong under any circumstances, we have the firm confidence and full ability to overcome any obstacles that might occur in the course of progress, guarantee Hong Kong's smooth transition, comprehensively implement the "one country, two systems" principle, and ensure Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. This goal of ours must and also can be attained. The future of the motherland is incomparably bright, and the future of Hong Kong also will surely be bright. In conclusion, I wish all Hong Kong residents good health and success in everything. According to another report, at the time when he delivered his New Year message to the Hong Kong media, Director Zhou Nan answered reporters' questions. He pointed out: Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland have become an integral whole economically. As the mainland enjoys political stability and its economy develops, Hong Kong will certainly have bright prospects, and this is precisely where the Chinese Government's confidence and ability are manifested. Asked if the absence of British cooperation would pose a problem for the smooth transition, Zhou Nan said: "As I see it, it will not pose any big problem. Naturally, we hope there is cooperation. However, it takes both sides to cooperate. If one side does not really want it, does that mean that we cannot get along and we will not pursue the `one country, two systems' principle?" "Still we will implement the Basic Law in accordance with the `one country, two systems' principle." Zhou Nan said: "The Chinese Government has strictly kept its word in the past and will do so in the future. We already have a good reputation in the world in this regard." In touching the issue of how to guarantee Hong Kong's smooth transition, he pointed out: The objective of the work of the Preliminary Work Committee is to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition. With the mainland's political situation stable and its economy developing at high speed and with the support and participation of the entire Chinese people (including Hong Kong residents), the Chinese Government will surely establish, as scheduled, the Hong Kong SAR and the region's first government in strict accordance with the principle of one country, two systems and the provisions of the Basic Law. He went on to say: "Now, the whole world has noticed that China's political situation is stable and its economic growth rate has won the admiration of many foreign friends. With their economies becoming an integral whole, the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong share weal and woe with each other. If the mainland prospers, so will Hong Kong. This is where our confidence and ability are manifested." Asked of the impact of pursuing a single rate of renminbi against other currencies, Zhou Nan said: The pursuance of the single rate will be helpful and not harmful to Hong Kong. Zhou Nan said to the journalists on the spot: We will surely implement the Basic Law. We and you are identical on this point. Some people will leave after 1997, but all of you want to stay. We also hope you will stay.
