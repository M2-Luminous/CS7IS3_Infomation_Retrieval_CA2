You will now learn what tactics the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] faction is going to pursue in the State Duma. Their tactics are described for Mayak by Stanislav Zhebrovskiy, a member of the LDPR Supreme Council, the party's deputy chairman and a deputy in the State Duma. The recording was made on the telephone. [Begin Zhebrovskiy recording] The Liberal Democratic Party will operate as a separate faction in the State Duma. This is because entering into blocs with someone always means colluding against someone else. The Liberal Democratic Party is going to the Duma not to wage war against someone, but to work in the interests of the state. That is, we stand for doing something in the interests of the state every day, and for agreeing to compromises. We shall always be a constructive political force. We are in opposition to the present government, but, I repeat, it is constructive opposition. Our stand is: Whoever proposes a sensible law directed at safeguarding Russia's interests, we shall always back this law. This is what we mean when we say we are constructive. [end recording]
