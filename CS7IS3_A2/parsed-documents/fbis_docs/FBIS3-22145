Have the US, Germany, Switzerland and many other countries unnecessarily forced changes on their industries and consumers in the name of ecology? Yes, according to the Phosphate Report [note] published today by Landbank, an environmental consultancy. The report is a life-cycle study which examines the environmental impact of two kinds of detergents, phosphate-based and zeolite-based. Such studies try to take into account every aspect of the production and use of a product from raw material extraction to waste disposal. Phosphates have been blamed for high levels of nutrients in rivers and lakes that lead to the dominance of algae over other life forms. Many countries have banned detergent phosphates as a result and encouraged a switch to zeolites. But the report concludes that there is virtually no difference between the environmental effect of the two types of detergent, if all aspects of production and consumption are taken into account. It is a conclusion that might have been expected, given that the report was sponsored by UK phosphate manufacturer Albright and Wilson, owned by the Tenneco industrial group of the U.S. But the two authors insist that they have been independent and objective. Their credentials help: one is Bryn Jones, once director of lobby group Greenpeace, the other is Bob Wilson, formerly a senior lecturer in statistics. They also claim that their report breaks new ground in thc controversial area of life-cycle analysis, a technique notorious for producing disagreements among experts. They pin their hopes on the Delphi Technique to iron out these differences. This method requires a panel of experts to give their views by completing an anonymous questionnaire. The results are summarised and fed back to the panel. The panel members are invited to reconsider their position, or give arguments about why they are right. These arguments are then distributed to the panel again. The process remains anonymous and can be repeated until a consensus is achieved or irreconcilable positions established. For the Phosphate Report, the panel assessed the environmental impact of 39 products generated by the likes of phosphate mining, road transport of materials and electricity generation for manufacturing plants. Each expert gave a score for the environmental impact of each pollutant generated during the life cycle of the two types of detergent. When the scores were added up, phosphate detergents scored 107 environmental impact points, and zeolite detergents 110 points. Jones gives the error as 10 per cent. This alone should bolster the case against banning phosphates but the report is not finished yet. In its final section, the authors argue that it is much easier to take phosphates than zeolites out of waste water. Sweden already strips phosphates out of waste water and has banned advertisements that claim that zeolites are greener. There are signs of a rethink in Switzerland, where detergent phosphates were banned in 1986 and phosphate-stripping plants built to protect lakes. The report quotes Ulrich Zimmerman, head of water quality for the Zurich Water Authority, calling for the ban on detergent phosphates to be revoked on the grounds that it has failed to improve water quality. The report concludes with several recommendations ranging from a call for zeolite detergent manufacturers to abandon eco-friendly labels to a suggestion that wind power be used to supplement electricity supplies at Albright and Wilson's phosphate plant on the Cumbrian coast. Of at least as much interest to consumers is the finding that phosphates are better cleansers: almost 1.5 times as much zeolite detergent is needed to produce the same cleaning effect. Swiss consumers have discovered this already. Their increased consumption of zeolite detergents, specialist stain removers and water softening machines may have been behind a rise in foaming at water treatment works, the report claims.
