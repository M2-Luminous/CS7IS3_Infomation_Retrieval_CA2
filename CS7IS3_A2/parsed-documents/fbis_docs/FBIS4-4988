With Okinawa Highway and Okinawa City located near the crash site, the crash could have caused a terrible disaster. A resident who witnessed the crash has indicated the flight route of the aircraft on a map. As regards the accident, the Kadena Air Base Public Affairs Office stated: "An investigation into the cause of the crash is under way, and there is nothing to comment on at this moment." Since the military aircraft crashed near residential areas, Okinawans continued to take angry action on 5 April. The Okinawa prefectural government takes the crash seriously and sent Tatsuo Matayoshi, chief of the Public Affairs Office, to Kadena Air Base on the morning of 5 April to express regret to Jeffrey Cliver, commander of the 18th Wing, and to ask the commander to conduct a through investigation into the crash. On 4 April, the Okinawa City Assembly held an extraordinary session; on the morning of 5 April, the Kadena Town Assembly and the Chatan Town Assembly held extraordinary sessions to unanimously adopt resolutions. In this manner, protests against the crash are now spreading to cities and towns located near Kadena Air Base. On the morning of 5 April, labor and peace organizations staged emergency rallies to protest the crash on the so-called "hill where the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is seen" along the runway of the air base. Officials from the Okinawa Federation of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, the Okinawa Federation of the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan, and the Okinawa Federation of the ruling Komeito have visited the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau to demand the removal of F-15 fighters, an investigation into cause of the crash, and the prevention of a recurrence of the crash.
