Kumagai told a press conference after the regular morning cabinet meeting that the stalemate in the negotiations is "an issue which cannot be left to bureaucrats and requires a political decision." He also reiterated that the government has to decide what measures -- both micro- and macro-economic -- it will take and when to break the impasse on the talks. The bilateral framework negotiations meant to whittle down Japan's lopsided trade surplus with the U.S. broke down earlier this month due to a discord over a U.S. demand for quantitative targets for Japanese imports. The collapsed talks apparently prompted the U.S. to announce plans last week to impose sanctions on Japan over a cellular phone dispute. Asked about a U.S. move to withdraw its offer on tariff cuts on electronics products made at the completed Uruguay Round of trade talks, Kumagai said the U.S. about-face should not be "viewed in the context of the Japan-U.S. relations." Washington has threatened to do so unless Japan reduces its timber tariffs. He also appeared to be critical of the U.S. move, saying, "The Uruguay Round was concluded last December."
