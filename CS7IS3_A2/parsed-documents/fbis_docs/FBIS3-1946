In some cases, it has caused serious consequences in the economic, social, and other aspects of endeavor. We must pay close attention to the problem. Where Does the Root of the Problem Lie? The cases of infringing the rights and interests of employees in foreign-invested enterprises are emerging one after another. In the final analysis, where does the root of the matter lie? Our survey shows that there are both institutional defects and manmade factors behind the problem. First, in examining and approving foreign-invested enterprises, the "green light" is being given at random. According to the stipulations of China's labor laws and regulations, when carrying out production projects, an enterprise is required to report to the labor and public health departments, and the trade union organization, for a joint examination and approval so that safety and health facilities and the principal parts of the projects are designed, constructed, and put into operation simultaneously. This is called the principle of "undertaking three things simultaneously." However, to accelerate the absorption of foreign capital some local governments and departments, taking a one-sided approach toward the building of investment environment and worried that setting strict demands on safety and health would frighten away foreign investors, would lopsidedly stress simplifying the examination and approval procedures of projects and give "the green light" to the projects at random. Consequently, labor protection for the enterprises' employees and fire prevention facilities were "simplified" to almost nothing; the soundness of safety and health work was not ensured; and foreign-invested enterprises suffered an inherent shortage in such areas as labor, safety, and health. Some enterprises engaged in "processing with supplied materials or samples, assembling with supplied parts, and compensation trade" with simple and crude equipment, backward technology and management, poor protection facilities, and even without any protection facilities, started their operations hastily. Therefore, once problems cropped up, it was already too late for them to remedy and they could neither stop production nor close down even if they wished to, thus causing great problems for the management. Second, labor laws and regulations are imperfect. China's existing labor protection laws and regulations were enacted mostly for domestic enterprises. The "Regulations Concerning Labor Protection" ["Regulations"], currently in force, were enacted in 1951 and revised in 1953. They were the outcome of the planned economic structure. As enterprises have become market-oriented, some of the contents of the "Regulations" have not kept abreast of the changing situation. Nevertheless, township and town enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises have been implementing the "Regulations" in terms of labor protection, thus making labor protection legislation even more imperfect and undefined. China has promulgated the "PRC Law on Foreign-Funded Enterprises," the "PRC Law on Cooperative Ventures," and the "PRC Law on Joint Ventures Using Chinese and Foreign Investment," three special laws applicable to foreign-invested enterprises but they all lack specific stipulations on labor protection, safety, and health work in foreign-invested enterprises. Therefore, some foreign- invested enterprises, in particular fully foreign-owned enterprises, when availing themselves of legal loopholes, were not abiding by China's laws and the "Regulations" concerning enterprise labor protection and health work other than those in the three laws mentioned above. By availing themselves of the loopholes whereby in China there are no stipulations on minimum wage and maximum working hours, some foreign businessmen deliberately prolonged working hours and deducted part of the pay of the Chinese employees. Third, government management and labor supervision are not effective. All enterprises which are set up in China, including foreign-invested enterprises, must strictly abide by China's laws. However, when the employees of some foreign-invested enterprises lodged complaints or took action to share legitimate rights and interests, some government officials one-sidedly stressed absorption of foreign capital and let the bosses of the foreign side have the final say on everything, thus giving unprincipled protection to the foreign side in foreign-invested enterprises for their failure to abide by labor laws and statutes. Some local governments went so far as to call out police to arrest the so-called "troublemakers' at the request of foreign businessmen and forcibly resolved labor- capital disputes. Moreover, labor departments in many localities have not yet established labor supervision institutions. Even though such institutions have been established in some localities, they find it difficult to effectively supervise the labor management of foreign-invested enterprises as there are no laws to follow. Fourth, trade union organizations are not well formed and they are weak and flabby. The trade union undoubtedly plays an important role in safeguarding the employees' rights and interests. In foreign countries, the enterprise trade union is also very powerful. In China, there are trade union organizations in all state-owned and collective enterprises through which workers can exercise their rights as masters of the enterprises and effectively inspect and supervise their enterprises' safety in production and their employees' rights and interests. However, in many foreign-invested enterprises, there are no trade unions at all. Our survey shows that in 1992, of Jilin Province's 76 foreign-invested enterprises, only 10 percent had trade unions and, in Qingdao City, less than 30 percent of the enterprises under operation had trade unions. Even where there were trade union organizations, more often than not they were looked after by the departments concerned, with their strength repeatedly weakened and their activities restricted. As a result, they could not bring their proper supervisory role into full play. Fifth, the sense of legal system of some employees in foreign-invested enterprises' is becoming blunted and the quality of employees is low as a whole. In October 1993, in a certain locality during his inspection tour of his factory, a foreign businessman saw several young female workers chatting. He quickly rushed up to the worker who was speaking and slapped her face without saying anything. After the event, somebody told the boss that the factory was having the machines overhauled that day and the workers need not have come to work but the female workers were staying in the factory to see if they could offer any help. The next day, the foreign businessman called the slapped worker to his office, gave her an envelope, and let her go, also without saying anything. The worker opened the envelop and found 400 yuan in it and she was inwardly pleased. Instead of being roused to righteous indignation against the foreign businessman, the other female workers admired the slapped worker thinking that she had gained an extra advantage. Does this not show that the quality of some employees in foreign- invested enterprise is too low? What Role Should the Government Play? The government is duty-bound to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of employees in foreign-invested enterprises employees. In the final analysis, what role should the government play? According to international practice, in handling employee-employer relations, the "three-party principle" should be followed. Put another way, the trade union acts on behalf of the employee and holds talks with the employer on the contents of employee-employer relations, labor interests, and enterprise interests, and the government plays the role of coordinator, its task being to supervise and rectify the behavior of the employee and the employer and protect both sides' legitimate rights and interests. China has it own national conditions. The CPC leadership and the socialist system have guaranteed themselves the "three-party principle" and enabled the three parties to cooperate with one another. The problem now is that China's labor supervision has just begun; the relationship between supervision and rectification of the behavior of the employee and the employer has not yet been harmonized; there is a gap between the conceptions of some leaders and the legal system and they still cannot coordinate the two sides in a just and reasonable way, even showing excessive partiality to the foreign investors. When the department concerned investigated the boss of a Taiwan- funded enterprise who traded foreign exchange in large quantities at a profit or illegally, a provincial leader urged the department not to do so instead of supporting their action. When the enterprise's Chinese manager reported to the department that the Taiwan businessman was importing shoddy car safety belts, engaging in the illegal procurement of foreign exchange, and evading customs duties and the manager had disputed this with the businessman, the leader gave a written instruction on the report submitted to him by the department, ordering the "arrest" of the manager and calling this act by the fine-sounding name of "improving the investment environment." Was this action not too excessive? The government is now changing its functions in line with the requirements of the market economy. As far as foreign-invested enterprises are concerned, the government should genuinely coordinate its labor supervision; safeguard the relations, rights, and interests of the employee and employer; and act as a fair-minded "judge" and "law-enforcement officer." Labor supervision should be carried out simultaneously regarding the employee and the employer. However, the current outstanding problems with foreign-invested enterprises, such as confusion in the relations between the employee and the employer and poor safety facilities and labor hygiene conditions, have repeatedly infringed upon the employees' rights and interests. This being the case, at present, attention should be paid to correcting the erroneous enterprise actions and promptly discover and handle the enterprises' violations of China's labor laws and "Regulations." When it comes to the inspection of labor recruitment in foreign-invested enterprises, it is necessary to: Inspect and supervise the signing of labor contracts between the enterprises and workers, examine and certify their labor contracts according to law, and put an end to the use of contracts based on factory "Regulations"; strengthen supervision over wages, working hours, social labor insurance, and employees' welfare in foreign-invested enterprises; and necessary to improve their working environment, supervise their working conditions, prevent safety incidents from endangering the employees, and ensure the safety of workers' lives and their health. Some people worry that this will frighten away foreign businessmen. A person in charge of the newly established department of labor relations and supervision under the Ministry of Labor said: "In operating enterprises in China, foreign businessmen must abide by China's labor laws and "Regulations." This is common sense. Carrying out labor supervision is an international practice which foreign businessmen can also understand. What most worries them is the absence of corresponding laws or imperfect laws. Therefore, strengthening labor legislation and carrying out supervisory activities according to law is precisely conducive to the creation of a sound legal environment for foreign investment. Trade Union--There Must be No Blank Space in Foreign-Invested Enterprises The special role of the trade union cannot be replaced by any individuals or organizations. This is particularly the case with foreign-invested enterprises. According to the survey of foreign- invested enterprises, people, be they enterprise workers, government officials, or far-sighted enterprise bosses, have increasingly realized the deep importance of trade union organizations. Making speedy preparations for the setting up of trade unions has become the consensus of more and more people. The trade union is, in fact, not the invention of socialist countries. However, the role of the Chinese trade union as a bridge is unique. There is no denying that some foreign bosses do not understand the nature, tasks, and work characteristics of the Chinese trade union, and many bosses of foreign-invested enterprises believe that: The main duty of the trade union is to represent staffers and workers to fight the bosses for better pay rather than organize the workers to strike. Therefore, they try every possible means to restrict trade-union activities and prohibit contacts among workers. They just let trade unions do such things as "beating drums, blowing trumpets, playing guitars, singing songs, playing ball games, and taking photos." Most enterprises are even afraid of organizing trade unions and find a variety of excuses to refuse to set them up. These bosses of foreign-invested enterprises have not genuinely realized the special role of the trade union as an "intermediary." At an interview with reporters, Teng Yilong, vice president of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The guiding ideology of the trade unions in foreign-funded enterprises is very clear, that is, safeguarding the employees' legitimate rights and interests, cooperating and working together with the investors, and serving the employees, the promotion of reform and opening up to the outside world, and economic construction. The trade union will firmly support the foreign-invested enterprises's legal operations on the condition of not infringing upon the interests of the state and the broad masses of employees. No one, no matter what he is, is allowed to act by transcending the law. In foreign-invested enterprises, the characteristics of the Chinese trade union determine that it has natural and inseparable ties with the masses of employees. First, it can teach the employees to abide by laws and observe discipline, at all times and everywhere, implement the enterprise leadership's decisions by appropriate means, or remove misunderstandings and mediate disputes when they occur between the employee and the employer. Second, as the spokesman for the employees, it can promptly report their wishes, demands, suggestions, and even dissatisfactions to the employer and supervise and urge the employer to abide by China's laws and protect the Chinese workers' legitimate rights and interests. In the development of foreign-invested enterprises in China in the last dozens of years, there is no lack of successful cases in this regard. In promoting earnest talks between the employees and the boss, the trade union organization in the Baowei Company in Beijing acted as the representative of the employees, thus enabling the foreign management personnel to have the opportunity for direct dialogue with the Chinese employees. The foreign management personnel issued circulars on a regular basis, informing the employees of the company's production and operations and the measures to be taken. The Chinese employees could express their opinions, demands, and suggestions directly to the company's management. Thanks to the mutual understanding and communication between labor and management, the company's economic efficiency shot up and its workers' pay and benefits continuously improved. Practice has shown that the relations between the employee and the employer in foreign-invested enterprises where trade unions are set up are relatively harmonious and many conflicts can be solved in the embryonic state. On the contrary, the contradiction between the employee and the employer is easy to intensify. In 1993, strikes occurred in more than 100 foreign-invested enterprises, of which 90 percent were enterprises where trade union organizations did not play the role of mediator. After having seen the role of the trade union, a Japanese boss who was previously biased against the trade union said emotionally: "Foreign-invested enterprises cannot afford not to have any trade unions." According to the stipulations in China's laws, all enterprises in the Chinese territory must organize trade unions. The 12th Congress of Trade Unions, which ended last year, also demanded: All enterprises which have started operation must organize trade unions according to law as soon as possible and newly established enterprises must make simultaneous preparations for the setting up of their trade unions. For foreign-invested enterprise to achieve a greater expansion in China, they must act according to law and also organize trade unions according to law. Labor Laws and "Regulations" Must Be Perfected As Quickly As Possible The market economy is based on the legal system. In the process of China shifting to the market economy, foreign-invested enterprises must, all the more, be among the first in the legal system building. Only when the rights and interests of foreign- invested enterprises's employees are protected by relying on laws can they develop on a sound and orderly track. While conducting this survey, these reporters were informed that: Of the total number of foreign-invested enterprises, 10 percent have "sacked" their own bosses and this has become an upward trend. In 1992, a certain joint-venture enterprise in Zhuhai recruited a number of female workers from Jiangsu. Because they could not bear the excessive overtime and the delays in and embezzlement of wage payments, 99 percent of the workers either changed jobs or returned home within four months. People of insight believe: Only when foreign-invested enterprises act in strict accordance with the law and establish proper relations between the employee and the employer according to law can they and their employees benefit therefrom. A sound legal system is the only way for the healthy development of foreign-invested enterprises. China still has a lot of work to do in this regard. On the one hand, it is necessary to speed up the pace of central legislation and the enactment of two major laws on state labor protection--the "Labor Law" and the "Law on Prevention and Cure of Occupational Diseases" and bring the labor protection of foreign-invested enterprises into the system of state legislation on labor protection as soon as possible, so that barriers between departments and regions at different levels will be removed and the unsound and uncoordinated state of legislation will be put to an end; there will be laws for foreign-invested enterprises to abide by in areas such as worker recruitment, wages, social insurance, labor protection, and professional sanitation, and a sound and harmonious labor relationship will be established. The bosses of foreign-invested enterprises must realize that as they do in other countries, they must take the path of legal system and manage their enterprises and safeguard their employees' rights and interests according to law. On the other hand, it is necessary to expedite local legislation. Before the state's basic law on labor is promulgated, localities must make full use of their right to make laws, speed up the pace of legislation, and step up their efforts to enact and improve their own "Regulations" on labor protection in foreign-invested enterprises. Those localities which have not yet enacted any "Regulations" concerning the management of foreign-invested enterprises must speed up the pace of legislation in the light of their own conditions and by using the experiences of the localities which already have their own "Regulations" in this regard for reference. The enactment of a law is just half of the process of social development according to law. To complete the other half of the task, it is necessary to enforce the law strictly. After the enactment of a law, the government law-enforcement departments, particularly the labor supervision departments, must enforce the law strictly, the bosses and employees of foreign-invested enterprises must observe discipline and abide by the laws, and the trade union must bring its role into play. On the other hand, at present, while the legal system is imperfect, the departments concerned must make use of the current central and local relevant laws and "Regulations" in accordance with the "three conducives [san ge you li 0005 0020 2589 0448]" principle, use the successful experiences of foreign enterprises as reference, and strengthen the inspection and supervision of the labor protection, safety, health, and welfare in foreign-invested enterprises. When examining and approving foreign-invested enterprises, it is necessary to strictly implement the examination and acceptance procedures of "undertaking three things simultaneously." If we discover any hidden accidents and job- related harmful things, we must boldly track, supervise, and correct them within a given time. We must deal with foreign-invested enterprises which cause serious injuries and death by using ideological education and economic and legal sanctions, investigate and hold those who violate the criminal law responsible for their crimes, and on no account must we be overly lenient toward their crimes and let them go unchecked. When discussing this issue, Zhu Jianzhen, vice minister of labor in charge of labor supervision work, stressed: Although the labor supervision department of the Chinese Government has just started its work, it will strictly enforce labor laws and "Regulations" and thus safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of both foreign-invested enterprises and their employees according to law. In addition, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on better propaganda and education work and let foreign, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investors and the Chinese personnel in foreign-invested enterprises realize that the Chinese laws and "Regulations" should not be trampled upon. Multiple forms should be adopted to give wide publicity to China's laws and standards concerning labor safety and health work in foreign-invested enterprises to persuade them to improve labor conditions, abide by labor laws and "Regulations," and to respect the employees' dignity. At the same time, it is also necessary to teach the employees of foreign-invested enterprises to act according to law and boldly safeguard their own rights and interests and their enterprises' interests. Foreign-invested enterprise have made important contributions to China's reform and opening up to the outside world and also to economic development. Nevertheless, the bosses of foreign-invested enterprises must also realize that the political status and economic rights and interests of their enterprises' employees, in particular, the Chinese personnel, are protected by China's "Institution" and laws. To safeguard China's national policy of reform and opening up to the outside world, and to enable foreign-invested enterprises to develop more healthily, please bear the following in mind: Acting according to law will benefit both the enterprises and the employees and infringing upon the latter's interests will ultimately infringe upon the former's own interests.
