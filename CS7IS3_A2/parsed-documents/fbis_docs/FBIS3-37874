NATO found itself in a complex situation. The adversary for whose deterrence the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had been created disappeared. NATO became confronted with the task of finding a new objective for its existence and new functions. The dramatic development of events in former Yugoslavia highlighted the "security vacuum" problem, which had taken shape in the Central and Eastern Europe zone. The former Warsaw Pact states and the newly created Eastern European states had to deal with the task of guaranteeing security in fundamentally new conditions. Some of them -- the countries of the Visegrad Group and the Baltic states -- see a way out for themselves in joining NATO and the European Community [EC] as soon as possible. One of their major considerations has been the hope to achieve a rapid economic integration into the European structure and to enjoy the ensuing advantages. In 1993, attempts by those countries to join NATO quickly met with increasing opposition on the part of Russia. The prospect of finding the North Atlantic Alliance close to the country's borders was categorically objected to. Since the early autumn of 1993, Moscow's position with regard to the prospects of Central and Eastern European countries joining NATO became more inflexible. It was precisely under those circumstances that the United States, which plays the most influential role in determining the future of NATO, came out with the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. As a matter of fact, the "Partnership" program is a compromise between the desire on the part of Central and Eastern European countries to join the Alliance and its members' attempts to avoid a deterioration in relations with Russia, something, which, in their opinion, would be detrimental to the position of reformers in Moscow. On 10 and 11 January, a summit held by the NATO members in Brussels adopted a framework document "Partnership for Peace." In accordance with the decisions adopted at the summit, all European countries, including nonaligned ones, were invited to participate in the "Partnership for Peace" program. On 8 February 1994, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko put his signature to the "Partnership for Peace" program. It must be pointed out that Ukraine was the first CIS country to join the "Partnership." In his speech after the signing, the head of the Ukrainian external political department stated this: "By joining the 'Partnership for Peace' program, Ukraine has confirmed its fundamental political priorities and its choice in favor of returning to Europe, from which we had been artificially alienated, and joining the family of European nations." What possibilities will open up to Ukraine after it joins the "Partnership?" The participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program will make it possible to achieve greater openness, will raise the degree of confidence in military-political relations, and will promote changes for the better in relations between the NATO leadership and Ukraine. Participation in the "Partnership" will enable Ukraine to become active in various spheres of NATO activity and will facilitate the tasks of restructuring and modernizing the Armed Forces and raising them to the standards of NATO. The program envisages cooperation in training troops and in preparing them for carrying out operations within the frameworks of the United Nations and the CSCE for the purpose of maintaining peace, participating in search operations, humanitarian tasks, and so on. One of the principles of the "Partnership for Peace" is the treatment of every member country on an individual basis. The working plan, which Ukraine must devise, will conform to its national interests and the possibilities of financing the necessary transformations in the Armed Forces, exercises, training, and joint maneuvers. The "Partnership" provides for a possibility of NATO consulting active participants in the program in case of a direct threat to their territorial integrity, political independence, or security. There is no doubt that the possibility of such consultations will contribute to strengthening Ukraine's security. The expansion and strengthening of cooperation in the sphere of security is an indispensable precondition for Ukraine's gradual integration into European structures. When Ukraine achieves the status of an associate member of the EC, this will become yet another stage on this road. Of course, this will only become possible in the case of a successful implementation of market reforms and the country's steady development toward democracy. The European security system is an ideal that Ukraine strives to achieve. As Zlenko emphasized in his speech following the signing of the "Partnership for Peace," Ukraine looks upon this program as a "two- way road." Adapting itself to NATO standards, Ukraine expects that, in the final analysis, "NATO must irreversibly change its essence in the process of cooperation with its partners." In the opinion of Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, precisely this will enable NATO "to play a major role in the new architecture of European security and form its foundation." It is precisely in such a security system that Ukraine strives to find its place.
