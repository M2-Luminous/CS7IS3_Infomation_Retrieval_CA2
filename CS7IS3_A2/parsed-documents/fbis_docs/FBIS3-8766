[Noev] Many sins have been attributed to me recently. This has prompted me to overcome my reluctance to participate in public debates related to national security issues. I categorically state that my lips never uttered and my pen never wrote the figure 50,000, or any other figure regarding the number of army personnel. This is not a part of my direct duties and I do not claim any qualifications in this sphere. However, I have every reason to believe that the figure 50,000 has been proposed to the minister of defense by a highranking officer. He was entrusted with the task of calculating what army we could maintain within the 13 billion military budget. [Denov] Do you mean Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General Staff? [Noev] No comment. [Denov] You have been accused of insisting on more decisive cuts in the army. Did you initiate the idea on officers' compensation in the form of privatization bonds, described by the military as "pieces of paper?" [Noev] I have nothing to do with any compensation or "pieces of paper." [Denov] Does the army have any alternatives within the framework of this miserable budget? [Noev] Generally speaking, there are two alternatives: The first is the immediate beginning of the reforms. There are possibilities for this and, in addition, the leadership of the Defense Ministry is willing to do this. The second alternative is to leave things as they are, as though we were still at the time of the broad frontal operations of the time of the blocs' confrontation. I do not think that anything has radically changed in our structures since then. I think that the same applies to certain people's way of thinking. It is my pessimistic forecast that a further delay of the reforms will inevitably lead by autumn to an accumulation of problems, exacerbating the crisis and shortages in the troops. I hope that my forecast proves wrong. In any event, I will not be a dumb witness to such tendencies. My only hope is in those employees in the Defense Ministry system, the officers and civilians, who are champions of the new ideas, and who are capable of proposing new solutions and breaking the old norms. Those people are not afraid to assume responsibility. [Denov] Could the army cope with an eventual external threat to Bulgaria's security within the framework of this budget? [Noev] Today there is no consensus among the political forces or experts about the external threat's character and degree. One should not make a great drama out of it. It is no secret that there is no consensus among the various units of the Ministry of Defense, either. The "threat" is a matter of assessment and no one should have a monopoly over determining it. This is the situation in all the civilized countries throughout the world. The assessment of the threat must be a product of cooperation between the relevant state institutions. [Denov] In your view, what is the goal behind fanning the military threat against Bulgaria? [Noev] Fanning the threat of a war in the Balkans could be in pursuit of many internal political group and individual goals. It is my opinion that despite the formally existing tension and military imbalances along a part of our borders, at present Bulgaria enjoys significant security. What contributes to this is first of all the unique and stable strategic circumstances, second, our real association with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, and last but not least, the prudent and balanced policy conducted by our relevant institutions. I know that not everyone will be happy if I again repeat my conviction about the absurd character of the apocalyptic script that includes aggression against Bulgaria. I also do not accept the abstract threat that "if our neighbor's house is burning, our house is next." The last thing that Bulgaria needs today is maintaining insecurity and a psychosis of fear in our society. This of course does not mean that there should not be an army. What kind of army -- this is a worthy subject that should be discussed in a responsible manner by the Consultative Council on National Security at the Presidency. [Denov] Is it not high time that this body began functioning? [Noev] I think that this is the only body that can and must assume collective responsibility for solutions that have such a fundamentally social character. This is the only body which could prompt the beginning of the new stage of the military reform. [Denov] Have you been punished for your statement that NATO should bomb Sarajevo? You said that limited air strikes do not jeopardize Bulgaria. However, later on the prime minister declared his opposition to air strikes. [Noev] I will draw your attention to the consequences of NATO shooting down the four Serbian aircraft. Have you heard of anyone expressing concern for our security in this context, despite the fact that Greece declared a state of increased combat readiness in its armed forces? This means that I was right. However, this was not only my position, but also the position of the president, the defense minister, and the other state institutions. [Denov] Nevertheless, was there a dispute between you and General Brigo Asparukhov at the National Security Commission, when the possible consequences of eventual air strikes against Sarajevo were assessed? [Noev] Yes, there was a dispute, but it revolved around principles. [Denov] You are one of the great adherents to the Partnership for Peace initiative and joining NATO. What are your reasons? [Noev] I was first of all motivated by the unanimous position of parliament, as well as the clear position of the government and the president on the same matter. Naturally, I am also led by the deep conviction that cooperation with the NATO states and with our former allies from the Warsaw Pact fully corresponds to our national interests. The more this cooperation strengthens, the more our security strengthens. [Denov] Why is it necessary to cooperate with NATO? Certain politicians propose various variants of neutrality, such as the Finnish type? [Noev] It is necessary to cooperate with NATO because there is no real alternative to NATO. This is the only military-political organization with proven potential and practical possibilities. In addition, only close cooperation with NATO and membership could provide us with those additional security guarantees, such as those that have already controlled the complex relations between our southern neighbors for decades. I think that the time of neutrality passed with the disintegration of the bloc system. It is interesting that the champions of neutrality do not object to our membership of the European Union, which also means membership of the Western European Union. They also keep silent about the fact that this membership, which we unanimously desire in such a passionate manner, means that we relinquish to a large degree certain elements of our national sovereignty! [Denov] How much will joining Partnership for Peace cost? Some people say that if we integrate into NATO we will have to change our weaponry completely, which means billions of dollars. [Noev] First of all, this is a political issue, and it was already resolved a long time ago. In the long run we will profit from the partnership much more compared with the immediate consumer expenditure related to opening our mission at NATO headquarters in Belgium. In this context, I would like to appeal to Bulgarian private capital, which could contribute very much to the direction of our integration. The annual expenditure of an optimal mission and a worthy representation of Bulgaria in NATO will not cost more than $250,000. If we receive this amount as aid from someone it will end the speculations that integration into NATO should be delayed because of the budget. As far as rearming is concerned, it has already been said several times that integration does not presuppose total rearmament. It is NATO's position that standardization is not a problem that, in the final analysis, influences the political decision about membership. Thus the billions of dollars described by certain factors in Bulgaria as "unsurmountable" obstacles are mere scarecrows. [Denov] After the so-called officer putsch the defense minister mentioned army cuts. How will these be effected? [Noev] A special commission has been founded under the leadership of one of the deputy ministers of defense. This commission will optimize the structures and payroll and will reveal reserves from a more efficient utilization of the scant budget. I share the assessment that the payroll of the Defense Ministry and the General Staff is artificially inflated. There are many duplicating functions. Some warrant officers do inappropriate work. Many military employees are engaged in inefficient activities. The results of this commission's work will be published in the second part of March; however, I would like to say that there will be no extensive or unprincipled cuts, or "throwing people onto the streets." Furthermore, I have every reason to believe that the Ministry of Defense could set an example in taking care of its personnel, as has been the case in other countries. For me the ideal example is Great Britain. We are also studying the Russian experience. Despite the lack of funds we could provide requalification programs. If we approach this subject seriously and responsibly, within six months we could be receiving 120 million leva from international financial institutions for the implementation of such programs. I think that the problem of compensation could also be fully resolved. I refer to the case when labor contracts are discontinued because of the closure of inefficient structures. Bulgarian officers, both on active service and in the reserve forces, must have a worthy place in Bulgarian society.
