The Lebanese criminal court pronounced Yasir Shuraydah, 34, not guilty in the 1984 murder of Mustafa al-'Ashiq in Germany. Another Palestinian, Ghassan Ayyub, was also cleared in the case. Germany has demanded Shuraydah's extradition from Lebanon as part of investigations into the April 5, 1986 bombing of the La Belle discotheque in west Berlin frequented by US troops. There is no extradition treaty between Beirut and Bonn. Under Lebanese law a foreigner living in Lebanon can be tried for a crime committed in this country or abroad and any extradition measure can only be decided by the cabinet after a verdict is pronounced. The Lebanese authorities have not charged Shuraydah in connection with the La Belle attack and he has denied any involvement in the bombing that killed three people and wounded 230 others. Washington blamed the attack on Libya. Ten days later US bombers blasted the headquarters of Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli. Shuraydah's lawyer, Muna al-Samrah, said that he was still being held at the Rumiyah prison, east of Beirut, where Ayyub is also detained. She said the pair were cleared of al-'Ashiq's murder "because there is no proof that they were guilty." Shuraydah, who along with Ayyub comes from the 'Ayn al-Hulwah Palestinian refugee camp on the eastern outskirts of the port city of Sidon, was arrested here in 1991 in connection with a string of murders, attempted murder and burglaries.
