The delegation will take 500 agricultural and industrial products and 333 co-operation projects with them to seek investors and trade partners in America. All the projects, focusing on such fields as electronics, machinery and transport, have been carefully chosen to restructure the local economy and produce the greatest possible profits. More than 50 co-operation projects will be launched especially to satisfy the demand of the U.S. domestic market. The economy of China's inland Shanxi Province for long lagged behind other developed parts of the country because it centered solely on the coal industry and entrepot trade. Along with the efforts of the central government to tap the potential of mid-western China in recent years, Shanxi has consolidated its strength as the number one energy supplier of the country. To foster technological innovation in old enterprises and accelerate development of all local economic sectors, Shanxi has put the utilization of foreign investment and expansion of foreign trade on top of its agenda. The province has previously sent an economic delegation to the Republic of Korea and hopes that the voyage to the United States will prove to be fruitful.
