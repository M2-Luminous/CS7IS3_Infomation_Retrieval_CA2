Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young Communists (UJC), has told PRENSA LATINA that the country's youths prove every day their high degree of preparedness in every area, including the area of ideology, and he denied assertions by ill-intentioned individuals to the effect that Cuba's youths "are lost." Although he acknowledged it is no excuse that only a small number of youths are on the wrong path, Contino has said individuals who -- instigated by the diversionist campaigns led by enemies of the revolution -- undermine the merits of the new generations know full well they are magnifying a lie. Contino explained there are segments of the youthful population of the island (there are approximately 3.1 million citizens between the ages of 15 and 30) that have behavioral problems that go hand in hand with the crisis Cuba is experiencing. That the number of crimes perpetrated by youths is increasing throughout the world -- and Cuba is no exception -- does not justify the appearance or intensification of these phenomena in a socialist society, he said. He added that the UJC works on an individual basis in an attempt to rescue boys and girls who succumb to those weaknesses. We know it is a difficult task that must be worked on everyday by everyone -- relatives, schools, teachers, social and political institutions, and mass organizations -- but we are willing to take strong actions against crime and prostitution, in defense of the Cuban people's peace of mind, he said. Contino has disclosed the UJC is extending its actions beyond its membership -- which is estimated at approximately 500,000 -- to the entire youthful population, including youths who have committed crimes and have served time in jail, to achieve their reincorporation into society. The 33-year-old member of the Communist Party of Cuba's Central Committee, an economist by profession, has said if you want to talk with Cuban youths, you must look for them on any battle field, actively engaged in the struggle to fulfill the revolution's leading tasks. Contino has said over 40,000 youths participate in urgent sugar harvest tasks (to guarantee the country's leading industry). He has also suggested that anyone who wants to understand what Cuban youths are really like must go to a sugarcane plantation. He cited as an example that over 167,000 students at the pre-university level and from technological institutes and universities volunteered to spend 15 days of their 1993 vacation working on farms, and more than 100,000 youths participated in those tasks throughout the recently ended year. Contino has also explained that approximately 60 percent of the country's scientists and more than 70 percent of its tourism workers are young, authentic proof, he said, of the education they received from childhood. The top youth leader, who replaced current Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina a year ago, has denied the existence of a crisis of ethical and moral values among Cuba's younger generations, let alone a generational struggle between the youths and the revolution's traditional leaders. A nation with a young population whose average age is 32.1 years -- who have brought down continuous allegations that they would topple the revolution --cannot have internal struggles, because there are no antagonistic contradictions between generations that share the same principles and prospects, he concluded. The UJC, which emerged shortly after the revolution in 1961, is a selective and voluntary organization that is joined by the best Cuban students and workers of up to 30 years of age. The UJC maintains relations at present with approximately 218 student and youth groups in 61 countries, and at home it works in coordination with children, youth, and student associations (the Jose Marti Pioneers Organization and High School and university student federations).
