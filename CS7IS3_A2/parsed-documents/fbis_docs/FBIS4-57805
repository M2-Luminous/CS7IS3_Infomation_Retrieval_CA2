The minister said that "although everyone is aware that we believe the commanders in chief should be appointed by the president of the Republic, the government has now proposed to the country what we call an `explicit defense' policy." Arriagada explained that the policy "does not emphasize the relationship between civilians and military, but rather issues pertaining to national defense." The fact that the high military commands cannot be replaced is established in the 1980 Constitution, which was drafted under the military regime headed by General Augusto Pinochet. The minister admitted that the political parties of the governing coalition lack the support in the Senate, as well as in the Chamber of Deputies, to approve the constitutional reform announced in President Eduardo Frei's government program when he was elected in December. Minister Arriagada was asked about the subject in view of the fact that President Frei did not mention it in his 21 May speech to Congress, in which he announced the tasks his government will undertake next.
