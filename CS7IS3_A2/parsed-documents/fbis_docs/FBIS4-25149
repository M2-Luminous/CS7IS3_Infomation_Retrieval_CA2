In their talks, the two prime ministers felt that government officials and entrepreneurs of the two countries can use the opportunity of the Maltese prime minister's visit to China to have discussions on furthering their relations of bilateral cooperation. Li noted that great progress has been made since the two countries established diplomatic ties 22 years ago. He said the two sides signed agreements on shipping and on avoidance of dual taxation. China is keen to explore new ways to have mutually beneficial economic cooperation with Malta, he added. Adami described Malta-China ties as a fine example of friendly cooperation between a big nation and a small one, adding that he first visited China in 1978 as an opposition leader. After 16 years, he said, he was very pleased to come to China again and had witnessed the tremendous progress that China has made. Adami expressed support for the resumption of China's status as a contracting party in the general agreement on tariffs and trade, for which Li expressed thanks. Adami invited Li to visit Malta as soon as possible. Li accepted the invitation with pleasure. Li said he had planned to visit Malta in early 1992, but had not gone because he had to attend the summit of United Nations Security Council. Since then he had been looking forward to visiting the beautiful island of Malta. Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Maltese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Guido de Marco, who is accompanying Adami, participated in the talks. The two prime ministers afterwards answered Maltese and Chinese journalists' questions, particularly on economic cooperation and trade. Adami said the prospects for bilateral ties are very good. Malta had changed its economic development strategy and adhered to building the country into a port with services. Adami arrived here at noon today on an official visit to China at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng. This afternoon Li hosted a welcoming ceremony for Adami and his wife and their party. Among those present were Li Peng's wife Zhu Lin; Qian Qichen; Zhao Weizhi, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiu San (September 3) Society, and Shi Guangsheng, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception Committee. This evening, Li gave a banquet in honor of the Maltese visitors at the state guesthouse.
