During the talks, which covered the latest developments in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Milosevic said that by bombing Serb positions, the United Nations has abandoned the principles of impartiality vis-a-vis the warring sides in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and openly sided with the Muslims. This has seriously brought into question the trust required for the realization of its role as mediator in the negotiating process in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serbian president pointed to the fact that the offensive by the Muslim forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been going on for a long time now, and that Gorazde's position as a so-called safe zone, in full view of UN representatives, has been abused by the Muslim forces, allowing them to concentrate on their offensive against the Serbs. The United Nations has neither prevented, nor hindered these attempts but, on the contrary, has supported them in terms of direct military involvement, something the Serb nation and the Serb Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina condemns energetically. In the view of President Milosevic, this behavior is not in the interest of peace but prolongs the war and intensifies instability in this region. In President Milosevic's opinion, the only real way out of the current situation is to achieve a general agreement on the cessation of all hostilities. A peace agreement should be reached as soon as possible without prejudging the political solution, President Milosevic stressed, pointing out his belief that the Serb side will accept new negotiations without preconditions after a cessation of all hostilities is in place. However, this can be done only on an equal footing. This means that the sanctions should be lifted. If the international community sincerely wants peace then it should respect the principle of equality. Sanctions imposed against Serbia and the Serb nation represent a constant impetus for the Bosnian authorities to continue the war. That is why lifting the embargo is the simplest way to make the Bosnian authorities abandon their war policy. Yasushi Akashi agreed with the assessment that an agreement on a general cessation of hostilities is better than a partial one because it ensures the best conditions for the resumption and successful conduct of political negotiations based on the principle of the equality of all three sides. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also attended the talks, the statement issued by the Serbian president's office says in conclusion.
