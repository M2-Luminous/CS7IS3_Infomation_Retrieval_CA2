The former defence minister and armed forces chief holds no official position, but is known to wield considerable clout in the ambiguous world of Indonesian power politics. No wonder when reports surfaced that the government would restructure and downsize the Strategic Intelligence Body or Badan Inteligen Strategis (Bais), it was seen as a move to deflate his influence. Bais, Murdani's former power base, serves as the military's eyes and ears on domestic and international affairs. The intelligence agency, which grew out of the smaller Strategic Intelligence Centre in 1983, is also having its headquarters moved from Tebet in southeast Jakarta to a new building at Pasar Minggu in the southern suburbs. This will deprive Murdani of the office he is said to maintain at Bais. However, it is unlikely to diminish the influence of a man whose allies have been in the intelligence service for 20 years or more. Armed forces spokesman Brig.-Gen. Syarwan Hamid will only say a reorganisation is under way. But there are suggestions that the number of sections in Bais will be reduced and that its name will be changed to Badan Intelijen ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] (BIA) or Intelligence Agency of the Armed Forces. "Some of its functions are being dropped and I think its powers are being dispersed," an intelligence source told the REVIEW. It is understood that Bais might no longer come under the direct command of armed forces chief Gen. Feisal Tanjung, who serves as the organisation's nominal head and the president's personal representative within it. Instead, it may be placed under the supervision of the chief of general staff, Lieut. Gen. H. B. L. Mantiri, and the assistant chief of staff for intelligence, Maj.-Gen. Bantu Harjito. According to some versions, the restructuring could lead to some Bais functions passing to the Badan Koordinasi Intelijen Nasional (Bakin), or the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency. Not everyone is convinced the revamp will be all that far-reaching. "Murdani created Bais to give direct advice to the president," said one Indonesian analyst with ties to the military. "The palace guard is under Bais and if control of the agency goes to armed forces headquarters, then it means the whole of the guard will be under that headquarters. I don't know if the president would like such an arrangement." On top of that is the question of who will provide Indonesia's intelligence overview. In theory, there is considerable overlap between Bais and Bakin, but in practice Bais is clearly the preeminent agency. Staffed purely by military personnel, it is better trained and has better resources than its more civilianised counterpart. Bakin is regarded as a sleepy sinecure with a somewhat elastic staff. Its mission, according to current chief Sudibyo, is to "strengthen national resilience." In describing the role of Bais, Australian academic Richard Tanter says the term "strategic" refers to the broad interests of the state, "rather than the narrow definition of military affairs or international geopolitics." This, in turn, is taken to mean domestic political intelligence, and perhaps operations against such targets as East Timorese refugees in Australia and Portugal. Up to now, Bais has worked closely with the armed forces' social and political affairs directorate and also the politically significant Home Affairs Ministry and attorney-general's office. Senior officers of the Kopassus [Special Forces Command] special forces regiment are routinely rotated through the agency. Kopassus commander Brig.-Gen. Agum Gumelar and Jakarta military commander Maj.-Gen. Hendro Priyono have both served as Bais deputies. Rumours of the change in Bais have been circulating since July 1993, not long after President Suharto dropped Murdani from his cabinet in a move seen to reflect his displeasure at the minister's political manoeuvrings. It was the same month retired Lieut.-Gen. Sayidiman Suryohadiprojo became the first senior officer to openly criticise Murdani and what he called the "excessive role" of military intelligence during the 1980s. Suryohadiprojo, a staff officer for most of his career, is now one of four roving ambassadors charged with assisting Suharto in his capacity as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. He also acts as an adviser to influential Research and Technology Minister B. J. Habibie. Murdani is known to be at odds with Habibie, who has also accumulated enemies among serving military officers for his interference in arms purchases. When Murdani became armed forces chief in 1983, he retained concurrent control over Bais and took direct charge of the Command for Restoration of Security and Order (Kopkamtib), the powerful security apparatus formed in the wake of the abortive 1965 communist coup. Over the next five years he built a formidable power centre that was second to none in the military and on which Suharto depended for his counsel. Observers noted that when Murdani finally stepped down as armed forces chief in early 1988 to take over the defence portfolio, the Bais leadership passed into the hands of his long-serving deputy, Maj.-Gen. Mohammad Sutarjo, instead of Murdani's successor, Gen. Try Sutrisno, the current vice-president. One of the first overt moves to clip Murdani's wings came in September 1988, when Suharto dismantled Kopkamtib and effectively ended the defence minister's control over the security apparatus. Although the process, known as "deBennyisasi," seemed to accelerate with Murdani's departure from the cabinet, Indonesian observers still see his status as enigmatic. "On the one hand, the president wants to reduce his power, but on the other he realises Benny can be very supportive," said one source. Last March, the outgoing defence minister caused a major stir by throwing a reception for 1,500 guests to mark the launching of a book on his often shadowy career. Six months later, three heads of state and a galaxy of political figures from Indonesia and the region showed up at the wedding reception for his only daughter. Since then, Murdani has kept a low profile. But that has not prevented rumours about his perceived behind-the-scenes role in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's surprise visit last October and, more recently, in the intrigue attending Megawati Sukarnoputri's election as chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Party. Typically, however, there is not a shred of evidence connecting him to any of it.
