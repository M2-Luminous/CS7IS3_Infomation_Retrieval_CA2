The street will be built at the sites of Guanghua Street and Chaoyang Street in the Chaoyang District of the city. At present, ten large textile enterprises, with total fixed assets of 900 million yuan and 35,000 workers, and covering an area of two million sq m [square miles], are located in the area. According to the city's new programs, the workshops of these enterprises will be moved out to the suburbs or to materials production areas, while this area will be developed into textile and clothing research and information centers, trading centers and commercial apartment buildings. The city plans to build two million sq m in residential space in the area by 2000, which will bring much more profit than the sluggish textile enterprises. Meanwhile, all textile production facilities will be moved out of the downtown area by 2000. On the sites, stores, hotels and trading centers will be built. Experts predict that the annual sales volume of Beijing's textile industry will reach 10 billion yuan by 2000, 1.5 times that of the present.
