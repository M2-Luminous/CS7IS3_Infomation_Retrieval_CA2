The postindustrial society has acquired not only the potential for self-annihilation but also immunity to it. The latter is being recognized far more slowly than the first." We have, evidently, to reconcile ourselves to the thought that political forecasts have rarely been successful in the present century. No one foresaw the catastrophes of three world wars and their consequences. It was not anticipated that the second would uninterruptedly grow into a third, a 40-year war, which was, hardly correctly, called cold: No fewer people perished in it than in the two preceding ones. Despite the atomic bombs, which were declared a superlative guarantee of peace. The end of the cold war has confused the ideas of security. Bloc opposition is clear and simple: Here's the enemy, this is where we are, and here is the "border of the two worlds," on either side of which are troop armadas, which do not advance against one another. And suddenly everything has changed. Security has disintegrated into a mosaic of permanently changing blurred conflicts and wars arising suddenly just about everywhere. Within states and outside. In order to determine a rational security policy in a changed world it would not be inappropriate to link our thoughts with a recognition of the lessons of the cold war just ended. For the present grows out of the recent past, and, indeed, the "dead tugs at the living," however much we swear that this time everything will be in the new style. The distortion of history over many decades has always taken its revenge on us, although this revenge has not always been recognized. It is distressing to think that in the present security policy also a repetition of the mistakes of the recent past is possible and that it is possible under the conditions of the present internal crises and upheavals arbitrarily or nonarbitrarily to slid into some version of relapses into the cold war--this barren historical failure. The calamity of the cold war was the mythologization of the policy of security based on the ideology permeating it. The West and its institutions were held with us to be an absolute evil. Stalin's rejection of the Marshall Plan and reforms caused by a fear of limitation of his spheres of power and the penetration of "alien ideology" was the H hour at which the lag behind West Europe began. An emphatic start was made there on economic reforms, with us--just as emphatically--on a search for internal enemies and the struggle against "cosmopolitanism." Ideology began to stifle economics, and with it, to undermine security. Together with the failure of the Berlin blockade this led to our isolation from the developed countries, which was made worse by another failure--the war that was unleashed in Korea. These two losses of Stalin's in the cold war would hardly have been possible had our elite not believed its own myths of a decisive weakening of imperialism in the course of the "third stage of its general crisis" and had it renounced overreaching ambitions and the overestimation of the successes and victories of socialism. When, subsequently, Khrushchev--a reformer and liberal at heart, but a hostage of the System--dragged the country simultaneously into most dangerous crises at different ends of the earth--the Caribbean, second Berlin, and Vietnamese--the reasons were, generally, the same. As were the results. We may observe with disquiet how currently increasingly influential forces are once again attempting to insert ideologization and myths in the constructive policy of security of recent years. Responsible persons and leaders of parties are declaring the "harmfulness and danger of the orientation toward the West," which is hampering relations with the Arab world. As though the one excluded the other. The calls for once again counterposing "East" to "West" on the basis of some messianism are becoming ever louder and militant slogans from extremist circles similar to the rhetoric of the period 1910-1930's and the 1950's, which led to two world wars and an intensification of the cold war, are increasingly assured. An overestimation by some party leaders of the powers of their country and people and attempts to "embolden" them by prospects are noticeable once again. I am sure that a principal postulate of our security policy should be a truth cast up by the cold war: Do not allow our country to become isolated from the civilized world. This means primarily treasuring the trust of others, who will in response value our trust also. Stalin's policy in East Europe and Korea on the frontier of the 1940's-1950's and, later, the Berlin crises and the tanks in East Berlin, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia undermined trust in us, which we are sensing even today in the East European countries' insuperable attraction to the West. The chauvinism and xenophobia periodically artificially stoked in the years of the cold war are now spreading like burning lava over increasingly wide expanses, threatening the breakup of a great country and a further loss of general trust in it. The lesson of the cold war is the need to overcome the mentality of the cold war. This is, perhaps, more difficult in some respects than tearing down the Berlin Wall: People's memory of the past is far stronger. Suspicion and remembered insults remain for a long time in the subconscious of all too many people. Converting this into policy is very easy when the world is indistinct and unstable. The mentality of the cold war was stimulated with us by the demands of the system: to blindfold the consciousness of a poor society from a sight of the West, which was rapidly pulling ahead and becoming richer. But the movement of the world itself relentlessly broke down the mentality of the totalitarian system--the more fully this world of the era of the information revolution converged, the more widely it opened up to all. Our tragedy of the era of the cold war was the discrepancy between evaluations of the surrounding world and its actual character. The merit of the new policy, on the other hand, in the sphere of security included, is the aspiration to reveal to the country and the people the world such as it is. And to build relations with it on such a basis, not on the previous one, whose architecture was erected over seven decades. Is the fate of Russian history of the past two centuries: the constant replacement of liberal reformers by those who either slow down the pace or cancel out both the reforms and liberalism, so inexorable? Are we condemned now to converge with the West, now, having taken fright at this proximity, to enter into confrontation with it? As in the cold war? There are two hopes. The first is that we will succeed in making the reforms irreversible, having determined, finally, their true path. The second is that the surrounding world will, perhaps, pull everyone into the information-technotronic revolution to such an extent that the main crisis of the 20th century--between rapid scientific and technological development and the vestiges of the old social thinking in vast areas of the world--will be overcome. Then genuinely collective security will ensue. For its roots lie not in this declaration and document or the other but in people's mentality and consciousness, in general trust. But can trust be stable if we have not determined the priorities of our security policy and, in some respects, policy in general? All had been determined, seemingly: to have good relations with everyone wherever possible, with a particular orientation toward the West, as all of Russian tradition has indicated since the times of Peter the Great. But suddenly, under the influence of some domestic conservative pressures, the command: "left face-about face," is being heard, just about. And it turns out that this orientation is not the West in general but entirely the other way about--the Asia-Pacific region. Or the Arab world. Or somewhere else. But a great power is not an infantry company, and grand national long-term strategy should not be called in question under the pressure of the opportunist ambitions of this party grouping or personality or the other. Nor can there be uncertainty in respect to the Partnership for Peace slogan. One has the feeling that under the shock impression of the results of the last elections a certain reconsideration of the estimates of external threats and of security policy in general is planned. It was acknowledged quite recently at the highest level that, broadly speaking, we have no enemies. The idea of general security "from Vancouver to Vladivostok" was recognized. There was talk of an alliance with NATO. We were at one with the majority at the United Nations and in the CSCE, we were thinking of joining the European Union, and we had established good relations with the United States. And now, evidently, as a consequence of the events of 12 December, we are hearing increasingly sharp criticism of this effective policy of security on the part of authoritative people. It transpires that the establishment of relations with the United States is an "infantile disorder" or the legacy of Brezhnevite diplomacy. For the first time since the times of the height of the cold war we have heard threats to start World War III uttered by us! Sharply worded demands for the naming of a "specific enemy" since the "military doctrine of the Soviet Union considered the probable enemy the developed capitalist countries, primarily the United States," and this was good and useful, are being heard. And so forth. But if there is no enemy? Should we invent one in order to "educate" the soldiers more easily? But we have been over this hundreds of times already and have acknowledged on thousands of occasions that the world has changed and that the dangers and threats are not those of the cold war but entirely different ones. And the concerns for our security have shifted toward the southern Russian borders and the sphere of national, ethnic conflicts. But why, then, resuscitate nostalgia for the vanished monsters of the cold war? After all, wars arise not on account of the existence of weapons but as a result of policy. You can have many missiles and live in peace, and you can have a minimum number and begin to throw them. The difficult subject of attitudes toward NATO is connected with this also. It is understandable that 40 years of hostility cultivated their stereotypes, which it is difficult for many people to abandon immediately. If we are expecting a deterioration in our relations with the West under the impact of our internal processes, certain steps are then understandable. Fears that NATO could draw closer to our borders in connection with the likely membership of the alliance of the former Warsaw Pact countries and our Western neighbors included. But if we intend to progress further along the path of the creation of a general system of security in the spirit of the ideas of the end of the 1980's-start of the 1990's, what is there to fear? It is hard to find serious arguments against the Partnership for Peace and the subsequent convergence of the security systems of East and West in some interacting structure, which could not happen any time soon, for that matter. We do not need new Berlin walls at the borders. They would be disastrous for us. We need integration in the world. Inside and outside. And unified security systems could contribute to this. Inside, in the form of a common security space in the CIS, outside, in consistent movement toward what was long since called general European and, subsequently, a global system of security. Even if only in the next century. A return, however, to bloc thinking would have deplorable consequences. After all, cold war blocs are a complex phenomenon. Defense against external attack is just one of their functions, not even, I would venture to say, the most important. The internal, "deterrent" functions are considerably more important. For the United States after the war this meant control and "reeducation" of German and Japanese extremism, the cementing of "Atlantic peace," and a strengthening of West Europe's relations with North America. For the elite of the USSR, control over the socialist camp and its unity and retention of East Europe in the orbit of the totalitarian structure and its protection against the impact of an alien system. But the question of questions is the correlation between security and the internal condition of society. Involvement in the most dangerous crises of the cold war era was a consequence of internal factors to a greater extent, probably, than external factors. In the West the fear of the ruling elites of appearing "weak" in the face of communism and losing the electorate and exaggerated fears in the face of the "world communist threat" stimulated the United States to war in Vietnam and an invasion of Cuba. In the East fears of internal ferment in the Warsaw Pact countries, dissidence, and the undermining of the socialist camp prompted a series of crises--from Berlin to Hungary and Czechoslovakia and to fraternal assistance to 49 countries of the "anti-imperialist world" with the writing off of the debts of the majority of them at a time of the enormous crisis of its own economy. Here we have the roots of the present troubles. What has been called the "logic of the cold war"--the incitement of hatred, furious distrust, and a mythical belief that the sole salvation lies in the stockpiling of weapons in the guise of a "balance of forces"--has taken shape as a result. The main threat to the security of our people lies in the all-embracing crisis of society--the legacy of the policy of the cold war. If crime has become an internal war against the people, if corruption is demolishing morals and the system of government, if separatism is threatening to disarticulate a unified great country, if all this is the case, where are the keys to national security to be found? In a quarrel with the West and NATO, which are extending the hand of assistance and friendliness, or in the restoration of order within? Our security is being totally undermined by internal processes, the sources of which lie not so much in this mistake or the other of the politicians of recent years (of which, as we know, there have been enough) as in the entire preceding era after 1945. And if we once again look for enemies across the ocean and in Europe or Asia and not under our own nose, we will be making even more grievous mistakes than those with which the cold war was filled. This by no means signifies, God forbid, a call for us to forget about possible external threats. The bloody wars along a wide arc from Yugoslavia to the Caucasus and Central Asia, like also unforeseen changes in the overall situation, require reliable defenses--who can fail to understand this? But it is a question of a sober evaluation of realities, the correlation of forces, and dangers and possibilities. To abandon the thinking of the cold war means to recognize that "big wars" are contraindicated for the 20th century. The postindustrial society has acquired not only the potential of self-annihilation but also immunity to it. The latter is recognized far more slowly than the first. "The atom bomb is a paper tiger," Mao said. Doctrines of "nuclear deterrence" are still in vogue at this time. But there have been more than 300 wars in the atomic era, and the bomb has not deterred them. After the Caribbean crisis, many people realized that no one would use it. But certain countries' race for "nuclear status" is once again in fashion today. The hopes of certain leaders that the bomb could be a splendid means of policy and an attribute of respect, and of certain military figures, that this would be an excellent instrument of war and victory, are incurable, evidently, like the most virulent pathogenic bacteria, like relics of the cold war. And the final point. Concerning the dimensions of a policy of security within the framework of Russia's relations with its neighbors. The concepts of "spheres of influence" and "national interests beyond one's borders" are highly contradictory. They disturb no one if democracy and accord constitute their foundation. They are unacceptable if totalitarianism and imperialism are mixed in here. The difficulty of this problem for Russia reflects the consequences of the disintegration of the Union. The impossibility of severing economic ties overnight. Millions of Russians who have been left abroad. The tremendous number of troops, a legacy of the cold war, who need to be removed, but whither we do not know. The need for Russia's peacekeeping in the conflict zones and for soldiers to guard what are now foreign borders. The strategic positions of the Black Sea region. And, finally, the specters, summoned from the darkness by conservative forces, of the consequences of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which have not been forgotten in East Europe and which are once again pushing it as far away from Russia as possible. It is clear that it will take great political skill in unentangling this knot of problems wound tight by the cold war not to overstep the fragile bounds separating that which is inevitable and necessary from imperial pretentiousness. The first would be understood. The second would to our and general shame be rejected. In all this lies the problem of problems. The 20th century is an unbroken unprecedented general crisis, a global transitional era on the way to some new future world, possibly. Only in this context is it possible to think about security. It cannot be ruled out that if the new generation of politicians simply disregards the lessons of the past cold war, it could pull the world into the semblance of a new one. Its possible outlines are not clear as yet. Whether there would be a series of some small cold wars or, God forbid, a new, albeit brief, NATO-Russia or Russia-rest of the developed world split. Both would be an intensification of our tragedy. Yet there is hope: Good sense and a recognition of the experience of the catastrophic 20th century will halt the flight to nowhere. The world will inevitably come together and unite, which will help overcome cold wars and make security more stable.
