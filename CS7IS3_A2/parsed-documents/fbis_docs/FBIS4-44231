In a statement prior to his departure from Ercan Airport, he assessed the latest situation on the Cyprus problem. [Begin Denktas recording] The Turkish Cypriot side has done its utmost to reach a reconciliation with the Greek Cypriot side. We are waiting for UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report. The Greek Cypriot side's persistent initiatives to join the European Union will keep that matter on our agenda. We shall closely follow the situation and, undoubtedly, we shall not hesitate to take the necessary measures together with Fatherland Turkey. The Greek Cypriot newspapers maintain their propaganda activities by distorting the views we have expressed in self-defense and as a reaction to Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis. In particular, they have distorted the views we have expressed on the Turkish Resistance Organization. Undoubtedly, this is not the first time that the Greek Cypriots, who claim that they will establish friendly relations with us, have tried to distort our views. Nor is it the first time that they have made an effort to create a negative impression in the world about the Turkish Cypriots and their leaders. I have followed the Greek Cypriot newspapers every day for 40 years. By doing so, I am able to determine what they wish to achieve. As far as the Greek Cypriot intentions are concerned, what we have read in the Greek Cypriot newspapers have not inspired hope in us. We hope that the foreign diplomats will closely follow the Greek Cypriot newspapers and see how much an opportunity the Turkish Cypriots have had to reach a reconciliation. Naturally, we cannot find the right way if we are not informed about the Greek Cypriot side's views. I wish to recall Rolandhis' views. I wish to reemphasize his approach because he made a realistic assessment. I hope that the Greek Cypriot leaders will carefully read his assessment. They have launched an appalling campaign to rearm themselves. Greece will disappoint them once again. However, the entire island will suffer if they open the door to catastrophe. I called for a face-to-face meeting with Glavkos Kliridhis. I still call for such a meeting because it would be very wrong to believe that foreign officials will be able to have us reach an agreement through their mediation, that is, if the two leaders do not meet, or are not in a position to hold talks, or fail to meet face-to-face as equals. Kliridhis has continued to avoid holding talks with us. I believe that we have many things to discuss. In particular, I wish to meet him face-to-face to tell him the cost the country may be forced to pay because of their rearmament campaign. President Denktas will proceed from Adana to Kahramanmaras. He will address the conferences that will be held in the two cities on the Cyprus problem. He will return to north Cyprus on Wednesday.
