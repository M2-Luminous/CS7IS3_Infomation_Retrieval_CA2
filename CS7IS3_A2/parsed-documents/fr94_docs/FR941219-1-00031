FR941219-1-00031 FR941219-1-00015 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 93&hyph;02; Notice 06] RIN 2127&hyph;AF14 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles; Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Container Integrity AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM). SUMMARY: This notice proposes to amend Standard No. 303, Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles , and Standard No. 304, Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Containers . With respect to Standard No. 303, the notice proposes additional labeling requirements for compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. With respect to Standard No. 304, the notice proposes to specify additional performance requirements that would ensure a CNG fuel container's integrity. The proposes tests include environmental cycling tests, an impact test, a gunfire test, a flaw tolerance test, a pendulum impact test, and a drop test. Along with the vehicle labeling requirements, the notice proposes additional labeling requirements for CNG containers. These tests and performance requirements, which are based on the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition's voluntary standard, NGV2, are intended to ensure the structural integrity of CNG containers. DATES: Comments on this notice must be received by the agency no later than February 17, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments on this notice should refer to the above docket and notice number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;5267. Docket hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Gary R. Woodford, NRM&hyph;01.01, Special Projects Staff, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590 (202&hyph;366&hyph;4931).

Rulemaking Analyses and Notices I. Background A. General Information Natural gas is a vapor that is lighter than air at standard temperature and pressure. 1 When used as a motor fuel, natural gas is typically stored on-board a vehicle in cylindrical containers at a pressure of approximately 20,684 kPa pressure (3,000 psi). Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to increase the amount that can be stored on-board the vehicle. This in turn serves to increase the vehicle's driving range. Since natural gas is a flammable fuel and is stored under high pressure, natural gas containers pose a potential risk to motor vehicle safety. 1 Standard temperature is 0 ○ Celsius or 32 ○ Fahrenheit and standard pressure is 101.4 kiloPascals (kPa) or 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). Vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date, although they are increasing. The number of CNG vehicles in the United States has more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is projected to again double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994. As discussed in detail in a final rule published on April 22, 1994, establishing Standard No. 303, Fuel System Integrity of Compressed Natural Gas Vehicles , recent Federal legislation, as well as the need to meet environmental and energy security goals, will lead to increased production and use of these vehicles. (59 FR 19648) B. Previous Agency Rulemakings On October 12, 1990, NHTSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to explore whether the agency should issue Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) applicable to CNG fuel containers and the fuel systems of motor vehicles using CNG or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a motor fuel. (55 FR 41561). The ANPRM sought comment about the crash integrity of vehicle fuel systems, the integrity of fuel storage containers, and pressure relief for such containers.
