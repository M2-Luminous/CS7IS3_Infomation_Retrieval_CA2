FR941102-2-00015 FR941102-2-00009 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [I.D. 072894C] Marine Mammals AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Extension of comment period on draft stock assessments and Potential Biological Removal (PBR) workshop reports. SUMMARY: NMFS is extending the comment period on its stock assessments and PBR workshop report in consideration of the complexity of the issues surrounding both the stock assessments and the PBR workshop report. DATES: Comments on the draft stock assessment reports and the report of the PBR workshop must be received by December 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to Chief, Marine Mammal Division, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910&hyph;3226; Fax: (301) 713&hyph;0376. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas C. Eagle with the Office of Protected Resources at (301) 713&hyph;2319. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 9, 1994, NMFS published a Federal Register notice announcing the availability of draft stock assessment reports and PBR workshop reports (59 FR 40527). The stock assessment reports are required under the new section 117 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1994 (Public Law 103&hyph;238). A summary of the stock assessment reports, specifying geographical range, regional designation, minimum abundance estimate, PBR, and estimated human-caused mortality for each stock, was followed by a designation of strategic or nonstrategic. The PBR workshop, consisting of NMFS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service scientists, was convened to develop an initial approach for promoting consistent national interpretation of parameters to be used in draft stock assessment reports, including the calculation of PBR. The initial comment period for NMFS draft stock assessment and PBR workshop reports was scheduled to end on November 7, 1994. In response to concern that the public comment period was inadequate, given the scope of the issues surrounding the assessments and the workshop reports, NMFS extends the comment period and welcomes comments received by December 1, 1994. Comments must be received in the Office of Protected Resources by December 1 to be fully considered. Therefore, those submitting comments close to that date should fax their comments or call to ensure their comments arrived via mail. Dated: October 26, 1994. William W. Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27085 Filed 11&hyph;01&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;F
