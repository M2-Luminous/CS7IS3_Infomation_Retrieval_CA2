FR940610-1-00002 FR940610-1-00001 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 52 RIN 3150&hyph;AE 42 Combined Licenses; Conforming Amendments; Supplementary Post-Promulgation Comment Period AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule: Supplementary post-promulgation comment period. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) is providing a supplementary post-promulgation comment opportunity on a portion of its final rule amending its regulations to conform to the provisions of Title XXVIII of Public Law 102&hyph;486, the ``Energy Policy Act of 1992,'' signed into law on October 24, 1992. This notice is necessary to inform the public of the comment opportunity. DATES: The final rule became effective January 22, 1993. Comments are due 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Grace H. Kim, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, telephone 301&hyph;504&hyph;3605. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In 1992 Congress passed, and the President signed, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776). Title XXVIII of that Act amended in part the nuclear power plant licensing provisions of the Atomic Energy Act to authorize explicitly the issuance of combined construction and operating licenses for nuclear power plants. The new legislation largely codified the Commission's existing regulations in 10 CFR part 52 with respect to such combined licenses, but also made several changes to the licensing process established under those regulations. On December 23, 1992, the Commission issued a final rule amending part 52 in light of the new legislation (57 FR 60975). Finding prior public comment on the part 52 amendments unnecessary because the changes were limited to incorporating the language of the Energy Policy Act into the regulations, the Commission established a 60-day post-promulgation comment period. Id. On February 18, 1993, the Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS), which did not submit post-promulgation comments, 1 petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the Commission's final rule. DC Circuit No. 93&hyph;1164. Recently, however, the NIRS voluntarily requested dismissal of its petition for review (which the court granted) after obtaining the Commission's agreement, in the interest of judicial economy, to provide the NIRS another opportunity for post-promulgation comment on the final rule's treatment of the so-called ``Sholly'' procedure applicable to combined licenses. The ``Sholly'' procedure, which the Commission made applicable to combined licenses in the final rule in accordance with the Energy Policy Act (see 57 FR at 60976; 10 CFR 52.97(b)(2)(ii)), allows the Commission to make an amendment to a combined license immediately effective ( i.e., prior to a hearing) if it makes a finding that there are no significant hazards considerations. 1 The only post-promulgation comment that the Commission received was submitted on February 22, 1993 by the Nuclear Management and Resources Council. The Commission responded to this comment in a Federal Register notice published on December 30, 1993 (58 FR 69220). In light of these specific circumstances, the Commission is providing another opportunity for post-promulgation comment. Any interested member of the public may submit comments on the Commission's treatment of the ``Sholly'' procedure in the final rule (see id. ) within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.804(f), the Commission will publish in the Federal Register an evaluation of the significant comments and any revisions of the rule made as a result of the comments and their evaluation.
