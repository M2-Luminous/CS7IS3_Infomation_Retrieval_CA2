In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Bolanos viewed as very positive the concept of the summit's program, which will provide more room for conversations and debates among the participating chiefs of state. He indicated that, in addition to the presidential speeches, among the meeting innovations will be a panel chaired by three Latin American personalities, whose identities have yet to be announced, but who will discuss topics dealing with the flow of investments, integration, and the way to finance regional social changes. Asked about the importance of the Ibero-American forums, he argued that it lies in the desire to meet at Ibero-America's own initiative and without an extraterritorial mandate to discuss the region's problems and the way to resolve them within a spirit of concerted effort, cooperation, and integration. He emphasized that the participation of a socialist Cuba in the main meeting of the Ibero-American family reaffirms the principle for which Latin America has struggled so much, which is respect for the sovereignty of peoples. In this regard, he added that the island's participation means a rejection of the policy of exclusion that this nation has been a victim of in the past 30 years and that it is a sign of the strength of the Cuban process, even in very difficult moments and adverse international conditions. In these summits, he added, our country has spoken not only for itself, but for the region, defending such concepts as development with social justice and the fact that these forums cannot ignore the millions of Latin Americans who live in conditions below the poverty line. In conclusion, he said the documents of the presidential conference must be a reflection of all Latin America not only of a part of this geographic region.
