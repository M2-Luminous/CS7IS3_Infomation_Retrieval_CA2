Cuban Ambassador Jorge Alberto Bolanos assured Foreign Minister Celso Amorim that the alleged invitation does not exist, to the extent that the Collors will not be lodged in any of the official or special guest houses that the government owns on the island. A source close to Collor has admitted in a round about way that an adviser of the former president was the origin of the rumors. The former president will also visit France, but he will not be given any exceptional honor. The rumor that Collor was going to be treated as a chief of state in Cuba caused a lot of concern in Havana, so much so that the consul in Sao Paulo, Rafael Hidalgo, was asked to visit the leaders of the Workers Party (PT, leftist) to express an energetic denial. The visit took place while a letter was on its way to Fidel Castro from Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the PT's leader and presidential candidate, in which he expresses surprise and regret over any special reception for the former president, although he also admitted the possibility that the rumor originated within Collor's advisers, who are very active in their campaign to reinstate him.
