Kozyrev, in turn, described cooperation between Moscow and Paris as a mainstay for new Europe. He hoped Juppe's official visit to Moscow would contribute to the cordial understanding between the two countries and would help remove objections to the conclusion of a formal agreement between Russia and the European Union. France opposed, among other things, the export of nuclear materials. Juppe hoped he would be able to convince the other member-nations of the European Union to voice their own view of the problem, with the result that the European Union and Russia would, after all, sign an agreement. He said France favors an agreement between Russia and the European Union. Juppe thanked the Russian leaders for help in the efforts to release eleven French nationals in Bosnia. The French were taken hostage on a humanitarian mission near Sarajevo. Kozyrev thanked France for help in the evacuation of Russian citizens from Yemen. Kozyrev said that in addition to bilateral relations he and Juppe discussed some international issues, including the Bosnian developments. Both felt that more pressure must be exerted on the conflicting communities for the sake of a cease-fire. In response to a question from Interfax, Kozyrev said that Moscow assigned priority to relations with France. He described his French counterpart as a good friend and a remarkably cultured and intelligent person. It would be premature, Kozyrev said in response to another question from Interfax, to try to prognosticate the impact of Kiev-Crimea relations on relations between Kiev and Moscow. Kozyrev declined comment on the recent killing of three Russian citizens in Algeria. He told a French newsman that the situation in Algeria was very complicated. Kozyrev and Juppe agreed to have a hotline between the Moscow Kremlin and the French Elysee. The two Foreign Ministers exchanged also exchanged [as received] archive materials. France received part of the French archives which, due to a variety of reasons, fell into Moscow's hands, and Russia received some Russian archives which had been in France.
