He attended commemoration activities for the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy and also exchanged opinions with the leaders of the three countries in order to improve the partnership with the European allies. On 7 June, Clinton gave a speech to the French National Assembly, and this attracted extensive attention from the mass media. The speech mainly expressed the following three points: First, post-Cold War Europe is facing some serious challenges, mainly from ethnic and religious contradictions and the consequent conflicts and civil wars inside the former Soviet Union and the East European countries. Second, the United States "supports a strong Europe," and, at the same time, will not rescind its military commitment to Europe. Third, a strong Europe should be built with all the countries of East and West Europe tied by security, economic, and democratic bonds. Clinton expressed support for a powerful Europe, but this in fact indicates that the United States hopes Western Europe will take on greater responsibilities for resolving the many difficult problems of post-Cold War Europe. Therefore, Clinton gave up, to a certain degree, his predecessors' attitude of having reservations about European integration, especially in the aspect of European defense. This is a major change. After the end of the Cold War, the United States became the sole superpower in the world, but its strength is declining and it lacks the ability to continue to act as the "world's policeman" to extinguish the flames of war in various hot spots. The Clinton administration has thus adopted a policy of no direct interference in local conflicts that do not directly endanger the "fundamental interests" of the United States. In such circumstances, the United States has decided to let Europe shoulder greater security responsibilities. That is, Europe will be encouraged to expand and strengthen its own organizations and institutions in order to restrain and eliminate local conflicts. Supporting a powerful Europe is something the United States can do at present to reduce its responsibilities without running any risks. This is because a lot of uncertainties remain in the outlook for the East European countries and about their participation in the European Union. A European defense system remains in an "embryonic" state, and it will take time for it to develop. Therefore, a so-called "strong Europe" will not challenge the leading position of the United States in the alliance for the time being, and the United States could also strengthen itself while Europe undergoes the prolonged adjustment process from turbulence to stability. On the other hand, this will be a giant challenge for Western Europe, as it will have to make greater efforts to solve issues which concern the destiny of Europe. To encourage Europe take on greater responsibilities, a major step taken by the United States was to improve relations with France. France is a very influential member of the European Union. Clinton chose to give the speech in France because he wanted to make a good impression on France and thus ease the tense relationship between the two countries in the past few years caused by the GATT negotiations and the Bosnia crisis. At present, France is trying hard to add a "social chapter" to the world trade talks in order to restrict imports from developing countries and to protect French products. Therefore, it needs U.S. support. Clinton and Balladur reached a consensus in their talks and agreed that the two countries should set up an expert team to work out a draft for discussion at the G-7 summit in Naples. Clinton also showed flexibility on handling the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. He needs France's understanding and tolerance toward the U.S. policy of "not sending ground troops." So Clinton praised France's "great contribution" to the settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and consented to a "European peace plan." Reaction to Clinton's European trip and his speech to the French National Assembly varied in the three West European countries. Clinton's praise of the European Union, especially Franco-German cooperation, delighted Mitterrand, the founder of the European Union, but left Britain feeling deflated because the "Anglo-American special relationship" was played down. Public opinion in Italy, however, held that Clinton's visit showed mistrust of the new government. Finally, it should be pointed out that during his trip to Europe, Clinton did not forget to call for strengthening the internal unity of the Atlantic alliance. He tried to use the Normandy commemoration activities to review the historical experience of "being comrades-in-arms fighting a bloody battle against common enemies" 50 years ago in order to strengthen NATO's internal cooperation with the United States as the core. However, the cohesive force between the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean is getting weaker, and Clinton's call did not gain an explicit response. In his talks with Clinton, Mitterrand said that France would be a faithful partner, but also an "unruly partner." He also explicitly indicated that France would not return to NATO's integrated military structure. Clinton's trip to the three West European countries shows that Europe remains the focus of U.S. global strategy, but it also indicates that European-U.S. relations will encounter more difficult problems in the course of readjustments while Western Europe takes up greater security responsibilities.
