On this occasion, Souban Salitthilat explained the line and policy of the party and state on the settlement of the narcotics problem in the LPDR for the period from now to 2000. He also reported the achievements in investigating narcotics problems throughout the country, especially in northern provinces, where there are some 19,000 hectares of land for poppy plantation. He noted that in the northern provinces in 1992-1993, a total of some 125 to 150 metric tons of opium were produced and some 42,000 people became addicted to the drug. In view of the aforementioned problem, the chairman of the Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control proposed as many as 16 infrastructural projects requiring as much as $35 million. He said: In implementing the various projects, an emphasis will be put on restricting and reducing drug production. Regarding this, more rural development projects will be set up in Phong Saly and Oudomsai provinces and in Saisomboun District, Vientiane Province. Existing projects now being implemented include the rural development projects in Xieng Khouang Province, the Lao-American Cooperation Project for Integrated Rural Development in Houa Phan Province, and the drug reduction projects in Bokeo and Luang Namtha provinces. In the recent past, the Lao National Committee for Narcotics Control has received technical and financial support in the form of loans and gratis aid from many organizations, such as the (?Christian) Organization of Norway, the United Nations Drug Control Program, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the Lao-American project in Houa Phan Province.
