RC denies media speculation that its criticism of the government's social and economic measures is caused by its abhorrence of the idea of a strong government in Russia. The statement says RC is in favor of reducing the army of government bureaucrats and their privilege of distributing resources and issue licences and quotas which is the breeding ground of iniquities, corruption and bribes. The party spells out support for "a small and thrifty state, but for a highly professional government." The statement says that is the reason why the RC is opposed to the idea of numerous benefits and privileges to members of the State Duma and the construction of a new parliament building.
