In the message the head of the Russian state confirmed his invitation to H. Mubarak to visit Moscow. This visit, Kozyrev told journalists, can take place in the forseeable future. Answering questions from journalists after meeting H. Mubarak at the presidential palace "Al-Ittihadia," the head of Russian diplomacy noted that at the meeting Russia's preparedness was confirmed to assist further steps along this path together with the United States, which co-chairs with Russia the Middle East peace process, and Egypt. Tomorrow's signing of the Palestine-Israel document, Kozyrev said, "will become a good present" for President Mubarak, who is celebrating his birthday on Wednesday. The realization of the Palestine-Israel agreement, the minister continued, will present the Palestinians with some difficult tasks in implementing autonomy. Russia is ready to give them all possible assistance in this. Moscow also intends to contribute to progress in the Syrian-Israeli direction of the peace process, too. "We will make every effort to bring closer the positions of the sides," Kozyrev said. "Maybe we are on the threshold of a new peace process, that between Syria and Israel."
