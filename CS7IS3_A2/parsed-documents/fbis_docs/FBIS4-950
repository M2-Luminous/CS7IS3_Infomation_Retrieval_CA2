Peace can only come as a result of repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation. The ACDP believes in government by the people, so that individuals and communities can take charge of their own lives. Local government should enjoy real power over all aspects of public responsibility. Social services should be funded by the State and the Region, but THEY MUST BE CONTROLLED BY THE COMMUNITY. For the first time communities should be given the authority to prioritise their own needs, without State interference. This is real empowerment of the people. The ACDP believes that via local referendums, you should be able to vote regularly on a single issue, without having to wait for five years for another election. YOU should decide whether you want to build schools, clinics, houses or training centres. YOU should decide on job creation priorities. YOU should be able to decide your own future, without having self appointed leaders thrust upon you. Too much power leads to corruption. Vote for yourself. Vote ACDP. It's time for Christians to stand up and be counted. [The ad also has a photograph of candidate Kenneth Meshoe next to a voter's checkmark and the enjoinder "It's Time to do it God's way. Put your vote by the cross."]
