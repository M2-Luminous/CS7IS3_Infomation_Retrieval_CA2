FR941026-2-00042 FR941026-2-00026 [FRL&hyph;5094&hyph;8] Review of Ecological Assessment Case Studies From a Risk Assessment Perspective Volume II AGENCY: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: This notice announces the availability of a report entitled ``Review of Ecological Assessment Case Studies from a Risk Assessment Perspective Volume II''. The report includes five peer-reviewed case studies that explore the relationship between the ecological risk assessment process as described in the EPA report ``Framework for Ecological Risk Assessment'' (EPA 630/R&hyph;92/001) and several types of ecological assessments done by EPA and others. The report is a companion volume to a previously published set of 12 case studies (``Review of Ecological Assessment Case Studies from a Risk Assessment Perspective'', EPA/630/R&hyph;92/005). ADDRESSES: To obtain a single copy of the report, interested parties should contact the ORD Publications Office, CERI, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, Tel: (513) 569&hyph;7562, FAX: (513) 569&hyph;7566.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1993, EPA's Risk Assessment Forum published an evaluation of 12 ecological assessment case studies from a risk perspective (``Review of Ecological Assessment Case Studies from a Risk Assessment Perspective'', EPA/630/R&hyph;92/005). To complement this original set of case studies, five new case studies were developed and peer reviewed to provide further insight into the ecological risk assessment process. The new case studies expand the range of the first case study set by including different kinds of stressors (radionuclides, genetically-engineering organisms, and physical alteration of wetlands) and programmatic approaches (Pre-Manufacture Notice assessments under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program). Both case studies reports provide useful perspectives concerning the application of ecological risk assessment principles to a range of problems. Dated: August 30, 1994.
