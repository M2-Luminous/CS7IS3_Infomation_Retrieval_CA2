FBIS TRENDS-17JUN94-JAPAN-DPRK Tokyo Remains Cautious, Divided Over Sanctions Tokyo Remains Cautious, Divided Over Sanctions SUMMARY The Japanese Government continues to favor a cautious approach to imposing sanctions against North Korea, preferring to resolve the DPRK issue through negotiations if possible and to invoke sanctions only gradually and in stages if negotiations fail. However, some leaders of the ruling coalition and some government officials appear to be arguing for a more forceful stance. There have also been signs in the Japanese press that the coalition is trying to build a consensus around the necessity of supporting sanctions, but its weak political position and opposition to sanctions from the Social Democratic Party of Japan are continuing to hinder this effort. END SUMMARY In their public statements on the DPRK nuclear issue over the last week, Japanese Government leaders have continued to advocate caution in imposing sanctions against Pyongyang for its failure To allow full-scale inspection of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). They have also remained vague about what steps Japan would take to support any sanctions imposed by the United Nations. -- On 14 June, in comments on North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA to the Diet Upper House Budget Committee, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata stated that Japan would continue to try to persuade Pyongyang to agree to a negotiated settlement. "We still have hopes," he said in portions of his remarks broadcast on NHK Television, "that they will open their doors to the international community as soon as possible to eliminate suspicions about their development of nuclear weapons." -- The same day, Kyodo reported that Hata told President Clinton during a telephone conversation that Japan would "take responsible action within the bounds of our constitution" if the United Nations voted sanctions against North Korea. Hata and other senior Japanese officials have been publicly reiterating this vague and cautious formulation of Tokyo's position for a number of months. -- On 15 June, after a meeting with Prime Minister Hata on the draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea that the United States plans to submit to the UN Security Council, Chief Cabinet Hiroshi Kumagai summarized the Japanese Government's position on sanctions, stating that "Japan has been extremely cautious about sanctions against North Korea. Japan has maintained that sanctions should not simply be a punishment for North Korea, but should encourage North Korea to return to the starting point" (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 16 June). -- During talks in Seoul on 11 June, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and his ROK counterpart Han Sung-chu agreed that any sanctions should be "gradual," according to a Kyodo report the same day. Kyodo also quoted Kakizawa as telling Han that Japan "will make the utmost efforts within its Constitution" to support any UN sanctions. Domestic, Foreign Policy Concerns Tokyo's caution is the result, in part, of several domestic and foreign policy concerns. Tokyo apparently believes that China is unlikely to support a UN resolution imposing sanctions against the DPRK, and that sanctions would be ineffective without support from China. In its July issue, the influential journal Bungei Shunju published what it said was a top secret government report on the DPRK situation prepared last November by an unidentified government agency. Examining the possible impact of sanctions against Pyongyang, the report argued that "if the DPRK can acquire vital goods such as oil and food from China . . . economic sanctions cannot be expected to yield results." It concluded from this that "as long as China does not go along with economic sanctions and show a cooperative response, economic sanctions may be less effective." Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa reportedly told the Budget Committee of the Lower House of the Diet on 3 June that the Security Council might not be able to reach agreement on sanctions because China was likely to oppose them. In addition, the government appears to be worried that Koreans living in Japan would provoke unrest and possibly engage in acts of terrorism if Tokyo supports sanctions against Pyongyang. The top secret document published in the July Bungei Shunju described at length the types of actions that the Chosen Soren (North Korean Residents Association of Japan) might take if sanctions were imposed. These ranged from "furious protest activities at Japanese Government organizations, UN agencies in Japan and the U.S. Embassy;" attacks on people in these installations; and damage or destruction of property at these or "related facilities" to "violent counterattacks" in reaction to criticism of the DPRK and the Chosen Soren by the Japanese media and right- wing organizations. Divisions Within Government As tension with Pyongyang has increased, some officials within the coalition and within the government appear to be arguing that Japan should take a stronger position on the issue of sanctions to preserve its relationship with the United States and its credibility in the international community. During an interview on Tokyo's FNN Television Network on 11 June, Ichiro Ozawa, Secretary General of the Shinseito, the largest and most influential party in the ruling coalition, said that although the international community should initially try to resolve the DPRK nuclear issue through "dialogue," if this failed, "we will have to take a firm stand." He added that while sanctions should be implemented "step by step," it was "very important" that Japan take "action in the preliminary stages," even before sanctions are imposed, to gradually discontinue monetary remittances and trade with the DPRK. He argued that Japan would "lose the trust of the international community" if it failed to do so. He also asserted that the Japanese Constitution would not prevent Japan from either stopping remittances to the DPRK--which he described as "a matter of domestic economic policy" that "has nothing to do with provisions in the Constitution limiting Japanese participation in overseas military activities"-- or supporting UN sanctions against the DPRK. There also continues to be considerable support for a stronger Japanese posture toward sanctions within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). A senior MOFA official told the 15 June Mainichi Shimbun that although Japan has been advocating that sanctions be imposed gradually, "this does not mean Japan wants to hinder the efforts of the international community." Similarly, the 15 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted another senior MOFA official as arguing that Japan "has no option other than to sincerely carry out what the United Nations decides." The same day, Yomiuri Shimbun reported that a mid-level MOFA official described sanctions as "unavoidable." On the question of whether Japan could support sanctions within the framework of its current laws, unidentified MOFA sources told the 10 June Yomiuri Shimbun that there is no legal obstacle to Tokyo's taking steps to enforce sanctions as soon as they are imposed. Continued Divisions over Remittances The issue of stopping remittances to North Korea by Koreans living in Japan remains a highly charged issue, however, and the Japanese Government appears to remain sharply divided over the extent to which Japan could comply, particularly in the absence of a UN resolution imposing sanctions against the DPRK. Parts of the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister's office seem to be arguing that Japan would have no problem complying with a UN decision to cut off remittances. -- On 11 June, Saneto Uchiyama, Deputy Director of the Cabinet Information Research Office's Second Foreign Affairs Division, reportedly told Kyodo that the Japanese Government could "block 6O or 7O percent" of the annual remittances from Japan to North Korea just by more closely monitoring tax returns of pro- Pyongyang businessmen in Japan and could take steps to prevent these businessmen from sending remittances through third countries. -- The 15 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that MOFA officials, upset by U.S. press reports that Japan was reluctant to support sanctions, stated that Japan would have no problem halting remittances. -- According to the 16 June morning edition of the same paper, an unidentified MOFA source refuted the argument--made by Japanese opponents of sanctions--that cutting off the remittances through Japan would be ineffective because many of them go through banks in third countries. The source reportedly stated that if the United Nations votes to adopt sanctions, third nations would have to stop remittances also. "All nations involved are obliged to comply" with the sanctions, he was quoted as saying. Within the powerful Ministry of Finance (MOF), however, opposition to cutting off remittances in the absence of a UN resolution remains strong. The 15 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that MOF recently sent a senior official to Washington to inform the Treasury Department that it would be "difficult to completely halt remittances under current laws." Similarly, the 16 June editions of both Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun quoted an unidentified government source as stating that it would be "difficult" to stop the remittances under Japan's current Foreign Exchange Management Law without a UN resolution. Perhaps because of sensitivity to and disagreement over halting remittances within the government, Kyodo killed within hours of its release a report quoting the Cabinet Information Research Office's Saneto Uchiyama as stating that Tokyo could bloc large portions of the remittances. The news service initially asked its customers to hold the story because it contained "some information to be checked" and later announced the retraction by saying only that "under the circumstances, we have to retract the story." Consensus-Building The Japanese Government may be taking steps to forge a consensus in favor of sanctions and prepare the Japanese public for their implementation. For example, on 14 June, the Justice, Finance, International Trade and Industry, and Transport ministers all testified before the Upper House Budget Committee that the government was studying a number of specific measures that it plans to take if sanctions are imposed. According to a 14 June NHK television report, these include bans on travel and remittances, restrictions on trade, and surveillance of ships. On 16 June, unidentified "well-placed" government sources sought to play down the impact that the imposition of sanctions would have on Japan, telling Kyodo, Japan's largest news agency, that in their first phases, sanctions would have only a "minimal effect on Japan," causing mainly the curtailment of limited cultural exchanges and travel between Japan and North Korea. The 15 June Mainichi Shimbun carried a similar report stating that sanctions would have little effect on Japanese industry because of the limited scope of Japan's trade with North Korea. (The report noted that mushrooms were the major product air freighted to Japan from North Korea). Political Tensions Despite the support for sanctions among some politicians and officials and despite the government's apparent efforts to build consensus, the fundamental obstacle to Japan's full support of sanctions, especially in the absence of a UN resolution, remains the opposition to sanctions by the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), one of the key opposition parties, and the weak political position of the minority ruling coalition. Over the past week, the SDPJ has continued to indicate that it will oppose any effort to impose sanctions against the DPRK. According to the 14 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun, an SDPJ delegation that recently visited North Korea to discuss the nuclear issue with North Korean officials told Hwang Chang-yop, secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers Party that the issue should be resolved "through dialogue." Upon the delegation's return to Japan, its leader, Kazo Watanabe, Director of the SDPJ's General Affairs Bureau, told the Japanese press that the SDPJ will oppose the imposition of sanctions against Pyongyang (Kyodo, 16 June.) Outlook The minority ruling coalition will probably find it politically easier to gain support for sanctions in Japan, especially from the SDPJ, if the United Nations votes to impose sanctions against North Korea. If the United Nations does not vote in favor of sanctions because of opposition from China, the coalition, whatever its own policy proclivities, will have difficulty winning SDPJ support for sanctions. If the coalition were to take steps to support and enforce sanctions without SDPJ support, it would be vulnerable to a no-confidence motion from the SDPJ at a time when there are moves within both the SDPJ and the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party, to bring down the coalition.
