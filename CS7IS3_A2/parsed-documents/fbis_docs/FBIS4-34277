There are 60 hours before the runoff election. Good morning, Mr. Registrar. [Osorio] Good morning, Dario. [Arizmendi] What will happen with the voters who have been affected by the earthquake and the mudslide in Cauca and Huila Departments? [Osorio] At this time, Dario, we are in the process of collecting information on people who lost their personal identity papers during the tragedy. The information I have is not up-to-date. As of yesterday, however, we had received approximately 400 identity card replacement requests in Huila and Cauca. We plan to send registrars to places where people have been relocated so these people can vote. Registrars will use census forms. We will replace the relocated people's identity cards and tell them where they can vote. [Arizmendi] Approximately 18,000 people have been relocated, many of whom have their identity cards. Can these people vote? [Osorio] Yes, but the figures we have are much smaller. We estimate that 2,000 voters have been relocated. We are providing local registrars with additional census lists so the people can vote where they are. [Arizmendi] People have begun to wonder: The Registrar's Office was so efficient during the first round that results were released before 2300 local, at least in 90 percent of the voting sites. What will happen next Sunday? Can we expect to have the name of the president-elect by 2000? [Osorio] Yes, we will do it again, with the possible exception of two or three points. I have headed the Registrar's Office on three previous occasions, in 1991, 1992, and the first Congress elections in 1994. [Arizmendi] So this election will set a record for the Office. [Osorio] We will duplicate what we did during the first round of elections. [Arizmendi] Do you think we will know who is ahead in the election by approximately 2100 local time? [Osorio] It will depend on the relative position of the candidates, Dario. As you know, there is a virtual tie between the leading candidates, according to opinion polls. [Arizmendi] At what time do you expect to release the first bulletin? [Osorio] Well, it is not the first one that counts but the last one. Anyway, we think there must be a very significant margin of difference between the two. We estimate we will be able to release the first bulletin by the same time we released the first one during the first round, 1640 local time. [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, what can you tell us about the people in the eastern flatlands, in southeastern Meta and Guaviare Departments, who are isolated because of flooded rivers? [Osorio] Well, Dario, so far it has been unnecessary to relocate any voting sites. Some damaged installations will be repaired, but we will have no relocations of people here as happened in some Huila and Cauca municipalities. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Registrar, we continue to receive calls from many people who did not vote in the 1986 and 1990 elections but who would like to vote in this runoff election. They ask us why they cannot vote, why their identity cards, if they failed to be registered, are not in the lists of the so-called line-up voting sites? [Osorio] As we have explained before, the citizens who have not voted on previous occasions can do so now provided they are included on the list of persons who applied for their identity cards as of March 1988 when, by legal provision -- this is not a provision of the Registrar's Office or an administrative act apart from the state's sovereign willingness expressed through the Congress -- those persons were automatically included in the electoral counts. In each municipality, voting sites are prepared for these citizens to vote. Only these citizens can vote at these sites. The rest of the citizens must have been properly registered at the sites where they have chosen to vote. Unfortunately, whoever has not been registered and has not applied for his or her identity card after March 1988 is not included in the census and consequently will not be permitted to vote. [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, will there be more or less than 5.8 million votes, the number of people who voted in the first round? [Osorio] Dario, we hope there will be more than 6 million votes. [Arizmendi] [Words indistinct] [Osorio] I beg your pardon? Oh yes, although there will be a soccer championship, there will be several matches. If people take advantage of the few working hours to find out where their voting sites are located, they can do their duty as citizens by casting their votes and still watch the soccer matches. For this reason, I think there will be more than 6 million votes.
