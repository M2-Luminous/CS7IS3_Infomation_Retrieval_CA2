In this way, he explained a stand of seeking a settlement through dialogue between the countries concerned. The interview took place this morning at Beijing's Zhongnanhai, where the main government and the Communist Party offices are located. [Takashima] I would like to ask you some questions concerning the issue that is now of primary concern to the world. The international community, with China as a central figure, is currently discussing North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. First, would you explain how China wants to resolve this problem? [Jiang] We appeal to all parties concerned to exercise restraint and act prudently. In solving the problem, the ultimate objectives should be to safeguard peace and stability on the peninsula and to achieve denuclearization there. As long as we do not deviate from these two basic objectives, there is always the possibility of finding a correct way to solve the problem, no matter what temporary difficulties might arise. We should see that the door to negotiations has not yet been closed, and that room for and the possibility of dialogue still exist. All parties concerned should take active measures to avoid an intensification of the crisis. Do not let the efforts made by all parties over the last year and more go to waste. China does not approve of sanctions. This is because sanctions do not help to solve the problem. On the contrary, they will escalate the situation and have consequences which none of the parties are eager to see. I believe that only dialogue and consultations are the effective way to solve the problem, as well as the fundamental way out. We have always hoped that the four parties and three sides [si fang san bian] will hold very good consultations. [Announcer] President Jiang stressed the stand that the DPRK, the ROK, the United States, and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] should continue discussing the matter. Moreover, President Jiang also spoke about the health of Chinese supreme leader Deng Xiaoping. He said that Deng Xiaoping is in good health and that there is no need to worry about his health. [Takashima] Today, President Jiang Zemin said that China cannot agree with the idea of imposing sanctions on North Korea. This is entirely consistent with China's position up to this point, but, the timing and forum of his statement appear to be significant. It comes as the IAEA and the UN Security Council are actually talking about adopting a resolution on sanctions. Moreover, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher is reported to have said that UN sanctions will be approved. President Jiang reportedly said that if they are introduced at the UN Security Council, China will not veto them but rather will abstain from voting. Under such circumstances, President Jiang, in an interview with a foreign television network, ventured to express China's opposition to sanctions. All of this indicates that President Jiang wants to restrain the growing international pressure for sanctions and wants to take the initiative in negotiations. In particular, President Jiang held long talks with Choi Kwang, the North Korean chief of staff, at [place-name indistinct] in Zhongnanhai four days ago, thus indicating at home and abroad that ties are still close between China and the DPRK. President Jiang's remarks today reflect his own desire to settle the issue through talks. At the same time, it seems that they can also be taken as a message to North Korea. President Jiang stressed once again the need for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and the importance of removing nuclear weapons from it. This indicates that China is worried that if sanctions are imposed, the resulting confusion and conflict will spread into China, which borders North Korea. Moreover, it is inevitable that refugees will cross the border, that China's political situation will be destabilized, and that it will have to step up its military readiness. This is apparently the last thing that China wants now while it is placing its top priority on economic growth. Given this situation, it appears unlikely that sanctions will be imposed on the DPRK in the near future over its suspected development of nuclear weapons.
