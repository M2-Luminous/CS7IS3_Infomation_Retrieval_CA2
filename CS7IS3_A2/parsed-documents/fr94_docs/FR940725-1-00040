FR940725-1-00040 FR940725-1-00009 §31.302 Applicant State agency. (a) Pursuant to section 223(a)(1), section 223(a)(2) and section 299(c) of the JJDP Act, the State must assure that the State agency approved under section 299(c) has been designated as the sole agency for supervising the preparation and administration of the plan and has the authority to implement the plan. (b) *␣*␣* (2) Should consider in meeting the statutory membership requirements and responsibilities of section 223(a)(3) (A)&hyph;(E), appointing at least one member who represents each of the following: a locally elected official representing general purpose local government; a law enforcement officer; a juvenile or family court judge; a probation officer; a juvenile corrections official; a prosecutor; a representative from an organization, such as a parents group, concerned with teenage drug and alcohol abuse; a high school principal; a recreation director; a volunteer who works with delinquent or at risk youth; a person with a special focus on the family; a youth worker experienced with programs that offer alternatives to incarceration; persons with special competence in addressing programs of school violence and vandalism and alternatives to expulsion and suspension; and, persons with special knowledge concerning learning disabilities, child abuse, neglect and youth violence. 8. Section 31.303 (a) and (b) is revised to read as follows: §31.303 Assurances. (a) Assurances. The State must certify through the provision of assurances that it has complied and will comply (as appropriate) with section 223(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8)(c), (9), (10), (11), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), (22), and (25), and sections 229 and 261(d), in formulating and implementing the State plan. The Formula Grant Application kit provides a form and guidance for the provision of assurances. OJJDP interprets the 223(a)(16) assurance as satisfied by an affirmation that State law and/or policy clearly require equitable treatment on the required bases; or by providing in the State plan that the State agency will require an assurance of equitable treatment by all Formula Grant subgrant and contract recipients, and establish as a program goal, in conjunction with the State Advisory Group, the adoption and implementation of a statewide juvenile justice policy that all youth in the juvenile justice system will be treated equitably without regard to gender, race, family income, and mentally, emotionally, or physically handicapping conditions. OJJDP interprets the 223(a)(25) assurance as satisfied by a provision in the State plan for the State agency and the State Advisory Group to promulgate policies and budget priorities that require the funding of programs that are part of a comprehensive and coordinated community system of services as set forth in section 103(19) of the JJDP Act. This requirement is applicable when a State's formula grant for any fiscal year exceeds 105 percent of the State's formula grant for Fiscal Year 1992. (b) Serious juvenile offender emphasis. Pursuant to sections 101(a)(10) and 223(a)(10) of the JJDP Act, the Office encourages States that have identified serious and violent juvenile offenders as a priority problem to allocate formula grant funds to programs designed for serious and violent juvenile offenders at a level consistent with the extent of the problem as identified through the State planning process. Particular attention should be given to improving prosecution, sentencing procedures, providing resources necessary for informed dispositions, providing for effective rehabilitation, and facilitating the coordination of services between the juvenile justice and criminal justice systems. * * * * * 9. Section 31.301 is amended by revising paragraph (c)(3) to read as follows: §31.301 Federal Wards. (c) *␣*␣* (3) Apply this requirement to alien juveniles under Federal jurisdiction who are held in State or local facilities.
