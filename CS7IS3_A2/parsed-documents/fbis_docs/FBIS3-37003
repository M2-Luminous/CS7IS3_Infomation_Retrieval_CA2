This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department. He said that "Russia proposes that this session be made open for the participation in the discussion not only of Security Council members but also other interested countries, especially those whose interests are in Bosnia and Herzegovina." The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the NATO Council had adopted a statement on the problem of the Bosnian crisis. In it the Council urged all the sides -- Serbs and Muslims -- to urgently place their heavy armaments in the Sarajevo region under UN control or to remove them from the area. Essentially, this is close to the position taken by Russia that has more than once come out with an initiative for the urgent demilitarization of Sarajevo and the imposition of UN administrative control in that city. In Grigoriy Karasin's opinion, such measures would be a most important step toward a settlement of the Bosnian conflict. He expressed satisfaction that the NATO Council, like Russia, had reaffirmed its support for talks as the way to a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia. It is precisely this path that demands vigorous pressure on the part of the world community on all the sides involved in the conflict. Unfortunately, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman believes, in the position of a number of NATO members one can sense an attempt to interpret this pressure as a unilateral ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs by threatening them with air strikes. The Russian Federation, Grigoriy Karasin stressed, cannot agree with this unilateral approach. "We are also convinced," the Russian diplomat said, "that it is the Security Council that must adopt decisions on the problem of lifting the siege of Sarajevo," as Russia proposed two weeks ago. Unfortunately, Russia's proposal was not adopted. G. Karasin said that at the same time, this problem had been put to the NATO council which, as is known, has no authority to adopt decisions on the matter of a Bosnian settlement. The UN secretary general had earlier approached NATO with a proposal to state the alliance's readiness to use aircraft if the United Nations asks for it. A decision on such a request should be adopted by the secretary general following consultations with the Security Council members. This procedure, which has been established by the Security Council, should be rigorously followed, Grigoriy Karasin emphasized. He noted that a few hours before the announcement of NATO's decision, reports had come in that the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims, through United Nations mediation, had reached agreement on a cease- fire, and had agreed on specific measures for the withdrawal of armaments from Sarajevo. "Hasty decisions outside the framework of the United Nations carry the risk of wrecking this encouraging process. Progress toward a settlement is possible only if neither side gains advantage while the demilitarization measures are being carried out by UN forces," the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.
