During the meeting, to be held later today, the Palestinian leadership is expected to define the PLO stance on continuing the peace negotiations on every level, in light of the Israeli terrorist actions against the Palestinian people, which are the result of Israel's continuing intransigence and failure to implement the Declaration of Principles Agreement and withdraw from Gaza and Jericho. President 'Arafat telephoned Nasir al-Qidrah, the chief Palestinian observer at the United Nations, and asked him to submit an urgent memorandum to the UN Security Council on the hideous massacre, which contravenes every international agreement and custom, and to call for an emergency Security Council meeting to discuss it.
