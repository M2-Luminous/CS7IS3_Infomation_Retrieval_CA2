FR940506-0-00022 FR940506-0-00012 III. Issues Relating to Data Set Implementation And Maintenance A. Implementation Date AER/MRT contend that the June 1, 1994 implementation date places too great a burden on the pipelines, because they are still in the midst of refining their restructured services and the compliance burden falls during the critical shoulder months between January and March. They suggest a December 1, 1994 date. In particular, they contend that they require the implementation guide for the ASC X12 data sets by February 1, 1994, and suggest that, if that date is not met, the June 1, 1994 date should be relaxed. The Commission will not change the implementation date. In Order No. 563, the Commission agreed to extend the implementation date from the April 1, 1994 date proposed in the NOPR until June 1, 1994. But, with this extension, the Commission expected a fully operational set of standards to be in place by June 1. Working Groups 1 and 2 stated in their comments that the June 1 date can be met if the ASC X12 implementation guide is available by March 1, 1994, and the Working Groups substantially met this deadline, filing the data sets and implementation guide with the Commission on March 4, 1994, with public notice given on March 7, 1994. AER/MRT is the only party alleging that the June 1 date cannot be met, and they have not provided sufficient justification for extending the date further. B. Periodic Reports In Order No. 563, the Commission found no need for requiring pipelines to file tariffs specifying how they would comply with the rule or to file periodic reports of their implementation progress. UDC/AGD renew their request that pipelines be required to file periodic reports. Without such reports, they maintain no formal procedure would exist to provide information on implementation progress or problems. They further claim such reports would provide useful information about the development of the secondary market and the interplay between interruptible and released capacity. The Commission denies the request for rehearing. As stated in Order No. 563, the Commission will monitor implementation of the rule by accessing the pipelines' EBBs, continuing to hold industry conferences, and by examining complaints. These mechanisms provide a far more flexible method of oversight than attempting to specify particular items of information for inclusion in periodic reports. As stated earlier, the Commission is committed to monitoring the EBBs and the implementation of the standards, and to making revisions when needed. C. Mechanism for Making Revisions to the Data Sets In Order No. 563, the Commission recognized that the standardization process was an ongoing one, which would require revisions and modifications to the data sets and protocols as the industry obtains experience with operations under the standards. The Commission stated it would continue the informal conferences and the Working Groups as the best means for monitoring the standards, but did not adopt a specific mechanism for implementing proposed changes. The Commission found that its determination of the proper method for making revisions may depend on the type of change contemplated. The Commission stated, however, that in considering proposed changes, it would comply with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and ensure parties have notice and an opportunity to comment on proposed changes. Tenneco Gas asserts that providing a mechanism for addressing changes to the standards is critical and requests the Commission to adopt a specific mechanism for making changes, which is both flexible and responsive. KGPC contends many participants are unable to commit the resources to remain actively involved in the Working Group process and urges the Commission to ensure adequate communication to the industry of proposed changes with an opportunity for comment. AER/MRT similarly request clarification that the Commission will comply with the APA and provide notice and an opportunity for comment. The Commission recognizes that the standards and protocols will have to be revised and that a flexible mechanism is needed for effectuating such changes. To provide the needed flexibility, the Commission adopted only a general regulation referencing the separate standards and protocols and did not include those standards and protocols in the Code of Federal Regulations. However, as explained in Order No. 563, the Commission cannot commit to one method for making revisions because different circumstances may demand different procedural mechanisms; for example, maintenance of the existing data sets may be treated differently than implementation of new requirements. As stated in Order No. 563, in making changes, the Commission will adhere to the APA and provide notice and an opportunity for public comment before implementing changes.
