FBIS4-27142 "dreas104_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 South Korea Preparation for Every `Contingency' Preparation for Every `Contingency' SK3005035594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0345 GMT 30 May 94 SK3005035594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The government is preparing for every possible contingency following the breakdown of negotiations between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). President Kim Yong-sam presided over a security-related cabinet ministers' meeting Monday morning to discuss various means of coping with the nuclear dispute. The government decided to strengthen cooperation with the countries around the Korean peninsula -- the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- and study possible action in case the issue is referred to the U.N. Security Council, presidential press secretary Choo Don-shik said. It was also decided to convey South Korea's position agreed at the meeting to the Governments of the United States, Japan, China and Russia, Choo said. Attending the meeting were Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Deputy Premier and minister of the National Unification Board (NUB) Yi Hong-ku, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyoung- tae and other ministers and secretaries. President Kim said, "The efforts of the government and the international society to peacefully solve the North Korean nuclear problem are faced with a grave challenge as Pyongyang ignored the international society's demands and pushed for replacement of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon." Kim instructed the ministers to prepare for any emergency which might be created by North Korea in a crisis. President Kim urged North Korea to immediately stop discharging the fuel rods, saying that selection, storage and measurement of fuel rods are indispensable to securing the transparency of past nuclear activities as well as ascertaining the non-diversion of nuclear material. Kim instructed the ministers to maintain close cooperation with related countries to achieve tangible results and to work out countermeasures for every possibility, including referral of the nuclear issue to the Security Council again. The government, however, decided to continue trying to solve the problem through dialogue ahead of the IAEA's regular Board of Governors' meeting slated for June 6, since the nuclear dispute cannot be considered a catastrophe as Pyongyang still wants to hold a third round of high-level talks with Washington, according to the official. "The results of today's meeting will be conveyed to related countries including the United States," Choo said. The government plans to hold a unification and security policy coordination meeting this week to draw up detailed measures on the basis of the results of the security-related ministers' meeting.
