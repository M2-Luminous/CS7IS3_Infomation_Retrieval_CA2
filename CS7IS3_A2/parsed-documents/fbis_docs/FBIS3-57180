Varebrus and Ye. Chukovskiy; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Excerpt] [Announcer] A contract under the intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation on the sale of highly enriched uranium was signed today at the Russian Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry. [Varebrus over video of nuclear explosion and signing ceremony] Most people have probably seen a nuclear explosion, on television of course, but few will know that the decisions to start producing nuclear weapons--and who was to do it, at what plants, and what type of technology was to be used--were adopted in precisely these premises, in downtown Moscow, on Ordynka Street. Now the people against whom these weapons were built, the Americans, are right here to sign an agreement to ensure that Russia's nuclear weapon potential is used for the benefit of our peaceful life. And these objects, even if they look a bit like missiles, are just pens which will be used in a few minutes to sign a Russian-U.S. contract on reprocessing weapons-grade uranium into fuel for nuclear power stations. Over a period of 20 years more than 20,000 nuclear charges totaling almost 500 tonnes of uranium are to be processed. The cost of the contract is $12 billion. If everything goes according to plan, the plant to be built under this contract in the United States will be using Russian technology and Russian raw material.
