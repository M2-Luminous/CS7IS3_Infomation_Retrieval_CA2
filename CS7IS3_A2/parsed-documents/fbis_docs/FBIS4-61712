FBIS4-61712 "drsov089_a_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-089 Daily Report 6 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Russian Troops To Be Withdrawn From Abroad by Sep Russian Troops To Be Withdrawn From Abroad by Sep LD0605145794 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1315 GMT 6 May 94 LD0605145794 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Russian Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev said that, by September 1, 1994 Russia would have withdrawn all its troops from other countries, both within and outside former Soviet territory, except for those states with which it has agreements to set up military bases on their territory. Altogether 32,000 troops would return to Russia, Grachev told a news conference in Moscow on Friday. The Black Sea Fleet, however, would stay in Crimea, and, unless proper social security was provided for retired Russian military officers living in Estonia, Russia would keep a military contingent there too, he said. The general said additional allocations were needed to resettle officers and their families coming back to Russia. He said his ministry was spending more than half of its funds for those purposes. Grachev said military reforms could not be successful without state support. Only at that level could the stable financing of the armed forces be ensured and could they be brought up to full strength, he said. The minister slammed the Pacific Fleet for its training standards, which, he qualified as the lowest in the country's armed forces. He said there would be replacements in the fleet command. Grachev said Russia would keep all its five arms of defense (the strategic missile forces, the land forces, the air force, the air defense forces and the navy) till the year 2000. He said the Defense Ministry would be paying priority attention to the strategic missile forces, "which are the guarantor of national security both today and in future."
