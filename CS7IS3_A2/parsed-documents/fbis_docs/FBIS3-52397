Within this context, a meeting was held yesterday at the headquarters of the Movement for Democracy in Algeria and included representatives from the National Liberation Front, Islamic Al-Nahda Movement, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], and the Movement for Democracy in Algeria. AL-KHABAR newspaper said in today's issue that preparations have been going on for about a week to hold this meeting, during which the preliminary document, prepared by the National Dialogue Commission, the issue of whether or not to take part in the institutions of the transitional period, and the issue of guarantees and the sides that would participate in the National Conference were discussed. AL-KHABAR added that the participation of the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front occupied a sizable part of the meeting's time. It seems, according to the newspaper, that these parties have formed a unified pivot to put pressure on the National Dialogue Commission when the multilateral meetings are resumed after tomorrow, Wednesday [5 January]. Before the anticipated meetings between the National Dialogue Commission and the parties, the National Party for Solidarity and Development said in a statement, a copy of which was delivered today to APS, that the multifaceted crisis, in particular the political crisis that resulted from the suspension of the December elections in 1991, can only be treated through a serious dialogue between the authority and the three winning parties in the elections. In order to make the National Conference and the transitional period successful, Bencherif's party [National Party for Solidarity and Development] proposes the release of political prisoners, the closure of the detention camps in the south, easing the conditions of the state of siege, and reinstating workers dismissed for their political views. At the end, the statement called for achieving all-embracing reconciliation within the framework of the reciprocal compromises and the return of tranquility to the people.
