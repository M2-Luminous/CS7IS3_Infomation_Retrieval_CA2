Upon his arrival Ejup Ganic gave a brief statement on the cease-fire agreement: [Begin Ganic recording] We have done what the assembly asked us to do. As far as Gorazde and the talks on the four-week cease-fire are concerned, we did not agree to freeze [the positions] that the aggressors tried to impose on us with help from some UN circles, and we tried to decide on what was best for our country. I must say straight away that some new ideas exist. If the arms embargo is not lifted there should be a reduction in armament. [end recording]
