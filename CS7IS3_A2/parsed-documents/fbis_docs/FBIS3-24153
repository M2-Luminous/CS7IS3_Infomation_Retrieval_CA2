Those who read newspapers have already encountered repeatedly sociological statistics which are made to fit the "image and likeness" of particular parties or candidates and induce citizens to join the majority. The psychologists and authors of the advertising texts are aware of this. On one occasion the Democratic Initiative research center decided to conduct an interesting and, as it turned out, instructive experiment. A party that did not figure in the political landscape of Ukraine, but which the sociologists gave a very tempting name, the Order and Justice Party, was included on the list of parties that really exist. It was suggested that those polled indicate which party they are leaning toward. The audacious contrivance of the experimenters proved itself all the way. In terms of its "popularity," the ghost party took an honorable fifth (!) place, leaving many other parties behind, including the Socialist and Communist Parties. What would you think? Ten percent of those polled intended to vote in future elections for a party that does not exist in political nature, or, as many as for the Socialist and Communist Parties. A strange triumvirate of political forces appeared in the imagination of the people, which consisted of two existing parties and one mythical party. There was something very symbolic about this because the entire election campaign of the Socialists and Communists has been built on myths and half-truths. The most ludicrous point was that some of the supporters of the illusory party turned out to be closely familiar with its political program, although such a program does not exist. To be sure, such enthusiasts of "order and justice" were not numerous--0.1 percent. However, the fact itself cannot fail to astonish us as it is eloquent testimony to the level of political thinking of a certain proportion of our fellow citizens, whose political dreams are reduced to two notions--"order" and "justice." As was to be expected, populists and demagogues of all hues immediately took advantage of this and began to juggle words in the ring of the political circus which they themselves created. Naturally, the Ukrainian Justice Party has sprung up like a jack-in-the-box; it is headed by former military intelligence officer Mykhaylo Hrechko--this is a profession that teaches one to collect the necessary information and package it properly to one's benefit. So, can surveys and other forms of the study of public opinion be trusted? To what degree do their data correspond to reality? Sociologists themselves find that only 6 to 8 percent of those polled have clearly defined political convictions, and 10-14 percent try to approach the questions asked in a balanced and sensible manner. The remainder are guided solely by transient, superficial emotional feelings and do not even try to penetrate the essence of the issue. But they are in the majority! The results of the elections in Russia are a vivid case in point. So, what is the result? If statistics are a mirror of the condition of society, are they a warped mirror?... Let us not jump to conclusions because surveys, despite their imperfect methodology, bear testimony to citizens' current sentiment. Naturally we should approach surveys with extreme caution, but it is not worthwhile ignoring and neglecting them, either. We know without surveys that at present many people are looking for their daily bread rather than spiritual sustenance. As the December referendum indicated, two years ago an overwhelming majority of citizens of Ukraine could not conceive of themselves without independence and democracy, naturally hoping for a better life. By now, the horizon of many people has shrunk to the size of their stomach. The time of rallies has gone, and even the most beautiful slogans no longer work. There is little faith in words, just as Shakespeare wrote: "Words have become so false that I loathe to speak the truth with them." At this point a Zhirinovskiy comes along and says confidently: "People, I will get you out of the abyss and I will do it right away." He wins, and he leads them into the abyss. Is the possibility of the appearance of such a Zhirinovskiy ruled out in our country? Undoubtedly, the elections themselves will be the most authentic public opinion survey. Have elections not been already tested in the Crimea to a certain degree? More than 1 million residents of the Crimea have voted in favor of the "sweet life" and "heavenly delights" that were generously promised by the leader of the Republican Movement of the Crimea, Yu. Meshkov. He skillfully convinced the citizens that once he was elected president, the autonomous republic would automatically turn into one big Bounty, the Black Sea would flow with milk and honey, and the Crimean Mountains would become mountains of gold. Meshkov did not rape the residents of the Crimea. He seduced them with allusions to "my great potential [rendered in Russian in the original]," without overly concealing that this "potential" is obviously found in the safes of enterprises such as MMM, which would "make yours a golden voucher [rendered in Russian in the original]" (in Ukraine itself there are many such Meshkovs who will also proclaim their "great potential [rendered in Russian in the original]," expressively looking north and advocating entry into the ruble zone). Objectively, Nikolay Bagrov had no chance of winning. By voting against him, the Crimea voted against the former secretary of the oblast committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, whom everybody has gotten sick of, and against post-Communist figures who, seizing power on the sunny peninsula, displayed their complete inability to control complex political and economic processes and yet displayed uncommon sagacity in the domain of "grab-it-ization," which each resident of the Crimea was well aware of. Thus, the choice in this instance came down to a simple alternative: vote for what has already been or for what might be. Since it cannot be any worse than it is, the choice was made in favor of the person who promised a Garden of Eden in the "muscatel-and-cypress republic." However, the Crimea is relatively small. It is hard to hide things there, or to hide oneself. Ukraine is large; it is possible to hide out there. To be sure, the roots of our troubles are hidden and secreted deeply, whereas their originators--Communists "and their ilk"--are trying to convince everyone that they have nothing to do with the troubles. The calculation is simple: Many people still expect solely the state rather than themselves to have to worry about their welfare. The illusion mounts in society that a real hero will finally come, and the next morning life will improve. Once again the Communists are angling for this role, as if they were not the ones to have already turned life into a frightening story. The populist clamor of representatives of post-Communist and Communist majority in the parliament demanding the establishment of "social justice" of a Bolshevik type is geared primarily toward retirees, who number up to 15 million in Ukraine. According to sociological surveys (let us hope that they are inaccurate), the once threatening student body is displaying strange passivity. It also turns out that among citizens who are active in various organizations, members of hobby clubs--i.e. those who collect stamps, badges, and so on--rank first (2 percent). Only 0.6 percent of those polled belong to political associations, and 0.8 percent belong to sociopolitical associations. Women constitute the predominant proportion of voters; it appears that they weep in unison over the artificial and unceasing suffering of Maria on TV, finding moral comfort in this after the shops and the lines. How will they vote? The statistics are silent. As far as I know, no sociological surveys devoted particularly to studying the views of women have been carried out. So, what are we common voters to do? Are we to wait for sociologist-scientists to tell us about ourselves and suggest a choice? I, for one, will trust my own experience, my own memory, and my own choice.
