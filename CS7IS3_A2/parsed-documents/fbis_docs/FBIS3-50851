"I wish to advise all concerned that the police service, as the state agency charged with the responsibility to maintain law and order in the society, would take prompt and decisive action to deal with any attempt to disrupt the peace, order and tranquility of the society," Bernard said after Abu Bakr said his group felt as "oppressed" as it had when it staged the insurrection. "It is important that all persons who may be inclined to embark on a path of unconventional behaviour be warned that the police would be vigilant and prepared to deal with any such activities." Bakr, during a news conference, expressed dissatisfaction over the long time the court of appeal took in delivering the judgment in the dispute over lands the Muslimeen claims at Mucurapo in the northern township of St James. The Muslim leader said his organisation had many options open to it regarding the land dispute with the government. "We can't just starve to death and do nothing. The government is treating us unjustly. We have many options and we would not sit and do nothing. We will use the best option available to us," he told reporters. He said that the organisation was not doing anything to create tension. Abu Bakr added,"we are feeling oppressed and we would like to defend ourselves. "The same kind of oppression resulted in the 1990 insurrection." The Muslimeen held parliamentarians hostage in 1990, complaining of victimisation and economic hardships. Bakr and 113 followers who gave themselves up afterwards were freed in 1992 after a high court found that an amnesty which they received from acting President Emmanuel Carter was valid. Previous governments and the Muslimeen have been at loggerheads over the ownership of the land, which eventually ended up in the courts. Bakr, at the news conference, also complained that the state had failed to pay compension for the destruction of several buildings on the Mucurapo lands which were gutted by fire, shortly after the six-day siege of parliament.
