I found the permanent accusations of Meciar wanting to install a presidential system suspicious from the very start, as he was not the president. Logic clearly tells one that he would be against himself. But who is asking for logic! Anyone assaults logic nowadays. Am I not right, Your Excellency? Or do you think that the ruling by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic concerning interpretation of Article 111 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic--I quote: "The president of the Slovak Republic appoints and recalls other members of the government at the proposal of the prime minister...."--that the president need not accept the prime minister's proposal, and interpretation of Article 87, section 2--I quote: "Laws passed by the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] are signed by the NRSR chairman, the president of the Slovak Republic, and the prime minister of the Slovak Republic"--that the prime minister is obliged to sign a law after its second approval in the NRSR, is in conformity with logic? The diction in both instances is the same. Or is this contradictory interpretation by the Constitutional Court due only to ignorance of the Slovak language? Let us return, however, Your Excellency, to the Constitutional Court's ruling on Article 111 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic that Your Excellency need not accept the prime minister's proposals for the appointment of other government members. This is fabulous! Now and in the future, Your Excellency can completely ignore election results. Your Excellency will simply refuse to appoint a minister as long as the new prime minister will not propose to you the "right" one, selected by Your Excellency. Incidentally, why should you not also choose a prime minister who is to your liking? Nowhere in the Constitution of the Slovak Republic is it written that anyone has the right to propose to Your Excellency a prime minister, let alone that Your Excellency would have to accept such a proposal. It is only a good custom in democracies that candidates for government members are nominated by the political entity that had won the elections and that the president accepts these candidates. But why should you let yourself be guided by this? After all, it is only a custom from something called democracy. Who cares about citizens' will? One need not worry one's head about that. As a matter of fact, even though, according to Article 102, letter (f) of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, you appoint and recall the prime minister and other members of the government, it is not written there that you must appoint a prime minister. Why not try it out? Following the ruling by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic on Article 111 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, I would not be surprised at all if the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic arrived at the conclusion that you need not appoint a prime minister. Let us return, however, to the gratifying possibility of ignoring election results, which the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic placed in your hands. Should the election winner disagree with the government selected by Your Excellency and NRSR deputies refuse to approve its policy statement, you will simply send them home, under Article 102, letter (d) of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, and will dissolve parliament. Even though the Constitution states that the NRSR chairman will call new elections within 30 days, it is not written there that he must do so. The devil knows how the Constitutional Court would decide. Does he have to? Does he not have to? Must he not? Does Your Excellency realize those amazing possibilities? A single ruling by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic managed to turn the entire system of power upside down. A parliamentary system has been transformed into a presidential one! Article 102, letter (d), whose original aim was to compel the election winner to responsibly approach the government formation, has been turned into a dangerous weapon against democracy in the hands of Your Excellency. Your Excellency has really pulled it off. Let me congratulate you once again. I always knew that one should not forget popular wisdom. The one, for example, about the thief shouting catch the thief. [Signed] Jozef Prokes, NRSR deputy P.S. Does Your Excellency think that the ruling by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic on Article 111 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic is a consequence of the insufficient ability to think logically and to work out in one's mind the consequences of one's decisions or that it is the result of ignorance of the Slovak language? Or is something completely, but completely, different involved? P.P.S. I dared express my opinion. Is that still allowed?
