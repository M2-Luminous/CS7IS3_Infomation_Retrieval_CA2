Narasimha Rao today when several leaders of Jammu and Kashmir, including former Chief Minister and National Conference leader Dr. Farooq Abdullah and Pradesh [state] Congress chief, Mr. Ghulam Rasool Kar, called on him and sought immediate changes in the administrative set up in Jammu and Kashmir if the political process in the State was to be initiated. The leaders included the Janata Dal chief of Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Abdul Qayaum. It may be mentioned that earlier these leaders had refused to accompany Minister of State for Internal Security Rajesh Pilot during his Kashmir tour because they felt that no purpose will be served unless the administrative set up in the State was changed to make it more responsive. These leaders had also submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister seeking changes in the administrative set up including change of Governor and top officials including Chief Secretary and senior police officials. The appointment with Prime Minister for Kashmiri leaders was fixed yesterday by Minister of State for Internal Security Rajesh Pilot who also accompanies these leaders. It may be mentioned that while Mr. Pilot has been supporting the demand for change, Home Minister S.B. Chavan is opposed to any change and feels that the Governor is doing a good job and should not be disturbed. The choice before the Prime Minister is difficult as both groups are adamant that holding of elections in the State which are necessary for restoring normalcy will be possible only if the alternative suggested by them was accepted. Mr. Pilot is also reported to have felt enthusiastic about the surrender of militants before him in Kupwara and large response received at the public meeting addressed by him. He is reported to have conveyed that in case administrative changes are made the militancy can be given a crushing blow. He has also suggested that for this purpose a surrender policy should be formulated so that militants fed up with insurgency could lay down arms. The Minister for Internal Security is also proposing an amendment in the Criminal Procedure Code to implement his assurance that parents of every person taken into custody will be informed within 48 hours after the arrest. This assurance was earlier given by the Minister in Jammu and Kashmir, but now he wants to enforce it throughout the country. According to reports, the Jammu and Kashmir Governor, K.V. Krishna Rao, is also expected here shortly to brief the Central leaders. The Home Secretary has also had talks with the State officials about the proposed changes in the State. In the meantime, the leader of the Panthers Party and convener of the conference of Kashmiri leaders in Vienna Mr. Bhim Singh is continuing with preparations even though some leaders including former Chief Minister Dr. Farooq Abdullah and former Health Minister Karan Singh have expressed their inability to attend the conference. The details of the proposed meet were discussed today at a lunch meeting which among others was attended by the leader of the All Party Hurriyat Conference. They included Professor Abdul Ghani Bhat, Justice Bahauddin Farooqi, and Mr. Abbas Ansari. According to reports, some leaders from Jammu and Ladakh including Mr. P. Namgyal former MP will also be going to Vienna to take Part in the meeting. Among the leaders who got in touch with Mr. Singh today about the meet was former hijacker of Indian Airlines plane Hashim Quereshi. According to reports there are also doubts if Pakistan Government will allow Sardar Abdul Qayum to go to Vienna to attend the conference. There are also differences within the Hurriyat Conference on the issue of participation as leaders like Syed Ali Shah Gilani of Jamaat-i-Islami, Mr. Abdul Ghani Lone of People's Party, and Mr. Shabir Shah of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front will be unable to attend as they are in custody and so far there is no move to release them to enable their participation in the conference. PTI adds: The Kashmir All-party Hurriyat Conference leadership held discussions with former State Government Karan Singh. [sentence as published] The Hurriyat leaders said later "we exchanged ideas and shared perceptions" with him. "Dr. Karan Singh does owe a duty to people of Jammu and Kashmir not as a son of Maharaja, but as a genuine and forthright seer in politics." Confirming the meeting, the former Governor said there had been a free and fair exchange of views. "I am not discouraged by their views", Dr. Karan Singh added. This also called for release of all detained Kashmiri political leader to create a congenial atmosphere for a dialogue. "The release of Jamaat leader Syed Ali Shah Gilani, People's Conference Chairman, Mr. Abdul Ghani Lone and militant chiefs Yasin Malik and Shabir Shah," Prof. Abdul Ghani said, would "create the right atmosphere for holding of such a free and frank dialogue." The four leaders awaiting clearance of the Central Government for their proposed visit to the Austrian capital of Vienna for a meeting of leaders from both sides of Kashmir asserted that such a dialogue would help in solving the Kashmir issue.
