At the same time, Montero reported that said appointment has the president of the Republic's blessing. Montero Revette had avoided making statements on the matter on Tuesday. But, speaking this Wednesday at the Miraflores presidential palace, he made extensive comments on this matter at the conclusion of a regular Council of Ministers meeting. The defense minister justified that appointment of Munoz Leon, recalling the admiral's military career, indicating that he came to this position without having missing one promotion: "He held the post of chief of the Navy's staff, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and he was defense minister; therefore he has enough experience in the military field." Montero added: "He was going to be living in the United States anyway on his own account. I asked him to be an ad honorem adviser; he will not draw a salary. He will advise, on an ad honorem basis, four departments that we have in the United States on military purchases. He has a great deal of experience in the military field, and he can advise us because he knows all of the organization's problems." Questions for the Minister Reporters asked the minister several questions. [Reporter] Is there no one else with the same knowledge in the military field? [Montero] I would like to know if there is. Previously, when he was defense minister, even before he was defense minister, hardly anyone ever questioned him. Maybe he was questioned about some things he said during his seven-month tenure, but Munoz Leon's military career cannot be criticized. Besides this is an ad honorem post. [Reporter] Why was he given a diplomatic passport? [Montero] He was given a diplomatic passport because the Defense asked for one. [Reporter] Where in the United States will he live? [Montero] I do not know exactly where. [Reporter] It is not clear why he has a diplomatic passport if he is not a member of the Venezuelan diplomatic corps in the United States. [Montero] He is a member of the diplomatic corps in the United States because he has an ad honorem post as a Defense Ministry adviser in military organizations through which we trade with the United States. [Reporter] Are there other advisers with diplomatic passports? [Montes] No, we have not issued any during my tenure. I do not know if other ministries have done so. [Reporter] Mr. Minister: The Foreign Service law establishes that the members of a diplomatic mission, in order to perform their duties, are accredited by one nation to the other. If Admiral Munoz Leon is an ad honorem adviser and not a representative of a mission, why is he then issued a diplomatic passport? [Montes] You could say that he is an ad honorem adviser because he will not draw a salary. Nevertheless, I do need him, with his contacts--he even took the Inter-American Defense course--to give us a lot of advice because he knows about the problems. It is easier for him to travel to Venezuela to report to me on what is going on over there than to have officials from there come back here. [Reporter] Is he going to be a member of the diplomatic mission? [Montes] He is a member of the diplomatic mission. [Reporter] Excuse me, Mr. Minister, he has said that a split had occurred in the FAN [National Armed Forces] over the president's decision not to appoint him defense minister. How could this appointment possibly have occurred? [Montes] Look here, listen to the following; I am going to repeat myself. Maybe--you know him--he made this remark on the spur of the moment because he was not appointed defense minister. It is not that he was not appointed; he was not reconfirmed. I spoke to him subsequently on several occasions. He is aware that what he said was a rash reaction, but he does have position within the military. He is an officer with almost 30 years of experience. He knows the organization, he knows the organization's problems, he has run the organization. Therefore, I appointed him, having taken this into account. [Reporter] Former Commander Chavez confirmed MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] and Radical Cause's charges about the defense minister's alleged plan to stage a coup. Doesn't this contradict the appointment somewhat? [Montes] When anyone here attacks a military man, they accuse him of planning a coup. If Commander Chavez, who was detained, has hard evidence that a coup was being planned, let him present the evidence to the court. It is very easy to talk. I want evidence because I am not going to fall into the trap of believing everything that many people like to say, just to talk. Gentlemen, evidence must be presented. [Reporter] Does the appointment have the president of the Republic's blessing? [Montes] Of course it does. I must submit every appointment to the president of the Republic for approvel. I requested this appointment. No Millions To Equip the Fan Meanwhile, the defense minister denied information to the effect that in going over the accounts with the president, he asked that 86 billion bolivares be earmarked for the FAN's equipment. It was also reported that all the officers who returned from Peru had decided to accept a court martial. Montes also said he will not get involved in "tit-for-tat bickering" with former Commander Chavez Frias, although he said it is wrong to think, as the coup leader said, that armed struggle is a valid means of attaining power. He noted: The nation wants peace, tranquillity, and progress. As far as patrolling the Gulf of Venezuela--reported by his colleague Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas--he said the physical presence that has always existed will be reinforced in a more organized fashion.
