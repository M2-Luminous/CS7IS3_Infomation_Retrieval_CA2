FR940921-2-00084 FR940921-2-00069 The Air Transport Association (ATA) has commented that: FAA has informally construed the Part 49 regulations to allow conveyance transactions to be recorded without certain sensitive information *␣*␣*. ATA suggests that what FAA is doing is in the nature of interpreting section 503(a) of the Act and that ``interpretative rules'' are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) from formal rulemaking requirements. (``General statements of policy'' are also exempt under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).) Federal courts have applied various tests, singly or in combination, to attempt to distinguish between interpretative and legislative rules (e.g., ``substantial impact;'' ``deference to agency label;'' ``legal effect;'' ``binding norm''). See Administrative Conference of the United States, A Guide To Federal Agency Rulemaking, 55&hyph;68 (2d ed. 1991), pages 55 through 68. More recently, in determining whether rules are either legislative or interpretative, courts have focused on the legal effect of the rules. See e.g., American Min. Congress v. MSHA, 995 F.2d 1106 (D.C. Cir. 1993). ``A statute or legislative rule that actually establishes a duty or right is likely to be relatively specific (and the agency's refinement will be interpretative), whereas an agency's authority to create rights and duties will typically be relatively broad (and the agency's actual establishment of rights and duties will become an amendment merely because it supplies crisper and more detailed lines than the authority being interpreted). If that were so, no rule could pass as an interpretation of a legislative rule unless it were confined to parroting the rule or replacing the original vagueness with another.'' Id. at 1112. Consequently, the FAA's delineation of section 503(a) as permitting the continued recordation of conveyances with omissions or redactions of financial data is interpretative and not legislative in nature. Finally, we note that a commenter suggests that the FAA should adopt a UCC-like approach and only require that a filed document indicate that a party has conveyed title to or has an interest in a civil aircraft. By this opinion, we intend only to affirm the continuation of permitting schedules containing confidential, proprietary information to be redacted or omitted from otherwise recordable documents. With respect to particular documents, the advice of the Assistant Chief Counsel for the Aeronautical Center should be sought. ␣␣Sincerely, John H. Cassady, Deputy Chief Counsel.
