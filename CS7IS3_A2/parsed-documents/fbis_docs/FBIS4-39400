A United Democratic Center Has Been Formed"] [Text] On 4 June a conference was held in Moscow by activists of regional branches of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], the Russian Social Democratic People's Party, the Democratic Party of Russia, Russia's Choice, the Russian Democratic Reforms Movement, and other parties and movements that are or were part of the democratic political spectrum. Furthermore, State Duma deputies and Duma faction and political party experts also took part in the conference. According to the conference organizers, the need for holding such a meeting was conditioned by the crisis currently unfolding in regional democratic organizations, and also the results of elections to the Federal Assembly and local representative power bodies. Thus, organizing committee representative Vladimir Zharikhin (PRES apparatus) noted that conflicts "at the top" between Moscow leaders negatively affect the activity of provincial primary cells. According to Zharikhin, the reason for the centrist associations' relative failure in the elections was the fact that their leaders did not manage to come to agreement among themselves, while the activists of various regional party branches are accustomed to working together, under "one roof." Irina Zubkevich, deputy chairperson of the Duma Committee on Public Associations and Religious Organizations (Democratic Party of Russia faction); and Vladimir Komchatov, the president's representative in Moscow, confirmed their colleague's point, noting that the "provincials," who have worked together for many years, often do not understand the reasons for disagreements in Moscow. At the same time, some of the "regionals" said quite openly that elections to the Federal Assembly destroyed democratic blocs that had existed for several years. It was no accident that the new organization's first statement says that "the leaders' interests are isolated from the interests of individual people, voters, and rank and file members of political parties." The conference participants virtually unanimously recognized the need for a new association. In this context one of the participants observed that "unless we hang together, we shall all hang separately." Judging by the organizers' plans, the United Democratic Center will not necessarily acquire the form of an election association or independent political party. At least, the majority of the conference participants did not express the wish immediately to leave their parties' ranks. The new organization intends to promote "a new political wave that would bring up new leaders and create new organizational forms of democratic activity." To accomplish these aims, the United Democratic Center plans to create an information network and organize political workshops inviting foreign experts. The creation of financial groups to support regional democratic organization activities is not ruled out.
