In an attempt to silence the criticism, the police have directly contravened the instructions of the senior patriarch Deng Xiaoping, who offered his personal protection to the reporter. The case could prove a watershed in determining which counts more: the law, or the personal instructions of a senior leader. Xu Keren, who writes for the lively XINMIN EVENING NEWS [XINMIN WANBAO], was detained in January after the paper ran a series of articles revealing the links between the Shanghai Public Security Bureau (PSB) and the city's nightclubs, according to sources at the paper. The articles showed that the PSB directly ran some nightclubs and colluded with owners to charge exorbitant fees, from which it received kickbacks. Xu was released a day later after the ailing Deng, who was in town for the lunar new year, reacted against the interference, the sources said. "We must protect the pen as well as the sword," Deng was reported to have said on hearing of the incident. The 10-character statement, relayed through his daughter and unofficial press aide, Deng Rong, was enough to ensure that Xu was released from detention, the sources said. After Deng left Shanghai in mid-February, the PSB filed a libel suit against Xu and the paper's editors alleging that the articles were "malicious" and "without foundation". Court officials are understood to be gathering material and advice from party and government leaders in Shanghai on how to proceed. "The case has not opened yet, so no one is willing to discuss it right now," a source said last night. "The police believe that they can achieve through legal means what senior leaders stopped them from doing through harassment." Xu's home phone has been bugged and he is under constant surveillance from plainclothes policemen. His passport, revoked in February as he tried to board a plane for Japan where his wife lives, has not been returned. "Xu's situation remains precarious, but all staff on the paper as well as some central leaders are behind him," one source said. XINMIN EVENING NEWS is one of only nine government-run papers nationwide whose circulation increased last year. The paper had already had one confrontation with the local PSB at the time of Deng's visit, when it was barred from reporting on the beating to death of an innocent bus driver on January 1 by nightclub guards who were believed to be off-duty PSB officers. The real nature of the so called "1-1" incident is still murky, but there are rumours that the VIPs inside the nightclub (whose parked limousines had blocked the road, precipitating the incident) were part of Deng's entourage, some of whom had arrived in Shanghai in early December. Among Chinese liberals, the Shanghai PSB has the worst reputation for intimidation and harassment in the whole of China. The recent round-up of dissidents in China during visits by leaders from the United States, Japan and France was said to have been carried out most efficiently in Shanghai, where surveillance may be even stricter than in the capital. The Shanghai PSB's business empire, part of which was the subject of Xu's reports, has run rampant since the mid-eighties and is said to include nightclubs and other service businesses.
