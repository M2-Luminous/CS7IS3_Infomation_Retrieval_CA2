The plan is to establish control, education, and health promotion policies, as well as to work on drug prevention programs and the struggle against drug trafficking, as part of a plan to change the antinarcotics strategy. In Jose Luis Harb's opinion, the most important achievements in international negotiations were those reached with the Chilean Government. He asserted: "Important agreements have been reached for the establishment of common and reciprocal actions in the interdiction field, and for the exchange of information on the border control and particularly on illegal precursors smuggled into the country." The "narco-influence" ["narco-influencia"] phenomenon, which the government has identified as the "number one" threat to youths in Bolivian territory, has increased the level of drug consumption in the country to 2 percent of the Bolivian population. According to a study conducted by the Drug Prevention and Social Rehabilitation Undersecretariat, "narco-influence" has become the main concern of the Government Ministry due to Bolivia's character as a drug producer and generator of cocaine trafficking to the rest of the world. Jose Luis Harb commented: "Most youths start off by getting involved in drug production, then in drug trafficking, and they end up becoming highly addicted." This is how the "narco-influence" phenomenon is generated in Bolivia, although he did not mention the true origin of "the youths' involvement in the underworld." [passage omitted]
