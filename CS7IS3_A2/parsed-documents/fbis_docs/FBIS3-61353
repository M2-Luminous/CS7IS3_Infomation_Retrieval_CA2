The results of the two years following the gaining of independence by Ukraine and the election of Leonid Kravchuk to the presidency are joyless, sad, and in many ways tragic. The country that set out on an "unrestricted cruise" with dignity and integrity is now increasingly reminiscent of a wagon rolling downhill whose wheels and shocks are breaking off and speeding every which way as it rolls. It appears that we will no longer be able to stop and that the wagon, and all of us with it, will end up in an abyss. This is what Ukraine has today: a paralyzed economy and financial system, a most profound crisis in all spheres of life; inflationary processes have already turned into superhyperinflationary processes (on this score we are next only to Serbia where, unfortunately, a war is on). The pace of destruction is far greater than that of our creative activities, which makes it possible to refer not only to Ukraine turning into a Latin American banana appendage, but also to conclude that the threat of the nation dying off is very real. How could this happen? Who is to blame? First of all, the state authorities, which have taken care to preserve the old system of the nomenklatura-Soviet-communist monopoly behind the new attributes. Monopoly has become a reliable barrier in the path of all reforms. Thus, Ukraine was perhaps the only European country to successfully maintain the old system "safely and entirely," and to neutralize political forces of a democratic persuasion by way of their splintering and elementary graft, which has made it possible for the turncoat party nomenklatura to not just hold onto its complete power but to also to reinforce it. In this instance, the role of the parliament is instructive. For the first time, democratic forces have appeared within it; they accounted for one-third of deputies, which sufficed to assert differences of political opinion and create a constructive opposition to the Communist Party bosses, kolkhoz and sovkhoz estate owners, the "Red directors," and other representatives of the "aggressively obedient" majority. However, L. Kravchuk, I. Plyushch, and V. Durdynets, who cut their teeth on nomenklatura intrigues and honed their skills for many years in the "golden cage" on Ordzhonikidze Street, together with the died-in-the wool fraternity of oblast committee secretaries, did everything to block the operation of the parliament. This was executed masterfully. Pitting the Reds, the yellow-and-blues, the rosy, and the just plain sickly people's deputies against one another, the ruling nomenklatura undertook to sell out Ukraine and its wealth against the background of a political struggle. The deputies and the people were fooled in a classical manner--governments and programs for overcoming the crisis changed; "tame" political parties were created; the president proclaimed himself the guarantor of Ukrainian independence; from time to time the attention of the public was diverted toward "white brothers and sisters" or the Russian threat. At the same time, everything possible was exported from Ukraine, plundered, and "grab-it-ized." The mafia, corruption, and oligarchy, or in simpler terms, the fusion of the criminal underworld with the powers that be, permeated the entire societal pyramid, beginning with its very apex and on down to the least of the officials issuing export licenses. Graft and bribery are reaching a zenith--bribes are given and taken not only in "green envelopes" but in entire files and attache cases stuffed with dollars. The expression "bribe suitcases" has taken root in the vernacular. A colleague told me on one occasion: I was flying in from Asia; there are no direct flights; you have to change planes in Zurich. I took a look: Everyone on the plane was ours: some ministers, bankers, prominent merchants--a well-known company. I asked a friend: "What are you returning from--some kind of symposium?" "No, everyone was there on business. I for one flew to visit a bank and checked on my accounts." Not having a personal foreign exchange account abroad is now considered bad form in the milieu of those who govern us. Prospects Having successfully "done in" a referendum on confidence in the president and the Supreme Council, L. Kravchuk and I. Plyushch began to seriously prepare for new elections. As a result of very refined, jesuitically sophisticated, and crafty efforts the Law on Elections appeared, which caused the whole civilized world to laugh. First of all, it is majority-based, i.e. the kind we got used to during the years of Soviet power. Second, candidates for deputies will be nominated by labor collectives, while political parties will be virtually unable to influence the course of elections and the qualitative composition of deputies. Third, the practice of electing deputies who are not responsible for their actions to anybody or anything, except the "mythical" voters, will continue. All of this means the collapse of illusions concerning the formation of a professional, reformist parliament. That is to say, the political and economic situation which has emerged in the country will be preserved for a few years to come, which, of course, is advantageous for the forces that hold power at present. As before, they count on "making it" as deputies in remote rural districts, exploiting the oppressed and confused condition of the people. The composition of the Central Electoral Commission, which consists mainly of people loyal to the president and the speaker, headed by Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission I. Yemets, who worked on the president's staff, testifies to how seriously and actively the party of power of L. Kravchuk and I. Plyushch is preparing for the elections. Methodological recommendations have been distributed to the localities and regions through the channels of both the soviets and presidential structures, which contain an analysis of the array of forces, recommendations on how to act in particular cases, who to nominate, who to block, and precisely how to do it. One such study which originated in the recesses of the administration of the president was printed in NEZAVISIMOST toward the end of last year with a view to familiarizing the voters with methods used by the representatives of the party of power. The special services have also been drawn into the effort. They have been charged with monitoring, through all operational and informant techniques, the receipt of assistance from abroad by democratic candidates. Finally, the special services will embark on carrying out their principal mission: looking for spies. The editorial office has learned of the establishment of a special, independent division for discrediting future "particularly dangerous" candidates for deputies and presidential candidates, which does not depend on either the Security Service of Ukraine or the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Techniques of political investigation, surveillance, and a thorough study of the "subject" will be used to this end. When compiling a character profile, one should answer these questions: Does the contender have a family? Where does his wife work? Does he have an official or personal car (the make is indicated)? What is his standing in the office? Does he celebrate holidays together with fellow workers? What does he drink--prestigious drinks, or does it make no difference to him? What are his hobbies? Does he have a mistress? What does he do in the evening? And so on, and so forth. There are grounds to believe that all this information will be used against democratic candidates by way of producing special leaflets which will be dropped in every mailbox, as is now the case with some newspapers. Incidentally, about the newspapers. As the election draws closer they are thinking about newspapers more often than usual. According to available information, appropriate work has already been done with a number of publications; they have been geared toward candidates who are "ours"; they have received instructions and motives to use in refusing to publish democrats or let them speak. This was stated recently by V. Pavlyuk, editor in chief of the disgraced Hart Studio. Here is an altogether amusing piece of information. S. Kichigin, the former president of the Dovira company and the former president of the newspaper (?) KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, became the editor in chief of this publication, having single-handedly fired from the job the well-known journalist A. Shvets. Understandably, this could happen only in a highly independent and democratic newspaper. However, something else is of the essence. As it became known, the dismissal of A. Shvets was the second condition which representatives of the administration of the president set for S. Kichigin. The first and key condition was to change the political line of the newspaper and unconditionally support all candidates of the party of power during the elections. In return, S. Kichigin was granted an "indulgence" in the form of a prolongation of credit and debt (totalling over 10 billion karbovantsy) until the end of March of this year, that is, until the elections. Subsequently, it will be possible to forgive the debt altogether if the newspaper fulfills its obligations and everything ends well for the current inhabitants of the "golden cage." This is how the party of power operates. What about the opposition, the national-democratic forces, organizations of state and market orientation? Alas, they are splintered and disjointed due to their own ambitions, intrigues, offenses, pride, and their own delusions of grandeur. It appears that they will still be unsuccessful in creating or contrasting anything of value. Besides, in the eyes of the people they are quite compromised, due to the care that was taken by yesterday's Communists. It is not surprising that in independent sociological surveys they hold between 5 and 8 percent of the vote. The Communists lead in these projections, who, in tandem with the Socialists, are capable of getting up to 55 percent in the new parliament. It is noteworthy that up to 23 percent of the vote goes to so-called "pure" and "independent" candidates whose names are known to few. However, having "made it" to the parliament, they will turn out to be closely tied to mafia structures, as well as to banking and entrepreneurial structures. However, the scenarios whereby homegrown communist-fascists come to power or still the same Communist Party nomenklatura survives are not ruled out. I do not doubt that many familiar individuals from the current parliament will be among the contenders. Many of them have come to like the comfortably sated existence built on using the erstwhile privileges of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine and meeting the mercenary interests of the present-day commercial structures, and they are not averse to extending it. I have repeatedly heard cynical narratives of people's deputies who have already "staked out" their districts. Using money wheedled out in advance for future services (for example, familiarization with the drafts of new laws), the deputies "bend over" for the voters every which way they can--they hand out sops to families with many children, lay the foundations of kindergartens and hospitals, open free cafeterias, and so on, and so forth. I for one have no particular doubt that they will be reelected. Alas, we have to talk about the imperfection and even fallaciousness of the very procedure of elections under the current economic conditions, whereby people reduced to the extreme stages of poverty and hunger are prepared to give everything away for crumbs from their master's table; they are prepared to give not only their votes but the shirts off their backs so that their children will not end up without clothes and barefoot in the snow on the street. Besides, the results of the elections in Russia confirm it: Zhirinovskiy's fascists and Zyuganov's Communists are in power. I will venture to predict their close rapprochement in the parliament; after all, the objectives of both are the same--totalitarianism, dictatorship, monopoly on power. The election struggle is going to be cruel. The political melee will shatter a great many careers and lives. The striving of genuine intellectuals, of people with integrity and honesty to not get involved in the dirty free-for-all, to keep their souls pure, and to distance themselves from lies and provocations is natural. This is why I for one have difficulty imagining that the new deputies coming to power will be better than the current owners of credentials. That is to say, the elections will hardly be able to change the situation radically. Conclusions The results are joyless, the prospects are hazy, and the conclusions are sad. As of now there is no force in Ukraine that is capable of winning the elections, forming the government, and averting a catastrophe. There is chaos in the economy; in politics, the party of power holds sway, and people are demoralized. This is why, to my mind, the coming elections cannot do anything good for the democratic forces; their outcome has been predetermined in favor of the nomenklatura. The threat of resuscitation of the Communist regime or the establishment of an authoritarian dictatorship is real. The situation is being complicated by the syndrome of the regions "pulling apart," the symptoms of which--attempts to withhold payment of taxes, creation of free economic zones, presidential elections in the Crimea, fuelling of tension in the Donbass, etc.--are apparent. In a situation in which all power belongs to the president (although he and his clique are trying to shift onto others responsibility for the current condition of Ukraine on various pretexts), his proposal to adopt a law on power acquires a menacingly ominous coloring. In the future, we will remain hostages to L. Kravchuk's ambitions; after all, if such a law is passed, he will still decide the fate of Ukraine single-handedly. In turn, if the new parliament adopts a new Constitution, the separation of powers will be codified in it. This is why it appears that at present elections to the Supreme Council are not the priority task. The elections will resolve nothing. Only an early election of the president of Ukraine and the formation of a reformist government from among professionals, proponents of the market economy such as V. Lanovyy, A. Savchenko, and V. Chernyak, can change the situation and influence it fundamentally. As I see it, there is just no other way out for Ukraine at present. The only issue is just how blind the current parliament is in failing to see that which lies on the surface.
