TISHRIN Says: In his speech, President Hafiz al-Asad called for serious work in order to continue the march of construction and liberation within the framework of deep-rooted and effective national unity. President al-Asad said: There is a lot to be accomplished and immense responsibility to carry out. Let us continue our march, armed with faith in God, and let us redouble our efforts. The people who believed in God, unified themselves, and resolved to regain their rights will surely regain them. TISHRIN emphasizes that while engaged in the battle for just and comprehensive peace, Syria should mobilize all its capabilities and potentials, whether in the field of internal construction or in the field of unifying the Arab position and urging Arab brothers to rise up to a viable position, especially since the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has shown it is impossible to speak about peace in the Middle East without ending Israeli occupation and dismantling Zionist settlements. The concessions offered by the Palestinian side and the involvement of some Arabs in discussing means of regional cooperation increased Israel's arrogance and aggressiveness. Furthermore, Israel went as far as propagating that it is possible to make peace in the Middle East without Syria and Lebanon. TISHRIN adds: Syria has repeatedly warned against deviating from Arab consensus and the principles of the peace process. Israel used the negotiations card with the Palestinian side in order to evade the peace requisites on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. The result was a horrible massacre and more Israeli killing, sieges, and starving. At present, the occupied territories are subject to the ugliest forms of Zionist terrorism. TISHRIN says this situation requires an all-out review of Arab policies in order to restore pan-Arab solidarity and continue the Arab boycott of Israel, until it accepts the principles of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and returns the Golan, south Lebanon, and all occupied territories. TISHRIN concludes by saying: Syria, now and in the future, will continue to be the same -- no relinquishment of a grain of national soil or any of the nation's rights. Whether the negotiations continue for a long or a short time, the Syrian position will always be based on the aspirations of our Arab people and nation to restore the territories and the shrines, and build a shining future, away from the Israeli aggressive threats.
