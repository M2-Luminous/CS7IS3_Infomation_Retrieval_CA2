FR941117-0-00221 FR941117-0-00014 F. Disclosures Relating to Asset-Backed Securities In 1983, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 to require disclosure of yield information on a customer confirmation, recognizing that such information is important to investors when evaluating the merits of investing in various debt securities. 84 Currently, Rule 10b&hyph;10 requires the disclosure of (1) the yield to maturity, if the transaction is effected on the basis of dollar price; 85 (2) the dollar price calculated from yield, if the transaction is effected on a yield basis; 86 and (3) if effected on a basis other than dollar price or yield to maturity, and the yield to maturity will be less than the represented yield, then both the yield to maturity and the represented yield. 87 84 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19687 (Apr. 18, 1983), 48 FR 17583. 85 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(4)(ii) and (5)(i). 86 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(5)(ii). 87 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(5)(iii). Rule 10b&hyph;10 exempts from the yield disclosure requirements any instrument that is a ``participation interest in notes secured by liens upon real estate continuously subject to prepayment.'' 88 Since the adoption of the yield disclosure requirements, structured financings have expanded to include securities backed by mortgage notes, automobile loans, computer leases, consumer debt, and other receivables. These asset-backed securities raised similar problems of variable yield. Accordingly, the Commission proposed to expand the range of securities subject to the exemptions from yield disclosure to include asset-backed securities that are not insulated from prepayment risk or susceptible to an accurate forecast of yield. 89 88 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10(a)(4)(ii) and (5)(iii). Essentially, this exemption was aimed at mortgage pass-through notes that were issued or guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, Federal National Mortgage Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. 89 See Proposing Release, supra note ___, at 59 FR 12771. In addition, the Commission proposed to require particularized disclosures in connection with transactions in collateralized mortgage obligations (``CMOs''). 90 Specifically, the Commission proposed amendments that would require broker-dealers to disclose on the confirmation the particular CMO's (1) estimated yield; (2) weighted average life; and (3) prepayment assumptions underlying the yield. 91 90 CMOs are collateralized pools of residential mortgage loans that are divided into multiple tranches (sometimes as many as 15 to 20) which can be tailored to a broad spectrum of investors or particularized to the cash flow needs of a single or discrete group of investors. Like other asset-backed securities, the rate of prepayment on the underlying collateral of CMOs is influenced by changes in interest rates and shifts in the general economy, which in turn may affect the actual maturities of CMOs as prepayment speeds accelerate or decrease. CMOs are priced on the basis of the estimated weighted average life of individual CMO tranches. As interest rates decline, prepayments increase, with a corresponding shortening of weighted average life. Conversely, an increase in interest rates results in a lengthening of maturity. 91 Proposing Release, supra note ___, at 59 FR 12771. Some commenters supported the Commission's proposal to require disclosure of CMO information and noted that such disclosures were provided to investors as a matter of course, either in a confirmation or other disclosure statements. 92 Other commenters opposed confirmation disclosure of the estimated yield, weighted average life, and prepayment assumptions on the grounds that the confirmation is not an appropriate disclosure vehicle to convey the information. 93 In addition, commenters opposed disclosing such complex information in a confirmation because it could not be accomplished in a meaningful way due to the document's limited size and space. 94 Many commenters noted that detailed discussions concerning particular aspects of CMOs are contained in the prospectus or other offering documents that are sent to investors prior to the time in which they make their investment decisions. 95 92 See, e.g., Letters from David M. Beckius, Vice President/Sr. Attorney, Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (July 14, 1994); Silas L. Matthies, Sr. Vice President, Norwest Securities, Inc. (June 14, 1994); Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Inc. (June 14, 1994); and Bill Duepree, Jr., President, Morgan Keegan & Co., Inc. (June 1, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 93 Commenters noted that investors receive disclosure documents containing numerous models depicting different prepayment assumptions. These commenters questioned which of the multiple assumptions would be disclosed in the confirmation. See, e.g., Letters from Robert F. Price, Chairman/Federal Regulation Committee, SIA (July 15, 1994); and R. Fenn Putman, Chairman, PSA (June 21, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 94 See, e.g., Letters from Robert F. Price, Chairman, Federal Regulation Committee, SIA (July 15, 1994); R. Fenn Putman, Chairman, PSA (June 21, 1994); and Mitchell Delk, Vice President Government and Industry Relations, Freddie Mac, (June 15, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 95 See, e.g., Letters from Kathryn S. Reimann, Sr. Vice President, Lehman Brothers, Inc. (July 14, 1994); R. Fenn Putman, Chairman, PSA (June 21, 1994); and Mitchell Delk, Vice President/Government and Industry Relations, Freddie Mac (June 15, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. No comments were received regarding the proposal to expand the range of instruments that would be exempted from the yield disclosure requirements. Because some instruments are not subject to predictable forecasts of the yield, the Commission is adopting amendments exempting asset-backed instruments that are continuously subject to prepayment. The exemption would apply only to those instruments that are not insulated from prepayment risk or otherwise susceptible to an accurate forecast of yield. 96 96 This position codifies a no-action position in Letter regarding Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (Oct. 19, 1988), granting no-action with respect to the yield disclosure requirements for those mortgage and asset-backed securities that are not subject to an accurate forecast of yield. The staff noted that if an accurate forecast of yield could be made, then the yield should be disclosed in the confirmation. In addition, in light of the comments concerning the proposed CMO disclosure, the Commission is modifying the amendment requiring the disclosure of prepayment assumptions, weighted average life, and estimated yield of a CMO. The Commission recognizes that broker-dealers intend confirmations to be brief, and thus size limitations may affect the detail of disclosure that may be practically and meaningfully conveyed to the customer. Thus, while yield information is important to investors of CMOs, as well as all mortgage and asset-backed securities, the Commission agrees that these securities contain complexities that are difficult to explain using single figures in a confirmation. Accordingly, rather than require the disclosure in the confirmation of specific numbers identifying the estimated yield, weighted average life, and prepayment assumptions underlying the yield, the Commission is adopting a requirement that broker-dealers include on the confirmation a statement alerting investors that their yields are subject to fluctuation depending on the speed in which the underlying note or receivable prepays and that specific information is available upon written request of the customer. 97 97 This approach builds upon an alternative suggested by one commenter that rather than the proposed disclosure, the Commission impose a requirement that a broker-dealer print a legend on the confirmation. See Letter from Mitchell Delk, Vice President/Government and Industry Relations, Freddie Mac, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 15, 1994).
