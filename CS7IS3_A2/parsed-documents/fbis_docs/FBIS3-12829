'Arafat opened the conference by saying: I extend my heartfelt thanks to President Husni Mubarak, who is standing firmly and strongly with the Palestinian people, their cause, and their sanctities. 'Arafat expressed his appreciation of the firm stance Egypt has taken with the Palestinian people vis-a-vis the heinous massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. I have asked President Mubarak to make efforts with all the parties concerned in the UN Security Council to follow up on this matter, he said, adding: I discussed this matter with Minister 'Amr Musa. On resuming the peace negotiations, 'Arafat said: We cannot talk about negotiations until we see what the situation will be like at the Security Council and until we see the resolution it will adopt. We insist on full condemnation of this heinous crime, international protection for our people, and disarming settlement inhabitants, he stressed. 'Arafat emphasized the need for protecting the Palestinian people, emphasizing that withdrawing settlers from Hebron is essential because these settlements are dangerous. He added that the Israeli Government must take effective and swift measures to control the settlers, because this is its responsibility. Answering a question on the outcome of the talks his adviser, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, held in the United States, 'Arafat said: We hope the United States will take a clear-cut stance to urge the Security Council to issue a resolution--this is very important for the occupied territories, particularly Jerusalem--to disarm settlers and provide international protection for the Palestinians. 'Arafat added that the most important thing is to determine the party that will take charge of protecting Palestinians, because we have an army [as received] to protect the Palestinians from these settlers. 'Arafat affirmed that units of the Israeli Army were involved in the massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa remarked that the situation is too serious to be addressed in a sentimental manner. The matter needs specific measures, he emphasized. The foreign minister underlined the need for the UN Security Council to issue a resolution and enforce certain measures to protect the Palestinians against aggression by the Israeli settlers. Speaking about the minimum Palestinian demands, Musa said that President 'Arafat has already stated this clearly: a UN Security Council resolution and certain measures to guarantee protection for the Palestinians and their safety. The settlements cannot be left the way they are now because this will lead to a repetition of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident, Musa said, hoping the Security Council will adopt a resolution as soon as possible. The UN Security Council resolution must involve the minimum Palestinian demands that are supported by the Arab states and the international community, he stressed. We are very upset at the delay in issuing a resolution because the Hebron incident cannot pass without taking specific measures to avert a recurrence and in the meantime protect the Palestinians in accordance with the international resolutions that should be respected, he emphasized. The foreign minister reiterated that all are acting to issue a resolution and enforce certain measures to protect the Palestinians. We have expressed our regrets and our denunciation of what happened in Hebron, he said, adding that the issue of Palestinian protection and settlers must be taken into consideration. Musa pointed out that as an occupying force, Israel is fully responsible for protecting the Palestinians according to the 4th Geneva agreement. He said that the West Bank and Gaza are under Israeli occupation, according to UN Security Council Resolution 242.
