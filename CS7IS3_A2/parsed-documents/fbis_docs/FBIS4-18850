It is part of the 26 projects chosen by the European Commission for the expansion of the "European transportation networks." The Commission considers no less than 250 airports to be "of European interest," which means they are worthy of being financially supported. Greece probably does not enjoy enough credit on the capital markets to finance such a project. Thus, the European Union [EU] in Brussels is supposed to help -- to a small degree with subsidies from its budget, primarily, however, with the excellent credit standing of its European Investment Bank (EIB). By the end of the decade the Brussels authority wants to raise more than 400 billion German marks [DM] in this way for the traffic infrastructure in the EU -- DM800 billion over the next 15 years, and more than DM1 trillion if electricity and telephone lines are added. One cannot reproach the officials in Brussels for looking in the direction of their Mecca, that is, Paris, or for thinking up a new label in the form of the "trans-European networks," with which they hoped to intensify the redistribution toward the south. There is also a lot going to Germany, for instance new east-west links for high-speed trains. It is in particular this unbiased attitude that bothers some member states. When the finance ministers examined the list of projects in Athens on the weekend, the Italian minister protested against the financing plans for the east-west direction. Rather, the EU should concentrate on the traffic infrastructure at its periphery, which also includes the Italian boot. Thus, redistribution after all? The officials in Brussels have long aroused greed with their plans, and now FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel and others have to recapture the genie that has been let out of the bottle. The EU, quite certainly, has not been passive so far. Last year alone the EIB provided loans of more than DM15 billion for traffic, energy, and telecommunications networks. Therefore, the officials in Brussels are not simply interested in even more capital but in making traffic investments in the member states a matter of the EU as soon as national borders are crossed. The issue is authority and thus power. In this connection, it is quite appropriate that the EU has forced its member states to save money, a constraint by which it does not consider itself bound. If the governments want to fulfill the criteria for qualifying for the monetary union, they have no room for further deficits. Brussels, on the other hand, would enter deficit management on a grand scale.
