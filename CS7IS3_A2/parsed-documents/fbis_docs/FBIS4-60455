In a message he gave today to mark the 31st anniversary of the OAU's establishment in 1963, President Mubarak pointed to the achievements, particularly the Abuja agreement on setting up the African Economic Group, which guided Africa's first step toward economic integration. The president affirmed that this achievement will leave its mark on economic activity on both the regional and global levels. In his message, President Mubarak emphasized that the political achievement was made during the recent African summit in Cairo in 1993, which ratified the Cairo Declaration on setting up a mechanism to resolve African disputes within the framework of the OAU through dialogue and reconciliation. He added that the third achievement was represented in the triumph of wisdom and political will in South Africa; a triumph that resulted in the establishment of the first democratic, nonracist government. He remarked that this government came to reflect the will of most South Africans after three centuries of struggle. Mubarak referred to other African achievements, represented in the pursuit of democracy and pluralism in most African states. He remarked that these two things are bound to enhance stability and create a favorable climate for the continent's economic development. As current OAU chairman, President Mubarak said that in spite of the political and economic achievements in 1994, some African inhabitants persist in the obstinacy they developed as a result of bloody domestic wars and disputes. He referred in that context to deteriorating conditions in Somalia, Rwanda, and Burundi in addition to other problems facing Angola, Liberia, and other states.
