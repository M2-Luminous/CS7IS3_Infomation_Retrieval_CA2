Exercises in the Russian armed forces have come to an almost total halt, says Colonel Erik Rosander. [Begin recording] [Rosander] There is a very low degree of exercises in the units, a very small time set aside for pilots to fly, a low exercise capacity among naval units, but a high degree of exercises for the highest leadership organizations. Thus, the staff service is well trained but the units receive no training. [Reporter] Can one talk about a tendency toward disintegration in the armed forces? [Rosander] No, I don't think one should do that. But one could speak of a state of weakness owing to the lack of money and lack of personnel. [Reporter] How long a period of armament do you reckon is necessary before Russian units can be deployed against a potential enemy outside the former USSR? [Rosander] If they have the economic distribution which prevails at present, with 6-7 percent of GNP allocated to military defense, I would think that it will take a considerable time, and by that I mean in the 10-15-year perspective. But if there is reprioritization and, above all, if the economy can be put into shape, it may be quicker, of course. But the Swedish defense will always have very good advance warning before there may be any possible Russian threats. That is our assessment now. [end recording] [Reporter] Last year, the Russian armed forces commanded more than 1.2 million men. That meant that they were 1 million soldiers short. Many units had no conscripts at all and in addition there was a shortage of young officers. The exception is the airborne troops who are still functioning as elite units. The report also notes that a militarily weakened Russia, which no longer has the capacity to counter external threats with conventioned armed forces, relies to a greater extent than before on strategic nuclear arms. The current openness displayed by Russia makes it easier than before to gain reliable intelligence, says Erik Rosander. [Begin recording] [Rosander] You can travel freely, you can move freely, you can visit ports, naval bases, even naval yards. As I have said before, you can even make a tourist trip to the Murmansk region which was unthinkable before the coup, or before the collapse. [Reporter] Do you judge the information now available from open sources as credible? [Rosander] On the whole, we think so. It corresponds well with the basic data we had before. One can draw analyses from the changes and try to assess the information. It is largely consistent. [end recording]
