The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: "An important task in consolidating and developing the results of the technical revolution in the rural areas is to complete land readjustment and solve the problem of fuel necessary in mechanizing the rural economy." Previously, this farm has been using substitute fuel for trucks. The functionaries and technicians here who keep in mind the party's intention to use more substitute fuel, used substitute fuel for tractors as well and are enhancing the rate of operation. Therefore, fuel for trucks and tractors in this farm are all produced and supplied by substitute fuel, thus enhancing the rate of operation. Experience from this cooperative farm shows that any kind of work can be done by tractors that use the substitute fuel, which will enhance the capability of the work. By operating the tractors with substitute fuel at this cooperative farm, large amounts of materials were transported every year. Every work team and subwork team are using tractors that use substitute fuel for harvesting and plowing. This cooperative farm is planning to use substitute fuel in plowing all the fields and harrowing this year, and is vigorously pushing ahead with this project. These days, the fighters for rural mechanization are producing more substitute fuel, are enhancing the rate of operation of the tractors, and are carrying out quality field plowing. In the past, functionaries and technicians here used substitute fuel to operate water meter and threshing machines. They also used it in irrigating dry fields and in threshing. By making effective use of this experience, functionaries here have set the goal this year to use substitute fuel in irrigating dry fields, threshing rice and corn, and are prudently organizing the work to fulfill such a goal.
