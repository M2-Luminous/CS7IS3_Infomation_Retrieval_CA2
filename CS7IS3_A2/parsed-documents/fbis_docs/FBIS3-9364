In their discussion the two sides focused on continuing the political dialogue at various levels and on relations between the two armies. They also examined ways and means to put the Partnership for Peace plan into practice, as well as a number of international issues, including the situation in former Yugoslavia and in the Russian Federation. The two sides also discussed the visits a number of German figures will pay to Romania this year: Minister of Defense Volker Ruehe, whose visit is scheduled to take place at the beginning of April; Foreign Minister Affairs Klaus Kinkel; Carl-Dieter Spranger, federal minister of economic cooperation; and Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth. Romania's relations with Germany are of particular importance within the context in which Germany is broaching relations with the states in the (?Balkan) area pragmatically and indiscriminately, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mircea Geoana, to our reporter Eugen Baboi at the end of the talks.
