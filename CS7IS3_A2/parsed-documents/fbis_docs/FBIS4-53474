By arranging the settlement of the North Korean refugees here for the first time, the South Korean government is showing to the world its active involvement in matters related to North Korean refugees. The measure also indicates Seoul's will of not remaining a mere observer in the human rights issues of Pyongyang. At the same time, by taking an initiative in bringing home the North Korean defectors, the Seoul government has weighed itself down with many new burdens. Firstly the government should take steps to ensure that the North Korean defectors successfully adapt themselves to life here. More important is the establishment of a comprehensive, consistent policy to deal with the problems of the North Korean defectors until reunification. An increasing number of North Koreans are expected to seek refuge in the South as life in the Communist country becomes tougher due to its sagging economy. An exodus of North Koreans to the South cannot be ruled out if the political system there becomes seriously unstable. Most of all, the Seoul government is required to financially prepare itself for increasing numbers of North Korean refugees here. Under the current law the government provides various kinds of support for resettlement of North Korean defectors, including financial help. But when their number increases to hundreds, thousands or beyond, it will be virtually impossible for the government to take responsibility for all the North Korean defectors. Unofficial counts say up to 2,000 North Korean escapees are already living in China alone. Several problems concerning the North Korean loggers in Russia are also to be resolved. Government officials say some 170 workers have fled their camps in Siberia and 90 of them have expressed their intentions to resettle in the South. Seoul has already announced the repatriation of all the applicants but their plan hardly seems plausible at the moment. The Moscow government is known to allow only North Koreans with permits for residence in Russia to leave for Seoul in order to avoid any friction with North Korea over the issue. But this restriction diminishes to a considerable degree the original purpose of repatriating the North Korean loggers. Under domestic Russian laws, this permission is given only to foreigners who are married to Russian citizens or those who have stayed in Russia for over two years. The applicants need to present passports to confirm their nationality. Political considerations also affect the screening of applicants. Most of the five North Koreans who arrived here yesterday belonged to this category. But most North Korean escapees in Russia do not hold residence permits as they usually failed to carry passports when they left the logging camps. The camps keep the passports of workers to prevent them from fleeing. South Korean officials admit that those who do not qualify for Russian residence permits are the ones who really need to come to the South. Those who have already obtained permission are not in a need to hurry to the South as they have led a comparatively stable life in Russia, they say. The officials refused to give details on how many of the five North Koreans who came to Seoul on the day hold residence permits and how many do not. But it is presumed that one or two do not have permits.
