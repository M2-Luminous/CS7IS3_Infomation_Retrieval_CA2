"Whether this was the intention or not, they revive fears of nationalisation and State control of the economy, with the consequent risk of a further flight of foreign capital." Mandela may have been restating a controversial point in the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP), but "his tone was far from discreet." "Mandela's speech is likely to negate the reassurances he made after publication of the RDP, and also those given by the ANC spokesman on mining, Paul Jourdan." BUSINESS DAY Concern About Partisan Influence on Argus Editors -- "Journalists at THE STAR are apprehensive about what the change of ownership of Argus Newspapers will bring," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 February. "Their apprehension testifies to their independence under Anglo's ownership." The fact that Nelson Mandela has been a house guest of Tony O'Reilly, chief executive of Ireland's Independent Newspapers which acquired 31 percent of Argus Newspapers, and "has O'Reilly's ear need not imply that partisan influence will be exerted on the Argus's editors. Whether this is so will surely become apparent in the run-up to April's election and the early period of ANC rule." "The ANC's Pallo Jordan was right when he said his party's aim was to attract foreign investment, and that it could not be squeamish about which sectors foreign investors targeted." SOWETAN Country May Be Headed for Civil War -- "It is now certain that the rightwing will boycott the elections," notes a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 February. "At worst we seem to be headed for a civil war. The rightwing and its bedfellows in the Freedom Alliance will do everything to thwart or make the elections difficult. The time has come for Government to act decisively against these groups." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN PAC To Acquire Watchdog Role -- "In the new parliament it is probably the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) and left-wing elements of the ANC who will most vocally express popular criticism of ANC leaders and their ability to deliver on the promises," points out a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 11-17 February. "The major divide of South African politics, post-election, will probably be between the ANC and those on its left, notably the PAC, rather than those on its right. Most black voters are likely to see the PAC as the watchdog." Sporadic Violence Likely From Right Wing -- A second editorial says the major question on everyone's lips this week is whether the likely nonparticipation of the Freedom Alliance in the elections is the "beginning of a slippery slide towards civil war." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN believes a generalized right-wing rebellion is unlikely. "The white right is too isolated, too powerless, too divided and too poorly led for full, open revolt." Instead, there may be "an increase in the level of sporadic, targeted violence rather than more widespread revolt. This could make the election ugly, violent and messy, without necessarily preventing it from happening."
