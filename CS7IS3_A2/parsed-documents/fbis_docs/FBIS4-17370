This estate, however, can also aspire to a higher title: Few people today would risk casting doubt on the influence of commercial banks. In all, there are more than 2,000 banks in Russia, and the association has united almost 800 of them -- naturally, the largest and most respectable financial establishments primarily become its members. The banks' actual influence on the economy is so great that both the government and the Central Bank of Russia deemed it necessary to tell the bankers of their intentions. In particular, O. Soskovets, vice premier of the Russian Government, announced an upcoming revision of tax policy. He said that it will be aimed at creating the most favorable possible conditions for capital investments in production. But he at once "gladdened" those assembled with the fact that the government has a project according to which they must channel into developing the agro-industrial complex up to one-half of the profits made on deals in the currency market and on other "speculative" deals. V. Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank of Russia, was the traditional target for the bankers' attacks. They criticized him harshly for the archaic system of transactions, for the inordinately high interest rate on centralized credits, and for many other things. There is no point in enumerating all the grounds for criticism, since this time too Mr. Gerashchenko turned a deaf ear to the rebukes. Even though one of the most painful questions -- the admission of foreign banks onto Russian territory -- was discussed at the congress, it rarely found itself at the center of attention. To all appearances, there will be no radical indulgences for foreign banks in the immediate future.
