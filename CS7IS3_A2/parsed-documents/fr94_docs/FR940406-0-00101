FR940406-0-00101 FR940406-0-00011 Even without implementing HDV ORVR requirements at this time, the ORVR program still provides significant benefits. When viewed as a percentage of sales, ORVR still applies to 91 percent of all gasoline-fueled trucks and 97 percent of all gasoline-fueled vehicles. Similarly, control is still achieved over 86 percent of all gasoline-fueled truck refueling emissions and 94 percent of all gasoline vehicle refueling emissions. Thus, EPA's final decision that ORVR requirements are not required for these vehicles does not significantly reduce the effectiveness of the ORVR program. 4. Applicability to California Vehicles As discussed further in the summary and analysis of comments, today's final rule implements a federal standard applicable to all vehicles sold in the United States. Based on the language in section 202(a)(6) of the Act, EPA considers refueling emissions control to be an evaporative standard. Although California has motor vehicle standards in place for model year 1998 and beyond, including evaporative emission standards, to date EPA has issued no section 209(b) waivers which consider a federal ORVR refueling program when evaluating the protectiveness, in the aggregate, of those standards. However, EPA interprets section 209(b)(3) to provide that once a section 209(b) waiver is granted, compliance with the state program is deemed compliance with the federal program standards. (See 42 FR 3193, January 17, 1977). To the extent that a new federal standard is established subsequent to a waiver, such standard will be considered in a waiver reconsideration or future waiver request consideration. EPA is making no finding at this time how stringency, in the ORVR context, may be considered in a waiver proceeding, should one occur. (It should be noted that EPA in this notice is restating its consistent interpretation for the convenience of rulemaking participants, and does not intend to reopen for reconsideration the issue of the effect of existing section 209(b) waivers on post-waiver regulations.) The California Air Resources Board (CARB) staff has held one workshop to discuss the proper application of refueling control (November 2, 1993). CARB is considering three courses of action: adopting the federal ORVR rule, adopting a California-specific ORVR rule, test, or standard, or maintaining that California's current motor vehicle program, taken in the aggregate, is at least as stringent as the federal program notwithstanding the lack of ORVR controls. If California submits a waiver request for its evaporative emission control program applicable to model year 1998 or thereafter, which does not include federal ORVR requirements, EPA will decide at that time whether California's motor vehicle program is at least as protective as the federal program. 5. Fuels Covered In the September 1991 and May 1993 notices, EPA specifically solicited comments on applying the ORVR requirements to highway motor vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline. Consistent with EPA policy on fuel neutrality and establishing a consistent set of requirements for all fuels, today's rule requires that LDVs and LDTs operating on any fuels be capable of meeting the refueling emission standard described below. It applies to vehicles certified under both 40 CFR part 86 and 40 CFR part 88. Although many commenters stated that the refueling standard should not apply to vehicles operating on diesel fuels, the section 202(a)(6) requirement by its terms applies to all LDVs regardless of the type of fuel used. (In contrast, section 202(k) requires evaporative emission controls only for ``gasoline-fueled motor vehicles''.) However, EPA has attempted to tailor the refueling emission certification requirements to the fuel used. Manufacturers of vehicles capable of operating on gasoline, alcohol, or gasoline/alcohol blends must show that these vehicles comply when refueled with such fuels through testing as described later in this preamble. This requirement applies to dedicated neat alcohol fuel vehicles and vehicles using alcohol blends. Bi-fuel or dual-fuel vehicles must meet the requirements on both fuels. Flexible-fueled vehicles must meet the requirements on all fuel combinations. At the present time the only alcohol fuel affected is methanol. However, a waiver of emission testing requirements is available for those vehicles/fuels which are considered to be inherently low in refueling emissions. EPA believes that a general engineering evaluation approach is acceptable for diesel vehicles and diesel fuels for several reasons. Diesel fuel today has a Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of less than one pound per square inch (psi) (7 kPa) and diesel engines today do not raise the temperature of fuel in their tanks substantially more than do gasoline engines (less than 130 â—‹F under most conditions). For these reasons, the vapor space over the fuel in diesel tanks has a very low concentration of fuel vapor compared to that in gasoline tanks and thus displacement refueling emissions are low. EPA thus expects diesel fuel vehicles to meet the refueling emission standard without a control system.
