The decision was made at a working-level meeting of related government ministries and agencies, including the National Unification Board, the Economic Planning Board, the Foreign, Home, Justice, Labor, and Information Ministries, the Agency for National Security Planning and the National Police Agency, presided over by the chief assistant to the prime minister for administrative coordination, Kim Si-hyong, on Tuesday. Under the measures, the North Korean defectors protection law enacted in June last year will be flexibly implemented, while programs to help North Korean loggers settle in the South as soon as possible will be developed. These programs will include job training and placement, housing assistance and security steps to ensure their safety. In addition, civic organizations such as religious and charity groups will be encouraged to stage fund-raising campaigns for North Korean loggers arriving in the South. The government will hold two or three more working-level meetings to finalize the measures, an official said. For the 10 or so North Korean loggers expected to arrive in the South soon as negotiations with the Russian Government are almost completed, Seoul will provide job training to aid their early settlement in the South, officials said. The South Korean Mission in Moscow has formed a task force to negotiate with the Russian Government on legal procedures for North Korean loggers traveling to the South. Moscow, considering its relations with Pyongyang, has not yet set a policy on North Korean loggers seeking refuge in South Korea, an official said.
