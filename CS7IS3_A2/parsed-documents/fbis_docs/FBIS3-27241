Addressing a national work conference, Fei Ziwen, general manager of the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation, said that China's output of ten types of major nonferrous metals reached 3.27 million tons last year, meeting the 1995 target two years ahead of schedule. "Meanwhile, our corporation has also made great progress in improving productivity by transferring a number of workers to the service sector and other lines of production," Fei told managers of nonferrous metals companies across the country. By doing so, companies attached to the corporation cut their total workforce by 12 percent in 1993, or 90,000 people, he said. He said that his corporation will continue to do so until the end of the century. It plans to transfer another 10 percent of the workforce to other production lines in 1994 and 33 percent by 2000, he added. "China's nonferrous industry is still far behind its colleagues in developed countries in terms of productivity," he conceded. Although the country's present nonferrous metals production is 11 times the amount in the 1950s, the productivity of the industry rose by just 100 percent, he said. He described the 11 percent rise in the industry's productivity in 1993 as a "significant achievement." "Only by continuing to improve its productivity, will China's nonferrous industry become more competitive in the world market," he said.
