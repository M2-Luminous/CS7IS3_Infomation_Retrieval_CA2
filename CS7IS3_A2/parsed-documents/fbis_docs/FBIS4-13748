Al-Hamud told AL-ANBA newspaper that he was positively not "thinking about that during the current stage when Kuwaiti forces needed to concentrate on working and exerting efforts. But he indicated that such measures could be taken in a very limited form with the interest in the work in mind and according to the needs of the next stage. The defense minister clarified that he would settle the issue of summoning the ministry's commanders and officers by the National Assembly's fact-finding committee when he meets its members on Tuesday. Al-Hamud said he would not allow commanders and officers from the ministry to be "dragged in" at any time without the presence of justifications and reasons for such a move, and would not allow them to be summoned just to be interrogated as witnesses in trivial cases or on suspicion of committing something or other. On the other hand, the defense minister said that there had been offers by countries and arms factories to provide the Kuwaiti Armed Forces with weapons, some of which were advanced. These weapons would enter the service of the Kuwaiti Army and could be the first to be introduced in the region. He indicated that relevant committees in the Kuwaiti Army were studying these offers. He said that new arms would be acquired according to the needs of the Kuwaiti forces and their various weapons.
