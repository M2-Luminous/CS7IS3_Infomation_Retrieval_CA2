As Rexrodt described his meeting with Finance Minister Paul Martin, Economics Minister John Manley, and Foreign Trade Minister Roy MacLaren, there had been talks in Ottawa between "free traders" seeking opportunities for closer cooperation on a broad level. Rexrodt, who stopped in the Canadian capital for two days on his way from the United States to Mexico, immediately presented his hosts with a wish list. He is hoping for "fair competition" if Canada decides to build a fast railroad line between Quebec City and Windsor (Ontario). Of course, given Canada's desolate financial situation, the only argument for such a project is the creation of jobs. During a visit to the Bombardier works in Montreal, Rexrodt also pointed out to the Canadians the advantages of closer cooperation in aviation and space travel. He called for improved access to the market in the whole area of telecommunications. The assessment of the new aggravation in Washington's relations with Tokyo made it clear how similar are Bonn's and Ottawa's ideas on key questions. Both sides basically welcomed American pressure on Japan, all the more so since the Canadians also have cause to complain again and again about lack of access to the Japanese market. It was also stressed, however, that one does not think much of compromises such as agreement on import quotas, because this would damage the pure spirit of GATT. On the sidelines of his visit, the Bonn minister also had an opportunity to get to know Donald Johnston, Canadian candidate for the office of OECD secretary general and a former minister from the Trudeau era. Johnston, who will soon travel to the capitals of the OECD countries to introduce himself, can count on the United States' support, but not on help from Bonn. Rexrodt: "We stick to Lorenz Schomerus." Regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement, Rexrodt today again sees a potential for German investments in Canada. The generally higher educational level in Canada compared with the low-wage zones [Leichtlohnzonen] of the United States and Mexico, the more comprehensible legal situation, and the comparable technical standards favor this, he said.
