FR940627-2-00078 FR940627-2-00031 While sponsored research agreements frequently are used where basic research is involved and no invention exists to disclose nor intellectual property to license at the time the agreement is executed, Grantees should anticipate such issues to arise and use the following points for consideration in developing a sponsored research agreement. The first section, Universal Points for Consideration, highlights several requirements and issues that Grantees should consider in all proposed sponsored research agreements. The second section, Points for Special Consideration, delineates circumstances which suggest heightened scrutiny. The third section, Other Points for Consideration by Non Profit Grantees, contains additional considerations which apply only to non profit Grantees. Universal Points for Consideration Academic Freedom Academic research freedom based upon social collaboration within the scientific community and the scrutiny of claims and beliefs by its members is at the heart of scientific advancement within the United States. Primarily through Federal funding, academic institutions have contributed to fundamental knowledge and techniques upon which current and future scientific discoveries and technological innovations depend. Therefore, the preservation of academic freedom for Grantee institutions and researchers is of considerable concern to the NIH. Grantees should be aware that their interest in the scientific endeavor covered by a sponsored research agreement and the interest of the industrial sponsor may not be totally consonant. As a result, in general, Grantees should ensure that sponsored research agreements preserve the freedom for academic researchers to select projects, collaborate with other scientists, determine the types of sponsored research activities in which they wish to participate, and communicate their research findings at meetings, and by publication and through other means. 7 Academic researchers also should be made aware of any agreements executed by their institutions which may restrict their ability to pursue research activities and publish research results. Grantees also should maintain their independence to pursue their own mission without undue influence or restraint by their industrial sponsors. For example, an agreement which gives an industrial sponsor the ability to direct the research mission of a Grantee would be inappropriate. 7 The NIH recognizes that there may be certain instances when it may be reasonable for a Grantee institution to agree to minimally restrict a researcher from collaborating with another industrial partner when the subject matter of such collaboration overlaps with that of the sponsored research agreement. Dissemination of Research Results Grantees must ensure that the timely dissemination of research findings is not adversely affected by the conditions of a sponsored research agreement. For example, the PHS Grants Policy Statement, incorporated as a condition of each NIH research grant, details policies on publication of research results, responsibilities to disseminate information on unique research resources, and standards of conduct for Grantee employees. Although an industrial sponsor's consideration of the commercial applicability of specific research findings and/or the filing of a patent application to secure intellectual property rights may justify a need to delay disclosure of research findings, a delay of up to thirty (30) days is generally viewed as a reasonable period for such activity. Depending upon the individual circumstances, Grantees could consider a shorter or longer period of time, as they deem appropriate. In addition to the timing, a sponsored research agreement which requires the disclosure of inventions and research findings developed with NIH funds to an industrial sponsor prior to submission of the invention disclosure to the NIH, may be inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the NIH grant or contract. Utilization The NIH also has a concern that Federally funded technology be developed and commercialized in an expedited and efficient manner. In deciding to enter into an agreement with an commercial entity, Grantees should consider whether the organization has the experience, capability, and commitment to bring its likely inventions to commercial status. Additionally, Grantees should not enter into sponsored research agreements that permit a sponsor to tie up the development of a technology by acquiring exclusive licensing rights to the product of given research results before deciding whether or not it will actively develop and commercialize that product. Grantees should provide a sponsor with an option to pursue licensing rights. It is reasonable for such options to be limited to no more than six (6) months. However, individual circumstances may dictate a shorter or longer period of time. After the option period expires, the technology should become available for licensing to other entities. Moreover, once a sponsor decides not to exercise its option, it should not be given a second opportunity to obtain licensing rights by matching other parties' offers for the rights. Such requirements enable Grantees to license to companies presenting a bona fide commercialization plan, thus expediting the availability of products to the public. In order to ensure that technology is developed rapidly and is not being subjected to delays, Grantees should also establish, maintain, and actively administer policies and procedures which ensure that licenses arising from sponsored research agreements contain due diligence requirements and benchmarks to monitor performance. When future rights to as yet undiscovered inventions are included in a sponsored research agreement, benchmarks for development of each such invention should be established as it becomes available for commercial development. In addition, Grantees should actively monitor licensees in accordance with those requirements and benchmarks to assure compliance with Grantee obligations under the Act. U.S. Manufacture The Bayh-Dole Act requires that products developed with Federal funds and used and sold in the United States, be substantially manufactured here. In granting exclusive rights to use or sell any subject invention in the United States, Grantees must ensure that each agreement requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. In individual cases, a request for waiver may be considered by the NIH. A determination will be made based upon a showing by the Grantee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. In granting a waiver of the U.S. manufacture requirement, the NIH may consider other benefits conferred on the United States by the potential license including the rapid availability of a product of benefit to the health of the American people. Notification Requirements and Records In sponsored research agreements, as in other contexts, Grantees must also ensure that invention, patent and license notification requirements are adhered to in a timely manner. Timeliness considerations include prompt (1) employee notification to Grantee administrators of an invention made under NIH funding, (2) written disclosure to NIH of an invention and the intent to retain or convey to the Government title to the invention, (3) adherence to time frames for initial filing of patent applications in the United States and the filing of foreign patent applications, (4) execution and confirmation throughout the world of NIH license rights in the results of the research, and (5) notification to the NIH of any decision not to continue patent prosecution, pay fees, or defend the patent in reexamination.
