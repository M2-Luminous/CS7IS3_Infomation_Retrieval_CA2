IEC spokesman Mike Chandler said from regional headquarters in East London that the strikers had received assurances from IEC head office in Midrand that their pay claims were receiving attention. He said cheques were being airfreighted to the Eastern Cape. Counting in Transkei only started after midday Saturday [30 April], when the strikers returned to work. The strike had also been called off in the Queenstown sub-region and counting stations there were operational. Chandler said there had been a late start to counting throughout the province. Some areas had transport problems in getting ballot boxes to counting stations. Others had problems contacting IEC head office for the permission required before they could begin counting. There had also been some problems in the reconciliation of ballot papers in Port Elizabeth, and counting started a "little later" there as well.
