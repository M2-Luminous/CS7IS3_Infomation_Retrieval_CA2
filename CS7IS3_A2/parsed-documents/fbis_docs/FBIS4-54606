The memorandum envisages that the two countries will set up a joint committee to prepare a policy on road, air, sea transport as well as inland waters transport. According to Russian Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov, the lack of money does not allow for the realisation of transport investments such as the construction of highways and border crossings. The Russian minister said that Russia would decrease fees for flights over its territory which are higher than the prices of the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation). Yefimov denied that Russian prices are higher.
