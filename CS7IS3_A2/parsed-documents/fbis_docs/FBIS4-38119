He said: "Britain would be the first loser if the sanctions against Libya were escalated to include Libya's oil exports. [no closing quotemarks as published] He pointed out that 7,000 Britons worked in the Libyan oil sector and that the trade balance between the two countries was $1.5 billion in Britain's favor. In a statement to AL-HAYAH yesterday, the source criticized what he described as "the West's intransigence against the Arab League's proposal calling for the implementation of international legitimacy by having the two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie case stand trial before a Scottish court at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice." He added: "That rejection is not only a stand against Libya but also a slap to all the Arab states." He said that if the Arab League proposal was rejected and the Western states concerned with the crisis insisted on escalating it, then the Arab states should not comply with the economic sanctions imposed on his country since April 1992 under Security Council Resolution 748, and should resume flights between the Arab states and Libya. He said that "if the Arab states did that, they would command world respect. Not all the Security Council resolutions are always in their favor. In fact, the majority of these resolutions are applied by some states and ignored by others." Meanwhile, Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, the Arab League's assistant secretary general for political affairs, has stated that the Arab League's proposal for the settlement of the Lockerbie crisis placed the ball in the West's court. He said that the proposal took into consideration international legitimacy and Libya's sovereignty at the same time, and that the Western states should respond to the Arab proposal which is also supported by the Organization of African Unity and the Nonaligned Movement. In a statement to AL-HAYAH, 'Imran said that Libya is serious in its efforts to close the Lockerbie file, adding that Western rejection raised some questions about this issue. He said: "If the Western states have sufficient evidence to support the charges then why do they not agree to the trial of the suspects at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice?" Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has sent new messages to the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and Britain stressing that agreement to the trial of the Libyan suspects in the Hague "would spare the region unnecessary dangers. A settlement of this issue would increase confidence in the new world order."
