Referring to the visit to Saudi Arabia of the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, `TEHRAN TIMES' said the visit has two objectives. The first, said the paper, is to speed up the process of signing the Gaza-Jericho peace accord despite popular Palestinian opposition, and the second is to justify the illegal presence of the U.S. in the Persian Gulf and push the sale of U.S.-made arms to members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council (PGCC). U.S. policy in the Middle East is to legitimize the presence of the Zionist entity in the region at any cost, said the paper noting that America must realize that even the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) has reached the conclusion that no peace will be achieved unless `all Palestinians' unanimously accept the terms.
