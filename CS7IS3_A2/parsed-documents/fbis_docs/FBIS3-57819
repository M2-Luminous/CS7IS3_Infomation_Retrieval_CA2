Its infrastructure will be based on ATM [Asynchronous Transfer Mode] technology and will use fiber optics. The leaders of the member states of the European Union have just voted in favor of adopting measures recommended in Jacques Delors' white paper to ensure that Europe is better prepared to "enter the information era, a transformation comparable to the first industrial revolution." At the heart of the project is the setting up of a high-speed communications network. According to figures in the white paper, its installation would cost ECU20 billion over the 1994-99 period. In spite of our insistence we were unable to find out what this ECU20 billion would cover in practice, as all the directors concerned were busy in Brussels. We only know that this network should use ATM technology and fiber optics. Its installation should be a godsend for European suppliers of ATM equipment such as scramblers, concentrators, and access networks. The first stage in this project would be to set up fiber-optic infrastructures; in this field France is the most advanced country in the Union. The spin-offs from this project should be at least as important as the project itself. For example, the white paper's insistence on the creation of information services should result in the use of numerous database servers. As a parallel development, impetus would automatically be given to the widespread use of multimedia equipment (videophones, pay TV, multimedia PC's, storage media). In general, the creation of the European information network should boost progress on the European telecommunications services markets, currently worth ECU84 billion per year with annual growth of 8 percent, and in telecommunications equipment (ECU26 billion and 4 percent growth). The major problem to be solved by those taking part in the program is apparently that of network interoperability. This should, however, be helped by the opening up of telephony markets in Union countries in 1998. Emphasis on Services Thanks to the implementation of European information networks allowing the transmission of data, voice, and images, access to huge databases will be assured and telecommuting will be promoted. This implementation will be accompanied by the creation of new services, which in itself will generate new jobs as happened in France with the minitel, which was behind the creation of 350,000 new jobs in the service sector. In voting for this project, representing an overall cost (equipment, services, and applications) of ECU150 billion over 10 years and ECU67 billion in the 1994-99 period, the leaders of the Union countries have shown their willingness to keep Europe at the forefront of technology. The project to which they have given their support corresponds to the super information highway program dear to Bill Clinton and Al Gore (an overall investment of ECU85 billion), and to the equivalent Japanese project supported by Tokyo as part of its economic revival plan. A task force working under a mandate from the European Council will identify the consecutive steps to be taken, draw up a timetable, and study the deployment of resources. It should report to the president of the European Council on 31 March 1994, so that work can begin by mid-1994, following the approval by the European Council. [Box, p 6] Proposed Trans-European Telecommunications Networks The total investment involved for the networks and services described below is ECU67 billion. Advanced Interconnected Networks - Installation of high-speed communications networks: This will require an investment of ECU20 billion over the 1994-99 period. It is deemed to be necessary for the development of multimedia services, and will use the most advanced data transmission techniques (ATM technology, fiber optics, etc.). - Consolidation of the integrated services digital network: With an investment of ECU15 billion over the next five years, such networks should be found throughout the Union before the year 2000. General Electronic Services - Electronic access to information: This will require an investment of ECU1 billion over the 1994-99 period, and will involve the uploading of information (administrative, scientific, or cultural) in databases accessible to any user in the Union. - Electronic mail: Also for an ECU1-billion investment, various commercial electronic document transmission services will be developed and made interoperable (particularly important for small- and medium-sized companies). - Electronic images, interactive video services: An ECU10-billion investment will be required to ensure the interoperability of new, flexible services (pay-per-view, video on demand) at the European level by 1997. Data Communications Applications - Telecommuting: There will be Community support to the tune of ECU3 billion over five years for pilot programs aimed at setting up a cross-border network of human resources management. - Remote administration: An investment of ECU7 billion over 1994-99 will help the implementation of data exchanges between administrative bodies (customs, statistical organizations) and give companies and private individuals access to such data. - Distance training: This will involve an investment of ECU3 billion and will result in the setting up by 1996 of a network linking more than 100 universities or colleges in order to make shared teaching modules accessible. - Distance health care: this will require an ECU7-billion investment over the 1994-99 period for the installation, between now and the year 2000, of a multimedia network linking up the major anticancer centers, bone marrow banks, and the principal Social Security centers.
