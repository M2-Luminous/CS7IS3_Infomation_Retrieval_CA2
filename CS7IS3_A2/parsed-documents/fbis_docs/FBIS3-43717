A poll by the HSRC and the Multiparty Democracy Organization found that the ANC [African National Congress] would obtain a two thirds majority. The ANC does not think it will get a two thirds majority, but thinks it will win an outright majority. It has criticized the poll, saying the category of people who did not know which party they would vote for had not been taken into consideration, nor were the residents of the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states. The National Party also criticized the poll finding, saying it believes its support is increasing compared with parties such as the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], the CP [Conservative Party], and other parties in the Freedom Alliance in general. Meanwhile, the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] says the fact that it and the Conservative Party can show that they have 2 million supporters should provide food for thought. It says groups wanting to ignore the Afrikaner's demand for self-determination should not ignore that support.
