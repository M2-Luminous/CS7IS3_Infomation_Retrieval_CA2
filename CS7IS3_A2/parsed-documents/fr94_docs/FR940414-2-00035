LE653 on a separate pipeline lateral owned and operated by TGPL. TGPL states that Pennzoil, the sole operator of natural gas production being transported by the subject facilities, recently constructed a new pipeline to re-route the existing SMI Block 23 gas (and other Pennzoil gas production) to the system of Sea Robin Pipeline Company. Pennzoil has informed TGPL that, as a result of this re-routing, Pennzoil will no longer ship any gas through the subject facilities and that, commencing July 7, 1994, Pennzoil will abandon by removal its SMI Block 23A, 23B&hyph;D and 23B&hyph;P Platforms. TGPL states that it will be required to disconnect and remove its facilities from these platforms before they are abandoned by Pennzoil. TGPL states that it must commence work on or about June 15, 1994, in order to complete the disconnecting and removal of its facilities. Therefore, TGPL requests the Commission take appropriate action to grant this authority on an expedited basis. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 15, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party in any proceeding herein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for TGPL to appear or to be represented at the hearing. Linwood A.
