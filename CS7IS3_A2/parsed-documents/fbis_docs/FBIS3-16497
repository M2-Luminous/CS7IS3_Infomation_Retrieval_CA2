As was pointed out by Zyanon Paznyak, the BNF does not aim to electioneer before the adoption of the constitution, as is being done by S. Shushkevich, M. Hryb, and A. Lukashenka during their numerous clamorous tours across the Republic. However as soon as the elections are announced, the BNF will definitely launch its electoral campaign. According to Y. Khadyka, the BNF has plans to reach a preelection agreement with other parties. The content of the agreement will depend on the concrete situation and will, at a maximum, envision support for one candidate or, at a minimum, joint control over observance of the law in the course of the elections. The BNF leadership believes that their organization has realistic chances for success. Yet, according to Z. Paznyak, this would happen only if the electorate faces a clear-cut dilemma of choosing between a man from the opposition and a representative of the old nomenklatura. A third candidate and a third way would be a threat. Zyanon Paznyak pointed out that Stanislav Shushkevich is the man specifically threatening BNF's future and added: "Someone either advocates independence or opposes it; there is no other option." In Paznyak's opinion, Shushkevich is the concrete politician responsible for what happened in Belarus. Due to BNF support, Shushkevich became deputy chairman and then chairman of the Belarusian legislature. However in the end, he abandoned the BNF and chose his own path, tolerating the annulment of the referendum and the legalization of the Communist Party of Belarus. The BNF cannot forgive this. Thus, Paznyak pointed out, (and was supported by other council members), the Popular Front would no longer support Shushkevich and quite probably, would campaign against him. Shushkevich's aspiration to take part in presidential elections and his attempts to look for support from political parties and the electorate had evidently irritated the BNF. In Paznyak's opinion, "This situation causes confusion and discord in the democratic camp. Democrats will lose. When opportunists come to the fore, the nomenklatura will be victorious." Nevertheless, the BNF faction believes that it is rather improbable that there will be several candidates for president. The draft law on presidential elections provides for the nomination of candidates by either 70 lawmakers or 100,000 electors. Alternative candidates will encounter enormous difficulties. However the BNF is not going to dodge them. Making use of its experience, the organization will begin collecting signatures, aware that a candidate nominated by the electorate will be in an advantageous position as compared to his opponent nominated by Supreme Soviet deputies. In the electoral campaign, the BNF intends to seek support from young people, workers, and intelligentsia. It also stresses the need to form veterans and pensioners organizations faithful to the idea of independence, and to appeal for women's support.
