The agreement did not tackle the presence of settlers in Hebron, maintained the Qiryat Arba' settlement, and has not put an end to settler terrorism, he added. The new agreement watered down the international protection and confined it to 160 observers, Talhami said. The signing of the agreement on the international presence in Hebron will allow the resumption of the autonomy negotiations next Monday [4 April], according to PLO ambassador to Jordan, al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, who announced that the first units of the Palestinian force will begin deployment in Gaza and Jericho the next day and will complete deployment on 13 April. As for the Israeli forces, they will redeploy in these areas. Our correspondent Basim Abu- Sumayyah informs us of the general conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories: [Begin recording] Israeli military officials have said the Israeli Army is prepared to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho and redeploy within 72 hours of receiving orders. [passage omitted] Former Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, who is expected to return to his post shortly, has welcomed the deployment of the international forces in the town, regarding it as a good step if the members of this force are capable of providing genuine protection for the Palestinians. He emphasized the need to disarm and evacuate the settlers to provide security and stability for the Palestinians. On the other hand, supporters of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] have rejected the agreement, which fails to provide genuine protection for the Palestinian people. 'Abd-al-'Alim Da'nah said that what is required is an opportunity for a just peace and not reaching a truce between the victim and the perpetrator. Islamic law judge al-Shaykh Tayseer al-Tamimi expressed fear that the deployment of the international force will help consecrate the partition of the town which was imposed by the Israeli forces.
