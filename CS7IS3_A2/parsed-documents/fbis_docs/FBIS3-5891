Seoul's Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political and Military Affairs Robert Gallucci met to evaluate recent developments concerning International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in North Korea and inter-Korean dialogue. Officials here said the two sides will reaffirm their two preconditions for Washington to hold the next round of high-level talks with Pyongyang -- the IAEA inspections must conclude successfully and the two Koreas must exchange special envoys. "One year ago tomorrow, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Today, we are still wrestling with the problem," Kim said in opening the meeting. "We have to resolve the problem through dialogue. We maintain that principle," he said. The IAEA team is currently in North Korea for inspections after a one-year break but the monitoring activities are not going as smoothly as expected, according to officials here and in Washington. Meanwhile, the inter-Korean contacts on exchanging envoys are dragging on with the next meeting set for Saturday. Officials say the March 21 meeting between North Korea and the United States may well have to be delayed until the two preconditions are met. "We have been at a crossroads, and we are again in that position," said Gallucci. "This will be a good time to discuss the next steps to take together."
