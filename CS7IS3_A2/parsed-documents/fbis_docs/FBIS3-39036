He talked about the League, the imminent elections, Sisde, and [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi -- "someone who seems unreal on television, who in person is different, practical, and who speaks clearly. You can make yourself understood with him in a couple of minutes." Calm and rested, as though the congress marathon were already a distant memory, the League leader relaxed in front of a rare steak in the restaurant of the Holiday Inn very near the conference hall. The magic moment, League supporters believe, occurred when the secretary proclaimed, and put to the vote, the Pole for Freedom -- with Silvio Berlusconi and Forza Italia, with the "wreckage of the old parties," and with the quick-change artists who really are willing to change, but without [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini's right. A center force based on economic liberalism and federalism, opposed "to the three linchpins of state control -- Christian Democrats, communists, and fascists." [Vimercati] But how can you explain this to Berlusconi? [Bossi] As I have already said, anticommunism is not enough. Berlusconi must choose -- either with us to promote economic liberalism, or with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] to halt change. The North belongs to the League, and if he wants to attempt exchanges of electoral favors with anyone in the South, I do not care. But I am sure that we will overcome these stumbling blocks and that everything will go well in the end. [Vimercati] But you are so different -- you, sanguine, impetuous, and careless in your dress; he, so fastidious, careful about matters of tone, in his suit...the proletarian and the plutocrat. Will you get along? [Bossi] I think that Berlusconi is different from the way he appears, or from the way his people, with some political naivety, make him appear. I saw him on television, and he did not look real. [Vimercati] So you did see him. It is not true that you were asleep while Berlusconi was talking in Rome, as the newspapers said. [Bossi] I got up late because I spent the night drafting the congress document. I do not have people who write for me. I saw Berlusconi later, on the television news. As I said, he looked unreal, but that impression from the television does not do him justice. Basically he is not an elitist; in fact he is an easy- going Milanese, to whom I can tell it like it is. I say to him: "As far as I am concerned, it is simple. Can we agree?" And he answers me in the same vein; we understand one another. [Vimercati] Even when you are talking about candidates? [Bossi] Of course. It is simpler than people think. We sit in front of a map and decide: my man here, yours there, mine here, yours there; here we have something of a problem -- it is yours! We can settle the whole thing in a couple of hours. [Vimercati] Is there not even a small place for the Christian Democratic centrists? [Bossi] The old faces could make a generous gesture and sit this one out. But if they really insist, we will find a seat for Mastella and D'Onofrio in the South. There is room. But do not print that, otherwise we will have people lining up outside our house tomorrow. [Vimercati] Will your people still like a Bossi who goes around with Berlusconi in his blue double-breasted suit? [Bossi] There will be no major difficulties, because Berlusconi is a different kind of rich man. True, he made his money under the old regime, but he has always had the communists against him and he had to negotiate with the rest because he had no alternative. He does not look like the manager of an ironworks, like Gianni Agnelli, who could never contest the elections. [Vimercati] Are you not afraid that Berlusconi will steal a large number of your votes and ultimately deprive you of the leadership of this Pole for Freedom? [Bossi] I am being careful, but I am not afraid. I realize that Berlusconi has some power of attraction. He may win over people who are still afraid of the League, but he is stealing those votes not from us but from [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli, and is thus killing the final vestiges of the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. In the bar the other day I was pestered by some hulking fellow with callused hands who kept saying: "We need Berlusconi!" Eventually I told him to get lost, but in its generic way, Forza Italia's message could win much support.... I would call it pre-political support, more in the South than in the North. [Vimercati] Why do you think Berlusconi entered politics? [Bossi] Well, at first perhaps he was forced to do so by Mediobanca, by Agnelli and the DC, and by their respective banks, who tried to destroy the League by unleashing the judiciary against me. They tried to make him the good League leader, who would win over our votes and bring them back into the system. But that plan went wrong; I halted the sword of justice; but by then the mechanism had been set in motion.... [Vimercati] If he had wanted to, Berlusconi could have withdrawn. [Bossi] I do not know what he thought. Maybe by then he realized that Forza Italia could perform a major role, or perhaps he was afraid for the future.... Some time ago [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto was pursuing me. Perhaps Berlusconi feared an accord with the communists. [Vimercati] The election is drawing nearer. Your adversaries are becoming increasingly dangerous. The left-wing forces have already presented their symbol. What do you think of that? [Bossi] That red-green wave is ridiculous; it is a petty thing planned in the abstract, with no feeling, by people who have no imagination. How can it be compared with the vast tide of the League? Our symbol, the warrior of Legnano, is much stronger and more powerful. We will never relinquish it, partly for the sake of clarity with respect to the voters. [Vimercati] Is it true that, by using different symbols in the single-candidate and proportional stages, the left-wing forces hope to avert dismemberment in the elections and thus to gain a few additional seats? [Bossi] It is true, they are trying to rob us of a dozen deputies by such petty means. But they will not succeed. I have already told [League lower house floor leader] Maroni to appeal to Interior Minister Mancini to seek guarantees. I am worried; this election is a war, and I do not want to concern myself with skirmishes, too. I do not trust Mancino and his tricks.
