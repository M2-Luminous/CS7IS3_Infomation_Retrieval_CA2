Regarding the flow of illegal aliens, Escovar said the "first problem" that must be tackled to solve the illegal aliens problem is the Sectorial General Directorate of Identification and Control of Foreigners [Diex], which must be revamped. Escovar made this statement at the opening of the First Round of Conferences on Security and Defense, organized by Seconasede, which is being held on 12, 13, and 14 April. Escovar and other prominent individuals are scheduled to participate at this meeting. During his speech, Escovar mentioned the subject of Venezuela: its political situation and effects on security and defense. Escovar said, among other things, national security and defense have several serious and complex problems. The first problem is the need to control the undetermined number of illegal aliens in the country, a situation that creates several problems. He conceded there are irregularities regarding the identification of foreigners. Many of these irregularities have long existed and have done the country much harm. He said emphatically Diex constitutes the first problem that must be tackled. "That is what I am doing," he said categorically. Transculturation In countries, such as Venezuela, weakened and troubled by foreign debt, corruption, and disorganization, it is not enough to invoke patriotic emblems and sing the national anthem when referring to national sovereignty, but it is also necessary to understand more profound aspects that affect sovereignty. In this respect, Escovar said in addition to the above-mentioned problems the country is threatened by the drug problem, an unusual and highly dangerous one. Drugs and its geopolitical ramifications have brought a new element to the situation which, according to Escovar, has a nullifying effect on society, its health and morals. Escovar warned that is the scenario and those are the new actors. Regarding transculturation, which seriously harms our sovereignty, he said it reaches Venezuelans via satellite dishes and the media. Political Reforms Concerning reforms, he said the inclusion of the referendum on impeachment must be one of the fundamental aspects to be discussed during the discussion on constitutional reform, scheduled to take place at Congress within the next few days. "I do not think it is the only reform the country is demanding, but in political matters the referendum on impeachment is fundamental in making in-depth changes in Venezuelan society," he said. In this regard he said the country is anxious to relegitimize the system, which is "evidently losing legitimacy." At this moment, he said, the discussion of constitutional reforms left pending by the previous Congress is being accelerated. There is a fundamental element, however, if we want to make a true change, which is to incorporate citizens into the decisionmaking process. This can only be achieved via a referendum.
