The amendments say the privatization voucher issued to Estonia's residents for their years of work may be transferred as a gift to the holder's parents, spouse, relatives in the descending line, sisters, brothers and their relatives, who are Estonian citizens or permanent residents of the country. The law also gives the municipal and local commune governments the right to determine the houses that cannot be privatized because of plans to pull them down, their reconstruction, further use, or some other reason. The reason for the refusal must be made public. Non-occupied housing premises can be privatized by Estonian residents of at least 18 years of age. The law says years of service in the KGB shall not be accounted in calculation of the length of employment in Estonia. The parliament also approved an amendment to the tax regulations law, giving the government the right to extinguish debts of state companies going to privatization, or participate in management of the debts.
