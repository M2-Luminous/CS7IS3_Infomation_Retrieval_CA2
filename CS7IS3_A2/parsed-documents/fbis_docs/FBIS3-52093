Andoni] [Text] Amman--The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) has asked for total control over crossing points to Jericho and Gaza and joint supervision of the other crossings with Israel as a compromise to break the deadlock over the implementation of Palestinian autonomy, PLO officials said on Friday [31 December]. The PLO demands were included in counter proposals that Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th has conveyed to the Israeli government. Israeli officials have already declared that the government could consider its original proposals, put forward in Cairo last week, but will not accept to scrap them. [sentence as published] The new Palestinian proposals according to PLO officials, are the following: The Crossings A: The Palestinian flag should be hoisted on all entrances to crossings points and borders. B: Two separate crossing points to Jericho and Gaza, at King Husayn Bridge and Rafah respectively, totally controlled by the Palestinians. C: Palestinian participation over the other crossing points. Jericho A: [as published] The area of Jericho extends from al-Nabi Musa to al-'Awja reaching the King Husayn Bridge. According to a senior PLO official in Tunis, the Palestinians are giving priority to access between Jericho and the bridge over the area under consideration. "According to the accord it is a matter of time before the Israeli withdrawal from the Jericho district. But if they had control over the bridge, Jericho would have been like a detention camp" for Palestinian leadership. The Gaza Strip A: [as published] The Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip will be confined to the boundaries of the settlements only. The Israeli proposals allow for Palestinian presence at one of two windows in one checking point around 500 metres inside the borders leaving the actual control in Israeli hands. Furthermore, Palestinian travellers will have to be cleared by the Israeli window at the checkpoints before proceeding to the Palestinian window. The Israeli plan also stipulates retaining control of "a three-metre-long security strip" between Jericho and the bridge. The Palestinian counter proposal flatly rejects it. The city of Jericho, according to the Israeli proposal, will be connected with al-'Awja through a special narrow strip leaving all of the land around Jericho to the King Husayn Bridge, under Israeli control, while Palestinians will only administer the religious sites in al-Nabi Musa. By confining Israeli control to within the boundaries of the settlements in the Gaza Strip, the PLO hopes to thwart Israeli attempts to connect the settlements in one "security zone." But some PLO officials warn that the Palestinians should not concede to Israeli demands to control land within the settlements' boundaries. "The land within the settlements' boundaries are controlled by Israel any way against our will," said one PLO official. "The settlements are illegal and we should continue to deal with them through the negotiations as such."
