The special measure, which is published in the official gazette EL PERUANO, covers several provinces of the Departments of Lima, Callao, Ancash (Andean northeast), Ucayali, Huanuco (central jungle), and Loreto (eastern Amazon). The corresponding decrees establish the suspension of constitutional rights and indicate that the Armed Forces will continue to maintain control over the previously mentioned areas. Since the beginning of the "fratricidal war" in Ayacucho in 1980, more than 60 percent of the country has been under a state of emergency. According to official figures, the conflict has killed more than 26,000 people and caused more than $24 billion in economic damage, which is equivalent to the country's foreign debt.
