"Normally a change could be expected every five years, at the party congress," Bounkeut said. He said the next party congress would be held in two years. During the Fifth Lao People's Revolutionary Party Congress in 1991, party Secretary-General Kaysone Phomvihan became president of Laos and Khamthai Siphandon replaced him as prime minister. The ambassador denied an earlier report that a large-scale change was expected soon in the cabinet, saying the report was inaccurate. "The change will not come so soon," he said. The report said six cabinet posts -- four economic and two security affairs -- would be affected by the change. There has been frequent speculation about changes in Laos since the death of President Kaysone in November, 1992. After his death, there was one minor cabinet reshuffle in which Somsavat Lengsavat became foreign minister to replace Phoun Sipaseut.
