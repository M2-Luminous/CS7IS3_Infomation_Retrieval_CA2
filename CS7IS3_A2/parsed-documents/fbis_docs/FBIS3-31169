He said he could not imagine on what basis a coalition could function if the governing parties preserve their current policy. "I cannot imagine how members of the current cabinet such as Roman Hofbauer, Marian Andel and Jozef Prokes would sit in the government along with SDL Deputies Milan Ftacnik, Robert Fic and Ludomir Fogas" Weiss said. He pointed to a scenario drafted by the HZDS which seeks to again win a majority in parliament through calling a referendum. These efforts are aimed at installing either a presidential regime or a chancellor system, Weiss said. He voiced the view that the latest parliamentary crisis when HZDS deputies and part of SNS deputies purposefully postponed parliamentary discussion on the law on large privatisation "questioned parliament as institution". Government coalition deputies made their further presence at the parliamentary session conditional on the ruling of the Constitutional Court on the dispute whether or not deputies can deprive (in a vote) the chairman of parliament of the right to chair a parliamentary meeting. Weiss described as politically expedient statements Slovak Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar's offer -- reiterated publicly -- that the SDL form an open coalition with the current government coalition parties. Weiss said this offer lacked the support of the decisive HZDS and SNS bodies.
