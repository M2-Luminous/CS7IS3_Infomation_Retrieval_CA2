The 7th Court House, presided over by Judge Nilsa de Gonzalez, on 23 June granted the provisional release of Eduardo Herrera, who along with 16 other servicemen was charged on one count of sedition. According to Herrera's defense lawyer, his client was not released, because the prosecutor appealed the judge's decision. [Begin recording] [Defense Lawyer Hector Zavala] The judge issued a pretrial statement saying she can only try Mr. Herrera for an offense that carries a sentence of less than two years for the offense of sedition. This ruling, or as the file states, denies, as President Guillermo Endara has charged, my client tried to topple him on 5 December 1990. The ruling states there is no evidence to prove there was an attempt to topple the government at that time. [end recording] Lawyer Hector Zavala made the request for a provisional release in late April. In her decision, the judge agreed to grant a provisional release until the trial is held, but she forbad Herrera to leave the country and ordered him to appear before that court every month. The 2nd Court of Justice will have to decide whether to uphold or revoke the release. If revoked, the final step would be to appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice. Eduardo Herrera is also charged for his involvement in terrorist acts of Operation Let Us Kill Fatty [Asesinar Al Gordito, in reference to President Endara] in Chiriqui Province and for evading justice.
