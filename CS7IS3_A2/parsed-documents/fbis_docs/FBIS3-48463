The article quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: "Our party is an invincible revolutionary party, which has performed immortal feats in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of chuche, enjoys unquestioned trust of the popular masses, is united as steel-like ranks and is possessed of rich experience and tested veteran leadership ability." It further says: The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party is clearly displayed first of all in confidently leading our people along the road of socialism, upholding the revolutionary banner of the chuche idea under any circumstances. It is a steadfast faith and will of our party to carry the socialist cause to completion, holding aloft the banner of the chuche idea, neither hesitating nor taking a step back, whatever complicated situation may be created and whatever trial we may face. Drawing a proper lesson from the collapse of socialism in some countries and decisively refuting the abuses hurled by riffraffs at socialism, our party is vigorously advancing toward a bright future by displaying wisdom and bravery in turning misfortune into bliss. It has developed and completed the socialist idea of chuche and firmly armed the popular masses with it and strengthened the driving force of the revolution, the integral whole of the leader, the party and the masses, to resolve all the problems arising in the revolution and construction with its strength. The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party in leading the socialist cause of our era to victory is also highly displayed in firmly defending the dignity of the country and the gains of the revolution, boldly meeting the challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries. Last year, the moves of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate, stifle and crush our Republic got more vicious than ever before, which carried the situation in our country to the extreme pitch of strain. When a touch-and-go situation was created in which a war might break out any moment, Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, took a decisive step of declaring a semi-war state to the whole country, all the people and the entire Army and called upon all the people to meet the challenge of the enemy in the revolutionary spirit and militant stamina as was displayed in the grim fatherland liberation war. Thanks to this principled and resolute struggle of the party, our people and the officers and men of the People's Army could boldly meet the challenge of the enemy and smash his aggressive moves and honorably defend the dignity and security of the socialist motherland. The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party is also displayed in vigorously leading the revolution and construction to a constant upswing with grand aspirations and ideal and without slightest stagnation and standstill. It is our party's steadfast stand to continue the revolution till imperialism will have been wiped out and the victorious flag of socialism will be flying higher on this land. Hence, our party is pushing ahead with the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, keeping a tight hold on them, and is firmly defending the revolutionary principle, the principle of socialism, under whatever circumstances. Unprecedented miracles are being wrought and innovations effected and grand monumental creations adding lustre to the era of the Workers' Party are rising up in great number in our country under the wise leadership of our party. Today our party is exalting its pride of being a great party leading the socialist cause along an ever-victorious road with iron will and tested leadership ability entirely because it has the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at its head.
