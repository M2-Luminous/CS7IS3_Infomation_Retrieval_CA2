ACTION: Notice of additional hearings. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is announcing that public hearings will be held in San Francisco, California concerning the effectiveness of the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements (set forth in Rule 175 under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), Rule 3b&hyph;6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), Rule 103A under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and Rule 0&hyph;11 under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. On October 13, 1994, the Commission issued a concept release soliciting comment on, among other matters, whether the safe harbor adequately encourages issuers to disclose forward-looking information. 1 In that release, the Commission announced that hearings would begin in Washington, DC on February 13, 1995 to further consider the issues raised. In an effort to make those hearings more accessible, the Commission is announcing that hearings also will be held in San Francisco, California beginning February 16, 1995 at 10:00 a.m. Those who wish to testify should notify the Commission in writing of their intention to appear. The written notification should include a brief summary of the proposed testimony. Those who do not wish to appear at the hearings are reminded that they may submit written testimony for inclusion in the hearing record. The schedule of appearances, date for submission of final written testimony by persons who will appear, and an agenda for the hearings will be announced by the Commission shortly before the hearings commence. 1 Securities Act Release 33&hyph;7101 (October 13, 1994), 59 Fed.

Public Hearings In view of the broad interest, as well as the importance and complexity of the issues addressed in the concept release, the Commission believes that public hearings should also be conducted in California after the close of the comment period. Among other matters, these hearings will explore the assumptions underlying the different views expressed by these and other members of the public. Testimony from witnesses will be elicited about the efficacy and potential effects of different safe harbor approaches, the costs and benefits of each approach, the design of any safe harbor and issues that may be raised by the comment letters. After these hearings, the Commission will determine whether to propose amendments to the rules regarding forward-looking information. Dated: December 23, 1994. By the Commission. Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;32152 Filed 12&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
