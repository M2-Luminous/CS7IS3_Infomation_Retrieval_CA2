"It's not very likely now, but things are still developing," the assistant governor of Sichuan, Xu Zhongmin, said in a recent exclusive interview in Shenzhen. "He would like to remain as Sichuan Governor, but Beijing still has the right of consideration," he said. Top officials in Sichuan remained worried Xiao would be persuaded by Zhu, who was a Qinghua University classmate, to take up the post in Beijing. "It would be a great loss for us. We should have him for longer," Xu said. Since being promoted from party secretary of Chongqing last year, Xiao has taken personal charge of foreign investment and industry portfolios, areas that are usually handled by deputy governors, Xu said. "This is the time of great aspirations for Mr Xiao," he said. Zhu reportedly offered Xiao the post during an inspection tour of Sichuan before the lunar new year, according to Taiwan's CHINA TIMES. Xiao, 65, threatened to resign from politics unless he was promoted to a Beijing position during last year's 14th party congress, where he barely squeaked in as an alternate politburo member. Zhu offered him a state councillor position as an additional sweetener if he would become head of the People's Bank of China (PBOC). But worries about the political pressure of being the first governor of a supposedly independent central bank led Xiao to refuse the offer despite his ambitions. Zhu's act was apparently likened to offering a strong cappuccino to a man dying of thirst. But while politely refusing the post, Xiao expressed support for Zhu's tight control of China's financial system, which he said would prevent Sichuan bank savings from illegally flowing to coastal areas. "If you open the floodgates, it becomes more important to plug leaks. Following the recent easing of the money supply we must prevent even a single cent flowing east," Xiao reportedly said. Zhu confirmed before his recent trip to Japan that he was having difficulty finding someone to take over the top position in the central bank. He is believed to be desperate to shed the governor's job because of the extra workload. "It seems not many people would like to take the post... so I have to continue," he told reporters at Beijing airport. The current vice-governors of the PBOC have been most often mooted as Zhu's probable successor, but official sources in Beijing said there was concern that they would be too weak. "The central government wants someone for the post who can wield power without any restrictions," one official said. "That means someone who is a political heavy weight, not an experienced banker," the official added. Fighting the threat of inflation has emerged in recent weeks as Beijing's main concern in 1994. This contrasts with the emphasis on quick growth and "deepening reforms" of last year. Maintaining a tight control on the money supply despite political pressures is considered crucial to keeping inflation in check.
