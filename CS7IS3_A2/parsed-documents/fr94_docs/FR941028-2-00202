FR941028-2-00202 FR941028-2-00109 For germicidal lamps that emit radiant energy predominantly at a wavelength of 254 nm, proper use of the REL requires that the measured irradiance level (E) in microwatts per square centimeter (μW/cm 2 ) be multiplied by the relative spectral effectiveness at 254 nm (0.5) to obtain the effective irradiance (E eff ). The maximum permissible exposure time can then be determined for selected values of E eff (Table S3&hyph;3), or it can be calculated (in seconds) by dividing 0.003 J/cm 2 (the NIOSH REL at 270 nm) by E eff in μW/cm 2 ( 136,150 ). To protect HCWs who are exposed to germicidal UV radiation for 8 hours per workday, the measured irradiance (E) should be >0.2 μW/cm 2 . This is calculated by obtaining E eff (0.1 μW/cm 2 ) (Table S3&hyph;3) and then dividing this value by S l (0.5). Table S3&hyph;3._ Maximum Permissible Exposure Times* for Selected Values of Effective Irradiance 1Permissible exposure time per day 1Effective irradiance (E eff ) (μW/cm 2 ) 8 hrs 0.1 4 hrs 0.2 2 hrs 0.4 1 hr 0.8 30 min 1.7 15 min 3.3 10 min 5.0 5 min 10.0 1 min 50.0 30 sec 100.0 *Permissible exposure times are designed to prevent acute effects of irradiation to skin and eyes ( 136 ). These recommended limits are wavelength dependent because different wavelengths of ultraviolet (UV) radiation have different adverse effects on these organs. Relative spectral effectiveness (S l ) is used to compare various UV sources with a source producing UV radiation at 270 nm, the wavelength of maximum ocular sensitivity. For example, the relative spectral effectiveness at 254 nm is 0.5; therefore, twice as much energy is required at 254 nm to produce an identical biologic effect at 270 nm. At 254 nm, the NIOSH REL is 0.006 joules per square centimeter (J/cm 2 ); and at 270 nm, it is 0.003 J/cm 2 . For germicidal lamps that emit radiant energy predominantly at a wavelength of 254 nm, proper use of the REL requires that the measured irradiance level (E) in microwatts per square centimeter (μW/cm 2 ) be multiplied by the relative spectral effectiveness at 254 nm (0.5) to obtain E eff . The maximum permissible exposure time can be calculated (in seconds) by dividing 0.003 J/cm 2 (the NIOSH REL at 270 nm) by E eff in μW/cm 2 ( 136,150 ). To protect health-care workers who are exposed to germicidal UV radiation for 8 hours per work day, the measured irradiance (E) should be <0.2 μW/cm 2 , which is calculated by obtaining E eff (0.1 μW/cm 2 ), then dividing this value by S l (0.5).
