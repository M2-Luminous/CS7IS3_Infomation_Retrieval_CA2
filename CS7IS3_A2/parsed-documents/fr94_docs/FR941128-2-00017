FR941128-2-00017 FR941128-2-00010 Because Dalmine knew that it would receive the GOI interest contributions over the life of the loan when it obtained the loans, we consider the contributions to constitute reductions in the interest rates charged rather than grants ( see Certain Steel from Italy at 37335). Under the mortgage loan program, the GOI provides long-term loans at subsidized interest rates. Dalmine received financing under this program which was outstanding in the POI. To determine whether these programs conferred a benefit, we compared the effective interest rate paid by Dalmine to the benchmark interest rate, discussed above. Based on this comparison, we preliminarily determine that the financing provided under these programs is inconsistent with commercial considerations, i.e. , on terms more favorable than the benchmark financing. To calulcate the benefit from these programs, we used our standard long-term loan methodology as described in section 355.49(c)(1) of the Proposed Regulations. We then divided the benefit allocated to the POI for each program by Dalmine's total sales in 1993. On this basis, we determine the net subsidy from these programs to be 0.47 percent ad valorem for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. With respect to retraining grants provided to Dalmine under Law 675/77, it is the Department's practice to treat training benefits as recurring grants. ( See Certain Steel General Issues Appendix at 37226). Since the only grant reported under this program was received by Dalmine in 1986, any benefit to Dalmine as a result of this grant cannot be attributed to the POI. Therefore, we determine that retraining benefits provided under Law 675/77 conferred no benefit to Dalmine during the POI. B. Grants Under Law 193/84 According to the GOI, Articles 2, 3, and 4 of Law 193/84 provide for subsidies to close steel plants. As stated in Art. 20 of Law N. 46 of 17/2/1982, steel enterprises, including enterprises producing seamless pipes, welded pipes, conduits and welded pipes for water and gas, are the recipients of these subsidies. As benefits under this program are limited to the steel industry, we preliminary determine that Law 193/84 is de jure specific and, therefore, countervailable. In this investigation, information provided by Dalmine indicates that the company received grants under Law 193/84.
