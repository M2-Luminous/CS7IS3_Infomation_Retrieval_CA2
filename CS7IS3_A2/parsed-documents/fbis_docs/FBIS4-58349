They added that "the dialogue is beginning through local and international mediators and Damascus is not distant from that." They pointed out that "the end of Ja'ja''s role, the detached position of the Christians, and the cancellation of Pope John Paul II's visit to Lebanon have created the feeling that the current situation cannot continue as solutions in the region become imminent, and that peace requires internal stability and a strong Lebanese authority supported by the broadest sectors of Lebanese society." The same sources emphasized that "the meeting which took place between 'Awn and former President Shaykh Amin al-Jumayyil covered the dialogue issue but there were differences of opinion regarding the national conference 'Awn intends to convene in Paris in June. Al-Jumayyil is not expected to attend that conference, for several reasons." They added that "contacts made by mediators between 'Awn and the state have come a long way and the results will be known at the earliest possible time barring a surprise that would torpedo the entire process."
