The meeting, which lasted more than 30 minutes, has been described as positive. The two discussed matters of national interest in the short and medium term. They also discussed the current Constitution and the need to make changes to it. Media laws inherited from the recent past were also discussed. [Begin recording] [Eisenmann] He is doing everything possible to secure a consensus. Ten days before the elections I wrote an article saying that I was optimistic. There is evidence now that supports this optimism. The big test is always in what is done, not in what is said, but so far all of us can feel that this is a president for all Panamanians. [Reporter] What about a national agreement? [Eisenmann] I think that one of the most important components of a democracy is a vigorous opposition. I don't believe in just talking about national unity. This is a favorite thing for dictators. I think that in vigorous diversity there is the clear possibility of national consensus. I think that if he stays on the road down which he has started this will be possible. [end recording] Later, Perez Balladares visited EL SIGLO in the company of Raul Arango, who is the future presidency minister, and other important advisers. During his visit, Perez Balladares met with EL SIGLO's director, Jaime Padilla Beliz, and other members of the board of directors of that enterprise. He was invited to tour the installations and was able to talk to the personnel, who greeted him enthusiastically. Dr. Perez Balladares also visited the offices of the weekly EL CAMALEON, where he signed autographs and was photographed next to the equipment of this popular media organ, which has a high circulation. Dr. Perez Balladares said that these visits are part of his campaign promises. [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] This is a serious position, a commitment. I want to reiterate to the media that there will be absolute respect for freedom of expression, including the media that has aggravated me in the past, including the media opposed to me, which can continue opposing me with complete freedom. [Reporter] What do you think about the way you have been received? [Perez Balladares] Fine. I think that it is most important for people to maintain communications, to see each other, not to go separate ways. I plan to continue doing this now as president-elect, and you can be certain that as president I will also be visiting the media and talking to them. [Padilla Beliz] I think that these actions by the president-elect are very positive. Let's hope the other people in his party share this attitude. He is trying to comply with and consolidate his promises for a national agreement. This is a source of much enthusiasm. [end recording]
