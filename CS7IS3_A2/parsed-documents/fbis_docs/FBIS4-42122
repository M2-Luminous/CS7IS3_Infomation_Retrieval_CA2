Papoulias warned Tirana that Athens could stop the attacks against the Greek minority and described as unacceptable the position adopted by some U.S. officials that there is insufficient evidence of the violation of the Greek minority's rights. The foreign minister did not rule out that [Albanian President] Sali Berisha is supported by circles outside Albania. He also expressed concern over, but called for calm regarding, the recent Turkish provocations in Istanbul. Mr. Papoulias announced an initiative by the European Union [EU] at the troika level in the case of Albania and pointed out that Greece has lodged representations at all the international forums. He said that he has sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the latest Albanian provocations. Mr. Papoulias stressed that we are carefully guarding our borders and linked the problem to the economic support we render Tirana by tolerating the 400,000 illegal immigrants. He did not rule out that the Greek Government, using legal measures, might stop accepting illegal immigrants from Albania and increase the policing of the borders. Greece's moderate stance should not be interpreted as weakness or retreat. We are moderate, but certain issues are not raised for negotiation, they are self-evident, such as the rights of the Greek Albanians. This statement was made by government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos when asked about the government's view of the latest developments in Greek-Albanian relations. Mr. Venizelos stressed that representations are continuing. He said that if Albanian provocations do not stop, our country is ready to adopt measures to guard the borders; these measures involve using police and customs guards, not the military. Asked if the government intends to expel Albanian illegal immigrants following recent developments, the government spokesman stressed: The Greek Government would not hold illegal immigrants hostage to exercise its foreign policy because it is a country of justice. However, it is determined to exhaust all legal means.
