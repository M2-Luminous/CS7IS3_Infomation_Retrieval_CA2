The Ministry sent a guideline on this year's pay hikes to 45 local labor offices, which are to work for increases below 5 percent in prosperous industries such as electronics, shipbuilding and automobiles, because large rises in these areas might affect other sectors. It also decided that wage negotiations should be settled before late May. The Ministry hopes that wage hikes will be meted out not under the seniority system, but according to merit that fully reflects the achievements of workers. The Ministry will help management and labor in settling wage negotiations and a trade agreement at the same time.
