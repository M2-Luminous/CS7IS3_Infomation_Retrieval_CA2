De Greiff was referring to San Gil Bishop Monsignor Leonardo Gomez' admission to having held such meetings. In statements to the Colmundo Radio Network, the official said: "I think it is regrettable that a bishop has become a mailbox for subversives." The prelate said on 24 February that he met "with the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] 23d Front." He also said this guerrilla organization "did not perpetrate some crimes attributed to it in Velez Province; paramilitary groups did." De Greiff responded to those statements. When asked about the legal repercussions for such actions, he said that "one characteristic of the state of law is that no one is above the law, not even the most dignified person. No one can feel free to dictate his own behavioral guidelines." De Greiff added: "If the law that Colombians have approved forbids talking with subversives, then everybody must obey it: the president of the Republic, the bishops, and even the most humble Colombian." Two months ago, on 17 January, Santander authorities blamed the 23d Front for perpetrating a bloody and vicious attack on the Florian community that left five policemen dead. On August 1993, the National Committee of Victims of the Guerrillas [Comite Nacional de Victimas de la Guerrilla] (Vida), headed by lawyer Fernando Vargas, personally filed charges against Bishop Gomez at the Prosecutor General's Office for allegedly being an accomplice to and aiding and abetting the subversives.
