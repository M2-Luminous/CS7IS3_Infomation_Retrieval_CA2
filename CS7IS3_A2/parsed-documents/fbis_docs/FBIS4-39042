Groups of Russian and Ukrainian Military Experts Are at Work in Sevastopol"] [Text] Sevastopol -- Our correspondent met with Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy, the head of the Russian experts. [Gromov] The group of experts is involved in assessing the status of the fleet's forces, primarily the seagoing hardware [plavsredstva] which is to be divided up. The parameters for this division are being determined and a list is being drawn up of names of the ships and vessels that will go, in time, to the Russian Fleet and to the Ukrainian Navy. It is a painstaking job. It is necessary to look into every ship, every piece of hardware. The groups' experts have different viewpoints on some issues. And it is by no means simple to find a common language. But we are acting on the basis of the official accords that have already been secured during the previous meetings of the heads of state and defense ministers. No new accords are envisaged. The status of the ship "pool" is being assessed. [Pasyakin] Feliks Nikolayevich, there was a report that the Russian and Ukrainian delegations would be led by Yuriy Dubinin, Russian Foreign Ministry ambassador at large, and Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov. However, they have not come. Why? [Gromov] There was no full accord to the effect that the delegations would comprise precisely these members. There was an accord regarding the work of the groups of experts. I came in order to direct the Russian group. As for Valeriy Nikolayevich Shmarov, as a representative of the Ukrainian government he has expressed a desire to familiarize himself with certain fleet installations that may go to the Ukrainian side. We considered this normal and possible. If he comes to the fleet and wants to familiarize himself with certain facilities, we will show them to him. [Pasyakin] The officers, ensigns, and employees of the Crimean Naval Base sent an open letter to you. It asked you not to allow it to be handed over to the Ukrainian naval forces. "If that happens," the letter says, "over 7,000 officers and ensigns and family members will be left without the means of existence and will be forced to leave their homes." What do you think of that? [Gromov] I understand people's concern and disquiet, the position in which they find themselves. Where possible we will take this request into consideration. But I think that this letter is somewhat premature. Why? Because the division of a fleet is a lengthy process. And it does not mean that if some decision is adopted today, say, it will be implemented tomorrow. But the main thing that we will strive to do is not to harm people, not to harm the fleet and its combat capability.... [Gromov ends] Before my meeting with the commander in chief of the Russian Navy I asked Rear Admiral Aleksey Ryzhenko, first deputy commander and chief of staff of the Ukrainian Navy, how the joint work of the Russian and Ukrainian military experts was going. "We will follow the list of ships and vessels and divide them up fifty-fifty; then the Ukrainian side will sell Russia a number previously agreed. The groups of experts are expected to be at work for around a week." A Ukrainian delegation led by Boris Tarasyuk, who is, as we know, conducting the talks with the Russian side, arrived in Sevastopol 3 June. The delegation included Ukrainian Vice Premier Valeriy Shmarov and Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, Ukrainian first deputy defense minister. The Ukrainian delegation had a meeting with Adm. Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Navy. Yuriy Dubinin has not arrived in Sevastopol. The delegations look unequal. The talks seem to have become deadlocked. Needless to say, we should not expect a rapid practical solution to the question of the division of the Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine benefits from that, since Russia is effectively maintaining the entire fleet on its own and thus the Ukrainian part of it as well. Moreover certain politicians are in no hurry to close the question of the Black Sea Fleet, since they have by no means "squeezed" all the possible political "dividends" from it. The men are being patient. But this patience is not infinite. Do the politicians realize that?
