Days after their appointment premier Li Peng is to renew the appointment of the first batch of 43 Hong Kong Affairs Advisers in Shenzhen on March 2. The 43 received notification at the weekend from the local branch of XINHUA (the New China News Agency) for the Shenzhen trip. Now on a swing in the southern cities including Zhuhai and Shenzhen, the premier is scheduled to make his second tour to the border city early next month to attend a celebration of the completion of a mammoth water supply facility from the East River to Hong Kong. The strengthening of united front work comes as the first piece of legislation on the 1994/95 elections is about to be passed by the Legislative Council and the remaining controversial parts are due to be tabled in the legislature. According to sources close to XINHUA, the de facto embassy's three district offices have begun finalizing the list of the first batch of District Affairs Advisers. Formal invitation is scheduled to be extended by heads of the three district offices in Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and Sha Tin in the next fortnight. The official appointment is expected to be made by the local director of XINHUA, Zhou Nan. Unlike the Hong Kong Affairs Advisers who were jointly appointed by XINHUA and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Offce, the newly-created District Affairs Advisers will only come under XINHUA. The first batch of District Affairs Advisers would include members of the district boards, area committees and mutual aid committees which form the skeleton of the lower-tier political structure under the British administration. A number of District Affairs Advisers will be chosen from the hundreds of traditional kaifong associations, residents groups and neighborhood bodies in the territory. The source said it was almost certain that core leaders from the United Democrats, seen as subversive, would be excluded. But members of other liberal political groups such as the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood might be enlisted. The source maintained that, like the Hong Kong Affairs Advisers, the District Affairs Advisers would not be working as a group. "They will have regular meetings with XINHUA officials and be consulted on territory matters," the source said. The appointment of District Affairs Advisers means China will have its own three-tier consultative network in Hong Kong. Top of the structure is the 30 Hong Kong members in the 57 strong Preliminary Working Committee, which was formed under the National People's Congress Standing Committee last summer to pave the way for the setting up of the post 1997 region. Further down will be the Hong Kong Affairs Advisers of which 91 local leaders in two batches have been named since 1992. The third batch is expected to be appointed next month. The next structure will be District Affairs Advisers, the idea for which apparently came from Hong Kong people. Beijing decided to seriously consider the idea about "one to two months" ago in the face of the breakdown of Sino-British talks, the source said.
