In his words, the instruction No 53-RP was signed on February 4 after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan, however, only that part of the instruction which talks about re-burial of Japanese citizens whose graves are on Russian territory was made public. In Ilyukhin's estimate, this instruction to the Defense Ministry testifies to the beginning of a gradual transfer of the Kuril islands to Japan. Ilyukhin also reported that according to available information, one company of the ground attack air forces has already been withdrawn under the pretext that it was armed with obsolete aircraft. Ilyukhin proposed to commission the State Duma Committees on International Affairs and on Defense to verify this information. Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the parliament's lower house, reminded that on Friday Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is expected to deliver a speech during the so called "government hour." Rybkin proposed to put corresponding questions to the Defense Minister. According to a protocol, the State Duma International and Defense Committees were commissioned to verify Ilyukhin's information. The State Duma refused to include the issue of no-confidence in Russia's government into Wednesday's agenda. This proposal was put forward by deputy Igor Muravyev (the New Regional Policy group). While explaining his demand, Muravyev reminded that the Russian government has been acting freely without any control since October 1993. He reproached the government for failing to develop an anti- crisis program until now and for not solving the non-payment and debt crisis in the agricultural industrial complex and defense enterprises. According to Muravyev, the government was to submit the draft budget for 1994 at the moment the State Duma started its work in January, not at the end of March. As many as 81 deputies voted for Muravyev's proposal, 106 -- against, and 106 abstained.
