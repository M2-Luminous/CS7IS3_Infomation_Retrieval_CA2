FBIS4-59552 "drnes094_c_94004" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Egypt Musa on Peace, Bosnia, Foreign Relations Musa on Peace, Bosnia, Foreign Relations NC1305210194 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1845 GMT 13 May 94 NC1305210194 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] London, 13 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa emphasized Egypt's deep interest in the need to reach a just solution to the Bosnian problem. He called for lifting the weapons embargo to Bosnia and denounced the behavior of the forces that have been dealing with this problem but have not been serious about finding a solution to it. He described the crisis as a bad omen for the international community. In a lecture he delivered today before the Royal British Institute for Foreign Affairs (Chatham House), Musa said that more complicated problems will arise in Central and Eastern Europe if no solution is found to the Bosnian problem. He criticized the international community's behavior on this issue and condemned racial and sectarian discrimination in Bosnia. 'Amr Musa reiterated Egypt's stance, which calls for lifting the embargo on weapons to Bosnia, noting that the Serbs are getting weapons from Belgrade. He said that Egypt is ready to provide troops within the framework of a relevant UN resolution. He added: We in Egypt feel disappointed with the contradictory actions of the international community in Bosnia. He stressed the need to respect human rights there, adding that what is happening in Bosnia is a test for the new world order. In his lecture, which was attended by a number of Arab ambassadors, the British ambassador in Egypt, and a number of Middle East experts, the foreign minister referred to his visit to South Africa. He said that South Africa is now in the stage of change and that the nineties are important to all of us. He added: The change taking place now has positive and negative aspects. A new stage has also started in the Middle East following the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He said: We are seeking to achieve a permanent settlement based on guaranteeing the inalienable and political rights of everyone in the region and are looking toward the post-settlement stage to achieve development and prosperity. He noted that the achievement of these objectives will come through cooperation between all countries of the region. Musa added that Egypt will continue its efforts to give impetus to the peace process in the region, achieve peaceful coexistence between all parties, and reach a just solution that guarantees all the political rights of the parties involved. He emphasized that the stage following the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement will require more efforts, especially as there are still obstacles to peace. He explained that Egypt is seeking to achieve an Israeli withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, guarantee security for all countries, and establish peaceful and normal relations with Israel. He said: If all this is done, then the Middle East region will be completely different. The foreign minister said: Egypt has proposed the establishment of a forum for the Mediterranean basin countries to achieve cooperation between them and ensure that the Middle East region will be completely free from weapons of mass destruction on condition that all countries, including Israel, comply. Then the economic growth desired by all countries in the region will be achieved and the area will benefit from the available resources and thus ensure a better future for their peoples. 'Amr Musa, who is currently paying a visit to Britain, went on to say that Egypt's objective is to ensure that the Middle East is not isolated from the world but is interacting with its peoples. He said: While the region is now preoccupied with the peace process, it is also looking toward ending all the problems surrounding it, such as the one in Bosnia. He stressed that the situation in Bosnia does not differ much from the former state of the Cold War. He added: The threat to peace in Bosnia and the Balkans also is a threat to the Middle East and the Mediterranean basin. We must open the doors for interaction between the cultures of Europe, the Arab region, and the Mediterranean basin. He said: We do not want to go back to the Cold War era with all its challenges, hatreds, and confrontations. Musa noted that Egypt is interested in solving the problems in Yemen, Sudan, and Iraq because his country is part of the region, knows its responsibilities regarding these problems, and earnestly seeks to achieve stability in the area. He pointed out that as far as Yemen is concerned, Egypt seeks to contain the current differences and crisis there. Referring to the British policy, which he said he noted in his current talks with senior British officials, Musa said that Britain also wants to help achieve stability in the Middle East. He also noted that Egypt is interested in steering the Israeli-Palestinian talks in the right direction to achieve the desired objectives. He pointed out that the confidence-building process between the Arabs and Israel has already started but it requires time. It also must come from both sides, not just from the Arabs. Israel must work in that direction, too, he added. Musa stressed that the peace process in the region is still just beginning, since the negotiations between Israel and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon still remain. He noted that the Arab boycott of Israel will be lifted, but at the appropriate time. Musa noted that Egypt is concerned about the developments in Algeria. He hoped that stability will be achieved in Algeria, adding that the Algerian people are capable of establishing stability. He noted that what is happening in Algeria does not worry Egypt alone but all the countries in the region, the Arab and Islamic worlds, and Europe. He urged helping Algeria emerge from its current crisis. Turning to Egyptian-Sudanese relations, Musa noted that there is a difference between the two governments over the two countries' policies. He stressed that Egypt does not accept the partitioning of Sudan. On relations with Iran, Musa said that Egypt is concerned with security in the Gulf and the need to prevent attempts to export the Iranian revolution to other countries in the region. He added: With the exception of these points, there is no political antagonism between us and Iran. He called for Iran to change the policies it follows regarding the Arab region. Concerning the issue of Jerusalem, Musa said that it will be part of the negotiations to be held at a later stage between Israel and the Palestinians. He added: There is no reason to object to the principle of negotiations over Jerusalem or dividing it. The whole issue, he added, is negotiable between the Palestinians and Israelis. He stressed that Jerusalem will remain one city [madinah wahidah] and its status will be discussed at a later stage in the negotiations. Regarding the question of Iraq, Musa said that this issue is very complicated. He added: There is only one key to the crisis with Kuwait, namely, that Iraq recognizes Kuwait and that the UN Security Council resolutions on this subject be implemented. He stressed that Egypt does not accept the partitioning of Iraq or anything that may jeopardize its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Concerning the situation in Lebanon, Musa said that things are improving there and that the Lebanese Government is extending its authority over Lebanese territory. He stressed that Egypt is concerned with Lebanon's sovereignty and stability. Regarding Lebanese-Syrian negotiations, Musa said that there is a framework for negotiations and there are Security Council Resolutions 242 and 425. He hoped that stability will be restored in Lebanon and that the country will return its former stability.
