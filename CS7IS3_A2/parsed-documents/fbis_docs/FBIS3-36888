All Kazakh consumers have been ordered to pay debts for received fuel within a couple of weeks. National bank and a number of commercial banks will grant them certain credits for that. Custom duties on export coal deliveries will be abolished and tariffs on deliveries within the territory of the republic will be reduced. However, it will be very difficult to return all the debts as their sum is astronomical: Only the debt for wages in the Karagandaugol totals about 180 million tenge (approximately 16 million U.S. dollars).
