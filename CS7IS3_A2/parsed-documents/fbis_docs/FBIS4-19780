The U.S. President wants to extend the Sarajevo model to five other cities in Bosnia which the United Nations declared as safe zones. Gorazde is one of them, and yet another in a series of live broadcasts of that city's bloody siege by the Serbs has compelled President Clinton to assume once again a role he does not like, that of a world leader. As far as Bosnian issues are concerned, such a role is infinitely difficult and thankless, also because the army of armchair strategists, Balkan experts, and aerial warfare analysts immediately criticize any decision as too late, too hesitant, too belligerent, or too dangerous. It is not yet certain whether the NATO countries, especially those with troops in Bosnia, will agree to an expansion of the air forces' assignment. Just as uncertain is whether Moscow really is prepared to take part in the possible bombing of even those Serbian military facilities that do not pose a direct threat to UN forces. After all, this possibility of bombing forms the nucleus of the Sarajevo model: Unlike the case in Gorazde so far, in Sarajevo NATO said that it would attack more than just individual tanks or artillery pieces to provide so-called air support for the blue helmets. NATO said it would expand its targets to include anything that fires upon civilians within a radius of 20 km of Sarajevo. This certainly amounts to an escalation, because according to the Sarajevo model, air attacks do not serve tactical purposes such as the protection of friendly troops, but strategic purposes such as the protection of foreign civilians and forcing a withdrawal by the attackers. But NATO is not just trying to avoid a Gorazde-type massacre. It is also attempting to take the side of one of the parties to the conflict. This is exactly what many critics of the so-far hesitant NATO want. Just as many people in Europe consider U.S. aerial attacks a wonderful tactic, many in Washington believe in the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia. The Senate has voted four-fifths in favor of this, and more and more leading figures are arguing that the United States should cancel the embargo, if necessary without the approval of the United Nations or other NATO allies. "Let the Bosnians defend themselves," they suggest, meaning: "Then we will not have to be involved any more." Clinton is considerably more careful here. Although he has been calling for a lifting of the arms embargo ever since he took office, he only wants to do so together with the allies. In the White House, people fear that if the United States makes any moves on its own, it might suddenly be stuck with the commitment to deliver weapons to the Bosnians, and possibly also teach them how to use them, which would hardly be a reduction in U.S. involvement. In addition, what can the United States do if other countries unilaterally declare a lifting of arms embargoes, for example those against Iraq or Libya?
