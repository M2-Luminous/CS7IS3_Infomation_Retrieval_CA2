Before leaving on a private flight, the Panamanian president said: "I am going to harvest what we and President Gaviria have been cultivating for more than a year." Endara referred to Gaviria as "the godfather of democracy" in Panama. Foreign Minister Raul Mulino and more than 60 businessmen are travelling with President Endara to participate in the fourth meeting of the Neighborhood Commission created by the two nations to promote the integration of their economies and to resolve border conflict. Presidents Endara and Gaviria will sign an agreement that will permit the free trade of sixty items and the implementation of a sea line between Cartagena de Indias and Colon. The agreement will be implemented after a year of negotiations by the Neighborhood Commission. The two states are committed to keeping this agreement from hurting national production. For this reason, the initial list (of more than 200 items) was greatly reduced, an official of the Panamanian Foreign Trade Institute who worked in the drafting of the list has reported. In Medellin, Endara and Gaviria will also sign an agreement on the special status of people without legal documents. This agreement will allow the status of one country's nationals who live in the other country and who are able to prove that they have resided there continuously for more than two consecutive years to be legalized. The presidents will review the Neighborhood Commissions' work on security and border matters, the repatriation of arrested people, deportation procedures, and issues related to the social development of the two nations. Panama and Colombia initiated rapprochement in March 1991, when Gaviria visited Panama for the first time. This rapprochement led to the creation of the Neighborhood Commission, whose work began in 1992. July 1993 in the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias, Panama and Colombia signed a letter of understanding to encourage business cooperation and to increase trade relations to more than $300 million annually.
