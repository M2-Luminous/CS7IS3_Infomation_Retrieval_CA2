ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for residues of the plant pesticides watermelon mosaic virus-2 (WMV2) coat protein and zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) coat protein, as expressed in Asgrow line ZW20 of Cucurbita pepo L. and the genetic material necessary for the production of these proteins. Asgrow Seed Co. petitioned EPA for the exemption. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective November 2, 1994.

Cole, Acting Product Manager (PM) 21, Registration Division (7505C), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 227, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-6900. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38149), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Asgrow Seed Co., Kalamazoo, MI 49004, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4310 to EPA under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance the residues of the plant-pesticides watermelon mosaic virus-2 coat protein and zucchini yellow mosaic virus coat protein as expressed in Asgrow line ZW20 of Cucurbita pepo L., and subsequent generations obtained through normal sexual reproduction. An amendment to this petition was received on April 4, 1994, which changed the proposed exemption by including the genetic material necessary for the production of these proteins. There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. By way of public reminder, this notice also reiterates the registrant's responsibility, under section 6 (a)(2) of FIFRA, to submit additional factual information regarding adverse effects on the environment and to human health by the pesticide. The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticides and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: October 17, 1994. Daniel M. Barolo, Director, Office of Pesticide Programs. Therefore, 40 CFR part 180 is amended as follows: PART 180_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 180 continues to read as follows: Authority: 21 U.S.C. 346a and 371. 2. In subpart D, by adding new ยง180.1132, to read as follows: ยง180.1132 Watermelon mosaic virus-2 coat protein, zucchini yellow mosaic virus coat protein, and the genetic material necessary for the production of these proteins; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance. The plant pesticides watermelon mosaic virus-2 coat protein and zucchini yellow mosaic virus coat protein as expressed in Asgrow line ZW20 of Cucurbita pepo L. and the genetic material (nucleic acids) necessary for the production of these proteins are exempted from the requirement of a tolerance in this transgenic plant and in subsequent generations of Asgrow line ZW20 of cucurbita pepo L. obtained through normal sexual reproduction.
