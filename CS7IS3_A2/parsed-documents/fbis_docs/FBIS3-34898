Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports this has been decided in a session chaired by Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin on a UN request that Israel send a Medical Corp unit to Angola. Later this week Deputy Minister Beilin will meet UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali for discussing the location to which the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] representatives are to be sent. The place will be one of the conflict ridden areas in Africa. Our correspondent notes that Israel prefers to send soldiers to areas in which it has strategic interests, such as the Horn of Africa.
