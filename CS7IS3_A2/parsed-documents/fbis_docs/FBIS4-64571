German payments to the "European Development Fund" (Lome Agreement), which is financed outside the EU budget through payments from member states, will presumably amount to DM913 billion [as published] in 1994. This is what the Federal Finance Ministry says in its answer to a written question in the Bundestag (printed matter 12/7296). The ministry gives a detailed explanation of the legal and technical bases for the financing of the EU budget by the member states. The German payment obligation results from the EC Council decision of 24 June 1988 on the system of the Community's own resources, which was ratified by the Bundestag on 20 December 1988. This decision on the financing of the EU budget envisages maximum EU resources totalling 1.20 percent of the annual GNP at market prices in the Community. This quota is achieved by means of the following revenue procedures: In addition to its traditional own resources (customs and levies), to which the Community is basically entitled, the Community can access the revenue from the value-added tax (value-added tax funds) up to 1.4 percent of the "standard assessment basis." This assessment basis corresponds to the sum of all sales at final consumption level that are taxable under Community laws. The methods of calculation are the same for all member states and are stipulated in an EEC directive. According to the Federal Finance Ministry, they are undisputed in substance. The Commission and the Court of Auditors of the European Community have to supervise the standardized calculation of the value-added tax assessment basis by all member states. This has probably not always been sufficiently done in the past. However, the Federal Government now sees an "increasing improvement." The value-added tax assessment basis is only considered up to a maximum 55 percent of GNP, however. This lower rate was introduced above all in response to criticism of economically weaker member states which, compared with other member states and measured by the respective GNP, have a relatively high assessment basis. The balance of the EU budget that is not covered by this revenue is financed by way of a standardized rate of payment being applied to the respective GNP of member states. The harmonization of the assessment of GNP by EC directive was started and is making "good progress," according to Bonn officials. The regulation on the EU's own resources, which was basically adopted by the European Council on 11-12 December 1992, is intended to reduce the importance of value-added tax funds for the period 1995-1999, and is to orient the structure of the EU's own resources at the GNP system to a larger extent. This will be done through the gradual reduction of the upper ceiling of the value-added tax funds from 1.4 percent to 1.0 percent by 1999 and through the step-by-step reduction of the value-added tax assessment basis to 50 percent of the respective GNP for all member states. According to the Federal Finance Ministry, from 1989 to 1997 the Federal Republic of Germany paid or will pay to the Community budget the following sums (in billion German marks): 1989 -- 23.8 1990 -- 22.0 1991 -- 32.5 1992 -- 35.3 1993 -- 37.8 1994 -- 44.2 1995 -- 45.4 1996 -- 48.5 1997 -- 52.3 However, there have also been payments from the EU budget back to the Federal Republic. This means that the net amounts paid by Germany were lower (in billion German marks): 1989 -- 13.4 1990 -- 11.6 1991 -- 19.1 1992 -- 22.0 1993 -- 23.6 The Federal Government has said that because of the "erratic course of paybacks," it is not possible at this early point to estimate the German net payment for 1994. On the basis of the resolutions adopted by the European Council in Edinburgh in December 1992, the Council, the European Parliament, and the Commission on 29 October 1993 agreed on a spending plan for the period 1994-1999. The Federal Government stresses in its statement that it will stand by the obligations it assumed within the scope of the EC. The government, however, is prepared, in the scope of its possibilities, to keep the Federal Republic's financial burdens within acceptable limits by pursuing a strict course of budgetary discipline. The Federal Government will in the future increasingly "push its financial interest in higher paybacks to Germany" in connection with the formulation of unavoidable Community expenditures and in connection with the appropriation of funds. It is seeing possibilities of approach in particular in the area of the so-called "internal policies."
