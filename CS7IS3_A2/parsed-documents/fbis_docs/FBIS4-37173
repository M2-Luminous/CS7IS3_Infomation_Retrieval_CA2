[passage omitted] These stances could then be considered as a consensus of the majority of world countries in support of the Great Jamahiriyah's position regarding a solution to its crisis with Western states. These stances express the real will of the international community and expose Western countries' stance which use their domination of the UN Security Council to [word indistinct] international resolutions and claim they express the will of the international community. The editor said that this international consensus, in support of the great Jamahiriyah and which calls for the lifting of the unjust measures imposed on it by Western countries in the name of the UN Security Council, once again exposed the truth of this council and revealed the isolation in which these countries now find themselves against the voices of the world's countries, people, organizations, as well as political, cultural, and prominent social figures who expressed their true stances in support of the Great Jamahiriyah, not the stances fabricated in their names in the so-called Security Council under threats and blackmail from Western countries which dominate this Council. Furthermore, the international community, embodied in these countries and organizations, demand that the UN Security Council acts with respect to the crisis between the Great Jamahiriyah and Western countries, according to the provisions of the sixth chapter of the UN Charter, because this is the right direction toward finding a solution to this crisis and toward an end to be put to the fallacy and the dilemma in which the council had fallen when it acted according to Article 7 of the UN Charter, an act that was a breach of this charter and an insult to the conscience and values of the international community and a falsification of its will.
