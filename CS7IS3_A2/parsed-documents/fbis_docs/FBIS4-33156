Cuban Foreign Ministry sources confirmed to PRENSA LATINA yesterday's arrival in Havana of Ambassador Willy Verriest, who has already met with acting Foreign Minister Isabel Allende. The Cuban side described this meeting as positive. The diplomat's presence in the country is considered a demonstration of Belgium's interest in obtaining a satisfactory solution to the incident. Cuba and Belgium agree on the illegal nature of the forced entry into the building, which has been occupied by a group of people since Saturday in an attempt to force the foreign mission to enable them to leave the country without carrying out the normal procedures established for leaving. It has been learned that Verriest was ambassador to Cuba from November 1986 to February 1990 and now holds a high position in the Belgian Foreign Ministry. Parallel to his initial activities in Cuba, it was reported that Alfredo Morales, Cuban ad interim charge d'affaires in Brussels, has met with Belgian Foreign Ministry officials, especially the chief of staff of that Ministry. The objective of that meeting was also to exchange ideas and positions on the development of the negotiations begun by the two parties immediately after the occupation of the Belgian ambassador's residence in Cuba. Cuban Foreign Ministry officials consulted by PRENSA LATINA reaffirmed the normal nature of the negotiations, which are being conducted in accordance with the international customs and regulations that exist for these types of cases. The Cuban position, which is shared by the Belgian mission, is that of facilitating the departure from the diplomatic residence of all the people who violated its extraterritoriality, independent of whether afterwards and in accordance with pesent legal provisions, they begin the appropriate steps to leave the country.
