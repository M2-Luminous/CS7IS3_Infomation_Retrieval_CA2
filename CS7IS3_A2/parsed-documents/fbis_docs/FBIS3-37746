In a statement on 16 February, the Armenian Foreign Ministry officially admitted that eight Azerbaijani prisoners were shot and killed while attempting to escape. The ministry also said that the Armenian Defense Ministry was investigating the incident in accordance with the Geneva Conventions and that the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] representative in Yerevan had been informed of the situation. The world condemned the criminal practice of establishing camps for POW's long ago. The Geneva Conventions adopted in 1949 called for the safety of war victims. Those Conventions banned the inhuman treatment of POW's. Armenia's criminal action not only grossly conflicted with the Conventions but also openly violated the accepted norms of morality and international law. The Azerbaijani prisoners were shot after Azerbaijan revealed that it was prepared to unconditionally exchange all the hostages and POW's. Azerbaijan's government organs have unilaterally released over 100 Armenian POW's since August 1993 and, in accordance with its signing of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Azerbaijan has revealed that it condemns the taking of hostages by any side during the military operations. Azerbaijan's ruling organs repeatedly appealed to their counterparts in Armenia to maintain a similar approach to the issue of the Azerbaijani hostages and POW's. But the Republic's appeals failed to yield a result. The mistreatment of the innocent war victims reconfirms Armenia's involvement in the war against Azerbaijan. Otherwise, why should POW camps be established near Gumry, Spitak, Echmiadzin, and Gugark in Armenia? Over 3,500 people are imprisoned in them, most of them children, women, and elderly people. The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry expresses indignation over the Armenian ruling organs' fearless activities and describes them as inhuman. It calls on the international community, the ICRC, and other international and humanitarian organizations to investigate all the aspects of Armenia's criminal action.
