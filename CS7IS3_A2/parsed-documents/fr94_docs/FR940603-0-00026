ACTION: Final temporary rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary rule to regulate the operation of the S36 Bridge over the St. Croix River at mile 23.4, at Stillwater. The present opening schedule has contributed to traffic delays and congestion in Stillwater. The existing regulation is being temporarily amended for the purpose of evaluating the reasonableness of proposed changes. The Coast Guard is requesting comments from interested parties throughout the evaluation period. EFFECTIVE DATES: This temporary rule is effective from June 3, 1994 to October 15, 1994. Comments must be received on or before November 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Commander (ob), Second Coast Guard District, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63103&hyph;2832, Attention: docket CGD02&hyph;93&hyph;002. Comments may also be delivered to room 2.107B at the above address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays. For information concerning comments, the telephone number is (314) 539&hyph;3724. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roger K. Wiebusch, Bridge Administrator, Second Coast Guard District, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63103&hyph;2832, telephone (314) 539&hyph;3724. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD02&hyph;93&hyph;002), identify the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. Each person who wants an acknowledgment of the receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. The Coast Guard may change or not implement a final rule in view of the comments. The Coast Guard does not plan to hold another public meeting. However, persons may request a public meeting by writing to the Docket Clerk at the address under ADDRESSES . If the Coast Guard determines that the opportunity to make oral presentations will aid the rulemaking process, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the Federal Register . Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Wanda G. Renshaw, Project Manager, and Lieutenant Commander Arn Denny, Project Attorney. Regulatory History On Friday, October 8, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation Regulations, St. Croix River, Minnesota and Wisconsin in the Federal Register (58 FR 52466). The Coast Guard received six comments on the proposal. A public meeting was requested and held on April 7, 1994, in the Stillwater Municipal Building. For the reasons discussed below, the Coast Guard has decided to issue a temporary regulation which will allow it to evaluate the proposed changes for the remainder of the summer boating season. The Coast Guard has decided that good cause exists for making this temporary regulation effective upon publication in the Federal Register because, since vessel traffic falls off dramatically in the fall, early implementation will provide for an evaluation period which will include as much of the summer boating season as is possible. Background and Purpose The St. Croix River is heavily used by recreational craft. River excursion boats are the only known commercial navigation passing the bridge. To meet the navigational needs of these boaters, the S36 Bridge is presently required to open on signal, from May 15 through October 15, on a set schedule of hourly and half-hourly openings from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. From October 16 through May 14 the draw will open on signal if at least 24 hours notice is given.
