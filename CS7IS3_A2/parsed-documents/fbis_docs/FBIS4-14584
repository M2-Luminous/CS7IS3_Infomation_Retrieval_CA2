Earlier, Russia cut its gas deliveries to Belarus because of huge outstanding debts of the republic's consumers to the Russian state-run gas company. But as a result of Russian-Belarusian negotiations, gas supplies to the former Soviet republic were resumed in the full volume, some 54 million cubic metres a day, from March 15. Since then, Belarusia's debt to Gazprom has increased by another 100 billion roubles and reached 500 billion roubles. Attempts by the Belarusian Government to recover debts from the republican gas consumers and to repay them to Russian suppliers have been in vain so far. However, the Gazprom official said, in contrast to Ukraine, Belarusia has not resorted to syphoning gas intended for Western consumers from the pipelines crossing the republic's territory. Therefore, gas consumers in Brest, Lithuania, the Kaliningrad region and Poland are likely to continue receiving Russian gas in the full volume. Ukraine has not yet managed to repay its gas debts to Russia either. As a result of the latest Russian-Ukrainian negotiations, gas deliveries to Ukraine were resumed in the full volume for a month's period, until April 10.
