"Today Africa stands at the door of total political liberation as apartheid is about to be relegated to the ignominy of history", the organisation's secretary general, Salim Ahmed Salim said. Addressing the 59th session of the OAU Council of Ministers which began in Addis Ababa Monday, Salim said at a time when South Africa was undergoing fundamental transformation, Africa which had invested so much energy and resources in support of the liberation movements must make its presence felt in that country. He told the foreign ministers that Africa had a responsibility to South Africa and must sustain interest and keep the momentum of support to the on-going process in order to accomplish the objectives it set for itself in the country. "Today, when we are walking the final mile and we are about to see the results of years of struggle and sacrifice, we owe it to ourselves and the people of South Africa not to relax our vigilance or allow our enthusiasm to diminish", he said. The end of apartheid, Salim stressed, marked not only the closing of one of the saddest chapters in the history of Africa, but also the beginning of a new challenge of economic cooperation in the southern African sub- region and Africa as a whole. "We now need to see how the immense potential which exists in South Africa in terms of capital, resources and know-how, can interface with those found in the rest of the continent, to forge an economic partnership which can propel the continent to new heights of growth and development". Salim said for Africa to successfully monitor the forth-coming South Africa elections, "we need to be there, in good time and in sufficient numbers, to support the process and to encourage our brothers and sisters". He said that concerted action on the part of African countries would make a difference similar to the success they achieved during the Namibian election. Africa must give some material assistance to the liberation movements to enable them compete against a government "endowed with almost unlimited resources and the advantage of incumbency", he added. The OAU scribe urged African states to urgently contribute to the election fund established at the OAU summit in Cairo in 1993 to support the liberation movements.
