The sources described as false and completely unfounded the claim made by the new Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] ambassador to Namibia regarding South African extreme right-wing elements. The sources said the claim is an MPLA ploy aimed at diverting attention from the mercenaries the Futungo de Belas government has been recruiting through the (Executive Altcom) company. We have been informed that mercenaries recruited by the MPLA in Namibia and South Africa are in Cabo Ledo.
