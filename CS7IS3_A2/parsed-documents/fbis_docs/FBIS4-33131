[Begin recording] [Escovar] We want to expedite the issuance of gun licenses, remove middlemen from the process of issuing them, and make people pay what the law stipulates, instead of paying for bribes, which trigger illegal gunrunning in the country. In other words, we want to moralize the Interior Ministry's services, as well as increase its control. The Interior Ministry must control this issue. No other Venezuelan authority can issue gun licenses. This is what the law stipulates, and the law must be enforced. [Da Corte] Would you please explain to us why the population should see the issuance of gun licenses as something that has gone awry? Those who want to bear arms should be able to. This does not necessarily mean people are going to start killing one another. [Escovar] Of course not. Those who have gun licenses do not kill; usually it is only those who lack gun licenses. On the other hand, the legal and peaceful use of arms is a discipline that must be taught to the people; it is part of public education campaigns. It is also part of democracy, but so far we have failed to accomplish this goal. Therefore, we must strive to accomplish it. In a national emergency, we cannot let peaceful citizens go unarmed while criminals and thieves are armed. [end recording] The head of the Interior Ministry also listed some measures that will be adopted shortly, including the expediting of the issuance of gun licenses and removing middlemen from the process of obtaining gun licenses, as well as exerting effective control on the issuance of gun licenses.
