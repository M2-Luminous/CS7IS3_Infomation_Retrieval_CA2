They are expected to resume at the beginning of next week. The joint statement was released this morning in Jerusalem and Tunis. It says the talks will be held on the basis of the Declaration of Principles signed in September and the controversial Cairo understandings reached last week. In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the joint statement means that the border issues and the size of the Jericho enclave are no longer up for negotiation. David Ze'ev reports: [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was cautious this morning. The bitter taste of crisis was still strong, but the foreign minister also spoke in no uncertain terms: Israel's right to maintain security control over the external borders to Jordan and Egypt from the self-rule areas remains intact, as does its objection to enlarging any further the Jericho area as was if not agreed upon, at least understood in last week's Cairo understandings. The joint statement was signed by Peres for the Israelis and by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] on behalf of the Palestinians. Foreign Minister Peres said the Palestinians have learned that when Israel says it will not back down from its security needs, it means it. And this time, said Peres, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat would be best advised not to overrule this joint statement. [Peres] I think that if this will be done, we will lose credibility in the eyes of everybody. I was told that this is a decision that was taken by the action committee -- I do not know exactly the name of the institution -- and it is collective responsibility. [Ze'ev] This is only one stage. Now the negotiations have to resume in Taba. How far are we from the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First accord? [Peres] Depends upon the amount of difficulties we may encounter as we go along. If it will go smoothly, it can be done in weeks. If we shall again encounter some very complicated issues, this will take more time. But I believe that all of us intend to work continuously so we shall really arrive at a conclusion at the earliest possible date. The land is not burning. We are not operating under fire. We are operating under reason. [Ze'ev] There is room for some maneuvering. Foreign Minister Peres said Israel has agreed to the PLO's demand for what were described as stylistic changes to the Cairo understandings, but otherwise on the agenda, said Peres, will be the transfer of civilian authorities in a number of areas; security on the roads; and the details concerning the size and authority of the Palestinian council that will be in place to supervise matters once the self-rule arrangement is implemented. The foreign minister said he believes the existing difficulties could be resolved, but he preferred not to project whether implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First arrangement will be completed on schedule by April 13th.
