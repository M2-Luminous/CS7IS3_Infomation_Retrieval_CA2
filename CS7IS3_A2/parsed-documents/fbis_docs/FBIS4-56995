Last month saw the fall of the cabinet of Prime Minister Nelson Oduber of the socialist MEP [People's Electoral Movement]. Since then, he has not been able to reach agreement with opposition leader Hennie Eman of the liberal AVP [Aruban People's Party]. The shaky MEP coalition (the party had 9 of the 21 parliamentary seats) with the ADN [National Democratic Action] and PPA [Aruban Patriotic Party] splinter parties (one seat each) suddenly collapsed because Oduber was more than tired of the favoritism policies of his partners. The two political dwarfs repeatedly succeeded in pushing things through as they wanted because the MEP could not govern without them. Oduber tried to avoid holding new elections by offering to form a cabinet comprising the AVP, which also has 9 seats, for the remaining three years of the government's term. Eman immediately said he was against the suggestion. "That would mean that the AVP approved the policies of the last year and was also jointly responsible for them. I am ready to form a crisis government with the MEP as long as elections are organized within a year," he said. That was going too far for Oduber. After removing the ADN and PPA ministers, he remained with an outgoing cabinet of five MEP ministers. He preferred new elections and withdrew his instructions to the two negotiators he had appointed to examine the possibility of forming a cabinet. Aruba's eight political parties are to present their lists of candidates by 8 June. Six parties are advocating maintenance of the separate status [from the Netherlands] as the most important point on their programs. The elections will be held on 29 July, which does not suit the AVP.
