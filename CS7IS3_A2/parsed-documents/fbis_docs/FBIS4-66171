The Final Act's Impact on China's Economic Trade 1.The Uruguay Round's relevance to China. In July 1986, the Chinese government formally applied to regain China's status as a GATT signatory state. In September of that year, the Chinese government attended the new Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations in the status of full participant. For seven years, China enthusiastically attended this round of negotiations from beginning to end, and made due contributions to the successful negotiations. In the process of negotiations, besides making significant adjustments in economic and trade policies in accordance with the requirements of the negotiations, China submitted tariff reduction forms for agricultural products and non-agricultural products, involving taxes on more than 800 agricultural products and taxes on more than 4,000 nonagricultural products. In the trade service aspect, from start to finish, in addition to participating in the negotiations and drafting of the general agreement on trade service, China also submitted the final trade service reduction form, and opened sectors which included banking, insurance, shipping, land and sea oil exploration, professional services (including legal, accounting, etc.), computers, real estate, and advertising. Plans are for China to initial all Uruguay Round accords at April's ministerial level meeting, but the actual implementation of these accords must wait for China to reenter GATT and become a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). 2. The Uruguay Round's final act and its impact on China's economy and trade. There is no doubt that the agreement to liberalize world trade described in the final act of the Uruguay Round will push world markets open further and promote the world's economy, in which the growth and promotion of international trade in most countries has fallen upon hard times insofar as creating significant economic efficiency and employment opportunities are concerned. Economists believe that the Uruguay Round's agreement to liberalize world trade will bring a $6,000 billion increase in output value in the next decade, and by 2005, the gross amount of world trade will have increased by 12 percent from the current level of $3,600 billion. However, the benefits that accrue from the agreement to liberalize world trade will be different for each country in the world, especially for poor nations which import agricultural products, because they will pay more to purchase grain in the world market. Talking about China's situation, the Uruguay accord will have the following impact on our economy and trade. 1. It will assist the further development of China's economic trade, especially the foreign-oriented economy. It will help to promote and expand export of China's products and service, to expand attraction of foreign capital. This is chiefly due to: a) Internationally, the success of the Uruguay Round will help restrain western nations' trade protectionism and push them further into China's open market while providing good and relaxed external conditions for our economic development; b) the free trade benefits from the Uruguay Round must be extended to China, because although China in not yet a GATT member, we have signed bilateral trade accords with MFN status; c) since the implementation of the policy of opening and reform, China's economy has become more closely linked to the world economy, and the pace of that linkage is accelerating. In recent years, reform and opening have gone further and expanded, and the lasting rapid development of China's economy has created a nice internal environment for the further development of economy and trade. One analysis by an economic cooperation organization showed that China will be one of the countries deriving the most benefits from the Uruguay Round's trade liberalization, and by 2002, its annual income will reach $37 billion. But a more open market means more intense competition, setting out a new and more serious challenge to the mix and quality of China's export products and service. China's domestic market will face strong competitive pressures from imported products, and our export products must also face a strong fight for markets with other countries' products. For this, we must have clear understanding and preparation. 2. For the next step in China's economic and foreign trade reform, the Uruguay Round accord will be an important reference point. It will play an important role in making our economic and foreign trade system match up better with international regulations. 3. It gives a greater urgency to the negotiations for China's rejoining GATT, and the negotiation assignment will be more critical. According to the schedule set up by the Uruguay Round and the conditions for funding membership set by the WTO accord, China must have completed its GATT re-entry before the WTO goes into effect (estimates are for July 1995, with the final date for going into effect to be established at the ministerial level meeting in April 1994). Otherwise, China will have to re-apply to join the WTO again, pay an expensive second time "entry fee," and will also have greater obligations in opening markets. Speaking of the assignment, the accords reached in the Uruguay Round will become the obligations China must comply with. So, in the future negotiations on rejoining GATT, the signatory parties will demand a higher price from China. 4. On the other hand, the final act of the Uruguay Round will also have some negative impact on China's economic and trade development. For example, it allows cross-industry retaliation (as an example, a nation can take retaliatory measures against fabric products for problems in intellectual property rights and service industries). Although the unified system for resolving disputes will alleviate international trade disputes more efficiently to prevent unilateral retaliation, it will not resolve the problem of some countries exploiting their domestic laws (for example, the American Special 301 Provision) to implement restrictive measures against foreign countries in order to retaliate for trade problems; some countries such as the U.S. have made anti-dumping agreements part of their domestic laws, opening a convenient door for them to use anti-dumping restrictions on imports at their will. It is worth mentioning that it will be some time before the final act of the Uruguay Round goes into effect, and there will be gradual implementation of the trade liberalization agreement in it, so its impact on China's economy and trade will also be gradual. In short, while on the one hand, the final act of the Uruguay Round will be favorable to the further development of China's economy and trade, on the other hand, its imperfect nature will have some negative impact on the development of China's economy and trade. At the same time, it makes China's GATT re-entry negotiations all the more urgent and formidable.
