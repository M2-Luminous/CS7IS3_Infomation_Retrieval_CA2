From whom has this initiative come? [Shumeyko] The initiative of concluding a treaty between Kaliningrad Oblast Administration and the federal government has come from the Security Council. It should be pointed out that the Potsdam Agreement remains in force in perpetuity. But certain politicians are using its 50th anniversary to raise the question of the oblast's status; they are starting to say in this connection that the Potsdam Agreements are expiring inasmuch as the Soviet Union does not exist, Stalin does not exist, and Russia is not the Union's legal successor in this sphere; and they propose to raise the question of Kaliningrad Oblast's once again becoming a protectorate of Germany or being regarded as a separate state. Along with this there is also talk of the need for a demilitarized zone on the territory of Kaliningrad Oblast, of the fact that the presence of troops hinders economic development, and so on. Therefore the Security Council has decided to sign this treaty. [Sherova] What is it proposed to enshrine in the treaty? What changes will there be in relations? [Shumeyko] As we know, the local government can delegate to the federal government as many rights and powers as the federal government can transfer to the local government. Thus, the Security Council reached the conclusion that as many rights as possible must be transferred today to the government of Kaliningrad Oblast, so that the local authorities can react promptly and clearly to any manifestations. For Russia, a quick and appropriate response relating to what is going on in that region is very important. Therefore we will prepare this treaty very thoroughly. We will weigh up what to transfer and what to take on at the federal level. [Sherova] The treaty with Tatarstan elicited contradictory comments. How valid are the fears of those who believe that such treaties shake Russia's unity? [Shumeyko] On the contrary, this strengthens the Federation's unity. Tatarstan is right in the middle of the Russian Federation and does not have external borders. Many people say that it is written in the treaty with Tatarstan that Tatarstan is a subject of international law -- which will enable it to secede from the Russian Federation. Secede to where? Either upward or underground? Moreover, the signing of the treaty with Tatarstan led to elections being held there in March. We in the Federation Council have acquired two more members. By entering the Federation Council, resolving federal problems, and participating in the life of the Federation, Tatarstan is becoming still more involved in all-Russia problems. I would only welcome this treaty. [Sherova] It will soon be three months since the Federation Council started its work. How satisfied are you with this work? [Shumeyko] I am satisfied, although many people say: Look, so much time has passed, and not one law has been adopted. It is not a matter today of the number of legislative acts that the Federal Assembly must adopt. It is a matter of quality. We must all be aware of one truth: If we regard the question of the development of the Russian state as being of paramount importance, then we must be very attentive toward the legislative base today. On no account must this legislative base bear a trace of political struggle. I will cite the following example: The chairman of the Federation Council Committee for Agrarian Questions is a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Just a few months ago it would have been unthinkable for a leader of the Communist Party to be a committe chairman in a country carrying out democratic transformations. The standing orders are very important for any parliament. For deputies, standing orders are the paramount law after the Constitution. We adopted the standing orders in half a day. I must say that the last Supreme Soviet never adopted standing orders but worked with temporary standing orders, because, if the democrats' faction proposed something, the communists rejected it, and if the communists proposed something, the democrats rejected it without considering the substance of the proposals. [Sherova] What are relations like between the Federation Council and the State Duma? [Shumeyko] Normal. Russia is so tired of political troubles and so tired of a confrontation that is of no use to anyone that we must simply display concerted work. We must now adopt the budget and tax legislation as quickly and correctly as possible. [Sherova] Do you believe that the strategy enshrined in the president's message and the premier's report is capable of rallying the main political forces to resolve the set tasks? [Shumeyko] I believe it is. Because both the Duma and we ourselves have responded identically: to discuss in committees, to place on the session agenda, and to coordinate the president's message with the plan of legislative work. If we really link the president's message with the plan of legislative work and adopt legislation in development of the president's message, then one way or another it will become the rails along which everything will travel. [Sherova] Many deputies believe that the message says a great deal about what must be done but does not say how to do it. [Shumeyko] Are we to require everything at once of the head of state: an interpretation both of what is to be done and how to do it? This resembles what things were like in old Rus: The nobleman will come along and settle everything. In the modern world it is impossible to pile all the work onto one person, even if all the analysts work for him. What are the deputies for, then? What are the government, the court, the prosecutor's office, and all the rest for? The head of state delivered a message which set forth -- in my view, for the first time in the whole history of perestroyka -- a clear program, and you get the feeling that these are the words of a head of state who has acknowledged a number of mistakes, named all the sensitive points, and indicated what work needs to be done. I myself am a production worker. In production there are always two camps which argue and fight each other. There is the chief designer and the chief technologist. The designer answers the question: What is to be done? The technologist answers the question: How is it to be done? The truth is born of this dispute. The head of state is the designer and is responsible for the question of what is to be done in the state today. The technologists are all the rest: the legislators, the government, the prosecutor's office, the court, etc. It is they who must answer the question of how it is to be done. [Sherova] Do you not think that the emergence of more and more new parties will lead to chaos in political life? [Shumeyko] More than 100 parties are now registered at the Ministry of Justice. But nothing has come of this. The people live as they lived before. Politicians like to show that they influence what the masses do. In fact they have almost no influence. This can be both good and bad. [Sherova] But are parties created as a tool to seize power? [Shumeyko] If a politician does not think of seizing power, he is simply not a politician. But an interesting situation, in my view, has taken shape in Russia today. The question of seizing power has become secondary and disappeared from the agenda. This is something that politicians will never understand. The question of strengthening power stands in first place. All the powers that exist will be strengthened when the Russian state is strong. Today it is customary to personify power, which is why people associate presidential power with Yeltsin. I respect him, but some people do not like him. Those who do not like him say that presidential power is bad because Yeltsin stands up there. They, these politicians, must understand that if they do not find within themselves today the strength to reinforce this same presidential power and only then fight to become president, then nothing good will happen in Russia. But they are now shaking this power which they subsequently want to seize. Enough of shaking it, it is time to strengthen it.
