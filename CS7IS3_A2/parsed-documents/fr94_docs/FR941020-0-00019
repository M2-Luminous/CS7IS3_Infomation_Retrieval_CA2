Posting of Discounts on Firm Transportation Indicated Companies request clarification that the posting requirement applies to firm, as well as interruptible discounts. The regulation refers to transportation discounts, which includes both firm and interruptible discounts. VI. Capacity Allocation Log In Order No. 566, the Commission eliminated a number of requirements for pipelines to post information about requests for transportation service. The Commission replaced these requirements with a more limited requirement that was better tailored to the methods used by pipelines to allocate capacity under Order No. 636 during periods when demand exceeds supply. Those pipelines relying on contract data or other data for allocating capacity must maintain a log showing for each shipper, the applicable contract dates or other data used to allocate capacity. The log for pipeline affiliates must be posted on the pipelines' EBBs, while the log for both affiliates and non-affiliates must be maintained by the pipelines and provided to the Commission upon request. MGS/Natural contend that the capacity allocation log should be removed because the industry has no need for or interest in the data. ANR/CIG maintain that if the primary basis for capacity allocation is rate paid, the capacity allocation log is not needed. They maintain undue discrimination cannot take place when contract data is only the secondary basis for allocation and that the burden of maintaining the log, therefore, is not warranted. Columbia/Columbia Gulf request a waiver of the allocation log requirement, contending that on their system, the only information other than the rate used to allocate capacity is the date nominations for interruptible transportation are received. The Commission finds that the capacity allocation log is necessary. When demand for interruptible service exceeds available supply, Commission policy and pipeline tariffs require that the interruptible capacity first be allocated on the basis of the rate bid. However, if the rate bid is not sufficient, some pipelines assign priority based on contract data, such as contract execution date, the date service is requested, or the date gas is first shipped under a contract. Even though contract data are the secondary basis for allocating capacity, such information can be very important during a constraint situation when many shippers are willing to bid the highest rate necessary to retain capacity. The capacity allocation log provides a reasonable means for non-affiliated shippers and the Commission to ensure that pipelines do not unfairly favor their affiliates during periods when capacity is at a premium. The allocation log provides this important information with only minimal burdens on the pipelines. It consists of only five data elements and will not have to be updated frequently, because the contract data used for allocating capacity generally remain the same. Implicit in Columbia/Columbia Gulf's waiver request is an assumption that the rule requires posting of the dates on which nominations are received. The rule generally was designed to reduce the burden on pipelines and, therefore, the Commission did not intend for pipelines to have to maintain and post data that varies every day, such as nomination dates and times. The capacity log is designed to capture information that remains stable over time, such as the date a contract is executed or the service request date, or other similar data relating to service under a contract. This rehearing order is not the appropriate forum for acting on Columbia/Columbia Gulf's waiver request. Columbia/Columbia Gulf should file a separate waiver request setting forth the burden imposed by the rule and suggesting means for reducing the compliance burden. VII. Requirement To Maintain Affiliate and Non-Affiliate Discount Information In Order No. 566, the Commission amended ยง250.16 to require pipelines to maintain certain information about both affiliate and non-affiliate discounts. 26 The regulations required pipelines to provide this information to the Commission upon request and also provided that it would be made available through the Commission's discovery procedures. 27 Indicated Companies contend that the information also should be made available to the public upon request. The Commission denies the request for rehearing. 26 This information includes the name of the shipper being provided the discount, the affiliate relationship between the pipeline and the shipper, the affiliate's role in the transportation transaction (i.e., shipper, marketer, supplier, seller), the duration of the discount, the maximum rate or fee, the rate or fee actually charged during the billing period, and the quantity of gas scheduled at the discounted rate during the billing period for each delivery point. 27 18 CFR Part 385, Subpart D. Prior to Order No. 566, the Commission required pipelines to post affiliate discount information on their EBBs and to maintain the same information for non-affiliate transactions. The non-affiliate information was available only to the Commission and to others pursuant to the Commission's discovery provisions. The non-affiliate information was not made generally available to the public because it might be competitively sensitive and non-affiliate information was not needed to detect discrimination in favor of affiliates. 28 28 Order No. 497, FERC Stats. & Regs. [Regulations Preambles 1986&hyph;1990] at 31,148. In Order No. 566, the Commission eliminated the previous requirement, under ยง250.16, to post affiliate discount information because the relevant discount information was posted under Standard H. The Commission concluded that the discount information posted under Standard H is sufficient for non-affiliated shippers to monitor affiliate discounts to determine whether discrimination has occurred and thus found that a duplicative posting requirement under ยง250.16 was not needed. The Commission, however, maintained the requirement that disclosure of the affiliated and non-affiliated data would be limited to the Commission and to parties demonstrating a need for such information in discovery. Indicated Companies has not provided any justification for now requiring general public disclosure of the detailed non-affiliate information. Moreover, Indicated Companies already has access to less detailed information about both affiliate and non-affiliate discounts through the Part 284 requirement that pipelines file discount reports with the Commission showing the name of the shipper receiving a discount, the maximum rate or fee, the rate or fee charged, and any affiliation between the pipeline and the shipper. 29 29 18 CFR 284.7(d)(5)(iv). VIII. Tariff Waivers and Complaints In Order No. 566, the Commission eliminated the requirements that pipelines post tariff waivers and complaints related to affiliate transactions on the pipelines' EBBs. The Commission concluded that if shippers had questions about tariff waivers, they could obtain such information under Standard K, which requires pipelines to maintain and make available for copying a log of tariff waivers. The Commission found that complaints are matters between the complainant and the pipeline and that the complainant, if it is dissatisfied with the pipeline's response, can bring the matter to the Commission's attention either through the Commission's Enforcement Task Force hotline or the Commission's formal complaint procedure.
