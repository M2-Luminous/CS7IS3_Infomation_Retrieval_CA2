The PDDSH struggles for a free and democratic Albania where full freedom of the individual, private property, religion, thinking, expression, and action should be guaranteed in a lawful and democratic state. The Political Position of the PDDSH 1. The PDDSH is a political force on the right wing of the Albanian political spectrum, relying on and defending the rights of all those who are in favor of a firm anticommunist stand. It primarily relies on the broad masses of former political prisoners and detainees, former owners stripped of their property by the communist dictatorship, the broad masses of workers, both employed or economically assisted by the state, honest intellectuals, the youth of Albania, suffering women of Albania, and the Albanian patriotic peasantry. 2. The PDDSH will cooperate with other political right wing forces for the creation of a common anticommunist front. 3. The PDDSH will not accept any agreement with forces of neo- communist and communist convictions and stands. 4. The PDDSH will turn down any political agreement with extremist forces that aspire to resort to violence. 5. The PDDSH will work to attract the rank and file PD [Democratic Party] members who nurture right-wing democratic aspirations. The PDDSH will not enter into any relationship with the present PD leadership, because it thinks that they hold neocommunist views and positions. 6. The PDDSH will carry out its political activities in a democratic way, rigorously respecting the constitutional order and laws of the state. 7. The PDDSH is a party of clear nationalist stance. It will strive to protect Albania's freedom, independence, and national interests. The PDDSH is for an ethnic Albania, created through the free expression of our people's will in the motherland and the will of our brothers living in their own territories in Montenegro, Sandjak, Kosova, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], as well as the will of the expropriated Cams, who were expelled from their legitimate lands in Greece. Working for the realization of these aspirations, the PDDSH declares itself against any violent changes of the existing state borders of Albania with its neighboring countries. 8. The PDDSH will resolutely fight for the thorough eradication of communism and neocommunism in Albania. In this respect, it will also work for: - the creation of a state commission which should investigate and bring to account the former ruling communists who have perpetrated political genocide against the people or have their hands stained with the blood of innocent people. - the weeding out of former communists from responsible positions and decisionmaking bodies of the state administration. - the investigation of business activities of unscrupulous speculators who have illicitly become rich and against whom measures should be taken, including expropriation in accordance with the law. 9. The PDDSH is for guaranteeing the rights of national minorities living in Albania, strictly honoring relevant international agreements. 10. The PDDSH will work for the state to protect the legitimate rights of our fellow countrymen who are permanently or temporarily living in other countries. The PDDSH will strive to mobilize our compatriots, however they live, in our country's political, cultural, and economic life. The PDDSH's Economic Program 1. The PDDSH is for a market economy, but economic reform in Albania should take into consideration our country's specific political, social, and economic conditions created following the collapse of the cruel communist dictatorship. The PDDSH is against the "shock therapy" and in favor of a gradual reform resulting in less drastic consequences during the transition period. 2. The PDDSH will work to reduce the unemployment level by taking the following main measures: a. Putting under operation state-owned profitable enterprises mainly in food, textiles, mining industry, and in agriculture, etc. b. Investing in projects that create more new jobs in infrastructure, forestry, tourism, and so forth. c. Encouraging private business of productive character, which involves more manpower. d. Rapid privatization at all levels of state-owned enterprises. 3. The PDDSH will strive to narrow at fast speed the existing differences between the real pay and price level, in the following aspects: a. Control, through a discouraging fiscal system, over the uncontrollable price hikes. b. Gradual increase of salaries, pensions, and assistance allowances. c. Tax exemption of pensioners, unemployed people receiving economic assistance, invalids, and children, and ticket price reduction for them in state-owned transport, cultural and sports activities, public services, electrical energy, dental services, school texts, and so on. 4. The PDDSH will work to draft a state financial budget on a more studied basis, bearing in mind the following: -- More rational rapports between investment and assistance, giving priority to the former so as to enable work and production to start again from scratch. -- Drastic cuts in unproductive costs, particularly in state administration, army, and so on. 5. The PDDSH will struggle in a lawful way to abrogate immediately the Law No. 7,689 of 15 April 1993 "On the Restitution and Compensation of Buildings and Lands," and No. 7501 of 10 July 1993 "On the Agricultural Land." It will strive for new laws to be passed that should thoroughly honor the legitimate rights of former owners in towns and countryside to total and unconditional restitution of their property, arbitrarily grabbed by the communist state and not given back even by the present laws in force. The PDDSH will strive that the new laws on property contain the following legal obligations to the owners: a. Immediate and unconditional restitution of the existing buildings. b. Immediate restitution of free land grounds, or those on which economic or cultural facilities and villa type dwellings have been built. c. Compensation in value, in other land grounds or in buildings (according to the former owner's right to choose) for all the land grounds occupied by multistory dwellings (apartment flats). d. Compensation in value, or in other land grounds, for occupied land grounds on which social facilities have been built, like hospitals, schools, kindergartens and nurseries, roads, parks, stadiums, and sport fields. e. Full restitution of agricultural lands, olive trees, grazing lands and forests to poor, middle or rich former owners living in towns or in the countryside. f. In areas where the state possesses large areas of land, the former landowners can be compensated, if they so wish, in plots of land from the state-owned land. g. Peasants, who according to "the Land Law" have received plots of land, remain as tenants of this land now belonging to its former owner. The owner cannot send the tenant away from this land earlier than a period of five years. After this period, new contractual agreements can be concluded between the owner of the land and the tenant. In this case, the tenants who have rented the land do not pay any more taxes to the state. 6. The PDDSH will fight for the abrogation of the existing laws on privatization, because they sanction the privileges of red businessmen and violate the rights of former owners, political detainees, and the working people. The PDDSH will strive for a minute revision of privatization, according to the following criteria: a. Small and medium-size enterprises should be privatized by selling them on credit to former owners of objects, land grounds, former political detainees, and people working in them. The credit will be paid back within a delayed period of five to 10 years, without any bank interest rate. b. Large enterprises will be converted into shareholder enterprises in which 51 percent of the shares will initially remain state-owned property and 49 percent will be given free of charge to the workers of the respective enterprises. c. With the abrogation of the government decision which has divided land to the working people for use, the agricultural enterprises will be revived and converted into shareholder enterprises, where shares will be divided according to the "b" clause of this article. d. In agricultural enterprises set up on land that was formerly private property, the land, together with the economic projects built on it, will be given back to the former owner of the land, who is obliged to offer employment to not less than one farmer per family, for a period of two to three years. These types of enterprises can also be turned into private shareholder enterprises by agreement with the owner or owners who are carrying out their economic activities in the territory of former state enterprises. 7. The PDDSH is for the restitution to the former owners of riches expropriated or confiscated without compensation by the communist state, such as toppled buildings, livestock, monetary values, and so on. This will be gradually realised within a period of several years. 8. The state should compensate the political prisoners and detainees of the communist regime according to their relevant status in the following main directions: a. Compensation in cash for the period of their sentence term in jails or concentration camps. b. Free of charge privatization of state-houses they are living in. c. Providing homeless people with free housing by the state. d. Credits without bank interest rate, enabling them to start up business, and priority to the privatization of economic enterprises. Priority to employment. e. Awarding study scholarships at home and abroad. 9. The PDDSH will encourage foreign investment in Albania. The PDDSH is of the opinion that the restitution of property to its former owners will attract foreign investors. The PDDSH is for offering stimulus to investment by large and serious foreign companies and creating procedural facilities for the conclusion of relevant contracts. A state administrative body will be set up for this purpose. It will deal with all the necessary practices that are currently dispersed among many government bodies, causing undue delays and concern to the foreign investors, and leaving room for corruption. The PDDSH is of the opinion that in certain important sectors of our economy like agriculture, tourism, mining, and forestry, a policy of concessions must be pursued as a most profitable policy in our conditions, which would further encourage foreign and serious investors. Priority in these concessions will be given to agreements between governments. 10. The PDDSH will work to attract most favorable credits to our country. Work will be done for more acceptable rapports between investment funds and those for technical assistance. 11. The PDDSH will see that the credits received by the Albanian banks really serve to encourage productive activities. In this respect, the following basic criteria will be pursued: -- To lower bank interest rates to medium international levels. -- To create favorable conditions (longer terms with lower interest rate) for productive activities which create new jobs in agriculture, construction, public services, etc. 12. The PDDSH will strive, through a favoring fiscal policy and state investments, to support and encourage the activities of those enterprises that produce domestic goods, especially in food, tobacco, the textile industry, etc. 13. The PDDSH is for the immediate creation of a stock exchange market. It is of the opinion that the setting up of private shareholder companies will mark a consolidating step for the market economy in Albania. The PDDSH's Agrarian Policy The PDDSH considers agriculture as one of the main branches of our economy, which plays and will still play in the future a primary role in our country's economic development. In this respect, the PDDSH will work to create conditions for Albanian agriculture and the Albanian countryside to embark really and as soon as possible upon a modern and intensive level of development, capable of successfully competing in the international market. To achieve this goal, the PDDSH will work in the following directions: 1. The production structures of the private agricultural economies should be defined by their owners themselves, according to the requirements of the market. The prospective development of agriculture will be guided by the state along a policy of subsidies. Given its suitable climatic and soil conditions, Albanian agriculture will be oriented toward the cultivation of tobacco, vineyards, cultivation of vegetables, strawberries and flowers in greenhouses, and toward animal husbandry. 2. Given the difficulties in creating a modern and competitive agricultural technology due to the large fragmentation of the land, the PDDSH will work (by providing credits, subsidies, and a favorable fiscal system) for the creation of farmers' units and private shareholder enterprises in the production sphere, agricultural machinery, transport, collecting and trading the products, and in the bank system, etc. 3. The PDDSH will work to encourage and stimulate the setting up of private farms by specialists in agriculture, the state renting them land from its own land (10-12 hectares) and offering them assistance with credits at low interest rates, exempting them from rent tax, and reducing their income tax for the first two or three years, etc. 4. The state, through a license system, will encourage the creation of private rural centers for selling seeds, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers. These centers will be required to be run by agronomists of high education. 5. The PDDSH will insist that a network of centers of technical assistance and control over agriculture be organized on a village- commune basis so as to ensure effective assistance and control over the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, according to technical discipline, strictly respecting the legislation in force. 6. The PDDSH is for offering support to joint ventures with foreign investment, by respecting parity in invested capitals and clearly defining the mutual obligations and profits in advance. The state will also assist in creating enterprises with foreign investors, renting to them land from the state-owned land, and allowing private owners, too, to rent their land. 7. While being for passing a law that will allow selling and buying land, the PDDSH is against selling agricultural land to foreigners for a period of not less than 10 years, and it is against selling agricultural land to citizens of neighboring countries who live near the frontiers with our country. The PDDSH will pursue a social policy promoting the interests of the most deprived and unprotected segments of our country's population. It will strive to protect the interests of these segments, making the state take the necessary measures in their favor. The PDDSH will struggle also for improvements in the social policy pursued by the state in all fields of its activities. In this respect, the PDDSH's attention will focus on taking the following measures: 1. Free ambulatory and hospital health services in the state-owned health institutions. Free service in the state-owned dental clinics (except for full or partial prostheses, for which pensioners, invalids, and people economically assisted by the state will pay up to a 50-percent reduced price. 2. State-owned education system. Obligatory eight-year education. Reduced prices of school books. 3. The state will support scientific research work in all fields. The scientific research institutions will be entirely financed by the state. 4. The state will fully or partially finance the activities of cultural and sports institutions, as well as educational entertainment and leisure activities for youth and children. The state will also assist and encourage private undertakings in setting up and operating sports associations, establishments for the education and entertainment of children (discos, cinemas and clubs, game centers, swimming pools, etc.) The state will assist with financial contribution in setting up clubs and other establishments for aged people and pensioners. 5. The PDDSH will strive to extend the period of leave days per year, birth leave days for pregnant women, and prohibit night shift work or other particularly difficult jobs for women. 7. The PDDSH will strive for the improvement of infrastructure by investing in repairing existing roads and building up a new modern road, railroad, and internal air transport network. 8. The PDDSH will persevere with investments in restructuring the electrical network of the cities and their potable water supply system. 9. The PDDSH attaches extremely great importance to a concrete estimation of Albania's intellectual potential. The PDDSH will struggle so that the state pursues a favorable policy toward an active participation of Albanian intellectuals and specialists in drafting projects, steering and putting them into practice, and in other technical and scientific undertakings, keeping under control the number of foreign specialists involved in these projects. The PDDSH severely condemns as antinational and antieconomic every attitude of underestimating our specialists. 10. The PDDSH is of the opinion that the state should coordinate private business through legal means, ensuring fair rapports between the sphere of commerce and that of public service so as normally to meet the population's needs in this sector. 11. The state will wield its strict control over hygiene and sanitary conditions in the commercial sector and services. It will gradually restrict street vendor trade, especially in food products, and discipline the trade of vegetables and fruits in centers controlled by hygiene and sanitary bodies. 12. The PDDSH is for a fair solution and prevention of social conflicts stemming from demographic movements of the population from mountainous areas, especially from the northeastern parts of our country. The PDDSH will not encourage parallel movements from one village to another, but it is for a free movement of people from villages to the towns. In the actual period of trnasition, the PDDSH is of the opinion that the state, through investments in forests and mines, should assist the peasants living in these areas with long-term, interest-free credits, so as to create living conditions in their areas until jobs for them are created in the towns. The PDDSH views the movement of part of the population into the towns as an indispensable element of the long-term state program. In this respect, the state will give priority to villagers having little land, and families living in agricultural state-owned enterprises to move gradually to the towns as new jobs are created there. 13. In all its political activity, especially dealing with economic and social problems, the PDDSH will seek the opinion of and closely cooperate with the BSPSH [Union of Independent Trade Unions of Albania], the Association of Former Political Prisoners and Detainees, the Association of the Kulaks, patriotic societies like "Kosova," "Cameria," "Tirana," and other societies of anticommunist program and orientation.
