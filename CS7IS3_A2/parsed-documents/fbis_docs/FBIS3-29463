At the meeting, the Czech delegation pointed to the stabilising role Thailand plays in South East Asia and praised the country's economic results. The Thai and Czech representatives agreed that the Czech Republic can be an entrance gate to Europe for Thailand, while Thailand serves as an entrance gate to Indochina for the Czech Republic. That is why nothing bars mutual relations from developing, the politicians said. Likphai stressed that Thailand was willing to deepen its cooperation with the Czech Republic, adding that his country of almost 60 million inhabitants presented a big market where it was possible to push oneself through. Trilateral cooperation, including that between the Czech Republic, Thailand and Vietnam was also discussed. Abolition of the U.S. embargo on the trade with Vietnam led to opening of the Vietnamese market, Thai representatives said. The meeting also focused on the Central European Free Trade Zone (CEFTA) and a similar South East Zone (AFTA). Thai politicians see this process as a long-term one and expect it to take some 15 years. The Czech delegation drew attention to the considerable possibilities of investing in the Czech Republic within the privatisation process. They also showed their interest in Thai financial participation in the Czech banking sector. Czech Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, one of the Czech delegation's members, invited Likphai to Prague on behalf of Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. Havel also met with chairman of the Thai parliament, Marut Bunnak. They agreed on a visit of Czech parliamentarians to Thailand in late March. Today Havel is to tour some of Bangkok's monuments. Four inter-state agreements are also to be signed. Havel today received an honorary degree from Chulalongkorn University and gave a speech of thanks. On leaving the university, which is named after a turn-of-the-century king who abolished slavery, Havel said with a smile he saw an "enormous gulf" between the quantity of doctorates he received and the quantity of knowledge he had. The way of coexistence of various cultures and powers which would not threaten the fate of the globe, is a big task for the present world, Havel said in a speech given at the occasion of being awarded the title. It is necessary in the present era that a multicultural world and a multipolar atmosphere in conditions of a single global civilisation are created, Havel said. A generally acceptable minimum must be sought within the variety of national features, historical and cultural traditions and different ways of thinking. This minimum must be cultivated with full respect for all differences and equality of their bearers. Simply, the era of new global universalism has come, Havel said. The several principles included in the mentioned minimum are those of respect for the basic human rights -- those to freedom and dignity, democracy, a respect for property, including private property, care for material development of human communities and generally acceptable social rights. Without this minimum being sensibly and steadily cultivated, developed and deepened, and without the world's identifying itself with it, he could hardly imagine that the present civilisation does not result in big catastrophes, Havel stressed. A new political metaculture could gradually arise from the new spirit of world cooperation. It would be the culture of political existence on principles of equality and cooperation of various cultures of the present multicultural civilisation, he said. Havel said that several basic tools, whose development, strengthening and transformation in line with the emerging political metaculture should be carried out in the decades to come, already exist. These are universal systems, such as the UN and other global institutions, including economic ones. These institutions' importance will rise with the increase in the new spirit of the multicultural world, Havel stated. Besides these institutions, integration groupings are important as well, Havel said. As an example of such groupings he gave the European Union, Association of the South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and NATO. He said he viewed these institutions as significant elements in the newly emerging system of world cooperation, the sense of which surpasses the pragmatic framework of the advantages of regional cooperation and defence. They are co-creators of the world's political metaculture at the same time, as they adhere to many principles included in the minimum mentioned above. They cultivate and push them through within their reach, and thus make mutual political communication within the international community easier, Havel emphasised.
