What you said conveyed the feeling that you alone were patriotic while all others were the scourge of the nation. Or was it not so? Each statement you made concerned the fault of the former government, of former state officials. To hear you speak, everybody else was always wrong; no one was right. I would like to tell you that without the former government, "which you said to be faulty," maybe you would not at all be able to show your face in Cambodia and step on Cambodian soil as you are now. You are a politician. You should know how to "think ahead and in reverse" and to speak with realism. You should not babble like a half-wit. If you find that a person is in the wrong, you have the right to remove, reprove, fine, or sue him; but you have no right to revile anybody at all. However, you are not afraid even to malign the former government with which you are currently in cooperation. By the way, what proof do you have to gamely accuse over the public address system that the previous government had driven vendors out of the Olympic market at gunpoint? Does it really happen that way? Or is it merely an attempt to cause division in the Royal Government? I am glad to hear your remarks, which gave credits to our company, but you should first closely examine them. My company is always prepared to let you personally inspect its books, because if you send somebody else to do it, that "somebody" may not correctly inspect them as you wish, may not be as patriotic as you are. Regarding to remarks that "the Thai Boon Rong Company has made a $30-million profit," I invite you to come in person to ticket me for a fine or to levy taxes on my company. If you appoint somebody else in your place, he may cause the nation to incur some losses. Do you want to solve problems, or do you want to create them in the Kingdom of Cambodia and in the Royal Government? If you want to solve problems, you are asked to be less liberal with your utterances. Before opening your mouth, you should wag your tongue a million times. After you have read this clarification, you should keep forever in mind that my company is run by humans who also know what is right and what is wrong, just like yourself. You are not the only one who knows and certainly not the only one who can solve all these problems. Please hurry up; do not any waste time. My company's door is always open for you to come in to inspect it and levy taxes. You likened investors to leeches sucking the blood and sweat of the people. This kind of talk is inflamatory and divisive. They are not words of the new year, the year of national reconstruction and national reconciliation. Such an attitude and such remarks certainly threaten investors and frighten them in their businesses that would contribute to the rehabilitation of the national economy. Therefore, it is more appropriate for you to be given the title of "Minister of Economic and Financial Destruction." So, Mr. Sam Rangsi, please come and inspect my company. If after you have inspected it and nothing is found to be as in your allegations, will you be game enough to play out your "patriotic" role? As far as my company is concerned, it is waiting for you to come and inspect it. If you find that my company has evaded taxes or has imported materials for the construction of that market more than necessary, I and my company will pay all the taxes and accept all kinds of fines. If you fail to find fault with my company, what will you do? You are asked to clarify this issue and to make a firm commitment. Mr. Sam Rangsi, please accept our clarification as appropriate. Phnom Penh, 14 January 1994 Thank you, Theng Bun Ma
