It is true that this act took place with the authorization of the United Nations. Even if the equipment, though we do not know what it contained, had this statute, the event acquires an extraordinary importance through its political and strategic significance. Nevertheless, there has been complete silence over this event. Apart from the thieves who discovered and robbed it, and the heads of the leadership, nobody knew about this train, although this issue is of utmost concern to the public. Why this fact was concealed, but mainly who authorized the crossing of the respective train, is not known. Article 117(5) of Romania's Constitution stipulates that "foreign troops cannot enter Romania or cross its territory except under conditions stipulated by the law." What law establishes the entry or crossing of foreign troops we could not discover. Neither could we discover to whom the law grants this responsibility. No matter who it is and who has such an authority, we believe that this event is too important to be kept concealed from the public. We do not say that we have anything against the authorization for the transit of troops or UN military transports, however, the fact itself is disquieting. The same bodies that today had the right to decide in secret about UN troops crossing Romania's territory certainly tomorrow will have the right to approve with the same secrecy, far from the eyes of the public, the "entry" or the crossing of other "equipment" or troops, or even their stay in Romania. No matter to whom the law gives this right, we believe that Romania's Parliament should have a certain responsibility or connection with such important actions. We believe this because, if the Parliament discusses and decides on such an issue, normally the public is also informed of it.
