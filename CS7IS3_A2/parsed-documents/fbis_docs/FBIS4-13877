Islamist Notes Jews' Policy, Claims WRITER ASSAILS EMERGENCY LAW, CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISLAMISTS AL-SHA'B carries on pages one and three of its 19 April issue a 2,800-word article by its chief editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn strongly attacking the government's extension of the Emergency Law and the long-running campaign of arrests and torture, especially against Islamists and Labor Party members. He says that, while the government claims no one has been affected by the emergency law, Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Sharif is behind bars with no charges made or reason given except that he contradicted the prime minister. In addition, "our colleague" 'Abd-al-Sattar is in the military prison, Husayn writes. He adds that everyone knows that arrest warrants containing no charges have been issued against journalists in past years, including against 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im, who was subjected to severe torture. Husayn notes that President Mubarak has not tried for even one day to rule without the Emergency Law, although it would have been in his and the country's interest to try to rule for at least one year without the Emergency Law. Pointing out that over the past years the government has turned toward the use of force instead of persuasion, he says incidents of political violence were rare before the 1952 revolution, but nowadays terrorist attacks are almost daily events. Reviewing the government's policy of "physical liquidation" and the campaign against the Islamic Alliance which represents "the forces of moderation in the Islamic arena," Husayn says that 180 mosques were stormed by police in 1988 and that in al-Minya, one mosque was stormed 166 times. He says: "While questioning the prime minister and the interior minister at the People's Assembly, I emphasized that the use of the iron-fist policy against the Islamic resurgence will only aggravate the situation; and regrettably this is what has actually happened." He notes that the government's policy of force and arrests led to the emergence of the Islamic movement al-Shawqiyun and prompted al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah's shift toward armed struggle. DETAINEES ALLEGEDLY BELONGING TO MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD RELEASED An 80-word front-page report in AL-SHA'B says the Higher State Security Prosecution has decided to release local council members in Dumyat belonging to the Labor Party after a two-month detention. The paper adds that the authorities fabricated charges against them of belonging to an illegal organization, meaning the Muslim Brotherhood. BRITISH NEWSPAPER'S INTERVIEW WITH SHAYKH AL-GHAZALI CITED In an approximately 800-word report on page 3, AL-SHA'B cites an article published by the British newspaper THE GUARDIAN on the situation in Egypt, decline in tourism, and Egypt' fear of Islamic resurgence. The newspaper's writer notes that terrorists are not the greatest threat to Mubarak, because the policy of shoot to kill and mass arrests have shaken them. But, the writer adds, moderate Islamists are the ones who are apparently pushing Egypt toward an Islamic state. The article also includes an interview with Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali. Asked by THE GUARDIAN about his stand on any Egyptian Government that fails to fulfill its duty toward Islam, al-Ghazali says: "If any government fails to do this, then I have the right to call on the people to change that government; and this can be done through the ballot boxes." When asked if there are free elections in Egypt, he replies: "You should ask those who go the polls." Replying to another question, al-Ghazali says: "If you Europeans have forsaken your spiritual leadership, am I supposed to do the same? My answer is no." He adds: "I want my religion to be strong because I want my nation to be strong and able to defend itself. We have been defeated militarily. We are a defeated nation and the only way for us to restore our strength and self-respect is through religion." MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL NOTES 'PLOTS' AGAINST ISLAM AL-SHA'B carries on page 5 an approximately 1500-word article by Deputy Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood Mustafa Mashhur noting "foreign plots" against Islam. He says that the conspiracy of the "crusader and Zionist alliance against Islam has never been stronger than it is today" and that the Islamic world has never been weaker than it is today. He adds: "This diabolical scheme--coordinated by the Zionists, crusaders, communists, Hindus, and other enemies of Islam--might make the world seem black in the eyes of Muslims and make them wonder if Islam has any future on earth." Mashhur says that some people demand a speedy solution because the enemies will not wait but continue their attacks every day. They say if we do not find a solution, the enemies will destroy the Muslims before they can react. But we say that afflictions are grace in the form of calamity, because the early Muslims triumphed over their enemies even though they were a minority and were surrounded by Jews, Persians, and Romans in Mecca and Medina. For example, he says, the Bosnian people were completely lost under communism and most of them forgot Islam but after the tragedy they reverted to Islam, began to fight under the banner of Islam, formed a combatant army, and became more aware of Islam and clung to it so that now their plight has aroused the feelings of millions of Muslims. He points out: "The enemies' dream of the possibility of destroying Islam and the Islamic awakening will not come true, God willing. Their very tactics of war consolidate, expand, and strengthen the Islamic resurgence." He says that the West has shifted from a religion that opposed knowledge to a knowledge that fights religion, from a religion without culture to a culture without religion, from a religion that exalts the world hereafter to a religion inclined toward materialism, and from a religion that revered God and disparaged man to one that glorifies man and disregards God. Mashhur then argues that Islam alone is what rectifies this disorder because it is a religion that does not fight knowledge and culture, but has produced the enormous scientific progress from which Europe learned in its renaissance. Islam is the religion that founded the most perfect civilization in history. Under the subhead "The Jews Are Behind Every Corruption and Enmity," Mashhur then writes that the Jews are the killers of prophets who have been behind "every weird, deviant principle." He says they have been behind communism that persecuted and killed millions of Muslims in Russia and behind the downfall of the Ottoman caliphate and the transformation of Turkey into a secular state. Then he notes: "But we see this Islamic renaissance and Islamic voice rising again in the skies of Turkey." Continuing his criticism of the Jews, Mashhur says the al- Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has revealed the Jews' intentions toward the Muslims but that the "free and proud Palestinian people will not surrender to them." He adds that the Muslims will not leave the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem captive to the Jews no matter how much material force they possess or how much help they gain from hostile powers. "It is the duty of all Muslims to liberate the whole of Palestine. A state that has been established on oppression cannot be stable or survive", he remarks. Mashhur goes on: "When Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] carried out reprisals for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, we saw Rabin strongly criticizing the king of Jordan for allowing Hamas to operate from Jordan, and we regret Jordan's compliance with his request. It is strange that we should hear that a Zionist delegation participated in a conference in Oman to discuss water issues and in another conference in Qatar on banning nuclear weapons." He adds that the Jews foment sedition and disturbances in Islamic countries and that the Jewish lobby influences the U.S. Congress and President because of their role in his election. He goes on to say: "So the President began to act according to their guidance, speak on their behalf, proclaim Jerusalem the capital of the Zionist entity, provide them with all types of weapons, and allow them to possess nuclear arms which he denies to other countries. But the day will come when the American people realize the danger and damage they incur from supporting this Zionist enemy, which is concerned only in its own interest." Concluding his article, Mashhur urges all Muslims to be wary and learn from these "predicaments" to distinguish between honest people and liars and to follow in the steps of the Prophet and his companions by having faith, unity, and cohesion. He says they must have faith that "Islam is coming, God willing." ISLAMIC CONFERENCE WARNS OF PROSELYTIZATION DANGER In an approximately 250-word report on page 7, AL-SHA'B says the international Islamic conference, held at al-Azhar University under the sponsorship of al-Azhar's shaykh, has warned of the danger of proselytization movements, especially the American ones, in Egypt and other Arab countries. He considers such movements to be one of the foreign impediments to Islamic action. The report adds that the conference emphasized that the "resurgence of Islamic and Arab countries from their backwardness is contingent on the application of the Islamic shari'ah, which is the basis of their progress and strength." ISLAMIST NOTES JEWS' POLICY, CLAIMS In an approximately 350-word article on page 12, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali writes that the Israelis aim to expand "whenever they see the Arabs disregard Islam." He says that the Jews claim Egypt as their land and say that the land on which their ancestors lived must be returned. He then adds: I have the right to ask where are the peace plans the Jews offer to the Arabs?"
