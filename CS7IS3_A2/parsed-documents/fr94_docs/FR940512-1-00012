FR940512-1-00012 FR940512-1-00001 §185.131 Sanctions. (a) The ALJ may sanction a person including any party or representative for the following reasons: (1) Failure to comply with an order, rule, or procedure governing the proceeding; (2) Failure to prosecute or defend an action; or (3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, orderly, or fair conduct of the proceeding. (b) Any such sanction, including but not limited to those listed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct. (c) When a party fails to comply with an order, including an order for taking a deposition, the production of evidence within the party's control, or a request for admission, the ALJ may: (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard to the information sought; (2) In the case of requests for admission, deem each matter of which an admission is requested to be admitted; (3) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying upon, testimony relating to the information sought; and (4) Strike any part of the pleadings or other submissions of the party failing to comply with such request. (d) If a party fails to prosecute or defend an action under this part commenced by service of a notice of hearing, the ALJ may dismiss the action or may issue an initial decision imposing penalties and assessments. (e) The ALJ may refuse to consider any motion, request, response, brief or other document which is not filed in a timely fashion. §185.132 The hearing and burden of proof. (a) Where requested in accordance with §185.109 the ALJ shall conduct a hearing on the record in order to determine whether the defendant is liable for a civil penalty or assessment under §185.103 and, if so, the appropriate amount of any such civil penalty or assessment considering any aggravating or mitigating factors. (b) The authority shall prove defendant's liability and any aggravating factors by a preponderance of the evidence. (c) The defendant shall prove any affirmative defenses and any mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence. (d) The hearing shall be open to the public unless otherwise closed by the ALJ for good cause shown. §185.133 Determining the amount of penalties and assessments. (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages and a significant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed. (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint: (1) The number of false, fictitious or fraudulent claims or statements; (2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made; (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct; (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed; (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation; (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss; (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations; (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;
