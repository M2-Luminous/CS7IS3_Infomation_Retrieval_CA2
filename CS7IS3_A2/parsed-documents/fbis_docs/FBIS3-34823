The bomb, which went off outside a shop and wounded passers by in the town of Tanta, was similar to those seized during a police raid here two weeks ago in which seven members of the outlawed Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] were killed. Two of the group's gunmen also fired on a bus carrying Romanian and Egyptian engineers in the southern city of Asyut on Monday, shattering windows but caused no injuries. The Jama'ah said it carried out the shooting attack as part of its "campaign against foreign investors and tourists" and to avenge seven members killed in a February 1 police raid in Cairo, the group said in a statement to AFP. The gunmen opened fire as the bus drove through Asyut, 380 kilometers (230 miles) south of Cairo, on its way to a cement factory, police said. The engineers hit the floor when the shooting started and escaped injury. The Jama'ah has warned foreigners to leave Egypt as part of a violent campaign against President Husni Mubarak's government which has killed almost 300 people. The group said the shooting was the fifth attack it has carried out to "avenge the seven martyrs of al-Zawiyah al-Hamra'," a poor Cairo neighborhood. Jama'ah has accused the police of gunning down the seven militants in cold blood.
