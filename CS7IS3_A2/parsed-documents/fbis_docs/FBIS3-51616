A PRENSA LATINA dispatch explains that in a climate of friendship, the two leaders came out in favor of strengthening the movement of nonaligned countries and increasing South-South cooperation. Nujoma termed the U.S. blockade against Cuba unfair behavior that lacks justification since the end of the Cold War. He stressed that the peoples of Namibia and Cuba have much in common. Windhoek and Havana signed an important trade agreement Friday. After having met with Roberto Robaina, whose African tour also included Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, 15 Namibian businessmen will be traveling to Havana soon to explore investment possibilities.
