What can you say in this regard to dispel these fears? [Samahah] Nothing in the decision made necessitates fear for the media and freedom of expression in Lebanon. Lebanon has its own traditions as embodied in its people, heritage, and system. Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy. The measure taken is temporary and extraordinary. It is dictated by the current extraordinary circumstances of our country. This is evident in the plotting against the unity of Lebanese territory, the unity of the Lebanese people, and the unity of Lebanese institutions. Within the framework of the measures taken by the Council of Ministers, a media measure was taken regarding only the illegal and unlicensed audio and visual sector, pending the issuance of the audio and visual media law. The written means of expression, i.e., the Lebanese press -- dailies, weeklies, monthlies, and periodicals -- continue to exist. They are safeguarded by the Lebanese press law. The newspapers are issued daily, as normal. All opinions expressing the political and trade unionist reality of Lebanese society are being published. As for the audio and visual media, the Council of Ministers will study and endorse the draft law in its extraordinary session on Tuesday [29 March] and then refer it to the Chamber of Deputies. I would like to stress here that when the Chamber of Deputies receives the government opinion as expressed in its draft law, it will make the decision. It will be free to study this law, ratify it as it is, or amend it in a manner that expresses the opinion of the Lebanese. The people's opinion is expressed through the Chamber of Deputies within the framework of the democratic parliamentary system. [Reporter] May I say that the al-Hariri government decision was not taken to gag mouths or silence every opposition voice, and consequently leave the media arena only for the official voice? [Samahah] Absolutely, absolutely. Opposition voices do exist. They have the opportunity to express themselves on Lebanese television, on official Lebanese radio, and in the national news agency, starting last night, after the closure of all -- sorry, not closure, but suspension of -- the transmission of news over radios sand televisions. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, have private audio and visual media abided by the ban, especially the dissolved Lebanese Forces [LF] news media? [Samahah] All Lebanese audio and visual news media operating on Lebanese territory have fully abided by the government decision since midnight on 23 March 1994. I had a series of meetings with officials in charge of these outlets, the latest of which ended two hours ago. We are working together in full harmony in order to implement this temporary arrangement, pending the ratification of the law regulating audio and visual media. [Reporter] Can you say when the new law regulating private media will be issued? [Samahah] I cannot anticipate the time the Chamber of Deputies will take to study and ratify the law. However, I will work from my position so the period will be the shortest possible. [Reporter] I would like to refer to the government decision to dissolve the LF. Some say it was an attempt by the government to liquidate this party. LF Commander Samir Ja'ja' said yesterday that three of the suspects accused of the church explosion, who belong to the party, have been residing abroad for a long time. How were arrest warrants issued against them? Can you explain this point? [Samahah] I would like to clarify two points. There is no retaliation between the government and the LF. The security and political facts gathered on the general situation and the LF activities dictated that the Lebanese Government make a decision, upon the recommendation of the interior minister. As for the judicial aspect, arrest warrants were issued by the examining magistrate in this regard. No one can wade into the details of this subject before the end of the investigation. We should all respect the disengagement of powers between the executive and judicial estates. According to Lebanese laws and all international investigation laws, it is the examining magistrate who, based on available facts and figures, forms a judicial conviction, issues arrest warrants, and interrogates suspects upon their apprehension, in a legal manner and in the presence of a defense lawyer. The examining magistrate will then issue an indictment prior to trial. We expect this indictment to be issued once the investigation is over. The trial will be held publicly in the presence of the defense counsel. [Reporter] Do you think the Government of Lebanon's adoption of these political, security, and media decisions came at the right time, in light of local and regional circumstances? [Samahah] I think it was the right time, otherwise, the Lebanese Government would not have made these decisions at this time. Consequently, I think if we had not taken, or if we had delayed taking, these measures, we would have regretted it and our citizens would have accused us of delinquency. [Reporter] In the government statement two days ago, you explicitly accused Israel of being behind the explosions in Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday spoke about the resumption of negotiations between the Arabs and Israel at the end of next month. Will these accusations have any reflections on the negotiations between Israel and Lebanon? [Samahah] The facts available to the Lebanese Government from the security angle, as well as political information and the proceedings of the negotiations, led us to directly accuse Israel. We are convinced of this accusation, based on the facts available to the Lebanese Government. As for negotiations, since the first day of negotiations in Madrid we have been sitting and talking to an enemy. We did so in solidarity with the Arab brothers. Together, we went to the negotiations, proceeding from the principles of Madrid conference. We all seek a just and comprehensive peace. Consequently, we will not be affected by the ongoing aggression on Lebanon -- land and people -- in the south through occupation, shelling, and the coercion of our people in the occupied Lebanese strip in southern Lebanon and the western al-Biqa'. We will not be affected by Israeli moves inside. This means we will continue our march toward peace, proceeding from the principles I have mentioned, at the negotiating table. Once the judicial investigation is over and real incriminations based on facts are made of Israeli involvement in explosions in Lebanon and [plotting] against the unity of Lebanon, the unity of authority in Lebanon, and the unity of people in Lebanon, the Lebanese Government, as its statement said, will take a position that will demand that the international community and the cosponsors of the conference deter Israel and prevent it from continuing all these aggressions, whether in occupied south Lebanon and the attacks on unoccupied southern Lebanon, or in the explosions and criminal hands that plant bombs in places of worship, as happened in the case of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq [Mikha'il] and the fasting worshipers in it. [Reporter] Your Excellency Lebanese Information Minister Michel Samahah, thank you for this direct telephone interview from Beirut. Is there anything else you would like to add at the end of this interview? [Samahah] I would like to thank Radio Monte Carlo and appeal to all friends of Lebanon and all those who care for Lebanon's unity, its independence, sovereignty, and independent decision to help Lebanon eliminate the Israeli occupation and its repercussions for Lebanon's unity and the unity of the government in Lebanon. Thank you. [Reporter] Thank you.
