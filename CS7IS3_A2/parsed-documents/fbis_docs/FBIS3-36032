If the Moldovan leadership sends mobile polling stations and foreign observers to the Dniester region, they will be barred by armed patrols which are stationed on bridges across the Dniester in compliance with the state of emergency proclaimed in the Dniester region. Incidentally, the Dniester parliament adopted a decision on Tuesday to hold elections to local bodies of self-rule next April. Within the next two months, a special commission is to submit a new concept of local self-rule to the Dniester parliament in connection with the new political and economic situation in the region. Several local lawmakers suggested that a referendum on the Dniester republic's future should be held along with the elections. Moldovan Deputy Parliament Speaker Viktor Pushkash described these actions of Tiraspol authorities as "anticonstitutional and contravening international laws". According to the deputy speaker, many voters on the Dniester west bank wish to participate in the elections, which is corroborated by letters coming to Chisinau and telephone calls. "However, armed patrols stationed by the Tiraspol leaders on all roads turned the territory into a reservation of a kind," Pushkash stressed. "I'm sure," he continued, "that the Dniester leaders will raise difficulties for those who will want to vote and try to prevent people from going to the right bank. "Despite an opposition from the Tiraspol leaders, we meet and will meet our voters in left-bank districts and will try to provide them will a chance to vote on the election day."
