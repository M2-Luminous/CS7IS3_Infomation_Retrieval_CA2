Song Jian, State Councillor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, made the request yesterday in Beijing at the closing session of the inaugural meeting of the newly-established Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) and the seventh academician conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He asked the scholars of the two organizations to give more suggestions and advice for the drafting of the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the 15-year plan that sets goals to 2010. The plans are expected to be finished by the end of next year and be submitted for approval at the March session of the National People's Congress in 1996. China's population will continuously expand during the next 40 years to reach 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion, Song said. Therefore, by the 2030's or 2040's, China's grain output needs to increase by 50 per cent just to ensure that the current modest supply remains level; electric energy production should expand 14-fold to reach the current per capita standard of moderately-developed countries; and all agricultural and industrial sectors and infrastructural facilities should be greatly expanded, he added. China's modernization requires the constant efforts of all social sectors, especially science, for at least the next half century, he said. Song stressed the importance of developing pollution-free production, reducing waste discharges, protecting the ecological balance, and establishing an environmental protection industry. He also promised that the government will try its best to increase its investment in science and technology. The total input from all social sectors in research and development should account for more than 1.5 per cent of the gross national product by the end of the century, instead of the current 0.7 per cent, he said. At yesterday's session, the CAS also announced the appointment of its first group of foreign academicians. The 14 foreign scientists include Derek Barton and Joseph Needham of Britain, and Peter Raven and Herbert Simon of the United States. The others are all Chinese-American scientists, including the Nobel Prize winners Samuel Chao Chung Ting, Chen Ning Yang, and Tsungdao Lee.
