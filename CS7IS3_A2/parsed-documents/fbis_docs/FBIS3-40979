Hassan Wirayuda, director for international organizations in the Department of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Jakarta yesterday that the plan will be brought before the House of Representatives. This is because deliberations on the matter -- which are very delicate and will have a far-reaching impact -- will take a long time. Meanwhile, Ian Kenyon, executive director of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, welcomed the Indonesian plan. Only four of the 154 countries that signed the convention have ratified it. He expressed his hope that more countries will ratify the convention. The four countries are Sweden, Fiji, Mauritius, and Seychelles.
