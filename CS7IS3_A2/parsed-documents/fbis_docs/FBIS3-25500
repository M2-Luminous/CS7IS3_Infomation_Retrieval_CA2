FBIS3-25500 "drafr035_c_94025" FBIS-AFR-94-035 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 22 Feb MB2202142594 MB2202142594 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN Warning Against U.S., Other Interference in Election--"In keeping with his self-appointed role as president-in-waiting, Mr Mandela, during his visit to The Hague last week, put in a ten-minute call to President Clinton to discuss the steps that the ANC has taken in recent days to facilitate the participation of all parties in the April election, to quote White House Press Secretary Dee-Dee Myers," notes the page-6 editorial in Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 21 February. A point illustrated by the "Mandela-Clinton chat is that the U.S. is still interfering in our affairs." The United States, and other foreign governments, are urged not to show "any partiality" to any contender in the election. "There cannot be a free and fair election if foreign governments interfere directly or indirectly. It is not for the United States to 'push' dissenting groups to participate in the election." THE STAR PAC Election Participation Welcome -- "Be grateful that the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] is participating" in the election, states a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 22 February. "It is nonparticipation that put the chips on PAC shoulders in the first place. Let its members now experience the parliamentary subcommittees and the practicalities of administration. Let them discover the role of loyal opposition. Let them take their places among the elected leaders of a democracy, and we shall see the less defensible portions of their policies whither away." Democracy has the effect of "downscaling enemies into rivals, mortal conflicts into pragmatic agreements." BUSINESS DAY No Credible Force To Keep Peace in Natal -- "The continuing efforts to draw the Freedom Alliance [FA], especially Inkatha, back into the constitutional process seem to have little effect on Buthelezi, though Inkatha's four bottom-line conditions can apparently be met," notes Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 22 February in a page-10 editorial. "He still sees no merit in returning to round table negotiations, and tells his supporters to resist any efforts to force them to vote on April 27." In view of this "there must be serious doubts that free and fair elections will be possible in large areas of Natal." The problem for the government and the Transitional Executive Council is that "they do not have a credible force to keep the peace in Natal." A peacekeeping force without representation from Inkatha will have "no legitimacy in areas where Inkatha has a following. Any deployment of this force in Natal will be portrayed as an invasion by Umkhonto we Sizwe." SOWETAN Service `Virtually Collapsed' in Venda -- "Bantustans like Venda are going to pot," warns a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22 February. "Reports claim that services have virtually collapsed in Venda with the capital city, Thohoyandou, in a mess." SOWETAN believes Venda illustrates "the failures and evils of the old homeland policies." CITY PRESS ANC's Compromise Proposals Basis for Further Talks -- Referring to the ANC's constitutional "compromise proposals" made to the Freedom Alliance which were rejected by Inkatha Chief Buthelezi, Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 20 February says: "This merry-go-round has been going on for a long time now. Our people are frustrated by this politicking which does not seem to be getting anywhere." The ANC has acceded to the two-ballot system, and "as a sop to the white right who are demanding their own Volkstaat [homeland], the ANC now accepts the principle of self-determination can be negotiated. These are important shifts. They may fall short of Inkatha and the FA's demands, but they should serve as a basis for further discussion. It is bad faith to reject them without due consideration."
