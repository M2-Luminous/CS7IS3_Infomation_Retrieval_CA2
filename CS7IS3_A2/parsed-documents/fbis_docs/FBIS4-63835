According to Viktorov, the Russian Foreign Ministry has already sent the document to the State Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian federal legislature, for consideration. Slovak delegation leader Ivan Laluga said members of the new Slovak parliament, which has been functioning for a mere six months, are interested primarily in the democratization process in Russia and in principles of work of the Federation Council in this respect. He said Slovakia is considering the establishment of a second chamber in its parliament to better reflect the interests of the regions". The sides exchanged views on the activity of legislatures in the two countries and expressed confidence that their inter- parliamentary ties will continue to strengthen. Responding to questions about relations between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic, Viktorov stressed that "all problems between the federal centre and the Chechen Republic must be settled though negotiations". According to him, it is far from best to try and solve such problems by force. He said the Russian president's intention to meet with the president of the Chechen Republic was a positive development.
