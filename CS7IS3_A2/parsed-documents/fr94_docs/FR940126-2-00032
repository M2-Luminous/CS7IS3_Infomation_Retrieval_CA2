Section 1.0␣Background and Introduction The Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFSP) was established on March 24, 1983, with the signing of the ``Jobs Stimulus Bill,'' Public Law 98&hyph;8. That legislation created a National Board, chaired by FEMA, which consisted of representatives of the American Red Cross; Catholic Charities, USA; the Salvation Army; Council of Jewish Federations, Inc.; United Way of America; and the National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. Since that first piece of legislation in 1983, through its authorization under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;77_signed into law on July 24, 1987, subsequently reauthorized under Public Law 100&hyph;628, and signed into law on November 7, 1988), the EFSP has distributed more than $1.1 billion to over 10,500 social service agencies in more than 2,500 communities across the country. From its inception, the unique features of this program have been the partnerships it has established. At the national level, the Federal government and Board member organizations have the legal responsibility to work together to set allocations criteria and establish program guidelines. Such coalitions, as set forth in the law, are even more vital on the local level. In each community Local Boards make the most significant decisions on their own make-up and operation, the types of services most in need of supplemental help, what organizations should be funded and for what purpose and amount. These portions of the law have remained unchanged and are the core of this unique public-private partnership. Section 1.1␣Purpose This publication is developed by the National Board to outline the roles, responsibilities, and implementation procedures which shall be followed by the Local Boards, Local Recipient Organizations (LROs), State Set-Aside (SSA) Committees, National Board, and FEMA in the distribution and use of these funds. National in scope, EFSP will provide food and shelter assistance to individuals in need through local private voluntary organizations and local governments in areas designated by the National Board as being in highest need.
