This chemical substance presumably can be used to process cocaine, "crack," and other drugs, thus DITA personnel suspect that a cocaine laboratory may be operating in the country. According to the police report, this type of alcohol, which was presumably shipped from El Salvador, cannot be used for medical or industrial (liquor production) purposes. Furthermore, it is described as a solvent on the list of suspected precursor chemicals. DITA grew even more suspicious when Costa Rican authorities called the Salvadoran firm noted as the shipper on the customs entry document, and the firm said it does not distribute that type of product. DITA will coordinate the case with the Government and Public Security Ministry's national drug control directorate as there is enough evidence to suggest that a cocaine laboratory is behind the importing firm. The latter is believed to be a ghost company as it does not have any physical location or personnel to handle the alcohol it has brought into the country. The company has imported more than 40,000 liters of isopropyl alcohol from October 1993 to date. The final destination of the chemical is unknown.
