China's education system has made tremendous progress since the birth of the People's Republic, and especially in the last 15 years along with the economic reforms and China's opening to the outside world. Top leaders have all repeatedly stressed the importance of education not only to the country's modernization programme but also to the future of the socialist State. At the opening session of the just concluded education conference, President Jiang Zemin, also the Party's General Secretary, reaffirmed that hopes for rejuvenation of the nation lie in education. He urged that the development of education be truly given top priority. As a matter of fact, with regard to a developing country such as China and against the background of the extremely fast advances of science and technology around the world, the importance of education can never be overestimated. "The Outline of the Reform and Development of China's Education" published by the Party's Central Committee and the State Council, stipulates the specific measures and targets for the development of education for the 1990s and the beginning of the next century. The outline sets the goal of instituting throughout the whole country a system of nine-year compulsory education by the turn of the century and eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people by that time. It also formulates plans for better streamlined and more efficient higher education and calls for faster expansion of vocational and continuing education. According to the State Education Commission, primary education is by and large available to all children in areas inhabited by 90 per cent of China's population; lower-intermediate education is available to most children in major cities and developed areas. The illiteracy rate among the young and middle-aged has dropped to about 7 per cent compared with the pre-liberation figure of 80 per cent. College enrollment in 1993 was 2.63 million, up by 16.1 per cent from the previous year and a record high so far. For the first time in history, the enrollment in professional schools at the upper-intermediate level exceeded that of ordinary upper-intermediate schools -- an indication of the significant restructuring of education in China so that it becomes more rational and better suits the actual needs. However, the development of education is still plagued with problems that call for strenuous effort. Shortage of funds is the No 1 problem. Though the government, which has little money to spare, has done the best it can, the outlay on education in 1993 covered just 3 per cent of the gross national product (GNP), while the average of world developing countries was 4.1 per cent. The government promises to raise educational spending to 4 per cent of GNP by the end of the century. Other sources of funding are being sought, too. Teachers are still not adequately paid, and many of them are not decently housed. All this has led to a serious brain drain, with a concomitant adverse effect on the quality of education. Then there is the problem of dropouts. Whether under stress of poverty or because the household needs a helping hand, dropouts from lower-intermediate and primary schools reached 7.1 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively last year. The fact that most of the top officials of the central and provincial-level governments were present in the just-completed conference shows that the decision makers are fully aware of the problems and seeking measures to tackle them effectively. The successful conference certainly can be expected to boost China's education, enabling it to better serve the urgent requirements of the fast-growing economy and the long-term interest of our nation.
