Therefore, Greece had to express its views with actions. The United States, the United Nations, and our allies must realize that [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's government should be pressured. Venizelos added: Recent experience has proved that Skopje misinterpreted the U.S. recognition, with Gligorov's letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton being the most obvious example. The spokesman said: All of these things forced Greece to adopt these specific measures, although with a delay because it expected its partners to put pressure on the neighboring state. Venizelos said: With these measures, we expect to go stronger into a dialogue under UN auspices Asked to comment on the U.S. secretary of state's insistence on calling Skopje Macedonia, Venizelos said: Christopher probably does not remember that his government recognized Gligorov's state a week ago under the name FYROM.
