FR941117-0-00121 FR941117-0-00011 (3) Co-channel protection from control transmitters with high antennas. This paragraph applies only to control transmitters that utilize an antenna height of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above average terrain. The distance between the location of such a control transmitter and the applicable protected TV station location specified in this paragraph must equal or exceed the sum of the distance from the control transmitter location to the radio horizon in the direction of the specified location and 89 kilometers (55 miles_representing the distance from the main transmitter location of the TV station to its Grade B contour in the direction of the control transmitter). The protected TV station locations in this paragraph are the locations of record as of September 1974, and these do not change even though the TV stations may have been subsequently relocated. (i) The protected TV station locations are as follows: ␣ 1Control transmitter frequency range 1Protected TV station location 470&hyph;476 MHz Washington, DC 38 ○57 ’17 ’ ’ 77 ○00 ’17 ’ ’ 476&hyph;482 MHz Lancaster, PA 40 ○15 ’45 ’ ’ 76 ○27 ’49 ’ ’ (ii) The distance to the radio horizon is calculated using the following formula: E:GRAPHICSER17NO94.008 where d is the distance to the radio horizon in kilometers h is the height of the antenna center of radiation above ground level in meters §22.627 Effective radiated power limits. The effective radiated power (ERP) of transmitters operating on the channels listed in §22.621 must not exceed the limits in this section. (a) Maximum ERP. The ERP must not exceed the applicable limits in this paragraph under any circumstances. ␣ 1Frequency range (MHz) 1Maximum ERP (watts) 470&hyph;512 1000 928&hyph;929 50 932&hyph;933 30 941&hyph;942 600 952&hyph;960 150
