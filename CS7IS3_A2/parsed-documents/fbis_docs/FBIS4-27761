"The National Assembly worked at the conference hall in the morning under the direction of National Assembly Vice Chairman Dang Quan Thuy. "The deputies debated a revised draft law on the amendment of and supplement to a number of articles on the law on military service. There were 21 deputies airing their views. All those who spoke favored the idea of amending and supplementing the law on military service now in force. Most of them hailed the fact that the draft law had been supplemented with Articles 11, 9, 23, 56, and 61 on the duty of economic organizations and of the administration to muster youths to comply with the law on military service. They pointed out the need to assign relevant economic organizations, public organs, and units with the duty of accepting their former personnel who have returned from military service. Many deputies asked that the law clearly specify that in cases where these organizations or organs are deactivated, the responsibility of arranging employment for these youths will rest with the War Invalids and Social Welfare Offices concerned." Some deputies proposed that the law further specify the responsibility of People's Councils at various levels to supervise the enforcement of the law on military service. The question of temporary military deferment or temporary military exemption was also intensively discussed. "The general views are that the law on military service has been carried out in a biased fashion, as there are fewer youths from wealthy families or whose fathers are party cadres and members carrying out military service than less-educated youths from poor families. It is precisely due to this that many deputies favor the idea of offering an appropriate benefit policy to those who have fulfilled their military service." Some deputies urged the defense minister to reexamine the training program for two-year military draftees "as there have been complaints about military draftees having to spend more time on manual labor than on military training." "Others proposed that members of Assault Youth Forces be exempted from military service." This afternoon, the National Assembly deputies split up into groups for discussions.
