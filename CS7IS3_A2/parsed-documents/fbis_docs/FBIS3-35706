Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev noted that the main purpose of the event was to analyze the work of the management bodies of the General Staff and the Defense Ministry. In particular, he pointed out shortcomings in the work of the cadre and indoctrination structures of armed forces management bodies. In their speeches the commanders in chief of the branches of the Armed Forces noted that systematic combat training is taking place among their troops. Combat readiness is being maintained at the proper level in units and subunits. There have been no disruptions in the performance of combat alert duties. The main problem acutely facing the Armed Forces remains financing. In order to prevent any disruptions in fuel deliveries and food and electricity supplies and to carry out military transportation tasks Grachev has issued instructions that the Defense Ministry's reserves be used for these purposes. He also drew attention to the question of bringing up to strength the level of active service personnel at Russian military units and subunits situated in so-called trouble spots. In this connection Colonel-General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of land forces, noted that these units are manned only by volunteers who have signed contracts and who have served for not less than six months in the Army.
