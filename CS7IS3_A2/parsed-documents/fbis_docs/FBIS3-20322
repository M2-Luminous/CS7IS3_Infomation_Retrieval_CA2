In contrast to Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union), Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic Party of Germany) rejects a speedy deportation of the people concerned to Turkey. The minister also expressed doubts about the sense of a German-Turkish agreement, which Kanther demands. By this agreement Ankara is supposed to commit itself once again to not torturing deported Kurdish criminals or sentencing them to death. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said on Monday [28 March] that Turkey has long joined several agreements "that say torture is not permitted. This shows that Turkey has obligations arising from these agreements." Therefore, a Justice Ministry spokesman expressed skepticism about a talk, which is to be held by the Justice Ministry, the Interior Ministry, as well as the Foreign Ministry on the agreement today, Tuesday. In an interview, the justice minister called for putting Kurdish criminals on trial in Germany. No one must be deported to a country where he is "really threatened" with torture and the death penalty. The Justice Ministry spokesman explained that this is "the ultimate limit" for Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger. Hans Gottfried Bernrath, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], chairman of the Bundestag Internal Affairs Committee, also called for trying the Kurdish criminals in Germany. Only afterwards should a deportation be decided on. The Interior Ministry played down reports that, on the weekend, it considered flying Federal Border Police units to the Kurdish demonstrations in Bundeswehr helicopters. Such considerations are only made in general and apply to really exceptional situations within the framework of administrative assistance. In no case does this mean the use of soldiers, but only the provision of Air Force transport planes, the Interior Ministry said. Several SPD politicians once again came out in favor of the immediate cessation of German arms exports to Turkey. There are indications that Ankara does use the weapons against Kurds, in contrast to its reassurances. A Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that German diplomats have not learned about the use of weapons from Germany against Kurds so far. However, it was said in the Defense Ministry that Bonn does "not have any possibility of checking this in Turkey itself."
