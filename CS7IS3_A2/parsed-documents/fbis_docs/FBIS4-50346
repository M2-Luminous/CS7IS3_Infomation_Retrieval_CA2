Representatives at the summit from well-known multinational corporations stressed this point in their speeches. Hubert Demestier from the Total oil company of France said that the changing needs of the Chinese society resulted from the development of its economy, its demands for energy were on the rise, and the energy mix was also changing. "As an international oil company having been active in Asia for 40 years, Total has closely followed the gradual reform of the Chinese economy," he said, adding that the company was the first foreign oil company to find and develop oil in cooperation with China in the South China Sea. "We appreciate the quality of the Chinese industry and the very high standards applied in oil exploration and production," he said. Demestier pointed out that in order to keep the enthusiasm of foreign investors in the oil production field, the Chinese Government should be flexible to optimize crude supply, refinery operation and product sales. Philip Tose, chairman of Peregrine Investments Holdings Company from Hong Kong, said that a period of growth in the Chinese economy must call for a dramatic transformation of its physical and financial infrastructure, and it is necessary for China to invest heavily in its infrastructure now. According to the forecast of the company, at least 230 billion U.S. dollars will be required in China between now and the year 2000. Tose pointed out that during the period, the domestic capital would account for 80 to 90 percent of the total investment, and about 35-40 billion U.S. dollars would come from abroad. In order to absorb foreign funds, he said, the allowed rates of return in China should be competitive with those available elsewhere. "We believe that it would be wise to develop as large a role as possible for portfolio investment in financing the deficits China will see," he added. Shanghai's history of being a cosmopolitan financial and trade center along with recent developments such as the launching of a bond futures contract make it a logical choice to collect international and domestic funds and channel those funds into infrastructure-related bonds and corporate bond issues, Tose said. Vincent Tan Chee Yioun, chief executive officer of the Malaysian Berjaya group, said that the Chinese economy has undergone tremendous growth and transformation and, coupled with its huge population and land area, excellent and significant business opportunities were available. "It is in China's best interest to continue developing upon its present policy," he said, adding that under the support of the Malaysian Government, the group had earmarked a sum of 100 million U.S. dollars for direct investment in China. "Being new in opening its economy to the world, China has a very short `track record' for investors to ascertain likely future policy direction," he said. "It is therefore more critical for China to consciously demonstrate its long-term desire to attract and retain foreign investors as partners in China's development and modernization process." T.T. Tsui, chairman of the New China Hongkong Capital Limited Company, said that in recent years, Hong Kong has invested greatly on the mainland, and the investment from the mainland to Hong Kong, which now reaches around 20 billion U.S. dollars, was increasing significantly as well. "The close relations between the two sides were set up on the basis of the achievement China had made over the last 15 years," he said. "Without reform and opening, the bilateral ties could not develop so smoothly." Overseas expansion of Chinese enterprises would be inevitable in the future, he said, adding that since the mainland companies were familiar with Hong Kong, it was very natural for them to increase their presence in the Hong Kong market.
