It was shown that two of the six epidemics were caused by serotype B influenza viruses and four, by influenza A virus. Influenza and ORZ [acute respiratory diseases] strike primarily the child population. For this reason, it is imperative to improve registration of incidence of ORVI [acute respiratory viral infection] in children. The lack of such registration makes it difficult to pinpoint promptly the start of a flu epidemic due to their small share of the overall population. For this reason, we kept a differentiated record of incidence of influenza and ORZ in different age groups during the flue epidemic in Alma-Ata in 1985-1990. In 1985, an epidemic rise in incidence of influenza among children began in the 46th week of the year (11-17 November) in the 3-6 year age group. The following week (18-24 November) the epidemic threshold was exceeded by morbidity among schoolchildren 7-14 years old with a high rate of rise (to 40.3 percent). The epidemic flu outbreak among children was characterized by low intensity, and it lasted for 6 weeks. In this period, morbidity constituted 5.2 percent for children in the 3-6 year age group, and 1.9 percent for children 7-14 years old, which was not appreciably reflected in the incidence of influenza in the adult population (Table 1). Table 1.

Within the epidemic period a total of 80 nasopharyngeal washings and 71 paired serum samples from patients with the diagnosis of influenza and acute respiratory disease were examined. Two strains of influenza virus were isolated from material from a sick 3-year old child and 59-year adult; identification with prototype sera revealed that they were of the sero-subtype A(H1N1) influenza virus. Immunological analysis carried out with a large set of immune rat serum samples revealed that they were closely related to the drift variant A/Chile/1/83 (H1N1). HIT [hemagglutination inhibition tests] on paired patient serum samples revealed an increase in titers of antibodies to influenza virus A(H1N1) in 14.1 percent of the cases, to virus A(H3N2) in 5.6 percent, to virus B in 7.0 percent, and mixed influenza infection in 9.9 percent. When the tested patients were distributed in age groups, influenza was diagnosed in 37.5 percent of the children 3-6 years old and 22.2 percent in those 7-14 years old (Table 2). Table 2.

One week later, children 3-6 years old were included in the epidemic process with an increment rate of 41.4 percent. However, overall incidence of influenza among the entire population of the city remained below the epidemic threshold at this time. This indicator exceeded its limits only 3 weeks after the start of the epidemic. The flu epidemic lasted 7 weeks, and at its peak 0.9 percent of the population was stricken. In this period, 19.9 percent of preschool children were involved, 12.0 percent of schoolchildren and 1.3 percent of adults. As a result, over the entire epidemic, 4.7 percent of the city's inhabitants had contracted influenza (see Table 1). As a result of virological tests performed in the first quarter of 1986, 3 strains of influenza virus B were isolated from 182 nasopharyngeal washings from patients (see Table 2). Two strains were isolated from children 21 months and 10 years old, and the third from a 34-year adult. The isolated strains were closely related according to antigenic structure of hemagglutinin to influenza virus B/Victoria/1/85, and they were characterized by loss of relationship to virus B/Singapore/222/79. Serological testing of paired serum samples from patients identified influenza B in 23.2 percent of the cases, A(H3N2) in 7.7 percent, and A(H1N1) in 1.6 percent. Mixed influenza infection was diagnosed in 4.1 percent. On the whole, influenza was demonstrated in 37.1 percent of the tested individuals. Serological testing of age groups revealed influenza in 21.2 percent of children up to 2 years old, 10.0 percent in those 3-6 years of age, 46.6 percent of children 7-14 years old, and 42.1 percent of adults. In the 4th quarter of 1986, epidemic influenza in Alma-Ata was characterized by involvement of all age groups (see Table 1). Rapid rates of increase in morbidity were recorded among schoolchildren (39.1 percent) and adults (35.1 percent). A dramatic rise in morbidity was noted in the 2d and 3d weeks after the start of the influenza epidemic. Peak epidemic morbidity occurred 2 weeks after onset of the epidemic in infants (0-2 years) and schoolchildren (7-14 years), whereas it occurred 3 weeks after the start in children 3-6 years old and adults. The flu epidemic lasted 6 weeks in the city. In this time, 2.1 percent of infants to 2 years old, 10.1 percent of 3-6-year children, 10.3 percent of those 7-14 years old and 2.7 percent of the adults had been stricken with the flu. Morbidity among children 3-14 years of age exceed that of adults by 3.8 times during this flue epidemic. A total of 176 patients were submitted to virological testing in order to make laboratory identification of the etiology of influenza during the epidemic. We isolated three strains of influenza virus A(H1N1) from children and one identical strain from an adult. According to antigenic structure of hemagglutinin, the epidemic viruses were closely related to the drift variant A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1). The hemagglutination neutralization test with antibody erythrocyte diagnosticum to strain A/Taiwan/1/86 showed that isolates interacted to a full homologous titer (1:5120), with A/Prague/1/84 to one-half titer, and to A/USSR/090/77 to one-eighth titer. Serologically, influenza A(H1N1) was demonstrated in 20.3 percent of those tested and mixed influenza infection was found in 3.2 percent. On the whole, influenza was diagnosed in 29.7 percent of the tested cases. Thus, in the first and fourth quarters of 1986, there were 2 flu epidemics in Alma-Ata, which were caused by serotype B and sero-subtype A(H1N1) influenza viruses. The distinction of these epidemics was predominant involvement of preschool and school age children. In the winter-spring period of 1987-1988, epidemic influenza morbidity in Alma-Ata had a two-wave course, and was characterized by dissimilar involvement of inhabitants in different age groups. At the start, in the 50th week of 1987 (7-13 December), the epidemic threshold was exceeded by schoolchildren, and after 3 weeks preschool children were involved in the epidemic process. Among younger children, the epidemic lasted 5 weeks, and in this time 6.7 percent of the children up to 2 years old and 8.8 percent of those 3-6 years of age were stricken. The epidemic had a continuous pattern in children 7-14 years of age, and 15.6 percent of them were stricken. The distinction of this epidemic was the fact that the adult population of the city was virtually uninvolved in the epidemic process. On the whole, 2.5 percent of the inhabitants of Alma-Ata were stricken with influenza during the epidemic. In the first wave of rise in incidence of influenza (December 1987), we examined 159 nasopharyngeal washings from patients and isolated 2 strains of influenza virus B. HIT of 89 paired serum samples from stricken individuals revealed influenza B in 8.8 percent of the cases, A(H1N1) in 3.5 percent, and A(H3N) in 2.2 percent. In 10 percent of the cases, we diagnosed influenza infection of mixed etiology. During the period of the second rise in incidence of influenza (1st quarter of 1988), 22 strains of the virus sero-subtype A(H3N2) were isolated from material taken from 414 patients. The strains were characterized by marked antigenic heterogeneity. One strain showed great resemblance to the standard A/Si-Chwan/2/87, others to A/Mississippi/1/85, and others yet to A/Philippines/2/82. HIT of 181 paired serum samples of patients demonstrated diagnostic rise in antibody titer to virus A(H3N2) in 18.2 percent of the cases, to A(H1N1) in 2.2 percent, and to B in 3.3 percent. In March, testing of 69 pairs of blood serum samples revealed an increase to 17.4 percent in seroconversions to influenza B virus. During the period of epidemic rise in influenza, serologically we established microcirculation of relic strains of influenza A(H2N2) virus and A(H0N1) to 4.0 percent, as well as active circulation of other groups of respiratory viruses: parainfluenza, RS virus, and adenovirus, the share of which ranged from 16.0 to 23.0 percent. In 1989, the epidemic rise in incidence of influenza in Alma-Ata started among 4-14-year school children in the 4th week of the year (16-22 January). Two weeks later, the flu epidemic struck preschool children 3-6 years of age and adults. The epidemic lasted in the city for 7 weeks, and in this period 12.8 percent of the children 3-6 years old were stricken, 17.3 percent of those 7-14 years old and 1.1 percent of adults. On the whole, 4.2 percent of the city's inhabitants were stricken with the flu during the epidemic. The distinction of this epidemic was also predominant involvement of the child population; however, the youngest age group (0-2 years old) was not involved in the flu epidemic process. During the epidemic period, we examined virologically 364 samples of nasopharyngeal washings. We isolated 10 hemagglutinating agents, 6 of which were referable to influenza A(H1N1) virus, 1 to A(H3N2), 1 to B, and 2 isolates were a mixture of serovariants A(H1N1) and A(HSW1N1). Strains of A(H1N1) showed antigenic resemblance to standard viruses A/Prague/1/84 and A/Taiwan/1/86, and were neutralized by immune sera to these viruses to a full and half homologous titer, respectively. HIT of 151 paired serum samples from patients revealed diagnostic increase in titers of antigens to A(H1N1) in 8.0 percent of the cases, to B in 11.2 percent, to A(H3N2) in 2.0 percent, and mixed influenza infection was found in 4.6 percent. In January 1990, there was a new epidemic rise in influenza in Alma-Ata. Unlike the preceding epidemics, it began among the adult population in the 2d week of the year (8-14 January), and a week later children became involved in the epidemic. Maximum incidence of influenza was recorded only 3 weeks after the start of the epidemic, when 2.5 percent of the inhabitants were involved. On the whole, the epidemic lasted in the city for 6 weeks, and 4.7 percent of the inhabitants were stricken. Also, in the period of the epidemic, 1.5 percent of children up to 2 years old, 11.4 percent of those 3-6 years old, 12.9 percent of those 7-14 years of age and 2.4 percent of adults were stricken with the flu. These findings indicate that in this epidemic too, morbidity among preschool and schoolchildren exceeded that of adults by 5.5 times (see Table 1). Virological examination of 293 samples of nasopharyngeal washings in the 1st quarter of 1990 resulted in isolation of 8 strains of influenza A(H3N2) virus, 4 of which were isolated form children up to 14 years of age and the other 4, from adults. The etiology of the epidemic was confirmed by serological testing of 182 paired blood serum samples from patients with the flu. Thus, influenza A(H3N2) was documented in 28.6 percent of the tested individuals. Thus, in 1985-1990, there were 6 recorded influenza epidemics in Alma-Ata, 2 of which were caused by influenza virus serotype B (1986, 1987) and the other 4, by influenza A virus. In particular, there was prevalence among the public of strains of variants of A(H1N1) in 1985, 1986 and 1989, and of influenza A(H3N2) virus in 1988 and 1990.
