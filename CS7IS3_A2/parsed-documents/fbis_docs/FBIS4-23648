After the election the party's funds are apparently running dry and other jobs must be found urgently for its officials. This week RAPPORT was alerted by informed sources that the ANC officials "will be in Pretoria soon." In civil service circles it is being described as "nepotism under the cloak of affirmative action." State departments recently received orders from Minister of Public Services and Administration Dr. Zola Skweyiya to inform him -- before last week Friday -- which vacancies existed in their departments. Some departments had to work through Thursday night until the early hours of the morning to prepare their lists. Over the past week the minister also issued a statement that approximately a thousand vacant posts in the civil service would be advertised by 15 June. A large number of these posts are senior management posts. The Transitional Executive Council has frozen these posts and have placed a moratorium on new appointments or promotions. Posts `Multiplying' RAPPORT was informed that these 1,000 posts being sought for "affirmative action" had "multiplied to 3,000" by Friday. There has been talk of an "undignified haste" and experts point out that the Civil Service Commission will complete its task within six weeks on the rationalization of the civil service from 11 services to just one service. It would have been more logical to halt the proposed appointments to these posts until this process has been completed. Meanwhile, it appears that the various provincial governments are appointing new personnel left and right. These appointments could "lead to chaos" and even to serious tension between the black state officials and government. The interim constitution guarantees the job of every civil servant. They should, therefore, enjoy first preference with the appointment of new personnel, but the process could drag on until early next year before officials are fully integrated into the various provincial governments. At that stage officials might find their posts being filled by political appointments. ANC Members Appointed In the Eastern Cape former ANC officials have already been appointed in all provincial state departments as "executive managers," apparently to promote the affirmative action program. Nobody knows exactly what their status is, not even whether they are just "embryonic directors general" who will later be appointed above other officials. Dr. Skweyiya says that these appointments are part of "temporary transitional measures made by the various governments. These appointments are not being done in accordance with the civil service rules and regulations. Neither I nor the Civil Service Commission are involved in these arrangements. It is not possible to speculate on the possible later inclusion of these officials in the civil service." Also in the PWV Province "there are offices full of officials" who have been appointed in the interim. `Old Extras' It was revealed to RAPPORT that there are "just more old extras" in the offices of the various premiers -- people who have come from somewhere and for whom posts will have to be created. "It seems that civil service regulations will not be followed in the new government. A moratorium on new appointments apparently does not exist any more." [passage omitted]
