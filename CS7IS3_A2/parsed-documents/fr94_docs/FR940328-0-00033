FR940328-0-00033 FR940328-0-00012 General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, Federal Register publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over two years old be withdrawn. A one-year grace period was given to proposals already over two years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the Federal Register (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). In at least one of these notices, eight of the species (including synonymous taxa) that had been in the 1976 proposed rule were treated as category 1 candidates for Federal listing. Category 1 species are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. Other than Chamaesyce deppeana (as Euphorbia deppeana ), Huperzia nutans (as Lycopodium nutans ), Melicope lydgatei (as Pelea lydgatei and P. descendens ) and Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa (as T. gymnocarpa var. pupukeensis ), all the aforementioned species that were either proposed as endangered or threatened or thought to be extinct in the June 16, 1976, proposed rule were considered category 1 candidates in all three notices of review. Melicope lydgatei (as Pelea lydgatei and P. descendens ), a category 1 species in the 1980 and 1985 notices, was conferred category 1* status in the 1990 notice. Category 1* species are those which are possibly extinct; however, because new information regarding this species' existence has become available, it was proposed for listing. In the 1980 and 1985 notices, Huperzia nutans (as Lycopodium nutans ) was considered a category 2 species and Chamaesyce deppeana (as Euphorbia deppeana ) a category 3A species. Category 2 species are those for which there is some evidence of vulnerability, but for which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Category 3A species are those for which the Service has persuasive evidence of extinction. For those two species, because new information provided support for listing or indicated their current existence, they were conferred category 1 status in the 1990 notice. Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa var. pupukeensis appeared as a category 3B species in the 1980 and 1985 notices; in the 1990 notice, it was considered synonymous with T. gymnocarpa , a category 1 species. Category 3B species are those which, on the basis of current taxonomic understanding, do not represent distinct taxa meeting the Act's definition of ``species.'' Cyanea truncata and Rollandia crispa first appeared in the 1990 notice, as a category 1 species. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on petitions that present substantial information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of these species was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the Service to consider the petition as having been submitted, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposal constituted the final one-year finding for these 11 plant taxa. On October 14, 1992, the Service published in the Federal Register (57 FR 47028) a proposal to list 11 plant taxa from the Koolau Mountain Range, island of Oahu, as endangered. This proposal was based primarily on information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program, the Hawaii Plant Conservation Center, and observations by botanists and naturalists. The Service now determines 11 species primarily from the Koolau Mountain Range to be endangered with the publication of this rule. Summary of Comments and Recommendations
