FBIS3-57102 "drsov015_c_94029" FBIS-SOV-94-015 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Jan 1994 Federal Assembly Parliamentary Defense Committee Chief on Tasks LD1901161994 LD1901161994 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 1315 GMT on 19 January broadcasts an interview with Sergey Nikolayevich Yushenkov, head of the parliamentary defense committee, by an unidentified correspondent. During the interview Yushenkov is asked to describe the committee he heads. He says that currently 18 people representing various parties are on the committee, almost all of them with military experience. Among them, he says, are Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Piskunov, one of the leaders of the former Supreme Soviet's defence and security committee, Colonel General Yuriy Nikolayevich Rodionov, former deputy defense minister and currently deputy chief of the Armed Forces Inspectorate, Colonel General Dmitriy Antonovich Volkogonov, and Georgiy Grigorovich Lukava. The committee's main task, according to Yushenkov, is to "restore officers' prestige" with particular reference to restoring the role of the Russian officer and gentleman. He adds that welfare issues, military doctrine, and army reform are among other questions the committee wishes to deal with, ensuring that the army is "on a proper level of combat readiness." Yushenkov then lists other committees headed by Russia's Choice members. Commenting on the fact that some government members have decided to focus on their Duma duties, Yushenkov says it will affect the work in the new parliament: Democrats have about one-third of the votes, or perhaps a little more. About 40 to 42 percent of deputies oppose the president and the government, he says, adding that "the battle now will be for those who are undecided." Those who succeed in enticing them will probably get majority in the State Duma, "although it seems to me that not a single competing group will get a stable majority," Yushenkov says. He goes on: "As for members of the government leaving the government, it is due to the fact that it is not possible to continue with effective reforms. Moreover, since mid-December Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov have, in fact, been unable to influence the financial stabilization, nor have they been able to influence in any effective manner any other decisions connected with the economic or welfare sphere and that is the reason why they left that government, together with Ella Panfilova and this will, of course, make itself felt on the work of the State Duma." Gaydar, he says, will now be a more active participant in parliamentary proceedings -- yesterday he was applauded for opposing the squandering of taxpayers' money on the building of new premises for the Federal Assembly. Yushenkov concludes his interviewe by noting: "I think that the truth that the center of power is currently being shifted in the structures of executive authority from the president to the prime minister is becoming more and more obvious -- it is a fact which must be taken into account in further activities."
