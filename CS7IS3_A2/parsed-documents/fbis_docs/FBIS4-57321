Gomez Mont yesterday favored legal reforms to give the Attorney General's Office [PGR] full autonomy and detach it, once and for all, from the Executive's decisions. Rene Bejarano Martinez, leader of the Party of the Democratic Revolution in Mexico City, has said that Diego Valades Rios' hasty dismissal "casts serious doubts on the government and the administration of justice in the country" and arouses the "permanent suspicion" that high officials are involved in drug trafficking, all of which heightens the climate of insecurity in Mexico. All of these changes have altered the functions of the Attorney General and Mexico City's Federal Attorney General. It is time for this office to become fully autonomous and to be freed from the president's control, Gomez Mont said. He voiced his fears that Humberto Benitez Trevino, the new PGR head, will file away the Hank Gonzalez case permanently. Gomez Mont said that Benitez is openly pro-Gonzalez and that all of Benitez' background consists of positions he held in the state of Mexico and SARH, [Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources] which was headed by Gonzalez. Apart from this, the change "is unhealthy" because it destabilizes the institution even further and reveals "a certain mismanagement" at the federal level. These changes give the impression of "messiness." Instead of benefiting the country, these changes harm it. Finally, Gomez Mont refuted the report that his party pressured for Valades Rios' removal.
