LDPR Leader Is Russia's Choice's Sole Hope for a Breakup of the `Big Coalition'"] [Text] Today another round of talks is due to be held between the four potentially largest factions in the State Duma about the candidacy of its future chairman. The previous round, which took place on the morning of 31 December, ended inconclusively. Russia's Choice, as has always been the case recently, has again found itself in isolation but this time its partners-opponents (the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Russian Federation Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]) were not quite so unanimous either. According to some sources, some turmoil among their hitherto apparently uniform ranks was introduced by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who has just returned from his foreign tour which concluded so unexpectedly. He replaced Viktor Kobelev, chief of his own party apparatus, at the negotiating table, and therefore some of the details agreed upon earlier had to be repeated to him. According to Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party, today's meeting will apparently be decisive. If there are no results -- that is to say, if there is no consensus on the nomination of a mutually satisfactory candidacy for the Duma speaker -- then votes would have to be counted. It can be stated with certainty that this is precisely what the leadership of each of the four large factions will have to do. With respect to Russia's Choice this procedure will apparently be the most upsetting, since its own votes will obviously not be enough to outweigh the votes of the agrarians, the communists, and the Zhirinovskiy followers. Incidentally, according to some reports, Russia's Choice was prepared for a failure at the talks on the speaker back when they were just beginning, while their results, by general consent, were reported to the press in upbeat, i.e., quite ambiguous phrases. It was at that moment that a member of the Russia's Choice faction who enjoyed substantial influence within it told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that their candidate would be Sergey Kovalev, provided the speaker is selected from among the major factions. If the Duma chairman is sought within a number of small factions, Russia's Choice would support any constructive candidacy. Now it is appropriate to go back to Russia's Choice's problems over the counting of its own votes. They (these problems) will become especially serious after the "democratic" factions possibly refuse to team up with Russia's Choice on the speaker issue. This mainly concerns the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES], whose leader Sergey Shakhray reminded Russia's Choice about the pledges by its numerous representatives that they would never sit down next to the fascists. True, the refusal to form a bloc with Russia's Choice will not bring PRES any success and, having no chances to get through its own candidate as chairman, it will have to vote against everyone, which somewhat contradicts its basic principles: unity and accord. Russia's Choice itself will undoubtedly explain away its participation in the talks by pragmatic considerations, at the same time renouncing its earlier pledges, citing pre-election rhetoric and the bitterness of defeat, widely publicized by pro-presidential TV. Therefore a bloc of smaller factions and a group of "independents" with Russia's Choice is evolving objectively: Only then will they possibly have a majority. It is another question whether such a number of partners, where each partner has his own interests and is determined to satisfy them to the fullest possible extent, will be able to come to a definite agreement. If not, defectors are bound to appear again: first, single individuals and then whole factions which will tip the scale. It appears that Russia's Choice has only one hope: Mr. Zhirinovskiy's unpredictable behavior.
