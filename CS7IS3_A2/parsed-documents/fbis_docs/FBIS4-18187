FBIS4-18187 "drweu062_o_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 CYPRUS `Text' of Denktas' Document to UN's Feissel `Text' of Denktas' Document to UN's Feissel NC3003192494 Nicosia KIBRIS in Turkish 30 Mar 94 pp 1, 3 NC3003192494 Nicosia KIBRIS Turkish BFN ["Text" of document Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas submitted to Gustav Feissel, UN secretary general's assistant special envoy in Cyprus, on 29 March -- all punctuation as published] [Text] Subparagraph 4 of Paragraph 38 of the UN secretary general's report, dated 1 July 1993, says the following: "The Turkish and Greek Cypriots will be able to enter the fenced area in Maras [Varosha] freely and without any formality." The Turkish Cypriot side showed goodwill by agreeing to the addition of the words "safe travel to and from the fenced area" to the first key issue in the talks that were held to establish the key points for the implementation of the package of confidence-building measures. (14 February 1994) Regardless of the specific provisions, the UN documents dated 9 and 21 March, which are referred to as nondocuments, have been observed to contain an inclination to deviate from the package of confidence-building measures and create a new dimension by placing an area outside the fenced area in Maras (that is the road between the southern perimeter of the fenced area in Maras and the buffer zone that is under UN control) under UN jurisdiction. Placing the area between the southern perimeter of the fenced area in Maras and the buffer zone that is under the protection of the United Nations under UN jurisdiction conflicts fundamentally with the guarantees the UN secretary general and his representatives have given several times to the Turkish Cypriot side in Nicosia and New York. Considering the contents of the package and the guarantees of the UN secretary general and his representatives, and acting with the wish to maintain a positive and constructive approach and remain open to the idea of cooperation, the Turkish Cypriot side proposes the following: A. The Turkish Cypriot side undertakes to create the conditions that will enable the Greek Cypriots to travel to and from the fenced area in Maras freely and securely, without formality or obstruction. B. The entry point of the road between the buffer zone that is under UN control and the fenced area in Maras will be controlled by Turkish Cypriot police units, which will guarantee unrestricted, unobstructed, and safe travel. C. No formality will be required whatsoever for travel to and from the entry point referred to. D. The UN observation post in the buffer zone that is under UN control will be able to observe activity at the Turkish Cypriot entry and exit point. E. UN personnel who travel in the area between the southern perimeter of the fenced area in Maras and the buffer zone that is under UN control will be able to observe the unrestricted, unobstructed, and safe travel on the road referred to. F. The Turkish Cypriot side undertakes to put into effect all appropriate measures that may be required to further reassure the Greek Cypriots who travel to and from the fenced area in Maras about their security. Considering the fact that (1) the two sides in Cyprus have undertaken to remain sincerely committed to the package of confidence-building measures in "the arrangements that will be made to resolve the problems related to the implementation of the package," (2) the UN officials will submit a report to the UN secretary general on the implementation of the package of confidence-building measures every six months, and (3) the detailed package that has been drawn up by the UN secretary general establishes a balance between gains and risks, the Turkish Cypriot side is convinced that the above-mentioned arrangements, which will allow the Greek Cypriots to freely travel to and from the fenced area in Maras without any restrictions or obstructions, fully comply with the word and spirit of the package of confidence-building measures that the UN secretary general outlined in his report to the UN Security Council dated 1 June 1993.
