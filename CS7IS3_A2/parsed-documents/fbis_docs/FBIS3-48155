Michael Roland reports that Mr. Griffiths has told the prime minister, Paul Keating, he is confident his name will be cleared but it is best that he stands aside while the investigation is carried out. In a statement issued late this afternoon, the prime minister says Mr. Griffiths has informed him he has serious concern about possible misuse of funds he received for party's political purposes. According to Mr. Keating, Mr. Griffiths has also expressed concern about the possible misuse of facilities in his Melbourne electorate office as well as irregularities in documentation relating to electoral fund-raising and expenditure. The federal police have been asked to investigate. There will also be an independent inquiry into the matters raised. In the meantime, the industry minister has told Mr. Keating, it is in the best interest of the government and the ALP [Australian Labor Party] for him to resign so the matter can be fully investigated. Mr. Griffiths has told the prime minister he is confident of being found not guilty of any wrongdoing or impropriety and he intends recontesting his position once the inquiries are over. Mr. Griffiths entered the ministry in 1990 and was promoted to the industry portfolio after last year's federal election.
