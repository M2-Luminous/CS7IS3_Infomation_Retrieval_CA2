We have not recognized NATO's ultimatum, and we have stressed the need to work within the framework of the UN Security Council resolutions. These resolutions, as is known, state the need for all sides to take measures to lift the blockade of Sarajevo and they warn the sides that, in the event of the UN peacekeeping forces coming under attack, these forces will respond and will receive support. Only in these instances can the use of force be permitted, and we have explained this in detail in our statements. We have also counterposed attempts to, so to speak, solve matters by an ultimatum with a policy toward political work and vigorous diplomatic actions which have, generally speaking, brought results. Incidentally, we put forward the idea of lifting the blockade of Sarajevo quite some time ago -- if you want to be exact, we were speaking about it last year when we proposed more than once that the Security Council should be convened precisely to examine the question of lifting the blockade of Sarajevo, which is the key to a solution to the whole Bosnian problem. [end recording] [Buzuyev] In the opinion of many observers, the Russian initiative restores our country's position as a player which should be reckoned with in the international arena. Whether we are too late will become clear in the next few days or even hours.
