"It is very regrettable North Korea has failed to make sincere response to the IAEA's efforts," Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference. North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) broke off their three-day talks in Pyongyang on Friday after the two sides failed to come to agreement over the inspection of spent fuel rods removed at the reactor. The top government spokesman also demanded that North Korea immediately suspend the removal of nuclear fuel rods from its 5- megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north of the capital, and fully abide by international nuclear safeguards. The IAEA has told north Korean negotiators that continuing replacement of fuel rods without inspection violates safeguards requirements as specified by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Saying Japan has tried to persuade North Korea to suspend the refueling in concert with the United States, South Korea and China, Kumagai vowed further efforts to grapple with the communist country's suspected nuclear arms program. Meanwhile, Kumagai withheld comments when asked if Pyongyang's reported preparations for test-launching a missile is linked with the outcome of the North Korea-IAEA talks. North Korea test-launched the Nodong-1 missile, with an estimated 1,000-kilometer range, over the sea of Japan in May 1993. Pyongyang's development of a long-range missile poses a serious threat to Japan and South Korea, as does its suspected nuclear arms program.
