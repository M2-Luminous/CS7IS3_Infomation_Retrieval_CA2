He made this statement during the discussion "The Future of the Russian Economic Reform," held in St. Petersburg on the eve of the annual conference of the EBRD managers. To quote Fedorov, the decision on the merger of the two monetary systems reflects the Russian Cabinet's inconsistent policies at a moment when Russia has approached financial stabilization. Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Kazmin admitted that by signing this agreement with Minsk, Moscow was running a risk. He noted, however, that Belarus had accepted Russia's key demand for subordinating the National Bank of Belarus to the Central Bank of Russia.
