Board Chairman Ronald Walker announced that the nuclear issue would be discussed at a board meeting on Friday morning as the last item on its agenda. Representatives of the United States, Japan, France and other major board members met informally Thursday to discuss drafting an IAEA resolution on the North Korean nuclear issue, with an eye to submitting a draft to the secretariat Thursday. These nations are reviewing the draft resolution's wording in a bid to get more than 20 board members to endorse it, a source said. In the resolution, the IAEA will express concern about the destruction of historical records on North Korea's nuclear development program as a result of the stalinist state's unsupervised refueling of its 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, while demanding that Pyongyang permit special IAEA inspections to ensure its nuclear transparency.
