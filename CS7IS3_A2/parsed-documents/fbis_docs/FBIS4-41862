The scientific community all over the globe is now marking the 40th anniversary of that event. At present in Russia the nuclear power industry accounts only for 12 percent of total electricity output. We have had a long range objective for the share to grow to 30 or 35 percent. Now some details from the first deputy minister of atomic energy of the Russian Federation, Lev Ryabev. [Begin Ryabev recording in Russian fading to English translation] Over the past five years with nuclear disarmament under way we have been striving to use our potential, first of all scientific potential, to solve problems of safety in the Russian nuclear power industry, and other issues, including those of ecology. This country is now drafting a new power program up to the year 2010. The strategy of developing the nuclear power industry is part of the program. For the first time in the record of this industry, the program incorporates a profound economic and ecological analysis. We are now developing reactors and reactor stations of the so-called third generation to keep abreast of the latest requirements adopted by the International Association for Nuclear Affairs. These new developments are scheduled for the beginning of the next century to boost the nuclear power industry. Large-scale and wide-ranging research is under way in the birthplace of the nuclear power industry, Obninsk, at the Physics and Energy Institute. The main objective of the center is to develop fast neutron reactors. The researchers there have proved that this is a highly promising line of studies. [end recording] The first deputy minister of Russia's atomic energy, Ryabev, concludes by saying that as for a look for another 40 years, he feels the nuclear power industry's safety problems will be solved drastically. The problems of highly radioactive waste will also be solved with fine results for ecology. As the nuclear power industry here keeps developing on a large-scale, it will hold even greater positions in the long-term and that will amount to economic gains for Russia.
