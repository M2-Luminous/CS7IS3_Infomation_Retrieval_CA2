Several Haitian political organizations oppose the arrival of the French humanitarian aid, 530 tons of food products sent by France for underprivileged Haitian students. The aid will be sent to Port-au-Prince by sea and is expected to arrive on 25 March. FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] member Emmanuel Constant calls the French initiative cynical. According to FRAPH, it constitutes trampling on Haitian pride; and FRAPH added, for the information of the French Government: You are starving an entire nation, just so you can later give alms to clear your conscience. Another organization, Capois-La-Mort, supports the FRAPH position unreservedly. Capois-La-Mort leader Frank Pierre says no to the French humanitarian aid ship and takes the opportunity to denounce France's position. France has always demanded a total blockade against Haiti. [Begin Pierre recording, in Creole] We in Capois-La-Mort are saying no, 9 times 99 times no! We will not have this humanitarian aid ship land in Haitian territorial waters. We are [hereby] sending the French Embassy in Haiti the message -- to be conveyed to President Francois Mitterrand of France -- that we in Capois-La-Mort will not have this ship entering Haitian territorial waters. Therefore, we ask President Mitterrand to stop this ship now, in Guadeloupe -- because the ship will just have to go right back to where it came from. It might as well even carry extra fuel, so that it does not stay even an hour longer in Haitian territory. [end recording] On the other hand, ALAH [Alliance For the Liberation and Progress of Haiti] leader Reynold Georges has dissociated himself from the position taken by FRAPH and Capois-La-Mort. Georges thinks this French humanitarian aid could help prevent the death of children in Haiti. [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] If a country feels it cannot let the Haitian people die of hunger and wants to offer some aid, I believe we must accept the aid -- because there is no glory in death. I believe that the aid must come, otherwise many children will die; and I think the reason those people would prefer that the aid not arrive is because they want to capitalize on the death of those children. We think the aid should come. If not, then FRAPH should give it! Along with all the other people who continue to support the coup d'etat -- because since 1986 the Army has been choosing the governments and then overthrowing them [end recording]. Attorney Mireille Durocher Bertin opposes the arrival of the French humanitarian aid. [Begin Durocher recording]...consciously and categorically refuse humanitarian aid however derisory it may be, if it can prevent even a single child from dying of hunger. However, we must, it is our duty to, protest against the hypocrisy of certain nations that, after strangling us, seem to supply us with a slight breath of air for an artificial, false, derisory, temporary resuscitation. When France -- which is still calling for tightening the economic sanctions against Haiti -- says that it wants to feed 50,000 children for four months, I would like to ask France: What will happen to the other millions of children that it is starving? They want to reduce us to our simplest expression, on the pretext of imposing on us, with Mr. Aristide's return, a so-called democracy. France wants to punish its former rebellious colony and use it as an example to the other black nations. If they really want to help the women and children of Haiti, they should stop interfering in our internal affairs. [end recording]
