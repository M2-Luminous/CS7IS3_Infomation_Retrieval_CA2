"Who drew the borders of Ukraine?" asked the admiral. And immediately in the same spirit: "Ukraine had five oblasts within the 1939 borders, and has 26 now. Who has been pursuing an imperial policy--Russia or Ukraine?" (The admiral, by the way, made a "trifling" arithmetical error here, for some reason counting Ukraine with 26 oblasts instead of the 24.) Noting the embarrassment of the representatives of the mass media, who had in no way expected such attacks directed at Ukraine from the commander of the fleet of the two nations, Admiral Eduard Baltin promised that "our people" would soon be able to meet with him for a more detailed discussion on that topic. So now here is Admiral Baltin, who has gained a reputation as a cautious commander, not concealing his antipathy toward Ukraine and starting to talk the language of the odious Russian leaders. This visibly reflects the situation in the ChF, whose commander fulfills only orders from the Russian Navy. The uniform of the armed forces of Russia with the corresponding insignia has been introduced in the fleet, in violation of the Yalta agreements. Draftees from Ukraine, making up 50 percent of the fleet, are being indoctrinated in the spirit of loyalty to the Russian leadership... Need we be surprised that the commander of the fleet is now proposing that we think where the state border of Ukraine should really be, starting the division into "ours" and "not ours"? Just whose interests does the command of the Black Sea Fleet intend to protect on the territory of Ukraine?
