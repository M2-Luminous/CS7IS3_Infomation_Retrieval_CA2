Graham, fresh from a visit to Pyongyang from Jan. 27 to Feb. 1, said the message was being delivered to Clinton by a church associate at a press conference in Hong Kong. The evangelist said he sent the associate to Washington ahead of him so that Clinton can receive the message by Friday, showing the urgency he attached to Kim's message. Graham said it was in reply to an oral message from Clinton which he had passed on to North Korea's paramount leader, but declined to say whether Kim's was oral or in writing. The renowned preacher said he spent more than three hours with Kim and talked about issues ranging from religion to politics, hinting that Clinton had touched on the North Korean nuclear issue in his oral message. He did not, however, elaborate on the content of the messages, nor that of his talks with Kim. He said he had discussed his planned visit to the Stalinist country earlier with Clinton, who strongly backed the idea.
