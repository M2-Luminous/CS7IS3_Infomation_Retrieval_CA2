The blueprint said a new government, in which the SDP hopes to take part, should have a basic philosophy of democracy, freedom, fairness and peace based on respect for the Constitution. A third coalition government must establish trustworthy relations among the coalition parties, it said, indirectly criticizing the formation in late April of a parliamentary group by other coalition partners excluding the SDP. The SDP withdrew from the coalition following the formation, forcing Hata to form the first minority government in 39 years. Basic policies of a new coalition government should be agreement among parties on the coalition governments of Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata, it said. As for tax system reform, the blueprint calls for abolition of the consumption tax and agrees to raise indirect tax to cope with the aging of society. It wants to enact bills for tax system reform by the end of the year. The SDP urges the peaceful settlement of the North Korean nuclear issue by cooperating with the United States, South korea, China and Russia. The plan also proposed setting up a council of Diet leaders and holding regular summit meetings of the parties to ensure transparency of decision-making procedures. The SDP has said it will return to the ruling coalition if Hata and his cabinet ministers resign en masse voluntarily. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Monday his party will move to form a caretaker government with the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to oversee a general election if talks with the coalition fail. The LDP plans to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet after passage of the state budget for fiscal 1994, expected Thursday. If a no-confidence vote is approved, Hata must either dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap general election or disband his cabinet en masse.
