In response to relevant questions, Premier Lien noted: To develop cross-strait relations, the two sides should assume a pragmatic and rational attitude and seek common ground despite the fact that the country is divided and administered separately; otherwise, it will be hard for the hope for favorable interaction to materialize. On the Chiao-Tang talks currently underway on the mainland, Premier Lien emphasized: Instead of merely stating their positions, the two sides should adopt a problem-solving approach during the talks. At present, we must patiently confront differences that may arise, maintain our basic positions, and continue our efforts. Lien Chan, who has been in office for nearly a year, also fielded questions raised by correspondents on the mainland, internal affairs, foreign affairs, financial affairs, and constitutional reforms. The following is what happened at the news conference: Accompanied by Li Hou-kao, secretary general of the Executive Yuan, and Hu Chih-chiang, director general of the Government Information Office, Lien Chan entered the site of the news conference at 0830 GMT. He first extended New Year's greetings to the correspondents present and thanked the people in all circles for their efforts to encourage and supervise his cabinet over the past year. Thereafter, he began the hour-long news conference. [Correspondent] Building Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific business hub is currently the government's major plan. Planning is quite complete in this regard. Mr. Premier, would you please explain all the specifics? Moreover, Taiwan cannot possibly exclude Communist China if it becomes a free trade area as a result of this plan. The question of direct shipping and air services between designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will also be raised. Mr. Premier, what are your views on this matter? [Lien Chan] The Asia-Pacific region achieved an average economic growth rate of 4.5 percent in recent years, which was the fastest economic growth in the world over the past few years. Its total output of goods and services represented about half the world's total output. The region is bound to become the focus of the world economy in the future. The Republic of China [ROC] on Taiwan has the following advantages to become an Asia-Pacific business hub: 1) an excellent geographical environment; 2) excellent economic conditions; 3) ample and high-quality manpower; and 4) abundant capital markets. The government hopes to complete planning as soon as possible. It is expected that planning will be completed by the middle of this year. Why should we so actively promote the ROC as a business hub? This is because, aside from the two traditional Asian business hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore, Japan's Osaka, Shanghai's Putung [Pudong] in Mainland China, Australia's Sydney, and New Zealand all are making similar preparations and attempts. Even Subic in the Philippines hopes for a piece of the action. We must work against time; otherwise, we will lose our development opportunities in three to five years. To be sure, we must also strengthen local construction. For example, our public facilities are still inadequate. That is why we proposed the 12 construction projects to beef up our public facilities. Also, we should make great efforts to supplement our financial and legal systems with legislative work. We Cannot Consider Things on Purely Economic Grounds; the Time Is Not Ripe for Direct Cross-Strait Shipping and Air Services With regard to direct air and shipping services between designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the government has always placed importance on the question of the three cross-strait exchanges [mail, shipping and air services, and trade], listing them as long- and medium-range goals in the National Unification Program. We hope to attain these goals to facilitate economic and social development on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Politically speaking, however, we must reach a common understanding with Communist China on treating us as an equal political entity, renouncing the use of armed force against us, and allowing us room for developing international relations before we can further discuss the question of three exchanges. Otherwise, the time is not ripe for solving complex problems within a purely economic context by initiating direct air and shipping services between designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. In reality, Communist China, in its white paper on Taiwan released last year, maintained that we should obtain their consent prior to signing any agreements on shipping and air rights with other countries. If cross-strait shipping and air services can be considered on purely economic grounds, why did Communist China's white paper contain such a statement? Personally, I do not think the time is ripe for direct shipping and air services between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. [Correspondent] A final decision on the plan for readjusting the pay of military, government, and educational personnel in 1995 is imminent. People are very concerned. Premier, would you please give us a clear explanation in this regard? [Lien] This matter is to be settled at a final meeting scheduled for Saturday [5 February]. However, I would like to take advantage of this rare opportunity to offer some specific explanations. Pay readjustment for military, government, and educational personnel is a policy matter about which the government is very concerned. We have to take into consideration the government's financial capacity, inflation indexes, the competitiveness of the private-sector, and the material well-being and morale of government employees. The consumer price index, which rose 2.9 percent last year, is expected to rise 3.4 percent this year. Therefore, a raise of about 3 percent should be appropriate. The Personnel Administrative Bureau has submitted two plans. Personally, I am inclined to adopt the 3-percent raise in drafting the budget. [Correspondent] What are your expectations of the ongoing talks in Peiking [Beijing] on routine affairs between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] and the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF]? If the two sides are unable to reach agreement on some routine issues after extended discussions, will the government consider modifying its mainland policy? Will this lead even to a reduction in cross-strait exchanges? [Lien] SEF-ARATS discussions on routine affairs constitute a link of our overall policy toward the mainland. Today, development of cross-strait relations depends on the two sides taking a pragmatic and reasonable approach toward the reality of a divided nation and divided rules and seeking a common ground from this reality. Without such an understanding, a relation of constructive mutual engagement [liang xing hu dong 5328 1840 0062 0520] between the two sides will remain unattainable. The current SEF mission left for the mainland in the hope of following up on the five understandings reached at the Ku-Wang talks and reaching an agreement. We will certainly welcome any agreement on fishing disputes or repatriation of hijackers and people who illegally enter Taiwan that is reached at the ongoing talks in Peiping. Certainly, some of these issues require us to tackle them with patience. [Correspondent] Presidential adviser Li Kuo-ting recently questioned the feasibility of the plan for building an east-west superhighway. What do you think of such criticism? [Lien] We should indeed care about government finances. Not only those in the government but people at large should show concern. When I assumed office last year, the government debt stood at NT$1,060 billion [new Taiwan dollars] and the balance in the annual budget was a mere NT$100 million; the situation was extremely difficult. We took a variety of emergency measures, and, as a result, the budget deficit has dropped to NT$84.9 billion and the balance in the annual budget has risen to NT$23.3 billion. However, because the universal health insurance services that will come into effect this year, the budget for public welfare spending for 1994 will double that of last year. This, plus a pay raise of military, government, and educational personnel, increased budgetary spending on education and science and weaponry purchases; there probably will be a NT$400 billion shortfall in this year's budget. The government must also take the whole situation in consideration. On one hand, it must reduce spending, halt inappropriate public investment, and reduce waste; on the other hand, it must seriously consider all projects -- such as those for developing towns and cities and for regional balance -- that have a direct bearing on the people. Therefore, the east-west superhighway was given emphasis in the Six-Year National Development Plan. Often, only 60 percent of six-year plans are completed. Therefore, proper emphasis on priority projects will have a positive impact on national development and economic growth. In response to calls from various quarters, the provincial government undertook, seven or eight years ago, a study and adopted the highway project. A feasibility study of the east-west superhighway project was conducted in 1990 and a project assessment was made in 1993. There is a thick file of materials about the two studies. Everyone is welcome to look through it. More assessment will be needed in regard to the project's environmental impact and financing. When all the conditions -- environment, financing, technical capability, and private-sector participation -- are in place, we should push forward with this project. [Correspondent] The idea of "two China's as a phase" forwarded by Economics Minister Chiang Ping-kun at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting has won widespread approval. I would like to know how would you, the premier, advance this policy in the future? [Lien] The one-China policy is the nation's fundamental policy, but China is currently divided. The ROC is a sovereign nation founded in 1912, but currently the ROC holds the power of rule only over Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu, and Chinmen. This is the general environment, the fundamental reality. We believe that, realistically speaking, discussion of the sovereignty issue should be put aside at the present stage when considering the issues relating to foreign affairs and mainland policy. What should be done is to move forward step by step in the light of reality. The APEC meeting was an economic occasion, not a government occasion. Therefore, no politically sensitive question should be broached there. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists had the impudence to call our Taiwan a PRC province. Minister Chiang's statement was a tactical explanation to tell people that the reality is not what Chinese Communists claim. That was a tactical explanation made at a given circumstances and occasion. [Correspondent] In the past, we said that politics should be separated from economics in our policy toward the mainland. Will this policy be continued? If a policy of not separating politics and economics is adopted, what chips does the government have to make the businessmen abide by such a policy? Thank you. [Lien] Separating economics from politics -- I do not know whose idea this is. In regard to the overall situation vis-a-vis the mainland, I believe we should continue to take the National Reunification Guidelines as the supreme guidance and policy. It is a fact that our businessmen are investing in all sectors of the mainland's economy and we are trading indirectly. The mainland has seen rapid growth in the past few years, registering economic growth rates from 9 to as high as 14 percent. However, can such high rates be sustained for long? This is a question that merits consideration. Shortages of public facilities and strong inflationary pressures are, in particular, factors that we should consider from an economic angle. In addition to economic risks, there is no denying the fact that all economic activities in the mainland carry some political risks, even high political risks. Nowadays, with regard to economic activities in the mainland, the government is more inclined to give guidance than issue prohibitions. However, we do not encourage such activities. Our approach is an incremental and indirect one. We do not want to place all our economic strength in one basket; the preservation and development of Taiwan's economic strength should be the guiding principle governing all our economic activities. I made a trip to Southeast Asia recently. Economics departments have also come up with the so-called southern policy. Our investment in Southeast Asia stands at about $15 billion today; imports from that region accounts for about 11 percent while exports account for 32 percent of the ROC's total exports. It is a very important region. The Southern Policy Is Based on Pragmatism; More Efforts Will Be Needed To Break Out of Our Diplomatic Predicament [Correspondent] What is your view of the practice of "vacation diplomacy"? Are there plans for overseas trips for other cabinet members? [Lien] The primary consideration behind my visit to Southeast Asia and the subsequent announcement of the "southern policy" is the fact that the ROC has an investment of $15 billion in that region, which also accounts for 32 percent of the ROC's exports. With the exception of Thailand, we have signed agreements with all countries in that region on investment protection and protection against double taxation. We have close ties with them. We hope to participate more in Southeast Asian organizations meetings and activities. All in all, we must not look at only the regional and functional aspects in considering issues related to the "southern policy." I made a trip to Southeast Asia not long ago primarily because it was New Year's and I had some days off. I went to Malaysia and Singapore and met their government leaders. The trip to Honduras was an official diplomatic mission ordered by the president. The government is facing great difficulties in diplomacy. I always feel that we should make our voice heard by our friends and the world at large. We also hope to make our strength, good will, contributions, and ideas heard and seen by all the people. As long as resources permit, I am all for the idea that relevant government personnel should turn up more frequently in different locations and at different international occasions to publicize our nation. That is what you reporters call "show up faces." As a matter of fact, we have to show up to let everybody know that we did not vanish; rather we are growing in strength with each passing day. I think it is very important. [Correspondent] Where do you think our mainland policy will go in a post-Teng Hsiao-ping [Deng Xiaoping] era? Hsu Chia-tun [Xu Jiatun], former director of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said that under Li Teng-hui's strong leadership, the chance of peaceful reunification of China seems to be dwindling. What is your view? [Lien] I have said many times that people across the strait are, fundamentally speaking, compatriots and siblings related by blood and flesh. There are no deep seated hatred or absolute irreconcilability between people of the two sides. What we are trying to do today is to create for the entire Chinese nation a free, stable, and prosperous future. Such a basic standpoint is accepted by all. We can look forward to the nation's future, including unification. As a matter of fact, a politician's life is short, but a nation's life is forever. I believe cross-strait relations should not be based on the ideas of a life-or-death struggle, or on the big consuming the small, or suffocating the other side at every turn. This would not be unification but annexation. A unification should be the merging of two to work together for the development of the nation. The present Chinese Communist leader should, while he still commands tremendous authority, make a historic decision with a historical vision and lofty sentiments. That would be positive to the development of the nation. [Correspondent] You have been premier for almost a year. Can you tell us the policies you are most and least satisfied with? [Lien] In the past year, myself and the heads of the various ministries have worked in unity and devoted ourselves to public service. We have worked very hard to implement administrative renovation and economic rejuvenation. All these policies involve fundamental and structural issues. We do our best to reach a consensus. I have had the office for just 11 months. These policies were announced only last June or July. They have been implemented for a short time. However, all the signs indicate that all these policies are moving efficiently toward their goals and targets. We have also done a great deal of work with regard to public security, environmental protection, agriculture, communications, and so forth. Administrative departments always want to accelerate the pace of implementation. We hope that legislative organs will support us by enacting relevant laws. When the laws are in place, administrative departments will be able to take bold and resolute actions to implement them. The Cabinet Will Be Partly Reshuffled After the Lunar New Year; the Question of Candidates Cannot Be Determined Now [Correspondent] The "Chiao-Tang talks" somehow show that the higher the level of talks, the greater the efficiency. Communist China apparently wants to upgrade the talks. What are your views on this development and what are our future policy directions? [Lien] In my opinion, the five joint agreements reached during last year's "Ku-Wang talks" should be implemented quickly. Regrettably, no progress was made on implementation after that, whether during the talks in Amoy, Peiking, or Taipei. I am very doubtful that this problem can be solved by upgrading the talks. Basically, I think crucial problems remain between the two sides. We must patiently solve fishing disputes and the problem of repatriating airplane hijackers and illegal immigrants across the Taiwan Strait. I have a demand, though: We should proceed while maintaining the nation's basic positions. As for matters other than those affecting our basic positions, we can make readjustments or adopt a flexible approach. [Correspondent] Recently, there have been many reports that the cabinet may be partially reshuffled. Can you explain or clarify the matter? [Lien] As I said before, everybody has been serving the country faithfully, contributing wholeheartedly, and remaining on good terms in the 11 months since I began serving in the cabinet. However, a few colleagues will not be able to continue their service for personal reasons or for reasons of family. I think we will make proper readjustments after the Lunar New Year. As for candidates, since the Law on Provincial and County Autonomy, the Law on Autonomy for Cities Directly Under the Central Government, and the Law on Election and Recall have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation after Executive Yuan approval, we will hold gubernatorial and mayoral elections toward year's end if the legislative process is completed by the end of June. Perhaps there is a lot of guesswork out there. I do not think we can make specific decisions before the legislative process is completed. [Correspondent] Judging by the property declarations filed by public servants, we understand that you have 17 types of stocks. The Executive Yuan has decided to collect a capital gains tax. Since some other government leaders also possess stocks, will this policy of collecting a capital gain tax affect the stock market or even smack of serving one's own interests? Will this lead to a situation where the "referee is also the ball player"? [Lien] With regard to the stock transaction and capital gains taxes, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution in 1992 in which it urged the government to make a decision at the earliest possible date. After hearing a briefing on the Finance Ministry's bill of amendments and the opinions of other ministries and commissions, the Executive Yuan concluded that the collection of such taxes would mark progress in terms of tax revenue, fairness in taxation, and simplified auditing and taxation procedures. It held discussions and adopted the bill accordingly. A rapidly developing country will inevitably incur several problems in implementing financial, taxation, banking, land, and housing policies; and timely reviews of those policies are in order. Nevertheless, the government's policies are primarily based on national development and the interests of all people. [Correspondent] The Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan appeared to be on very harmonious terms during the past year. What do you think were the reasons? Was it because of institutional or individual factors? Since direct presidential elections are the main purpose of the third round of constitutional reforms, how do you think the duties of the president and the premier should be divided after the introduction of popular elections of the president? [Lien] The duties of the president and the premier are specified in very explicit terms in our Constitution. Because the president is the head of state, his guidance and leadership should be respected, especially on major national security policies such as foreign affairs, national defense, and mainland policies. During the past year, the Executive Yuan implemented many policies after they were discussed and assembled at high levels of the government. Constitutional reforms will temporarily come to an end. The National Assembly will meet in April to decide on outstanding constitutional matters. In my opinion, what happens to the presidential duties will depend on how such duties are designed. Direct presidential elections will lead to presidential systems in some countries, but the presidents of some countries are still not responsible for actual administrative duties despite the introduction of direct presidential elections. Our constitutional system is based on the division of power among five branches. The best way is to introduce necessary amendments to this system. I believe that experiences and precedents in constitutional rule over the past 40 years will serve as a guide in the future. [Correspondent] Lawmakers from the Kuomintang recently urged the government to allocate lawmakers' shares of budget funds for infrastructure construction. What are your views on this proposal? [Lien] I used to serve in local government. My basic position is that the government does allocate some part of its annual budget for local construction projects. For example, the provincial government has different budget plans, such as those for local construction projects and for coordinating local needs. These are all for the benefit of local construction. People's representatives may make suggestions. Relevant ministries and commissions will give full consideration to these suggestions and decide whether they fit into the overall plan. This is our basic approach. It was how things stood during the three years I was with the provincial government. Suggestions made by people's representatives should be considered in order of importance and urgency. The right to decide whether or not to adopt those suggestions rests with the executive branch because it will be responsible for implementing budget plans and spending in the future. We Have Conducted an Overview of Malpractices in Arms Purchases; We Will Focus on Tightening Budgetary Control [Correspondent] Yin Ching-feng's murder has revealed many problems regarding arms purchases. Do government departments have overall plans for reforming the practice of buying weapons? [Lien] The problems with our arms purchases have caused widespread concern. Relevant departments have made timely reports in this regard. The Defense Ministry and other relevant units have begun to conduct an overview of problems stemming from purchasing malpractices. An arms purchase improvement package will be unveiled in the near future. We will focus on tightening control over budget utilization and on eliminating thorny problems in the process. However, we can only say this much because the Yin case has entered the judicial and investigative stage. The government will draw lessons and gain experience from this incident, and it will study the best methods for bringing about improvements. [Correspondent] Along with presidential election methods, the premier's countersigning right is also one of the main subjects of the third round of constitutional reforms. You once said that the National Assembly's decisions on constitutional reforms should be respected. Aside from deferring to the National Assembly's opinions, do you think the premier's countersigning right should be readjusted? And how should we readjust it? [Lien] I think the premier's countersigning right could and should be readjusted because it is indeed unreasonable in some respects. For example, the premier still has to countersign decrees that affect him personally, as well as personnel matters involving administrative officers over which the National Assembly has already exercised its right of consent. It is all the more unreasonable when formality requires the premier to countersign the appointments of civil servants at the grass-roots level, although he does not know whose appointment he is countersigning because there are thousands of them. While the premier should have the right of countersigning things, this right should be clearly defined, either by outlining matters requiring his countersignature or by eliminating those that do not require his countersignature. The right of countersigning things should not extend without limits, as it does now. We should be able to readjust it. [Correspondent] In the 1995 administrative guidelines you submitted to the Legislative Yuan, you described this year as crucial for bridging the past and the future. You expressed your hopes that Taiwan would take an active part in international activities or bid for hosting international events. Do you have concrete plans for realizing these hopes? Also, there has been a steady stream of criticisms against our country for engaging in "checkbook diplomacy" at a time when it is actively expanding its niche in the international community. What are your views on these criticisms? [Lien] This matter involves several issues. Only a few of the international conferences we plan to host this year are of an official nature due to our country's status. However, we can host many nongovernmental international events. For example, the International Rotary Club's plan to hold a large-scale event in Taipei, to be attended by 30,000 people, will afford us excellent opportunities because participants will be given to understand the ROC's progress. Other international events include our bid for hosting the East Asian Games and the Asian Games. However, these events require the host cities to undertake some obligations in advance, and the central government is prepared to cooperate fully. For this reason, most of our national construction plans concern the construction of sports facilities. With regard to so-called "checkbook diplomacy," Minister Chien has made our stand very clear over the past few days: Our approach toward developing bilateral relations is based on the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and reciprocity. Criticism by people outside the government that the latter is engaging in "checkbook diplomacy" is very unfair. In reality, economic, agricultural, and technical cooperation is our bargaining chip for expanding our diplomatic activities. This is something all countries can do openly. Why do people not criticize what the Chinese Communists do? Our situation is already difficult enough. I feel great sympathy for Foreign Minister Chien and his subordinates. They are really working hard, and people should encourage them.
