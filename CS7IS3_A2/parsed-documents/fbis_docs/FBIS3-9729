The first conference on the agreement is expected to be held in May, based on the preparatory work. Csoti said a condition for the successful conference is that representatives of the Hungarian national minorities living in the different countries be present at the talks. The politician said no decision can be reached about the minorities without them. Csoti noted with regret that, contrary to the expectations, no positive changes have come about in Romania and the related recommendations of the Council of Europe were not fulfilled. He said it is distressing that no commemorations were heard in Romanian legislature in Hungarian to mark March 15, the Hungarian national day, the anniversary of the outbreak of the 1848-49 revolution and freedom fight. Csoti said the senior political forces in Bucharest rely on extreme nationalist, chauvinistic parties.
