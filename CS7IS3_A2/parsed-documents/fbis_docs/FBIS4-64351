The League leader very much wanted this meeting to take place, but it was long delayed, and the event was characterized by a tone of political detente. This evening Bossi returns to Rome to negotiate the composition of the next government and related guarantees with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [National Alliance leader] Fini. Bossi is offering himself as guarantor of the rights of the opposition within the majority coalition. On the basis of such a role, he is planning to win a major success in the negotiations: the granting to the League of the Interior Ministry, a key position for averting public disturbances. [Passalacqua] Mr. Bossi, how did you feel 25 April amid the catcalls and insults? [Bossi] On the way there I knew how things would turn out. On the one hand, there was the anger and dissatisfaction of those who lost the elections and who were reacting because they were dissatisfied, and, on the other, there was a kind of appeal, a love-hate relationship. [Passalacqua] That is your interpretation of the insults.... [Bossi] What other meaning could there be to their shouts of "traitor" if not hatred and love? For me that rally was a political experience. [Passalacqua] What is the status of the League after 25 April? [Bossi] The League is the same as before, a movement of the common people. Certainly not a right-wing movement, a center movement. The League constitutes the reformist part within the pole for freedom. [Passalacqua] Is this the message that you intended to convey by attending the rally? [Bossi] I wanted to indicate that the League believes in the principle of freedom, even when it is a historical memory. [Passalacqua] But politically.... [Bossi] We stressed the substantial difference that exists between the League and the other political forces that comprise the pole, which must govern because it won the elections -- because this country must have a government. We attended the rally, accepting all the dynamics that can occur in such a great rally, in a celebration which has always been managed by the Left and in which people saw the League joining the defense of the battle that we waged against the system of party domination, as a battle similar in kind to that waged by the partisans. [Passalacqua] Was it a provocation, in the best sense of the word? [Bossi] We participated in the event. But some people felt provoked: It was not our intention to provoke, but people perceived our presence almost as something sacrilegious. But how did people respond? With both love and hatred, because everyone knows that the League is not fascist. [Passalacqua] Some people interpret both your attendance at the rally and your debate with Occhetto as the start of a flirtation between the League and the Left. [Bossi] We are experiencing a situation in which things are unclear. We have a first-past-the-post electoral system which tends to divide the political spectrum into two poles. But the fact is that it is impossible to divide it into two, even if this is what the election results say: The first-past-the-post system should exclude the losers from a whole range of opportunities which were hitherto shared among all the parties, in accordance with the rationale of consociation. It is not easy to move onto something new; there is no magic wand. To say, "Winner takes all," could be dangerous because those who are excluded could take politics into the streets. A confrontation could result, if mediation proved impossible or if no willingness were displayed to perform at least some mediation in parliament. [Passalacqua] So this is the League's new role. [Bossi] The capacity for mediation and centrality; in other words, to democratize the Right, and to liberalize the Left. [Passalacqua] Speaking with Occhetto, you stressed the League's role as guarantor and mediator with respect to the progressive opposition. Is there a rapprochement. [Bossi] It was a public explanation, an important explanation. We had not spoken for three or four months. And I also consider it important that we were there at the rally while Fini was in church and Berlusconi was at home. [Passalacqua] Occhetto explicitly asked you to provide a guarantee of democracy for the opposition forces with regard to your role within the majority. [Bossi] We must talk not in terms of spoils sharing, but in terms of areas -- for instance, with regard to RAI [state radio and television service], the Anti-Mafia Committee, and the watchdog committees. The danger of the opposition's being nullified is normal in countries where the first-past-the-post system is established; here it is not normal. [Passalacqua] What inviolable barriers are there with respect to your allies? [Bossi] With regard to the National Alliance, we say "no" to any resurgence of fascism. [Passalacqua] What about the next prime minister? [Bossi] It is impossible to accept the idea of a prime minister that at the time of the establishment of the new government assigns himself a temporary role as interior minister: That reminds me of Benito Mussolini. [Passalacqua] So is the first barrier the Interior Ministry? [Bossi] It is certainly the most delicate issue at present. [Passalacqua] What if Forza Italia and the National Alliance do not accept your suggestion of a League member as interior minister, as guarantor and mediator with respect to the opposition forces. What will happen then? [Bossi] Why do you want to make me fight right away? I say that they will have to give me clear and convincing explanations. It is an important issue and deserves immediate attention. The alternative is to separate local government from the Interior Ministry. But it is Berlusconi's powers that are the real problem. [Passalacqua] Powers even outside the government, such as his role as a businessman.... [Bossi] I do not say that a businessman cannot engage in politics, but I do emphasize with regret that there is no antimonopoly law in this country. [Passalacqua] Is this the watchdog that is being discussed? [Bossi] But who will monitor the watchdog? It is the ordinary judiciary that can constitute the sole guarantor. The real guarantee is for the League to control certain ministries -- the Treasury Ministry, which holds the purse strings, and the Interior Ministry. This is the political guarantee; the other is the monopolies committee. [Passalacqua] What can you say about the Mediobanca [Financial Credit Bank] affair? [Bossi] I am worried: Mediobanca is one of the country's masters.
