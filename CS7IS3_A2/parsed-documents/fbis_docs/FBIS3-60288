Demin under the rubric "Ecology": "Burning Gold"] [Text] This is how V. Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection and natural resources of Russia, described the issue of garbage disposal in Russia and specifically in the Moscow region at a press conference devoted to ecological problems in our country held yesterday at the House of the Russian Press. In the words of Viktor Ivanovich, in developed European countries household waste is sorted and either recycled or burned. In our country, everything is burned without distinction, producing smoke which does nothing to improve the ecological situation in the country. Millions of rubles go up in smoke. This happens because there are neither specialists in sorting waste nor special plants. On the whole, the ecological situation in Russia is critical, but for now nothing can be done about it: In a country with a sick economy, the environment will also suffer. Mr. Danilov-Danilyan stated that inspectors of the environmental protection inspectorate are frequently unable to even assess fines against enterprises: They run to billions, and enterprises may go bankrupt, leaving hundreds of thousands of people out on the street. Meanwhile, Russia has only 16,000 ecology specialists.
