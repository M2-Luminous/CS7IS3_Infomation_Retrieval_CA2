Lage arrived in Venezuela from Brazil, where he met with President Itamar Franco and other government officials, political leaders, and local businessmen. Venezuelan media have reported that Caldera has the intention of maintaining good relations with Cuba. In Caracas, Lage will also meet with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli, who aspires to become secretary general of the Organization of American States and who has recently declared that he favors the reintegration of Cuba into that Panamerican association. Another important meeting that Lage will hold during his brief stay in Venezuela will be with the directorate of the Petroleos enterprise to examine the possibilities of resuming the triangular oil trade that existed between Caracas, Moscow, and Havana. In statements to the press in Rio de Janeiro, prior to his departure for Caracas, Lage pointed out that every day the United States is more isolated in its policy of blockade against Cuba. He added that an example of this is the passage of resolutions against Washington's economic retaliations against Havana by the UN General Assembly for two consecutive years. Today, Lage will travel to Colombia on an official visit.
