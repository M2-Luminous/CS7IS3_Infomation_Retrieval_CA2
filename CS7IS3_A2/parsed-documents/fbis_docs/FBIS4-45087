Benjamin: "Foreign Policy in the Nehru Era"; quotation marks as published] [Text] Today (May 27) the nation observes the 30th anniversary of the passing away of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru's life and work cannot be studied in isolation. It is an integral part of the Gandhian era. Gandhi and Nehru guided the destiny of India during the turbulent days of the freedom struggle. They represented different facets of a giant nation awakening from a long slumber. Gandhiji stressed the spiritual nature of man, while Nehru emphasised unity within the family of man. Their ideals and endeavours were never in conflict; they were complementary to each other. From this heritage flow the ideals of democracy, socialism and secularism and a foreign policy of peace and non-alignment. It is rare in history that there is almost total identification between a political figure and a certain policy. The idea of non-alignment free from power blocs, as distinct from the earlier concept of neutrality or the later pejorative phrase `neutralism,' is associated both in its origin and its evolution with Jawaharlal Nehru. He anticipated the needs of the newly-independent countries of a world dominated by very powerful systems. Because of the nature of the Indian national movement and his personal ability to articulate embryonic ideas, Nehru was able to champion the cause of non-alignment in a most attractive manner. The origins of the Indian policy of non-alignment have been faithfully recorded in the speeches of Nehru and the documents of the Indian National Congress throughout the Thirties. A study of these documents proves how inevitable the policy of non-alignment was after India became independent. There was no doubt, from the very beginning, in Nehru's mind that the essence of independence lay in the ability of the new Indian State to take decisions free from any external influence. He realised that while in internationalism economic relations have to be built, those relations should not in any way take on a character which would condition our political outlook and our foreign policy. Nehru was totally opposed to any kind of economic co-operation that offended either the dignity or the prospects of independence. That was his definition or understanding of non-alignment in international affairs. It was not as though he sat one morning and found out a phrase. As he said: "Foreign policies grow, they will not come out of a box or anything of that kind. Non-alignment, in brief words, is simply the expression of national independence in the sphere of international relations. An independent country has to remain non-aligned. A powerful country seeks allies...., but a country like ours which wants to be independent internally. It is for us to realise that smaller nations, newer nations, who are non-aligned, have also their ideas of independence." Nehru realised and recognised that India had "no particular mission in this world, in the sense, of trying to tell other people what to do. But at the same time, she had the mission of playing an equal, responsible and significant part in the destinies of the world as any other; and, on account of our size, on account of our importance, to do it as well as possible." Nehru was the first statesman of the world to recognise the significance of Africa and he was one of those people who anticipated that in far shorter time than even optimists dared to hope that the great continent of Africa would become free. In 1954, India was the first country to come forward and ask for a standstill agreement in regard to the nuclear bomb. Nehru knew that the stopping of these tests did not mean much. He knew all about its effects not only on his generation but generations to come. Long before non-alignment figured in the international affairs circuit in the mid-Fifties, India had become visibly active in world affairs. The call for an Asian Relations Conference a few months before the actual transfer of power was daring for a government which was yet to find its feet. Nevertheless, it reflected the irrepressible urge of the first country to have broken out of the colonial yoke, to play a purposeful role in international affairs. More specifically, the government-level conference on Indonesia that Nehru called in Delhi in 1949 bears testimony to his interest, urge and determination that independent India should be active in international affairs. It is not necessary to go into a detailed study of all the steps in the evolution of Nehru's foreign policy, but the decision to remain in the Commonwealth, the active diplomatic initiatives in Korea and Indo-China and championing the cause of Egypt during the Suez crisis are memorable milestones. Synchronised with these developments, was the continuous process of the development of Afro Asian personality which had its roots in the Asian Relations Conference and culminated in Bandung in 1955. The success of Nehru's policy was due to his cool realistic reassessment of India's own limited ability to contribute effectively to solutions of problems. Inflated rhetoric without any serious intention to translate words into reality was repugnant to Nehru's mind. An important feature of India's foreign policy during Nehru's time was that the Government's effort to inform and enlighten the people on international issues. In the early period of Indian independence, Nehru impressed upon the people that great as India had been in the past and hoped to be in the future, we could not exist in isolation as it would be good neither for us nor for the rest of the humanity without which we could not live.
