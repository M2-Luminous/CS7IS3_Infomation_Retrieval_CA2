China regards Kim's intentions as a virtual rejection. The same source analyzes that China's invitation was rejected because the DPRK is wary of the possibility that, if the issue should be resolved following Kim's visit, it would give the impression that North Korea had responded to persuasion, thereby giving credit to China. The "rejection" of Kim's visit indicates not only that North Korea is strongly aware of ROK President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China, but that there is a limit to China's influence on North Korea. A party delegation that visited Pyongyang late last month extended an invitation to President Kim to visit to China, and Chinese newspapers have reported this invitation -- aimed at promoting an exchange of views on such issues as reform and opening up policies. Since the two countries are known for their close relationship, it was unusual for China to officially announce the extension of such an invitation. This fact indicates that China is very enthusiastic about Kim's visit. Subsequently, however, China studied North Korean moves with caution, and reached the conclusion that North Korea feels: "The president's visit to China before resolution of the issue would probably indicate subjection to Chinese pressure and thereby give credit to China." In a recent interview, Chiense Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said: "There is no schedule for a visit in the near future." At a recent special council session of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), China abstained from voting on reentrusting the UN Security Council with the authority on settling the nuclear arms development issue. At a similar session held last year, China voted "against" the proposal. The change in its position can be taken to be pressure imposed on North Korea. China also clearly indicated opposition to sanctions by maintaining: "If the international community should decide to impose economic sanctions, there is a possibility that North Korea will risk its survival by attacking the ROK." Thus, it can be noted that China is having difficulties tackling the North Korean issue. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated on 28 March: "Since North Korea is a sovereign state, a foreign country should not instruct it to do this or that," and "even if we should try to persuade North Korea, there is a limit." In making these remarks, the spokesman must have kept these facts in mind.
