FBIS4-13766 "drnes079_r_94002" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 24 Apr 1994 India Rioting Reported in Tibetan Settlement Rioting Reported in Tibetan Settlement BK2404122194 Hong Kong AFP in English 0955 GMT 24 Apr 94 BK2404122194 Hong Kong AFP English BFN [Text] New Delhi, April 24 (AFP) -- The Tibetan settlement of Dharamsala in northern India was calm Sunday [24 April], but tension remained after the death of an Indian in a street fight triggered a burst of rioting, reports said here. The Dalai Lama's government-in-exile issued an appeal to the residents of the hill town to maintain "peace and calm during this period of tension," a spokesman for the Tibetan spiritual leader's office in New Delhi said Sunday. Tibetan refugees were urged not to retaliate against "acts of violence from anyone" and the Indians in Dharamsala were asked to help restore the traditional goodwill between the two communities. Tibetan property, including some exile government offices, a hospital and library, were damaged and about a dozen people injured when angry Indian residents armed with bricks and sticks went on the rampage Friday. The attacks were sparked by the death of a 20-year-old Indian youth in a knife fight Thursday night with a Tibetan refugee, who also was injured and hospitalised. Police reinforcements have reached Dharamsala, where the authorities imposed a ban on public protests in response to a Tibetan request for additional security, the spokesman for the Dalai Lama's office said. "Our information is that it is now calm and quiet, but there is some tension still," the spokesman said, adding that Indian leaders in the region had expressed their regret over the rioting. He said the incident which sparked the riots was an altercation between two individuals and "no one should take steps which will result in communal tension." Dharamsala has been home to the Dalai Lama and the seat of his government-in-exile since he fled Tibet in 1959 following an abortive anti-Chinese uprising. India is home to about 100,000 Tibetan exiles. The Tibetan spiritual leader is now on a visit to the United States and expected to return May 1. His government-in-exile used Sunday's statement to express Tibetan gratitude to India for "coming to our help at this critical period in our history." "Tibet and India have had close spiritual and cultural ties for centuries," the statement said. "The Dalai Lama has always been reminding our people that the relationship between India and Tibet is that of a teacher and a disciple."
