SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Scientific Reassessment of Dioxin In April 1991, EPA announced that it would conduct a scientific reassessment of the health risks of exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetracholorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD) and chemically similar compounds collectively known as dioxin. The EPA has undertaken this task in response to emerging scientific knowledge of the biological, human health, and environmental effects of dioxin. Significant advances have occurred in the scientific understanding of mechanisms of dioxin toxicity, of the carcinogenic and other adverse health effects of dioxin in people, of the pathways to human exposure, and of the toxic effects of dioxin to the environment. The reassessment is part of the Agency's goals to improve the research and science base and to incorporate improved research and science into EPA decisions. History In 1985 and 1988, the Agency prepared assessments of the human health risks from environmental exposures to dioxin. Also, in 1988, a draft exposure document was prepared that presented procedures for conducting site-specific exposure assessments to dioxin-like compounds. These assessments were reviewed by the Agency's Science Advisory Board (SAB). At the time of the 1988 assessments, there was general agreement within the scientific community that there could be a substantial improvement over the existing approach to analyzing dose response, but there was no consensus as to a more biologically defensible methodology. The Agency was asked to explore the development of such a method. The Agency's reassessment activities are in response to this request. Stages in the Reassessment Process That Have Been Completed The EPA had endeavored to make each phase of the reassessment of dioxin an open and participatory effort. On November 15, 1991, and April 28, 1992, public meetings were held to discuss the Agency's plans and activities for the reassessment, to hear and receive public comments and reviews of the proposed plans, and to receive any current, scientifically relevant information. In the Fall of 1992, the Agency convened two peer-review workshops to review draft documents related to EPA's scientific reassessment of the health effects of dioxin. The first workshop was held September 10 and 11, 1992, to review a draft exposure assessment titled, Estimating Exposures to Dioxin-Like Compounds. The second workshop was held September 22-25, 1992, to review eight chapters of a future draft Health Assessment Document for 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD) and Related Compounds. Peer-reviewers were also asked to identify issues to be incorporated into the risk characterization, which was under development. In the Fall of 1993, a third peer-review workshop was held on September 7 and 8, to review a draft of the revised and expanded Epidemiology and Human Data Chapter, which also would be part of the future health assessment document. The revised chapter provided an evaluation of the scientific quality and strength of the epidemiology data in the evaluation of toxic health effects, both cancer and noncancer, from exposure to dioxin, with an emphasis on the specific congener, 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Prior to each workshop, the draft documents or chapters were made available in keeping with the Agency's continuing commitment to conduct the reassessment of dioxin in an open and participatory manner, to keep the public informed of its progress, and to encourage public participation in the document development process. The public also was invited to attend the workshops, to present oral comments, and/or to submit written comments. At each workshop, a panel of scientific experts from outside the Agency reviewed the draft documents and provided valuable comments. It also should be noted that outside scientists have been heavily involved throughout the developmental process of writing and reviewing these draft documents. With this notice, the External Review Drafts of both draft documents are being released for a 120-day public review and comment period. Current Stage of the Scientific Reassessment of Dioxin The scientific reassessment of dioxin consists of five activities: 1. Update and revision of the health assessment document for dioxin. 2. Laboratory research in support of the dose-response model. 3. Development of a biologically based dose-response model for dioxin. 4. Update and revision of the dioxin exposure assessment document. 5. Research to characterize ecological risks in aquatic ecosystems. The first four activities have resulted in two draft documents (the health assessment document and exposure document) for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds. These companion documents, which form the basis for the Agency's reassessment of dioxin, have been used in the development of the risk characterization chapter that follows the health assessment (Chapter 9, Volume III). The process for developing these documents consisted of three phases which are outlined in later paragraphs. The fifth activity, which is in progress at EPA's Environmental Research Laboratory in Duluth, Minnesota, involves characterizing ecological risks in aquatic ecosystems from exposure to dioxins. Research efforts are focused on the study of organisms in aquatic food webs to identify the effects of dioxin exposure that are likely to result in significant population impacts. A report titled, Interim Report on Data and Methods for the Assessment of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo- p -Dioxin (TCDD) Risks to Aquatic Organisms and Associated Wildlife (EPA/600/R&hyph;93/055), was published in April 1993. This report will serve as a background document for assessing dioxin-related ecological risks. Ultimately, these data will support the development of aquatic life criteria which will aid in the implementation of the Clean Water Act. As mentioned previously, completion of the health assessment and exposure documents involves three phases: Phase 1 involved drafting state-of-the-science chapters and a dose-response model for the health assessment document, expanding the exposure document to address dioxin related compounds, and conducting peer-review workshops by panels of experts. This phase has been completed. Phase 2, preparation of the risk characterization, began during the September 1992 workshops with discussions by the peer-review panels and formulation of points to be carried forward into the risk characterization. Following the September 1993 workshop, this work was completed and was incorporated as Chapter 9 (Volume III) of the draft health assessment document. This phase has been completed. Phase 3 is currently underway. It includes making External Review Drafts of both the health assessment document and the exposure document available for public review and comment. Next Stages in the Reassessment Process As described previously, public briefings will be held during the first week of the public comment period to be followed by formal public hearings in December 1994. After the close of the public comment period, the Agency's Science Advisory Board (SAB) will review the draft documents in public session (early 1995). Following SAB review, the draft documents will be revised, comments and revisions will be incorporated, and final documents will be issued. Dated: August 30, 1994. Carl R. Gerber, Acting Assistant Administrator for Research and Development. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22442 Filed 9&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P&hyph;M
