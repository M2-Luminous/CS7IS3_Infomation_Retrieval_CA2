This was the first time in the past 15 years that gold sales to the State decreased, said Cui Dewen, Vice Director of the Gold Bureau under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. State regulations stipulate that all gold produced in the country must be sold to the People's Bank of China. Although gold purchased by the central bank fell drastically last year gold output was higher than in 1992 said Ai Dacheng, also Vice- Director of the Gold Bureau. A considerable amount of gold produced in the country was illegally sold on the black market at higher market prices, Cui and Ai said. The central bank's purchase price for gold is roughly half the international market price. During the first five months of last year, gold sales to the State fell 57 per cent over the same period of the previous year. To reverse the trend, the government raised the purchase price from 1,697 yuan ($195) per ounce to 2,986 yuan ($343) last September. The government pledged that the new purchase price, about 10 per cent lower than price on the London gold market, will fluctuate with the London gold price. In September, a record amount of gold was sold to the State. But the price of gold has remained at 2,986 yuan ($343) per ounce since September 1, while the price in the London gold market has climbed from $375 to $390 per ounce. The gap has attracted gold producers back to the black markets. Cui attributed the problem to weak management of the gold industry. Last year, the gold bureau went from being an independent unit under the State Council to a part of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. With poor supervision, many individuals and units were able to illegally mine gold. And Cui said he is not optimistic about the situation changing this year. The country's gold producers will be the hardest hit by the new taxation system that took effect on January 1, he said.
