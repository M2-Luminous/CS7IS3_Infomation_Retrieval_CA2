[Al-Jifri] Following the creation of a political balance, and after the declaration of the DRY [Democratic Republic of Yemen], the people's morale was lifted. Before this, they used to think the regime would continue as it is. However, when the people realized that this regime is for all citizens and that it is defending a just cause, and that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih intended to move the battle into their territory, their morale was lifted, and many of the DRY citizens began to go to the battlefield. Many of them are now receiving good training and we will send them to the battlefield in groups. We did not wish for this, because we are against fighting. However, when we are forced, we should confront them and our stands must be strong and clear. We are advocates of unity, but they have forced us to establish the DRY as a result of their arrogance and crudeness. I am sure that the sons of the DRY can check this arrogance. [Shihab] You have spoken about measures that are being taken to reinforce your steadfastness. What are the precautionary measures taken to prevent the northern troops' advance toward Aden? [Al-Jifri] The pillars of steadfastness have always been the same throughout history; the will, men, and capabilities. We have all this. We have the will to defend what is right, which gives us greater strength than the other side, even though the majority is with the other party. [Shihab] When you say that you will not go back to unity until a regime which understands unity takes over, do you mean that there will be no dialogue with the regime in Sanaa? [Al-Jifri] There is only room for talks with the current regime in Sanaa on one point; namely, on a cease-fire and on the withdrawal of its forces to where they came from. However, if wise people come from Sanaa to stop this madness, our hearts and minds will be open to them. [Shihab] Do you believe that it is possible to topple the regime in Sanaa at the current stage? [Al-Jifri] I am sure of this, because our people in the neighboring republic have faith in unity and in modernization. They have suffered from injustice, and have realized that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's actions have led to secession, destruction, and fighting. I do not think that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will remain in power after this. [Shihab] Who was convinced of secession from among the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] members? [Al-Jifri] Brother President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who enjoys sound experience and clear vision. Other members have continued to look for other alternatives. [passage omitted] [Shihab] Are you confident that you will be able to restore the southern areas that have been occupied? [Al-Jifri] One hundred percent. We will restore them either peacefully or by force.
