The Education Ministry also announced it will no longer accept applications for mainland artists to perform in Taiwan. MAC Vice Chairman Su Chi said resumption of cross-strait cultural and educational activities will depend on how Beijing responds to a mysterious boat fire in Mainland China in which 24 Taiwan tourists died. Some of the activities affected by the suspensions include a planned visit by a mainland printing industry group and a delegation of presidents from ten Chinese medicine institutes. A trip to the mainland by members of Taiwan's mass media will also be cancelled. Meanwhile, Taipei Association of Travel Agents President Hsu Chin-jui said the MAC will announce an all-out travel boycott against Mainland China within one or two days. Hsu said the travel association will cooperate with the boycott and urged all other travel agents to join.
