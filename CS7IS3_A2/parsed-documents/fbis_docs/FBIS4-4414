"I feel sorry for failing to publicly discuss the amendment in advance," he said. Testifying at the National Assembly Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Committee, the minister said the lack of its advance public discussion was due to a "strategic need" to prepare against verification by other countries. Minister Kim also said he now thinks that if a little more efforts had been made, the country would have gained some more. He said there are no secret agreements the government made with any specific parties. "The so-called behind-the-scene agreement with the United States refers to the mere letters exchanged by the two countries' ambassadors to guarantee the implementation of what have already been agreed to," Kim said.
