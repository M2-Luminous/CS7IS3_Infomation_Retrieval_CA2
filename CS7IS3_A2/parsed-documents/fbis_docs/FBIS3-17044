This calls for working out new principles of a world order in which both developed and developing countries are interested, according to President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who presented his vision of the world process to an audience at the British Institute of International Relations on Wednesday. The world process is now passing through a crisis following the collapse of the former socialist system, Nazarbayev said. He said the development of the post-Soviet space was determined by two tendencies. On the one hand, national states continue to take shape, and on the other these new independent states tend towards integration within the Commonwealth of Independent States. From the Kazakh leader's viewpoint, time is now ripe for reforming the commonwealth with a view to creating a belt of stability and security in the region and upgrading the degree of predictability of its political evolution. A renovated commonwealth will then be able to play a stabilizing role in averting or regulating possible conflicts in the region after creating collective peacekeeping forces. This would in turn strengthen substantially the system of global security, Nazarbayev predicted. Kazakhstan, jointly with other commonwealth countries and first of all with Russia, is already contributing to the process. "We consider ourselves to be part of Central Asia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, but we are also aware of our responsibility for the preservation of stability and security in the entire region," the president stressed. "In analyzing processes underway in our country, one should not cherish the illusion that we are ready to draw exclusively on the system of values worked out in the West. Kazakhstan, just as the other commonwealth countries, is passing through a stage of transition, and the world must understand that this stage is characterized by a lengthy evolution of all institutes, first of all political. The collapse of a totalitarian system does not automatically lead to a market economy and a full-scale democracy. We have to effect modernization in society and the state," the president said. Kazakhstan is one of the few former Soviet republics in which stability has prevailed in recent years, which enables it to confidently pursue its economic reform course, Nazarbayev said. The recent elections to the parliament and local governments undoubtedly were a success of Kazakhstan's nascent democracy, he said. Many countries and international financial organisations have commented on the substantial headway made by Kazakhstan in its switch to a market economy, and its commitment to large-scale privatisation, reforms and macro-economic stabilization, Nazarbayev recalled. Speaking about priorities in his country's foreign policy President Nazarbayev pointed to three basic factors. The first one is that Kazakhstan last year joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -- an historic step because the republic voluntarily assumed the obligation to eliminate all nuclear weapons on its territory. Another factor is Kazakhstan's geopolitical position which makes it necessary for the country to stick to a multi-polar foreign political orientation. Nazarbayev said his country is prepared to become a centre for strengthening security on the Asian continent. This problem has acquired a huge significance in the region which is plagued by numerous armed conflicts and ranks second after Europe in concentration of armed forces and nuclear arms. Nazarbayev reminded his audience that he had proposed in the United Nations a plan for the gradual creation of a single collective security system for Asia. The first step in this direction can be made by convening a conference on interaction and confidence-building in Asia, similar to the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The president said that one of the basic tasks in the foreign political sphere is "the creation of a belt of confidence and good-neighborliness" along the entire perimeter of Kazakhstan. The third factor is connected with membership of the Commonwealth of Independent States. "I was and remain a supporter of historically-shaped relations of friendship, cooperation and mutual understanding, which have been linking our peoples through the centuries of our common history", he stressed. Kazakhstan consistently supports the idea of economic integration within the commonwealth, but there can be no question about a return to the past since each republic made its final and irrevocable choice in favour of their sovereign development. The Commonwealth of Independent States is not a state in itself, not a national entity but a natural mechanism of regional interaction in the present conditions. "We rely first of all on the development of age- old traditional ties with Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzia, Turkmenia and Tajikistan and attach the greatest significance to cooperation with Russia," the president stressed. The system of global responsibility calls for a policy aimed at reducing the number of nuclear powers and ensuring regional stability based on reasonable compromise and consensus. This is a policy Kazakhstan is committed to, Nazarbayev said.
