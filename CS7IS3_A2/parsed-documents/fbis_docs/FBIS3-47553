At the end of the discussion, they affirmed their intention to work to pass the bills without revising such key portions of the bills as the constituency unit for the proportional representation system and the distribution of the fixed number of seats between single-seat constituency seats and proportional representation seats. The government and ruling parties believe that the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is seeking a joint revision of key portions of the bills with the ruling parties after giving up its filibuster in the upper house, and the government and ruling parties view the LDP's moves as an attempt to buy time. The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has vehemently opposed amending the bills, and the government and ruling parties are believed to have decided not to amend the bills after concluding that respecting the SDPJ's opposition to amending the bills is indispensable for their passage in the Diet. The ruling parties, which decided on 10 January to hold public hearings on 19 January which are a prerequisite for adopting the bills in the special committee on political reform of the House of Councillors, intend to pass the bills at a plenary session of the House of Councillors. The ruling parties plan to amend such nonkey portions as the "3-percent clause," which bans political parties with less than 3 percent of the total vote from receiving seats in the Diet, and the clause that lifts a ban on house-to-house campaigning by candidates. The bills are set to be forwarded to the lower house for their passage during the current Diet session after being amended in the upper house. The government and ruling parties have taken the position that if the LDP cooperates with deliberations of the bills in the upper house, they will comply with any LDP call for a certain amendment of the bills. The LDP decided on 7 January that if it reaches an agreement with the ruling parties on amending the key portions, it would will the passage of the bills in the Diet. The LDP's decision has created a situation wherein the ruling parties are forced to come up with ways to deal with the opposition party's decision. Some LDP members are asserting that: 1) The government-introduced bill sets the constituency unit for the proportional representation system as a nationwide unit but that the constituency unit should be divided into about 10 constituency blocs; and 2) The distribution of the fixed number of seats between single-seat-constituency seats and proportional-representation seats is set at 280 and 274 seats, respectively, but that the distribution should be revised. What the ruling parties are loath to accept is any demand for an amendment which provides for certain regulations which would permit the continuation of political contributions by businesses and organizations. The SDPJ has strongly argued that "if the clause is amended, we will have no choice but to leave the coalition government." Conclusions drawn by the ruling parties are that it is necessary to win a full guarantee from the LDP that the LDP will support the passage of the bills in the Diet if they go along with the LDP's demand for an amendment to the key portions, and that if they brush aside the SDPJ's resistance without such a guarantee from the LDP, this would endanger the passage of the bills. It has been observed that there would be little room for both the ruling and opposition parties to reach a compromise unless the LDP takes a clear-cut stand of supporting the bills after drafting compromise proposals acceptable to the ruling parties and deciding on them. It has also been observed that in the present situation, it is highly risky for the ruling parties to promote a quick deal with the LDP on amending the key portions in a way that might cause a change to the framework of the coalition.
