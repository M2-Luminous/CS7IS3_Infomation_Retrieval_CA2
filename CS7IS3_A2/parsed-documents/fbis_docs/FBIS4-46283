In his Friday sermon, which he delivered at Imam al-Rida Mosque in B'ir al-'Abd [southern suburb of Beirut], Fadlallah said: Our brother al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani was kidnapped on the night of 'Id al-Adha. When we study this issue, we find it is a victory for Israel over all the various forces on the ground. There were political, security, and military gaps. We have discovered something about this country as far as the mentality of the government. This government does not respect its people. This government is not prepared to forgo its comfort and look after the citizen's interests. [passage omitted] We must think quietly how to respond. You know that the resistance's arm is long. The enemy foreign minister said that Israel's arm is long. When Israel assassinated Sayyid 'Abbas al- Musawi, the strugglers taught him that their arm reached Israel in Argentina. The battle is as big as the world and as long as the length of time. We will work with all responsibility as Muslim strugglers all over the world. Fadlallah said that Israel did not only kidnap al-Dirani, it also kidnapped every Lebanese citizen. It kidnapped the state, the government, and the people.
