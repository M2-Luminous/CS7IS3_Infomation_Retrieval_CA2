This legislation, which is expected to be approved by the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. President Clinton, will ban arms sales and the offer of any U.S. military services or advice to any Arab state that tries to convince U.S. companies to comply with the Arab boycott of Israel. This U.S. bill is the latest in a series of measures that seek to eventually end the Arab boycott of the Zionist entity and to intimidate states and companies that comply with this boycott. Republican Senator Hank Brown claims the continued Arab boycott of this entity harms the efforts to establish peace in the Middle East. However, the contrary is true. This is because the new U.S. legislation is designed to protect Israel against the effects of this boycott and shows full bias toward this entity. It encourages the Zionist entity to persist in rejecting UN Security Council resolutions and continuing the policy of settlement building, repression, and torture against our people in occupied Palestine. The Arab economic boycott of the enemy was and still is a necessary measure to protect pan-Arab security against this entity that was planted by the colonialist West in the heart of our Arab homeland to implement and protect the West's policies and to act as its racist, aggressive base against our Arab nation. Any talk about ending the boycott of Israeli harms the Arab nation's vital interests. Its danger stems from the fact that it will lead to relinquishing and ceding the pan-Arab constants governing the conflict with the Zionist entity. Therefore, the U.S. legislation and insistence on passing it in the wake of Arab concessions in the course of the Arab-Zionist conflict ultimately aims at shattering these constants, represented by the boycott and its pan-Arab justifications, in a bid to impose capitulation on the Arab nation in accordance with racist Zionist concepts. Despite the attempts by the United States and its "Israeli" ally to expand the circle of capitulation and to expedite the political settlement process, all signs indicate that failure and a dead end is awaiting them because of the arrogance of the racist Zionists and the encouragement of the United states, which cares about nothing but its interests. Any talk about a just, honorable, and comprehensive peace to restore Arab rights and territories is nothing but an illusion, something which is being proved by events. As shown by the epic of the Mother of Battles and its great objectives, the Arab nation's only option is to stick to pan-Arab constants, the unity of their destiny, rejection of foreign hegemony, refusal to yield to intimidation and the policy of imposing the status quo, resisting all forms of extortion and containment, and insisting on self-reliance to epitomize the Arab nation's unity and protect its pan-Arab security against any penetration. What has been taking place in Iraq since its militant confrontation against the U.S.-Atlantic-Zionist military aggression and the subsequent hostile chapters genuinely expresses the Arab nation's spirit rejecting capitulation and aspiring for a prosperous future. The outcome of the Mother of Battles has begun to concern those seeking to impose custodianship on our nation and to implant despair in our souls. Therefore, they are anxiously attempting to contain this light coming out from the land of Mesopotamia to reach all the free ones in our nation and the world.
