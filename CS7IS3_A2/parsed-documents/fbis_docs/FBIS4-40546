FBIS4-40546 "drsov117_a_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-117 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Obstacles to Signing EU Document Removed Obstacles to Signing EU Document Removed PM1706083194 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 16 Jun 94 p 2 PM1706083194 Moscow IZVESTIYA Russian BFN [Report by Aleksey Portanskiy: "Last Obstacle to Russia-EU Agreement Removed"] [Text] The announcement of the fact that President Boris Yeltsin will be setting off 24 June for the Greek island of Corfu to sign a partnership and cooperation agreement between Russia and the EU was made to Russians with reference to the Greek deputy foreign minister, who revealed the news in Luxembourg Tuesday. The report was couched in the affirmative -- not "intends to come," but "will come." The most interesting point is that at the time of the Greek deputy minister's speech nobody in the Russian leadership, including delegation heads at the talks with the EU or even Boris Nikolayevich himself, could officially state that the Russian president would be flying to Corfu -- although everything was headed in that direction. There are indeed no points at issue in the text of the partnership agreement, and intensive technical work to prepare it for signing is currently under way. The other day Boris Yeltsin voiced the intention to sign this important document, but only in the event of its being utterly complete. I would recall that the Russian Federation president was invited to sign this agreement a year ago in Copenhagen, but the ceremony did not go ahead because we were dissatisfied with the quality of the agreement. Moscow is right to announce that Boris Yeltsin will be flying to sign the partnership agreement, at least after having examined and confirmed the draft at a government session which has not yet been held. Otherwise, we would have a situation where EU ministers had held their own council of ministers session, as arranged, and given the green light to the signing of the document with Russia and would have automatically nodded through a similar decision on Moscow's behalf -- even though, I would repeat, Russia is striving to move to a new level of relations with its West European partners no less than the EU is. Also on Tuesday in Luxembourg President Leonid Kravchuk signed the partnership agreement between Ukraine and the EU. Ukraine has thus become the first CIS republic to sign such a document with the EU, which is something to celebrate and to sincerely congratulate our Commonwealth neighbors [sosedyam] on. At the same time, this has allowed certain observers both here and abroad to talk about some kind of advantageous position for Kiev in obtaining a specific result in relations with West Europe. In actual fact, although Russia-EU and Ukraine-EU relations are similar, there are also some quite fundamental differences between them. From the economic standpoint Ukraine is still seen by the countries of the "12" as the same as the former Union -- that is, as a state with a centralized economy. On the contrary, Russia is recognized as having the status of a country with a transitional type of economy, which has rejected a state-controlled trading system. The Ukrainian document does not have a provision on trade in uranium, whereas in the Russian document it has been a stumbling block in the final stage. For the EU the last obstacle to an agreement with Russia is being removed as a result of the signing by President Yeltsin the other day of an edict restoring the rights of five West European banks in Russia.
