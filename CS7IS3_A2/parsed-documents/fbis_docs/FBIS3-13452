FBIS3-13452 "drnes050_o_94004" FBIS-NES-94-050 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 SYRIA `Complete' Peace for `Comprehensive' Withdrawal Urged JN1403154394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 14 Mar 94 JN1403154394 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Before leaving for the United States, and in a new deceptive move, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin announced that two extremist settler organizations in the occupied territories had been banned. The criminal murderer Baruch Goldstein, who committed the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, belonged to one of these organizations. In fact, this measure will not convince anyone. The Zionist settlers are still in the heart of Hebron provoking Arab citizens. They were joined a few days ago by more extremists. Rabin has refused to evacuate them from the city despite demands made by some Israeli ministers. He also refused to touch the settlements or discuss their future within the framework of the self-rule talks. What is even more serious is the fact that Rabin is still holding contacts with the Zionist extremist movement, Tzomet, to make it join the government. The leader of that movement, former General Rafa'el Etan, is well known for his racist tendencies, hatred against the Arabs, and calls for expelling them by force from their homes and annexing the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Israel. Rabin's government should have taken measures to restore confidence to the Washington talks, such as announcing its readiness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories in return for peace and taking decisive deterrent measures against the settlers. Israel has done nothing of the sort. The Israeli Government has only disarmed two settlers and has not uttered one word on the future of the occupied territories. If we review recent events we can see the extent of the Israeli officials' deception. In only one month, more than 30 people were killed by Israeli Army fire in the occupied territories. South Lebanon was the target of the most severe and savage land and air bombardment. As for the two Zionist organizations, Kakh and Kahana, whose activities were banned by Rabin, they have committed several crimes in the occupied territories in the past years. Rabin's ban is not different from his pledge not to use the U.S. loans for settlement activities. He allocated a large share of these loans -- some $500 million, according to the U.S. State Department -- to expand the settlements and arm the settlers and attract them with money and free housing to live in the occupied territories and terrorize the Arab citizens. Restoring confidence to the Arab-Israeli talks can only be achieved through a public announcement by Rabin of his readiness to withdraw from the occupied territories and implement UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. Syria has always spoken about its readiness for a complete peace in return for a comprehensive withdrawal. Has Rabin, or any other Israeli official, uttered the words "complete peace?" The Arabs have not heard this yet. What they heard from the Israelis in Washington and outside Washington was an endless series of security pretexts, as if Israel's security can only be realized by murdering and humiliating Arabs, confiscating their land and property, and expelling them from their homes. The Middle East peace has its basic prerequisites which cannot be tampered with or avoided, foremost of which is recognition of the Arab rights and withdrawal from the occupied territories. The Palestinian people have the right to enjoy freedom and dignity like all others peoples in the world. Lebanon also has the right to regain its southern part and its citizens in the south have the right to live a tranquil and peaceful life free from the daily Israeli bombardment. Syria has the right to regain the Golan Heights and the evacuees have the right to return to their homes and property. These are the conditions for peace. Certainly, there can be no peace without meeting these conditions. Syria, along with all Arabs, is yearning for a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East that would allow regional states to develop their economic and developmental resources and provide prosperity and well-being to their peoples. Such a peace cannot be built while the Israeli threat is still standing, while the Israeli aggression continues, and while the Israeli expansionism drags out as a daily fact and a criminal practice. Peace runs counter to aggression, expansionism, and settlement activities. Aggression, expansionism, and settlement activities run counter to the principles of the world community.
