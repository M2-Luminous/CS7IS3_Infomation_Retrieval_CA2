The amendments increase income by Ls18.15 million and expenditures by Ls21.44 million. The accepted amendments are connected mainly with children's benefits. Ls17.39 million have been earmarked for this purpose. Other big expenses (Ls4.8 million) are granted for the increase in the wages of the employees of state security institutions -- in the Ministries of Defense and Home Affairs, as well as in Home Guards and the Security Service. Part of the expenses are connected with the increase in the minimum wage from Ls15 to 22.5, adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers. Colleges will receive an additional Ls220,000; health protection -- Ls201,000. Additional funds are allocated for orphanages, and centers for social aid and rehabilitation, but at the same time, funds are reduced for homes for the elderly and disabled, as well as for boarding-schools for disabled youth. At the same time, there are plans to increase the budget by Ls9.18 million, preserving the same tax tariffs, but not foreseeing any reduced rates in this field. The government expects to gain Ls565,000 from the social tax payments, because the minimum wage has been raised and the minimum amount of tax-free duties has been reduced. It also expects to acquire Ls2.95 million from the budgets of towns and regions, and Ls5.44 million from the joint stock company "Lata International" credit, and credit interest. The Ls41.2 million growth of the state internal debt is connected with the Latvian Savings Bank and Latvian Universal Bank rehabilitation program. As State Budget Minister Janis Platais reported, government securities are to be issued in the amount of Ls57.5 million, which will be deposited in these banks. Simultaneously, the state internal debt, in the amount of Ls23.4 million, connected with the savings of the population, existing in the Savings Bank but not covered by assets, (the so-called lost Moscow assets, which until now have not been officially settled) is to be reduced. The government securities are supposed to yield a profit, and both banks will be able to recover, J. Platais said. The state budget minister also said that the funds assigned for the rehabilitation of both banks will be returned to the state budget. The part of the state funds connected with the servicing of bad credits will be allotted to the banks on condition that the bad credits are repaid. In that case, the bank will keep 15 percent of the amount of the credit at its disposal, while 85 percent will be used to cancel the government securities. The parliament accepted a total reduction of budget expenditures of Ls553.000, and an increase in expenses of Ls520,000. The cost of implementing the law on civil service, reform of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, and training of the State Reform Ministry clerks was reduced. As a result, additional funds were gained by State Land Service, cultural institutions, Central Elections Commission, Saeima, and the car service of the Saeima.
