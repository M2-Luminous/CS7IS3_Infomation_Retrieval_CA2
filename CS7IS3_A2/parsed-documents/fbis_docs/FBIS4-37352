The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from Tehran, Khorramabad, Urmia, and Khorramshahr gave preagenda speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 'Abbas Shibani, Deputy From Tehran The commands in the Koran and the speeches of the saints are not merely sermons. We ourselves must first act. The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Shibani, deputy from Tehran. During his speech he said: Instead of a preagenda speech, I wanted to observe 10 minutes of silence. Perhaps this silence will be more expressive than my inexpressive remarks. I have admired the president of the republic for more than 35 years, and I have been obedient to the leader since before the Islamic revolution. Continuing, the speaker added: Before anything else, I advise myself to be pious, for that is needed now more than at any other time. We are on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Imam's death. We were unable to recognize that unique gentleman's concern for supporting Islam, the revolution, and the deprived and oppressed people, and we did not act on his advice in accordance with our duty to do so. Continuing, Shibani said: Our old father, our Imam, and our leader, said that the people are our benefactors, but unfortunately our unsuitable performance has disappointed them in us and our revolution. Wasn't it his eternal cry to the people and especially to the officials, not to forget the greatest jihad, which is struggle with the base self? The deputy from Tehran said that if the Imam was able to stand up against the superpowers, it was because he was master of himself. He said: If we do not see this ability in ourselves, it is because we are prisoners of our base selves. Continuing, Shibani also added: Wasn't it Gandhi, the leader of the Indian people, who stood up to the English imperialists and said: I will wear my own handwoven burlap clothing, and I will not submit to the humiliation of using foreign goods? The speaker discussed the fact that we consider ourselves Shiites and the nation of this Imam (peace be upon His Holiness 'Ali). He said: Now the latest machinery and various kinds of foreign food and beverages are abundant in this land, and every year our indebtedness to others increases. Shibani discussed the fact that as the managers of the Islamic government, we need first to develop ourselves. He said: What I am saying is that we should not treat the commands in the Koran and the speeches of the saints merely as sermons. We ourselves must first act. My purpose in making the request I made and am making of the president of the republic and that has been approved by the leader that he hold morality classes for me was that these matters be promoted so that the people will know what has been said to us and to what extent we have acted upon it. Shibani added: Of course, I have a lifetime behind me and I do not have that much hope of reforming myself. My hopes are in the young generation and the Majles, so that we can review what has happened and change our procedures and policies. The speaker asked that more attention be given to the reconstruction of Abadan and Khorramshahr. With regard to price controls, he said: Without Majles approval, no sector in the government or its companies has the right to increase prices, and the judiciary must help with this matter. If someone says this cannot be done, I say it can. Give me the authority and I will do it myself. Nonessential expenditures must be avoided, purchases must be made with care. There are many hospitals throughout the country whose return is no more than 20 percent. Instead of building new hospitals, let them equip these hospitals so that they can better answer to the needs of the people. He discussed moral and cultural decadence. He said: You must first think of bread before you can promote faith. Do not fear satellites and antennas. You must train us in such a way that we will not use videos, television, and harmful programming. At the end of his speech, the speaker asked the minister of cooperatives to try to consolidate consumer cooperatives in order to provide the people with goods at lower prices. Akbar Farid, Deputy From Khorramabad I recommend that officials investigate the results of seminars, meetings, and guidelines without advance notification. The next speaker was Farid, deputy from Khorramabad. In his speech he offered condolences on the anniversary of the martyrdom of the Iranian pilgrims to the House of God. With reference to the geographic position of the province of Lorestan, he said: This province, with all its characteristics, which are known to all, is at the top of the national deprivation table. Its deprivation is striking in all areas, including roads, education, industry, and classroom space, and the deprivation is more evident in the province's central municipality than it is in the other municipalities. He added: The city's main streets are in poor condition and full of unemployed individuals, the old alleyways have not been improved, the entry and exit routes have not been widened, and due to their makeup these things show the deprivation all the more. The deprivation is such that its dimensions in this city have been confirmed by all the dear ones who have been in this city and its environs. The deprivation in our city and province has a historical precedent, which revolves around the commitment, religious belief, honesty, and bravery of the people of this region. The deputy from Khorramabad then discussed the struggles of the children of Lor. He said: After Reza Khan came to dominate the Lorestan region with thousands of tricks, plots, and deceptions, due to his fear of the children of Lor and the fact that he did not want the battles of Lorestan to have a name in the management system, with the help of his English bosses and their theorists he converted the tribal and religious values in Lorestan to antivalues, and turned the fate of the province of Lorestan over to a thousand families outside the province on the insulting grounds that the children of Lorestan are unable to be responsible for their own affairs because of their tribal and ethnic makeup. He added: With the triumph of the Islamic revolution led by His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him), the palace of oppression and despotism collapsed, the disgraceful ring of idolatry was defeated and the talents of the children of Lor flourished. A group found its way into the nation's universities and graduated with high-specialist degrees in various sciences. By order of the great Imam, a group also went to the war fronts of truth against falsehood to defend the gains of the revolution and the Islamic homeland. He said that one of the factors in the success of a manager is understanding the work setting and the surrounding environment. He said: There are some schools of thought in management that say we should leave the administrative center and go to the cities, districts, and villages where special disruptions and malfunctions are sensed in administrative affairs, and this itself has weaknesses and vulnerabilities. In the cities, this mostly takes the form of coordination between the government and nongovernment offices. He continued: Sometimes, to obtain a small loan, a government client goes from municipality to Tehran and back four or five times on dangerous roads at heavy expense and is ultimately faced with a rejection. Sometimes it is seen that an official is improperly assigned to a task because of his relationship with a deputy minister or a manager, without study or consideration of the relation between job and worker. After a short time he does things that not only cause him to be reprimanded, but also bring others into question. This takes on a different dimension and appearance under the influence of opportunists, whose numbers are not small. I recommend, to study and monitor the issues and to alleviate the existing problems and difficulties, that we make unannounced and unofficial appearances at official gatherings, even wearing disguises if possible, in order to pursue the guidelines and results of their seminars and meetings and to see how they are being implemented in the cities and villages and where the work problems are. Farid discussed the parliamentary aides. He said: One of the duties of these dear ones is to convey the information and logical requests of the deputies, which arise from the problems of the people, to the ministers, deputy ministers and organizations under the ministries. Some of the dear ones, willingly or not, fall short in transferring information intended to solve problems. Nosrat Samadzadeh, Deputy From Urmia The third preagenda speaker was Samadzadeh, deputy from Urmia. During his speech he said: The experts have regarded the goal of economic adjustment and eliminating subsidies as being to direct capital and currency in circulation into the producing sectors and arriving at true prices. It was their belief that after the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan current capabilities and quality would increase, and that consequently the prices of goods would drop. He added: During the plan, with a study of the market we see that the prices of goods and services increased by the day and sometimes by the hour, disturbing the people. The reasons are: (1) The lack of executive guarantees in the policies of the plan and the lack of financial regulations in the government, the government's failure to intervene in the market for goods needed by the people, and the failure to control prices. (2) The banking facilities given to the government and private sector companies to invest were not spent on the goal, the percentage of currency in circulation increased and consequently the government, instead of guiding capital into production and definite activity, created a thriving market for gold and currency speculators and drove the nation's interests out of the production sector into trade. (3) The economy was not properly evaluated, and due to the unstable policy making in the economy, part of the country's labor capability was wasted. The Five-Year Plan must specify the productivity of investment. Finally, the consumption model was not in accordance with incomes. (4) More than 80 percent of the foreign exchange revenues were obtained from oil exports, and because of the conditions in world markets, the anticipated prices were not implemented and likewise there was no specific procedure for collecting taxes under the Five-Year Plan. (5) The lack of public participation in setting priorities, especially in national projects. Since the Islamic government is founded on the commands of religion and the votes of the public, and His Holiness the Imam gave special importance to public participation and today the exalted leader also emphasizes this important matter, therefore the people are the main ones setting the policy for the nation's executive organizations. He added: Unfortunately, the National Planning and Economic Policy Council deals with statistics and numbers. (6) The First Five-Year Plan only had the goal of growth. No attention was given to investment procedures aimed at procuring social justice and alleviating deprivation. In studying the Second Five-Year Plan, in addition to goals, attention must be given to assessment of the First Five-Year Plan and to the objections to it. In short, policy making, planning, investing, and even managing must be such that all the nation's high ability will be used, so we will ultimately, in the near future, be able to follow the exalted leader's guidance and get away from a one-product economy dependent on oil, which is the only way of salvation in order to reach true independence for the nation of the Islamic Republic. The deputy from Urmia asked the president of the republic to think about the measures necessary to deal with the rising waters of Lake Urmia. He continued: Due to the lack of agriculture and industry, the province of West Azarbaijan is deprived of huge national credits. The speaker added: The Technical College and Urmia University as the only support for technical manpower training in the region, must receive special attention in order to develop the West Azarbaijan region. The current problems, such as equipping laboratories and factories, must be solved. In conclusion, the deputy from Urmia congratulated sports officials on the province of West Azarbaijan volley ball team's victory. Yunes Mohammadi, Deputy From Khorramshahr During the last 14 years the Majles has passed good laws, but it has acted weakly in the area of oversight. The final preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session was Mohammadi, deputy from Khorramshahr. During his speech, in connection with 3 Khordad [24 May] he discussed the anniversary of the liberation of Khorramshahr. He said: Khorramshahr is not just a city, it is a model and a symbol. It is a model of the power, greatness, and grandeur of the proud Muslim nation of Iran. With the liberation of Khorramshahr the enemies of Iran were politically and militarily demoralized. Today also, in commemorating this great day, we are teaching the lessons of moral heroism and courage to our children and we are reminding our enemies of the noble nation of Iran's steadfastness, sacrifice and courage. He discussed 7 Khordad [28 May], the anniversary of the establishment of the Majles, the manifestation of the justice of 'Ali (peace be upon him). He said: The Majles must act in such a way that it will realize the desires and hopes of the late Imam, for the Imam said: "the Majles is at the head of affairs." He continued: The Majles is also a bird with two wings, making laws and oversight. During the last 14 years the Majles has passed good laws, but it has acted weakly in the area of oversight. The Majles is the home of the nation and it must show this nation's determination, steadfastness, and greatness. Governments must always follow the Majles, and the Majles must not allow individuals, willingly or unwillingly, to abstain from acting on the law. The speaker then discussed 14 Khordad [4 June], the anniversary of the death of the great Imam. He said: We must all keep the Imam's memory alive in our hearts forever. We must protect with our good work this sacred government, which is his trust, like a valuable trust. Recently the president of the republic said that the policies of the enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran are to make the people of Iran lose hope and to despair, and to keep them from continuing on their path. The deputy from Khorramshahr then discussed the that fact that pessimism and despair grow like a dangerous bacteria in a place where it is possible for them to develop. He said: We must destroy the circumstances and factors that cause pessimism to grow. In my view the following factors create the possibility for the growth of pessimism and despair: (1) The nation's failure to recognize the government's services; (2) the nation's lack of awareness of the great problems that surround our government; and (3) the nation's failure to understand the nation's revenue situation. He continued: Perhaps the people think the government has so much financial capability that it can meet all their expectations, but it is not this way. We have great problems with regard to revenues and the people must become aware of them. (4) The failure to recognize the domestic and foreign enemies who act in various domestic and foreign dimensions, in various ways and in various political, military, moral and economic dimensions, and sometimes disguised as friends. (5) The government's failure to deal decisively with the enemies of the system. In this regard, he added: Those who are damaging the system in order to accumulate wealth and think only of their own interests especially have created this market situation, and moment by moment the prices of goods and services are going up without any reason. This is causing severe suffering among the people and has created circumstances to make the people pessimistic. Continuing, the speaker added: The people are saying that a government that has stood up to America, the hypocrites, Saddam, and tens of domestic and foreign enemies can also defeat these economic enemies. The people want decisive government supervision in the market. At the end of his speech the deputy from Khorramshahr called for the alleviation of the economic problems in his electoral district. He said: Bandar-e Khorramshahr must be a protected port or it must be declared a free trade zone so this city can prosper. Legislation Majles Amends Law on Abortion Enacted by the Interests Discernment Council Amendment Approved for Motion To Establish Files for Registered Appeals Without a Record Motion To Establish Files for Registered Appeals Without a Record The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission concerning the Motion To Establish Files for Registered Appeals Without a Record or Whose Protests Have Been Lost by the Judicial Authorities (returned from the Guardian Council), and the above amendment was approved. Article 1 as amended: As of the date of this law's enactment, with regard to appeals concerning the principle or boundaries of property, which are sent to the relevant judicial authorities under Articles 16 and 20 of the Registry Law by the end of the year 1360 [20 March 1982] or which for any reason do not have an appeals record with the judicial authorities, the appellants or their legal representatives may, within no more than six months after the date this law goes into force, submit their appeals along with the necessary documents to the competent court. They must obtain the necessary affidavit to this effect and submit it to the registry office at the place where the property is located. If they do not file during this period and if there is no excuse justified under religious law, the appeal will be considered rejected. Iran-Russia-Finland International Shipping Agreement The second item on the agenda was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill on the International Highway Shipping Agreement between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government of the Federation of Russia (returned from the Guardian Council), for which the commission's amendment was approved by the deputies. Amendment to Article 13, Paragraph 3, on the last line: will either be taken out of service under the supervision of the appropriate customs officials (the meaning of "taken out of service" is "turned away"), or will be given at no charge to the customs officials of the aforementioned side. The third item on the agenda was the report from the Housing and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill on the International Highway Shipping Agreement between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Government of the Republic of Finland (returned from the Guardian Council), which was approved by the deputies. Bill on the Uniform Retirement Pensions System The next item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs Commission concerning the Bill on the Uniform Retirement and Obligatory Service Pensions System, the general form of which was approved by a decisive majority of the deputies. Rashidi, the commission's expert, said concerning this: The basic issue was that the retirement wages were not appropriate for the periods before and after service, and government employees were truly disturbed by the arrival of the time for retirement and even fled from it. The time they were to retire was the time their children were entering the universities, the time their children were getting married and other things, and therefore the drop in their wages disrupted their lives. He then added: The ceiling on retirement pensions is about 18,150 tumans, and those with academic credentials have specific ceilings. Henceforth, however, retirees will receive pensions in view of their years of service and their academic credentials. Rashidi emphasized: Likewise, those who are already retired will have their payment ceilings raised under this law. Law Amending Abortion Rules The fifth item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission concerning the Motion To Amend Note 6 of the Abortion Rules Amendment Law enacted 8/28/1371 [19 November 1992] by the Interests Discernment Council, the general form of which was approved. The amendment to Note 6 states: "During a divorce requested by the wife demanding compensation for work that was not her responsibility under religious law, the court will first seek to meet the wife's demands through reconciliation, and if reconciliation fails, if conditions are set on financial matters in the marriage contract or the contract for dissolution, the court will act in accordance with that. Otherwise, whenever the divorce is requested by the wife and also if the request for the divorce does not arise from the wife's violation of her duties as a spouse or her bad morality and behavior, the court will act as follows: A) If the wife has done tasks that were not her responsibility under religious law at the husband's order or without the intention of the work being voluntary, and if this is proven to the court, the court will calculate the equivalent value and order its payment before issuing the divorce decree. B) In cases other than the one in Paragraph A, in view of the number of years of communal life and the types of jobs the wife has done in the husband's home and the husband's financial situation, the court will designate for the wife a sum as a forgiveness (evacuation) amount for the wife. It is worth mentioning that Paragraph A was added in the measure enacted by the Interests Discernment Council, and in the Majles motion the vote was taken after that paragraph was amended and Paragraph B was added. It is worth mentioning that Mr. Mohammad 'Ali Movahedi-Kermani said in a constitutional memorandum: If the Majles wants to enact a motion or a bill, it must be within the limits of religious law and the Constitution. Enactments by the Interests Discernment Council is above this. This means that the Interests Discernment Council may approve a measure based on interests and it may even be outside the bounds of religious law and the Constitution. Can the Majles change a measure enacted by the Interests Discernment Council? This issue was studied in the Interests Discernment Council, and the gentlemen in the Guardian Council specified precisely that the Majles may not make this change. Mr. Nateq-Nuri said in answer: This issue you are raising was discussed in the Interests Discernment Council, and no measure was adopted with regard to it. We also believe that the gentlemen in the Guardian Council must ultimately issue an opinion. Then Mr. Shibani gave a speech. He said: Our poor performance has disappointed the people in the us and the revolution. Then the speaker of the Majles, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, said: Of course, whenever Mr. Shibani speaks, he is clearly either concerned, passionate or sincere, but sometimes his language is harsh, and that is also sincere. He should modify his comment that the people are all disappointed now. He himself does not even believe that the people have become disappointed in this way, he is just saying that they should be more careful. Measures by Majles Commissions Amendment to Bill on Independence of Judicial Attorney's Society Paragraph "J" of the aforementioned article is amended as follows: In addition to being members for one term in the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission, Majles deputies must have a judicial bachelor's degree or at least four years experience teaching specialist classes in the law colleges or a certificate of completion of high-level studies from the Qom Seminary or five years judicial trial experience. Continuing below is Note 2, under which the society is required within six months to make a decision about requesting a certificate of on-the-job training or parliamentary membership. Bill on Organizations, Duties, and Elections in the National Islamic Councils and Mayoral Elections Article 5 of this bill states: A council will be formed in each village with a majority of its members chosen from among the chosen representatives of the councils of the rural areas within the village limits, and if a member presented by the rural council for full membership is elected for membership in the village council, he will not cease to be a member of the rural council. This bill was approved in the National Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission with five sections and 103 articles. Bill To Add Iran to the Agreement Between Member Nations of the Islamic Conference Organization To Support Guaranteed Investments Based on Article 2, Section 2 of this bill, the parties to the agreement will authorize in accordance with their own laws the transfer of capital and its use among the countries and within their own domains in authorized areas of activity. The investments made must have sufficient support and security and the host country must provide the necessary facilities and incentives for the investors actively working in its territory. The aforementioned bill was approved in the Joint Economic and Financial Affairs and Cooperatives Commission.
