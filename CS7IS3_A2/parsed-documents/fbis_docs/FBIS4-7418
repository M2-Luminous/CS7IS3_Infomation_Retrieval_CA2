FBIS4-7418 "dreas083_d_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 South Korea Assembly Fails To Approve Prime Minister 28 Apr Assembly Fails To Approve Prime Minister 28 Apr SK2904003594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0021 GMT 29 Apr 94 SK2904003594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly failed to approve the newly appointed prime minister Thursday, the last day of the extraordinary session, but decided to extend the session by one day to try again. At 11:15 p.m. Thursday, Speaker Yi Man-sop tabled a motion on approving the presidential appointment of Yi Yong-tok as prime minister and an opposition proposal that all members of the cabinet resign, but the plenary session could not vote because of an opposition filibuster. With eight minutes left until the session's official adjournment at 11:52 p.m., the speaker acted on an opposition Democratic Party motion and extended the session by one day. The National Assembly, hindered by disagreement between the ruling and opposition parties, could not break the current impasse as it refused to approve the new prime minister unless plans for parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal are approved at the same time. The major stumbling block for the Sangmudae plans was an opposition demand to call 51 witnesses, including former presidents and current chief executive Kim Yong-sam, to testify in the Assembly. The ruling Democratic Liberal Party opposes the motion. Another opposition proposal demanding the resignation of the entire cabinet was scrapped in accordance with the National Assembly law that calls for parliamentary action within 72 hours of a proposal. Since the Kim administration could not obtain parliamentary approval of the new prime minister, the expected appointment of Yi Yong-tok's successor as deputy prime minister and head of the National Unification Board, as well as a possible limited reshuffle of the cabinet, will likely be delayed by one day. Because of the political impasse at the National Assembly, the Kim administration has been without a cabinet administrator for one week. The ruling and opposition parties plan to continue their negotiations Friday on the Sangmudae scam investigation. If they can work out a compromise Friday, the National Assembly will vote on the new prime minister before acting on the Sangmudae scam probe plans. But the prospect of the rival parties agreeing on the Sangmudae scandal was still uncertain Friday morning. The Democratic Party wants the National Assembly to investigate the Sangmudae scam, in which the president of a construction company created a slush fund out of the proceeds of the project for moving military facilities called Sangmudae in Kwangju to the city's outskirts. The opposition party claims that part of the slush fund eventually was funnelled into the ruling party as campaign funds during the 1992 presidential election.
