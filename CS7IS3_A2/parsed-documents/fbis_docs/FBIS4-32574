The ODS's three-month decline has thus been halted (in March 32 percent would have voted for it, 31 percent in April, and 29 percent in May). This was apparent from the results of the opinion poll conducted by the Center for Empirical Research (STEM) in June among 1,500 respondents. The Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD] came second, with 13.9 percent; the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] came third, with 12.9 percent; and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] came fourth, with 6.8 percent. The Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party [KDU-CSL] (4 percent in May; 6.2 percent in June) and the Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia [SPR-RSC] (4 percent in May; 5.2 percent in June) would also cross the 5-percent threshold for election to parliament; the governing coalition Christian Democratic Party [KDS], for example, would not. The three strongest parties of the governing coalition would receive half the votes in total. It is not obvious from the poll what percentage of the vote the Party of the Democratic Left and the Left Bloc Party would receive. STEM brackets these parties with the KSCM under the name Left Bloc conglomerate [and gives them] 10.9 percent. According to STEM, 63 percent of the electorate would take part in the elections, 14 percent would not, and 23 percent still do not know. The June party rankings concur with the representative poll conducted by STEM in late May and early June, which involved almost 12,000 respondents (the newly constituted Democratic Union [DEU] would, according to it, receive 0.6 percent). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |How People Would Vote(in percent) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Apr |May |Jun | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |ODS |31 |29 |31 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CSSD |16 |14 |14 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |ODA |13 |15 |13 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KSCM |7 |7 |7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KDU-CSL |5 |4 |6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |SPR-RSC |4 |4 |5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Free Democrats |3 |3 |3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bohemian-Moravian |2 |2 |1 | |Center Party | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Greens |2 |2 |1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |KDS |1 |1 |1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |DEU | |0.5 |1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Liberal Social Un-|1 |1 |0.5 | |ion | | | | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
