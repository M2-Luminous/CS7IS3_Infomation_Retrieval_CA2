FR940216-0-00176 FR940216-0-00010 (a) Simple model per-gallon standards. The ``simple model'' standards for compliance when achieved on a per-gallon basis are as follows: Simple Model Per-Gallon Standards 1␣ 1␣ Reid vapor pressure (in pounds per square inch): Gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 1 <7.2 Gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 2 <8.1 Oxygen content (percent, by weight) ≥2.0 Toxic air pollutants emissions reduction (percent) ≥15.0 Benzene (percent, by volume) <1.00 (b) Simple model averaged standards. The ``simple model'' standards when achieved on average are as follows: Simple Model Averaged Standards 1␣ 1␣ Reid vapor pressure (in pounds per square inch): Gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 1: Standard <7.1 Per-Gallon Maximum <7.4 Gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 2: Standard <8.0 Per-Gallon Maximum <8.3 Oxygen content (percent, by weight): Standard ≥2.1 Per-Gallon Minimum ≥1.5 Toxic air pollutants emissions reduction (percent) ≥16.5 Benzene (percent, by volume): Standard <0.95 Per-Gallon Maximum <1.30 (c) Phase I complex model per gallon standards. The Phase I ``complex model'' standards for compliance when achieved on a per-gallon basis are as follows: Phase I_Complex Model Per-Gallon Standards 1␣ 1␣ VOC emissions performance reduction (percent): Gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 1 ≥35.1 Gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 2 ≥15.6 Toxic air pollutants emissions performance reduction (percent) ≥15.0 NO X emissions performance reduction (percent) ≥0.0 Oxygen content (percent, by weight) ≥2.0 Benzene (percent, by volume) <1.00 (d) Phase I complex model averaged standards. The Phase I ``complex model'' standards for compliance when achieved on average are as follows: Phase I_Complex Model Averaged Standards 1␣ 1␣ VOC emissions performance reduction (percent): Gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 1: Standard ≥36.6 Per-Gallon Minimum <32.6 Gasoline designated for VOC-Control Region 2: Standard ≥17.1 Per-Gallon Minimum ≥13.1 Toxics air pollutants emissions performance reduction (percent) ≥16.5 NO X emissions performance reduction (percent): Standard ≥1.5 Per-Gallon Minimum <^2.5 Oxygen content (percent, by weight): Standard ≥2.1 Per-Gallon Minimum ≥1.5 Benzene (percent, by volume): Standard <0.95 Per-Gallon Maximum <1.30
