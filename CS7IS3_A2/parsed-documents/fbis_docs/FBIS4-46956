The difficulty of the position of the president and government is that the executive power has only a month and a half or two months or maybe even less to prove the correctness of the acts that were adopted. If during this time there is not at least a minimal, even symbolic slow-up of inflation and the decline of production, the results of the discussion in parliament will be unpredictable." "Risk is a noble but not always an appreciated cause." Today, knowing the content of the statement of the Supreme Council which was made public by the Kazakhstan press yesterday, one can say that the risky steps of the executive power did not produce the expected results and our prediction, alas, turned out to be right, albeit with a delay of a month and a half. The refinement of the wording of a number of places in the document adopted by the Supreme Council on the evening of 27 May, which contains the agreement that there is no "alternative to the course toward in-depth reform," the desire to "reach a compromise and accord among the various political forces," and the "readiness for constructive dialogue with the president" does not change the essence. The parliament is unambiguously assessing the present results of the actions of the Cabinet of Ministers and leveling against it the serious accusation that the government is essentially blocking the declared course toward a market economy. In the opinion of the Supreme Council, this has led to "economic chaos" and therefore it expressed no confidence in the socioeconomic and legal policy of the government. Near the end of the regular round in the struggle among the various branches of power, the beginning of which was the introduction of the national currency and the disbanding of the councils, the new parliament dealt a painful blow to the president. Nor was it soothed by the decision finally adopted by the head of state to distance himself from the Cabinet of Ministers (the recent separation of the staffs of the government and the president) or by Nazarbayev's increasing criticism of members of his team, or by the activation in recent months of foreign political and foreign economic activity in a desire to win support from foreign politicians, potential investors, and international financial institutes. It would be difficult to hope for any other reaction from a legislator when there was an eightfold decline of the exchange rate of the tenge from the time of introduction, the permanent shutdown of not dozens but hundreds of Kazakhstan productions, a reduction of the national income since the beginning of this year as compared to the corresponding period of last 1992 by almost 40 percent, a 30-percent reduction of industrial production as compared to last year, and numerous other frightening economic minuses. And it is difficult to argue with the legislator who under these conditions has seen the only possibility of avoiding paralysis of power in dialogue among its branches and social and political forces in order to create a national program of reform and form a government capable of carrying it out. How will the president respond? He will probably not be enthusiastic about the Supreme Council's intentions to concentrate their attention on consideration of presidential edicts adopted in the absence of a legislative organ and, in the opinion of experts, containing a good number of contradictions with existing legislation, as well as on the performance of oversight functions and international treaties subject to ratification, and also the parliament's intention to legislatively limit the executive power in disposing of state property. The neutral wording of these points of the parliament's statement should not deceive the public either: It is essentially a question of a comprehensive expert evaluation and a probable change of approaches to such key areas of reform as privatization, economic integration into the world community, and the role of the state with respect to the commodity producer with all forms of property. And here it will probably be impossible to avoid significant compromises. ...Regardless of how effective the knock-down in the boxing ring may have looked, when summing up the results of the fight the judges count it as only one well-aimed blow, one point. Politics and economics are not boxing. Politics and economics for the authorities are more like an endless chess match. For society it would be preferable to have them moderated and stationary in nature. Now all the participants are in the end game. The legislator has made his move. In the end game you cannot be slow, and the president knows this. Being superstitious about predictions, we shall refrain from them, especially rash ones.
