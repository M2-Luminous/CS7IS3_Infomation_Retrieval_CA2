FBIS4-20526 "jpest008___94022" JPRS-EST-94-008 JPRS Science & Technology Europe/International Economic Competitiveness 26 April 1994 WEST EUROPE SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY POLICY EC Auditors Review ESPRIT Research Program EC Auditors Review ESPRIT Research Program BR0203095194 BR0203095194 BFN [Text] Section D seeks to promote a dynamic and open external policy. Under this heading are issues like the management of the Union's external frontier and the completion of the common commercial policy in the context of the internal market. Section E points to an ongoing process of evaluation of the strategic programme. The annual report on the internal market is considered as the principal mechanism for this. Standards Upgraded by Strategic Programme The strategic programme points to standards as being a key component in Europe's unified market, vitally important for the implementation of policy in a wide range of areas. "European standardization and conformity assessment instruments are an invaluable tool in the implementation of other policies, including environment, energy, food quality, safety at the workplace, and trans-European networks." The Commission, so as to exploit the potential contribution of European standardization to the effective functioning of the internal market, proposes: -- to undertake a review of the way in which European standardization could be financed over the medium term. This will aim to identify ways in which the resources invested by member states, the Community and the private sector in national and European standardization can be best harnessed for the purposes of developing a standardization system which meets the requirements of European integration. -- increasing transparency to ensure, for example, that a wide- ranging public enquiry takes place on the technical merit of proposals for European standards. The development of mutually agreed work programmes is another aspect of the overall approach. -- standards and research as they ensure the effectiveness of European telecommunications. Moreover, the Commission is beginning to work on the formulation of a Union quality policy which is due to be finalised by the end of 1994. JRC Future Role Mapped Out The Council adopted on 14 January the conclusions on the role of the Joint Research Centre (JRC). This reaffirms the need for the JRC to strengthen its competitive nature on the basis of a genuine customer/contractor relationship. Contributing to a Community research policy, especially in sectors where it has special, if not unique, skills and in areas where its neutrality is needed for scientific and technical support for Community policies, is recognised as important for the JRC. The Council points to the need to support new ways forward for the JRC, saying that it should "progressively enter the competitive arena, generally in networks with other laboratories, in specific programmes under the framework programmes to which it can contribute, and for activities providing scientific and technical support for Community policies of a kind suitable for that competitive approach. It emphasizes that funding decisions under the framework research programmes (1994-1998) should reflect that objective." It was agreed that the proportion of JRC activities in the framework programmes to be carried out in the competitive system should average 24 percent for the EC framework programme and 10 percent for the EAEC [European Atomic Energy Community] framework programme for the period from 1995 to 1998. The Council also agreed on a set of guidelines for defining the JRC's activities, especially regarding its contribution to the framework research programmes (1994-1998). It also wants the Commission to submit a progress report on the implementation of these conclusions to the European Parliament and the Council in 1996, involving an opinion from the Board of Governors, allowing the Council to make an assessment. The Council also asserts that "the JRC should be a driving force in improving links between research laboratories and institutes in all the Community's regions." The guidelines set out the terms and conditions under which the JRC will operate up to 1998. Regarding institutional activities, these will be entirely funded from the framework programmes. The JRC will also be involved in institutional RTD [research and technological development] activities "which contribute to the implementation of the Union's research policy." This also implies scientific and technical support in which the Directorates-General will use the JRC as a service provider. The Council permits JRC establishments to form networks with research institutes in any of the member states. They also make provision for the JRC to engage in competitive activities outside the framework programmes on behalf of third parties, including work in the context of member states' RTD programmes. The JRC will also be able to participate in other Community activity such as PHARE [Poland-Hungary Actions for Economic Reconversion], etc. Regarding budgetary provisions, the JRC will charge 100% of its costs for its involvement in competitive support activities in the framework programmes. Within the framework programmes (1994-1998), the JRC will be provided with an operational budget of an overall amount of 875 million ECUs (300 million ECUs for nuclear activities and 575 million ECUs for non-nuclear activities), which will cover the total funding of its institutional activities and, in the case of competitive activities, the costs not covered by shared-cost contracts. Within the Framework programmes will be two operational programmes for the JRC, one for nuclear and the other for non- nuclear activities. Competitive work will begin on 1 January 1995 and proceed in line with the framework programmes (1994-1998).
