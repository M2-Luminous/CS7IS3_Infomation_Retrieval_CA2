But Hata declined to comment on the timing of a top-level meeting with SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, who is under fire from rank and file members of his own party for his calls to the Hata cabinet to voluntarily resign. The SDP on Tuesday unveiled a blueprint of a potential new coalition government as agitation increases among SDP legislators to rejoin the coalition, which the party quit in April to protest the sudden formation of a parliamentary group excluding the SDP. Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition group, told reporters Wednesday morning he is not sure if the SDP is really serious about allying with the coalition once again. At a high-level meeting on Wednesday morning, the LDP confirmed that it will submit a no-confidence motion against Hata's minority government. The LDP's action is expected to come after the passage -- possibly on Thursday -- of the fiscal 1994 state budget, LDP sources said. But some LDP lawmakers have cautioned against such a step, saying a no-confidence motion would not pass in the 511-member lower house without the help of the SDP, the LDP sources said. LDP officials said Kono met former foreign minister Michio Watanabe to seek the LDP Stalwart's support for the campaign to oust the Hata cabinet from power.
