The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from Claire McGrath, Managing Director & Special Counsel, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated October 3, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). Specifically, Amendment No. 1 codifies certain provisions regarding (1) Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') review of the issuing bank or trust company and (2) minimum collateral levels. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Amex proposes to amend Exchange Rule 462 to provide for an index option escrow receipt program. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item III below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose In October 1984, the Exchange filed a proposal to amend Rule 462 to provide for the use of cash, cash equivalents, one or more qualified securities, or a combination of the foregoing, as collateral for escrow receipts issued to cover short call positions in broad-based stock index options. 4 The proposal was approved as a pilot program at each of the options exchanges and was successfully extended over the years. The Amex now seeks to join the other exchanges and make the pilot program permanent. The Amex also seeks to make conforming changes to Rule 462, so that the rule will correspond to rule language adopted by OCC 5 and the other options exchanges. 6 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22323 (August 13, 1985), 50 FR 33439.

For further discussion of the comparable amendments to Amex Rule 462, see infra notes 18&hyph;19 and accompanying text. 2. Statutory Basis The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system.
