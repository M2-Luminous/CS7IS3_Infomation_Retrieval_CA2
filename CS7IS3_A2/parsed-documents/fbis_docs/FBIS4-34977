In a news conference, the activists of the U.S. Freedom To Travel movement said that in the Clinton administration and Congress, there are those who support an end to the prohibition on visits to Cuba. They indicated that hundreds of people backed the bill and that in only one week, they collected $25,000 to make the trip after the Treasury Department's decision to freeze $43,000 of the organization's bank account. They emphasized that Freedom To Travel is composed of 50 organizations from 25 states and is committed to ending the restrictions on visiting Cuba and lifting the economic blockade. The group, which will stay on the island until 30 June, plans to visit sites of historic and social interest and meet with Cuban officials. We hope that the Freedom To Travel group will achieve its objective of changing the unjust laws with which the U.S. Government seeks to prevent visits by U.S. citizens to Cuba, Medea Benjamin, executive director of the Global Exchange Project, said in Havana. In remarks to this station, the spokesperson of the group said this second defiant action is greater than the first and that something very important has been achieved in recent months: a Congressional resolution that stipulates that the president cannot restrict the U.S. citizens' rights to travel. Medea Benjamin added that through these trips, the members of the group can confirm the Cuban people's affection and verify how irrational and unjust the U.S. policy against Cuba is. Last year, the Freedom To Travel group made its first visit to the island, and, when it returned to the United States, many of its members experienced coercive measures, such as having their passports withheld and their bank accounts frozen and even being threatened with imprisonment.
