While some blocs will have no difficulty providing the documents, a sizable number of deputies and parties have nothing to line up. One need not be surprised at a situation where, for example, the special account of "Zhirinovskiy's party" will show "zero" both in income and outgo in addition to the 50 million rubles issued by the Central Electoral Commission. Whereas the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] had to disclose this account if only to receive the government subsidy for television in the election campaign, for many deputies doing so simply made no sense. The fact is that the election regulation is only very particular about the use of special election accounts, whereas no one proscribes the use of any other accounts belonging to these persons and parties or to totally extraneous ones. This is something that virtually all blocs and deputies did. More, the extremely detailed rules on the use of special accounts envision no concrete sanctions for their violation. Therefore, neither the use of foreign sources nor the receipt of state funds to finance an election campaign can really endanger one's deputy seat thus received. However, accountants for newspapers, radio stations and, first and foremost, television have all the documents in payment for ads and air time. The content of these documents is no commercial secret or even simply confidential information. No one is preventing television and the newspapers from publishing the sizes and sources of payment of these election campaign expenses -- and thereby to fulfill their moral and civic duty since the poorly compiled election regulations leave society at sea about who finances today's people's choices.
