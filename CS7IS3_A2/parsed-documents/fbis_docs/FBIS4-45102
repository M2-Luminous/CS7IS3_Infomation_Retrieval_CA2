President Clinton also mentioned the movement in Kashmir. This was the first time in many years that a U.S. president had recognized this fact. The Indian media's hue and cry over this was natural. Since the freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir changed into an armed confrontation; Kashmiri workers, journalists, and politicians started having contacts with the outside world; Kashmir centers were established in the United States, England, Canada, and Saudi Arabia; and many "NGOs" [nongovernmental organizations] have become active, the Kashmir issue has become prevalent all over again. In this context, we cannot ignore Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's hard work. She bravely and astutely presented the Kashmir issue at all international forums and during her foreign travels. The fact that Pakistan could not present its resolution effectively in Geneva does not mean that Pakistan has adopted flexibility in its fundamental stand or the freedom struggle of Kashmiri people has weakened. Therefore, it is appropriate to say that Pakistan is still firm on its stand and the Kashmiri people are still active in the battle field. This whole exercise, which also includes India's "exercise in atrocities," has helped the whole world to at least understand that Jammu and Kashmir are not an "integral part" of India; that this is a disputed region about which the UN Security Council has passed resolutions. The Kashmiris are fighting against India's invasion and control and India is using military power to stop them and is violating human rights there. As for the United States, the Kashmiris living there have convinced the U.S. politicians, intellectuals, and journalists that India is committing bestial actions in occupied Kashmir. That is why the U.S. press, which used to publish one-sided news to do its duty to support India in the past, is also publishing some real facts. Pakistani and Kashmiri representatives have also succeeded in establishing their lobbies in the United States. Although the pro-India factions had worked hard for the last four and a half years to have Pakistan declared a "terrorist" or a "fundamentalist" nation, they were unsuccessful and the U.S. government has agreed that Pakistan is not involved in any kind of terrorism. Thus, the pro-India group in the United States including famous author Selig Harrison has been forced to admit that the present movement in occupied Kashmir is purely a people's movement against Indian occupation of Kashmir. The fact is that India has a major lobby in the United States supported by Jews. These people repeat the story that India feeds them. This Jewish group includes Stephen Solarz, William Shuazberg, James Claude, and Selig Harrison. Their job is to sing India's song all the time. The reason for this is their enmity towards Islam. If these American intellectuals see any danger after the fall of communism, then it is Islam. They are also afraid of China in Asia. Anyhow, what I am trying to say is that the efforts of Pakistanis and Kashmiris have stopped the progress of the Indian lobby and it was the result of their efforts that a group in the United States has emerged now that discusses Kashmir. Some of these condemn human rights violations, others mention other options for solving this dispute, and still others offer ways to conciliate. We cannot forget Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs Robin Raphel's role in this context. She issued several statements about the Kashmir campaign during the last few months and openly supported the idea that India should resolve this issue fully and make the UN Security Council and Shimla Agreement the basis of these efforts. India reacted to it strongly and the Indian government complained to the Unites States to take notice of Ms. Robin Raphel's statements. It is important to mention the fact that Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel went to India uninvited recently and explained her statements related to Kashmir. She emphasized that she had never challenged the idea of Kashmir joining India, and had only said that Kashmir is a disputed issue and should be resolved, and this is possible under the Shimla Agreement. Now who will ask Ms. Robin Raphel who will push India in this direction? India never started talks according to the Shimla Agreement. It has been repeatedly saying that Jammu and Kashmir are India's "integral part" and if there is a problem, then it is: when will the Line of Control accepted as a permanent border. The problem is that a faction in the United States, which is associated with the government, accepts the influence of India's propaganda and wants to sing the song of making the Line of Control the permanent border. Recently, a U.S. professor, Tom Travis, said in Peshawar that the Line of Control should be accepted as an international border. Meanwhile, U.S. Senator Dan Burton believes that the present Kashmiri campaign is a bona fide campaign and can be compared to the U.S. War of Independence. According to him, India should recognize Kashmiri people's right to self-determination. Both these points are being discussed in the United States now and the Kashmiri people have made it clear as day with their unprecedented and innumerable sacrifices that Jammu and Kashmir are not, and never will be, "integral parts" of India. However, during the last few days, especially after Mr. Talbott's return from Pakistan, the United States has become quiet about the Kashmir issue. His visit to Pakistan was declared to be successful, however, on what basis this trip called successful has not been known to us yet. One thing is clear; there was no mention of Kashmir in the joint communique. The truth is that the United States has economic relations with India and it is investing in Indian projects. Ms. Robin Raphel said in her clarification that the United States is the largest investor in India and that both nations want to encourage peace and human rights. The United States and India have the same viewpoint. Late Maulana Zaffar Ali Khan had said once, [couplet] "A drunkard who tells the truth in his drunken state is a lot better person than a religious person." The same can be said about Robin Raphel. We have been crying from the beginning that India and the United States are both together because the anti-Islamic attitude of the United States and India is not a secret to any one. The living example of this is the establishment of Israel and now India and Israel are together and the Israeli commandos are working side-by-side with Indian soldiers to crush the freedom fighters in Kashmir. This is the lobby that India created in the United States. Thus, the United States which claims to be a champion of peace and humanity all over the world, adopts double standards when it comes to dealing with Muslims. It throws its own principles out the window and puts pressure on Pakistan, some time back having asked it to roll back its nuclear program. Other times it has harassed Pakistan by accusing it of fundamentalism and terrorism. Now it is asking us to "freeze" Kashmir. This is done mostly because Pakistan is considered weak and conspiracies are afoot to isolate it in the world. All this is done because, as Ilama Iqbal said, [couplet] "The lord of fate had ordered from the beginning that punishment for the crime of being weak is sudden death." The fact is that after Talbott's visit to Pakistan, our relations with the United States have neither cooled nor warmed up. The United States wants Pakistan to roll back its nuclear program, however, Pakistan is neither willing to do so now nor will it ever agree to it. Pakistan's security and existence is tied to this problem and Pakistan's established enemy is India which is already a nuclear power and is not willing to sign the NPT. According to political observers, India will be ready to sign the NPT when it has attained its goal to forcing Pakistan to sign it. The truth is that the United States wants to make India the policeman of this region so that Pakistan does not become a major power. Pakistan's progress and prosperity will benefit the Islamic nations most and the United States wants to keep all Islamic countries as its "subordinate dependents." It wants to make Israel strong on one side and Pakistan weak on the other side. Its stand on Iran is similar and it had destroyed Iraq under this policy. The other aspect of the U.S. politics is that it does not want to provide India with a "free" atmosphere so that it does not unite with China which could confront the "new world order." Since Iran, China, and India talked about regional unity, the U.S. fears have increased. Therefore, the United States has to review its changed Kashmir policy to make India happy and sent Robin Raphel to India to further explain the position and remove Indian misunderstandings. In other words, India has blackmailed the United States to achieve its goals. Thus the defeat the United States has faced in its Kashmir policy is the result of India's pressure. It is our bad luck that we do not have a "lever" that we can use to pressure India. In this situation, we need to review Pakistan's foreign policy now.
