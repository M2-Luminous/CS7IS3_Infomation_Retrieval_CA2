Aydar indicated that the officials whom they met during their time in the United States said that the Kurdish problem cannot be solved by military methods and that they favor a political solution. During their contacts in the United States, DEP Siirt parliamentarian Zubeyir Aydar, DEP Adiyaman parliamentarian Mahmut Kilinc, and former Diyarbakir Mayor Mehdi Zana met David M. Winn, chief of the State Department's Southern Europe Desk; his future replacement John Hamilton; Nancy H. Ely Raphel [name as published], chief of the State Department's Human Rights Desk; Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee; Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Steny Hamilton Hoyer, a congressman and chairman of the CSCE Helsinki Human Rights Commission; Senator Dennis DeConcini; Congressman Bill Bray; and representatives of the American Democracy Fund, various democratic organizations, and the press. Aydar said that during their contacts they were asked questions on human rights in Turkey, the Kurdish problem, attacks on parties, the lifting of parliamentarians' immunity, and the situation in prisons and that views were exchanged. A New Approach in the State Department and Senate In referring to their talks with the State Department and Senate circles, Aydar said that, despite the fact that these circles have insufficient information on human rights and the Kurdish problem in Turkey, they have adopted a new approach. Aydar said that before the U.S. officials supported Turkey under any conditions but that they are now looking at Turkish policy with a critical eye and are particularly sensitive to the Kurdish problem. He said: "They said that the Kurdish problem cannot be solved militarily and that it must have a political solution. We felt that in the future they will give more emphasis to the Kurdish problem in their relations with Turkey. Their general approach on the Kurdish problem is that it should have a political solution within the borders of Turkey." Indicating that the main theme of their contacts was to contribute to the democratization of Turkey and a democratic solution to the Kurdish problem, Aydar said: "While we were there the pro-state press here reported that `they remained in the open, no one was interested in them or talked to them.' These were unfounded and concocted reports serving the psychological warfare. There was no truth to them. Our contacts were conducted in an extremely warm atmosphere and their results will be clearly seen in the future."
