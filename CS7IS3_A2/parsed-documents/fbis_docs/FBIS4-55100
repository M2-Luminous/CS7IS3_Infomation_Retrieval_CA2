FBIS4-55100 "dreeu090__a94011" FBIS-EEU-94-090-A Daily Report 9 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Opposition Divided on Proposal Opposition Divided on Proposal AU0905183594 Prague CTK in English 1634 GMT 9 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0905183594 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, May 9 (CTK) -- The opposition Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the Left Bloc (LB) party are opposed to the further restitution of church property, while the Bohemian-Moravian Center Party (CMSS) holds the opposite position. The Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) disagrees with the restitution of church property by an executive act, that is, by the resolution adopted by the government. The KSCM strongly disagrees with the return of any capital assets to the Catholic Church, all the more so in an executive form, KSCM spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova told CTK today. The KSCM considers such proposals a mockery of democratic principles, and demands that a real and legal full stop is immediately made to end restitutions which would at the same time put an end to endless property claims from the Church, she said. The Communists believe that a further considerable concession to the Catholic Church will likely be made by the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the government coalition, which would make possible a return of property which was put into national management after the war on the basis of the decrees directed against collaborators. "It is characteristic that the current government is more interested in claims from collaborators and their heirs than in compensating Nazi victims," Zezulkova said. The LB party rejects further property restitutions because they would wind further a "spiral of changes in ownership relations," Jaroslav Ortman, chairman of the LB deputies' group, told CTK. "Besides, nobody has ever specified the scale of property to be returned and which present owners the restitutions would concern," he said. Ortman said that the restitution of church property through a government decision would be by-passing the parliament. CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman said that his party was basically opposed to the restitution of church property through an executive act as it would means the transfer of the responsibility from the parliament to the government and would thus weaken parliamentary democracy. CMSS Chairman Jan Krycer said that his party, on the contrary, considered the restitution of church property to be an undisputable moral obligation of the state towards the Church. He pointed out that the CMSS had already proposed that the Finance Ministry assess property to be returned. The government should issue bonds at the overall property value and hand them over to the Church with five percent annual interest. It should guarantee that the nominal value of the bonds will be paid by the state after fifteen years, he said. According to the resolution adopted at a meeting of the ODS Executive Council last weekend in Teplice nad Becvou, north Moravia, the government should adopt a decision providing for the return to churches of certain property which serves their mission and goals. ODS Chairman and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists after the meeting that after this the parliament should say that it will pass no more laws redressing the injustices committed under the communist regime. The law to wind up restitution and rehabilitations would de facto rescind all articles of the existing restitution and rehabilitation laws blocking privatization, Klaus said.
