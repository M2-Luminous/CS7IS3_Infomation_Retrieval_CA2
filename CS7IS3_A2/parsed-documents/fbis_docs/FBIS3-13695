Such a procedure is applicable to individuals who attack U.S. citizens or property in any part of the world. Disparities between U.S. and international law in this regard are not seen as representing an obstacle to this effort. The Government of the United States branded as terrorism the Palestinian acts of resistance against occupation. The United States labeled the PLO "a terrorist organization," a view that was in keeping with the one held by Israel until the PLO signed the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. Washington also prepared a list of "countries sponsoring terror," rattling it like a sword in the face of countries with whose policies it disagrees. The massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is a classic example of a terrorist operation. This is true by the standards of common sense as well as U.S. and international law. The massacre was perpetrated by Barukh Goldstein, who remained a U.S. citizen even after obtaining Israeli nationality, a practice common among Jewish Americans immigrating to Israel. This gives us the right to ask for the United States to be included on the list of "countries sponsoring terror." Other reasons reinforce this claim. Goldstein hails from Brooklyn, a hotbed of Jewish fanaticism. Brooklyn is U.S. territory, as you may know, and Goldstein is not the first Jewish terrorist that Brooklyn fired like a gun in the face of the Palestinians in particular and Arab Americans in general. The U.S. Government allows and even encourages Jewish Americans to collect financial and material donations and send them to Israel. Donations collected in the United States go directly to settlers in the occupied territories, despite a U.S. policy considering the settlements illegal. The United States can, therefore, be seen as a state that sponsors terror. Although indirectly, the United States encourages Israeli settlers to commit crimes similar to the Hebron massacre.
