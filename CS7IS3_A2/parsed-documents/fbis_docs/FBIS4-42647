They delivered four cautionary warrants. Antonio Graziani reports: [Graziani] Honorary President Enrico Cuccia, Director General Vincenzo Maranghi, and Directors Maurizio Romiti and Gerardo Braggiotti are the Mediobanca directors who received the four cautionary warrants issued this afternoon by Ravenna prosecutor Francesco Mauro Iacoviello. The news was given with an official communique signed by the very same prosecutor who is investigating the role played by Mediobanca in the Ferruzzi affair. [passage omitted] Although we took into account the ideas put forward by Professor Dominioni [Mediobanca lawyer] in his defense document and by Professor Trimarchi [Milan law professor] in his pro-veritate statement--says the official document issued by the Ravenna prosecution office--we think that at this point in the investigation we must issue the cautionary warrants in order to continue the investigation.
