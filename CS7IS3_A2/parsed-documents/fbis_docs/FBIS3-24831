The Renamo men have been gradually handing over their weapons to the officials in the Unomoz peacekeeping mission. DOMINGO interviewed Renamo liaison officers in the three assembly areas in the area of jurisdiction of the Southern Regional Command, and it found that there is mutual trust between the Renamo forces and the "blue helmets" who have been deployed at those centers. Major Aurelio de Freitas and officer Meque Nyumba, of the Renamo command for Neves assembly area, noted that good Renamo-UN relations also extend to the civilian component. To back up their statements, Freitas and Nyumba explained that, from a comparatively small group of 50 men, the number of soldiers increased to more than 200 in only a matter of days. In addition, the health post set up by the peacekeeping mission has been assisting the people who live in the vicinity and who are under Renamo's control. This climate of trust is further enhanced by the fact that, as the soldiers receive orders from their Maringue headquarters to move to Neves and present themselves for registration, the process of disarmament and collection of war materiel is accompanied by the distribution of the goods to which they are entitled. In concrete terms, those goods are food and clothing that is distributed to individuals or to groups of men. [passage omitted] Freitas and Nyumba confirmed that each one of the soldiers under their command had received the quantities of food set by the World Food Program, WFP. Those foodstuffs included corn, rice, beans, peas, cooking oil, sugar, and salt. [passage omitted] Good relations between Renamo and Unomoz were also confirmed by Captain Cassama, a Guinea-Bissau observer in the UN peacekeeping force. Major Sven Kallstrom, a Swedish major in the Unomoz forces, also confirmed that relations were good, though he avoided going into details for reasons that have to do with ethics and internal regulations.
