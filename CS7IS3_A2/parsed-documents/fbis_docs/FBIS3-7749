We do not want to believe that one thing is agreed at the negotiating table while another thing is told the military commanders, those who implement the cease-fire. However, how else can we explain the bombing of the Novi Travnik Bratstvo [Brotherhood] factory from aircraft of the Croatian Army, as happened this morning at 0648 [0548 GMT]? Is there any justification for daily overflights of helicopters of the Croatian Army over the Vitez region, which drop military hardware to the extremist units, as happened yesterday over Jardol and Nova Bila?
