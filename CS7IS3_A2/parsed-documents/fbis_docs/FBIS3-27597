Last year, the number of firms engaged in such activity jumped by 85 per cent. By the end of last year, 98,000 firms were involved in scientific services, statistics from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce indicated. Public health, sports, and welfare services also grew, as the number of firms in these areas grew 54 per cent over 1992. Tertiary firms and companies in the fields of geological prospecting, education, art and culture, real estate, residential community services, and consulting also increased. "This shows that the tertiary industry is developing smoothly" said officials with the State administration, which is in charge of issuing business licences. However, transportation, postal and telecommunications, finance, and insurance services have failed to grow at a similar rate, the statistics indicated. "The tertiary industry has great potential for development," the officials said, predicting that the country's service sector will develop rapidly in the coming years. By the end of last year, 7.28 million enterprises employing 252 million workers were registered at the State administration and its local branches. In 1993, they had a record 4,236 billion yuan ($486.9 billion) in registered capital, surpassing the 2,780 billion yuan ($319.5 billion) set in the previous year. Never before in China's history have the number of enterprises grown so rapidly. Among the country's enterprises, 5.02 million are engaged in tertiary industry, about 70 per cent of the total. The average amount of capital registered by service sector corporations was about 1 million yuan ($114,942), a 9 percent rise over 1992. Hainan Province, Beijing, and Shanghai were hot spots for such firms. They listed 2.38 million yuan ($0.27 million), 1.22 million yuan, and 1.17 million yuan in registered capital respectively. While more than 1.83 million new enterprises and firms opened for business last year, some 340,000 companies folded--33 per cent more than in 1992--indicating increasing competition nationwide.
