In recent years, a particular kind of extra-plan pregnancies has come to the attention of the family planning administration throughout the area of Liaoning Province and Municipality. The intention in these cases of extra-plan pregnancies is not at all to bear another child in excess of the legal limit, but clearly, or not so clearly, the intention here is otherwise. I call this phenomenon extra-plan pregnancies of the "unintended" type. Even though occurrences are rather few, they are on the increase, and they, furthermore, form an important part of the larger group of extra-plan pregnancies in the region. Undoubtedly, these extra-plan pregnancies of the "unintended" type are a new problem that has arisen in the present urban population and family planning administration, and it deserves our attention and study. 1. Groups, Causes, and Characteristics of "Unintended" Type Extra-Plan Pregnancies There are mainly two groups of "unintended" extra-plan pregnancies. In the first group the intention is to use the extra-plan pregnancy as a kind of capital. When the government agencies or the units concerned are after them to take remedial measures, these people demand that certain economic problems or social problems be resolved for them first, and that they would take remedial measures only after that has been done for them. The economic problems to which they ask for help, generally comprise: their employment, their transfer to another line of occupation, work, or work place, increases in wages or allowances, asking for some kind of financial help, demanding help in resolving some housing difficulty or to improve their present housing, asking and to resolve some other economic dispute. The social problems generally comprise: reinstatement in a job after transfer or dismissal from an enterprise, demanding punishment for unit leaders or other personnel whom they accuse of "unfairness," and demanding resolution of other social disputes. All the above methods, whether economically or socially motivated, are conscious plans to get what they want by means of an extra-plan pregnancy; they may therefore be considered the "means to an end" type pregnancies. The second group may be called the "accidental" type. There had been no intention to get pregnant, yet pregnancy unexpectedly occurred. They generally comprise: unexpected pregnancies due to illicit cohabitation, unexpected pregnancies due to prostitution, and unexpected pregnancies in cases of marriages before the legal marriageable ages. The occurrence and increase of the "unintended" extra-plan pregnancies are not at all fortuitous phenomena. Let us first look at them from the angle of social change and social psychology. Reform and opening up are large social transformations; they have upset the norms of traditional behavior without establishing new behavioral norms. In this kind of a transitional period from old to new, all kinds of complex economic contradictions and social contradictions may arise. The people's mentality also will undergo great changes, and some people may develop an abnormal mentality and behave as if out of control. For instance, people, who for a long time remain unemployed in this society, are frequently developing serious psychic depressions, while personnel let out of enterprises on long leave may become suffering from inferiority complexes and may act out their discontent in obnoxious ways. Second, in some cases of warped mentalities and out-of-control behavior, and prevelent, unhealthy social practices, the effect is adding fuel to the flames. There are, for instance, some responsible cadres in certain units who handle cases unfairly, use public office for private gain, misuse the powers of office, and subject people to injustices. When things become critical, the people who have been treated unjustly will try even the score by going to extremes. There are also people who are afflicted with inflated egos, who place money above all other considerations, who will turn right and wrong upside down, and who viciously cause trouble for no reason and use coercion against the party organization. Third, the important position that family planning is now occupying as a fundamental state policy gives some people the wrong idea that here is a chance for bribery. At present, one "negative vote" in matters of family planning can already constitute a rigid indicator that will be critical in the assessment of a particular unit's performance, which, in turn, will have a direct bearing on the economic interests of the responsible cadres and the entire personnel of the unit in question. When people in such a situation will be looking for an opportunity to stir up trouble and to intensify the contradiction, they will think it a most powerful move to play the "extra-plan pregnancy" card. In the past, in the course of family planning and service activities, some agencies in charge had indeed rendered warmhearted assistance to some households of child-rearing ages that had gotten into genuine difficulties. Such normal cases may have aroused in a small number of people an abnormal and obnoxious motivation, having them erroneously assume that it would be possible by means of extra-plan pregnancies to "gain some illicit profit" and take undue advantage of a situation for one's own benefit. Finally, in recent years, changes have occurred in Chinese social relations as to such concepts as chastity and marriage. The dirty dregs of prostitution have resurfaced, and unmarried cohabitation and underage marriages are widespread. This has had the numbers of "accidental" type and "unintended" type extra-plan pregnancies increase without any sign of abating, and has become a social phenomenon that is causing grave concern. The following are some of the characteristics of the "unintended" type of extra-plan pregnancies: 1) Inferior quality of the relevant person as a work subject. Using extra-plan pregnancies as capital and as a means to make unjustified demands against the party organization are generally actions by a small number of people of inferior mentality and low level of general education. Some of these people have done time in the two institutions of "reform through labor" (reform of criminals through labor, reeducation of juvenile delinquents through labor), some are vagrant riffraff. Illicit relations between the two sexes and subsequent pregnancies are also mostly occurring among people of inferior personal quality. 2) The arduous nature of efforts at solution of the problem. If the relevant person as a work subject is not of a somewhat higher type, it is often the case that the conflict between the individual and the party organization has sharpened to a certain extent, that the individual believes that his problem cannot be resolved in a normal way, and that he will then heartlessly strike out in the wrong way and play the "extra-plan pregnancy" card. Behind what outwardly appears a simple "extra-plan pregnancy" phenomenon there is hidden in the background a complex contradiction, and effective resolution of these types of problems is a very thorny affair. 3) Widespread involvement of many departments and units. The economic and social contradictions that are background to "unintended" extra-plan pregnancies frequently involve many sectors of society, such as public health, civil affairs, industrial and communications, urban construction, public safety, and judicial departments. The contradictions cannot possibly be resolved by merely relying on the family planning departments. These types of contradictions involve a large number of large and small units of society. On the other hand, during the economic reform, the leadership system of many units has changed, the organizational structure has been abolished, and personnel has changed. Some units have even been completely abolished or merged, and all this has created many unbelievable difficulties for the resolution of the said contradictions. 4) The changing nature in the types of objectives. Regardless of whether the "unintended" extra-plan pregnancies had been of the "means to an end" type or of the "accidental" type, the initial and original objectives of the persons involved may not have been a childbirth in excess of the plan limits, but rather to take on manifestly the role of an extra-plan pregnancy. Following the many changes in such factors as the external environmental conditions, the eruption of contradictions and their treatment, the internal motivations in the pregnant persons may also change. If the problem is not dealt with appropriately, the objective pursued by the person having the extra-plan pregnancy may change from the intention of not having a childbirth to the intention of having a childbirth. Each case of this kind of a "pregnancy situation"; therefore, entails an extra-plan birth and the danger of it. 2. "Unintended" Extra-Plan Pregnancies Pose New Tasks for the Administration of Urban Family Planning According to investigations conducted in a certain large city of Liaoning Province, it was found that although urban family planning work been a primary concern in recent years, nonetheless, many new situations and new problems gave arisen. Although the "unintended" type extra-plan pregnancies occurences are few, the tendency has been to develop from nothing to something and from few occurrences to many occurrences. For instance, in one city ward, from January to May in 1992 and in 1993, there were 62 cases of persons with extra-plan pregnancies doing ideological mobilization work, along with the participation of the party secretary in charge of family planning. A later analysis established that 38 cases were of the "unintended" type, i.e. 61.3 percent. The analysis showed that extra-plan pregnancies of the "unintended" types were the highest, floating population was second, and extra-plan pregnancies among personnel residents in who wanted more children was third.
