In the famous work on March 9, 1934, President Kim Il-song indicated a highly important guideline in the building of chuche-oriented revolutionary Armed Forces. Thus, he opened a new phase in the Army building and strengthened the combat capability of the revolutionary Armed Forces as required by the developing situation so as to expand the anti-Japanese armed struggle. The author of the article says: The great leader's work is a historic work which indicated the way of building chuche-oriented revolutionary Armed Forces on the basis of a scientific analysis of the lawful requirement of the military and political situation and the development of the guerrilla Army and the prospect of the revolutionary struggle to accomplish the cause of national liberation. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: "We must reorganize the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla Army into the Korean People's Revolutionary Army without delay as required by the prevailing military and political situation and the development of the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla Army." In the work, the great leader said the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) should be organised in the system of a regular Army and, at the same time, in such a system that it could strictly observe the principle of guerrilla warfare, taking it into consideration that the anti-Japanese armed struggle was being waged in the form of a guerrilla warfare against the regular Armed Forces of Japanese imperialism. He also formulated the organisational system of the KPRA. He said the division, regiment, company, platoon and squad of the KPRA should be organised in a three-unit system, that the company should be defined as the main combat unit as required by the guerrilla warfare and that the KPRA units should be formed on the principle of strengthening the companies to the maximum. In forming the units, unified command of the headquarters of the KPRA should be guaranteed and, to this end, the general staff should be strengthened and its role be enhanced as fully as possible, he said. In the work, he put forward the policy of organizing the party committee of the KPRA in keeping with the reorganization of the anti-Japanese people's guerrilla Army into the KPRA. As the great leader organized the party committee of the KPRA and enhanced its role, the KPRA party committee could smoothly give unified guidance to all the party committees and organisations within the KPRA and correctly guide the Korean revolution as a whole as the supreme leadership body. With the great leader's unique idea of Army building fully embodied in forming the KPRA, the KPRA grew to be invincible revolutionary Armed Forces and played a decisive role in achieving victory in the anti-Japanese armed struggle. The Korean People's Army [KPA], the heir to the glorious anti-Japanese armed struggle, defeated the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces that had boasted of being the "strongest" in the world. The KPA has grown stronger to be one-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Army firmly prepared politically and ideologically and in military technique under the wise leadership of its supreme commander, respected General Kim Chong-il.
