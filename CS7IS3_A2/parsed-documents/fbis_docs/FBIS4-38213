This was stated by the United Nations secretary general's representative for Afghanistan, Sotirios Mousouris in an exclusive interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) in the Pakistani capital. Without disclosing the contents of report of the U.N. special mission on Afghanistan led by former Tunisian Foreign Minister Mehmood Mestiri, he said one could have good ideas to formulate a peace plan out of this report. However, he said it was up to the U.N. secretary general to decide whether the world body should make a peace plan for Afghanistan or not. Mousouris said a large segment of the Afghan nation has sought the help of the United Nations that range from demands for intervention to end foreign interference to the making of a peace plan and then its implementation. Answering a question as to what he considered would happen in Afghanistan after July 28, the end of President Borhanoddin Rabbani's term in office, he said it is up to Afghans themselves to resolve their problems. However, he said, countries such as Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia should also be consulted in this regard as they brokered the Islamabad accord between Afghan groups. Mousouris said complete ceasefire is a pre-requisite for sorting out political solution to the conflict. He also expressed his apprehensions that Herat City was bombed before it hosted a meeting of Afghan leaders to deliberate on the problem to figure out its solution. He said it seemed some persons are not interested to discuss any peace plan. To a question as to what could be a permanent solution to the crisis, he said the Afghan youth do not have jobs in the wake of fighting and thus are forced to affiliate with warring factions to piece out their livehood. He said international assistance for Afghanistan has also gone down because of instability. He said he could not propose any plan or solution to the crisis but the ideas of the "silent Afghan majority" are to be taken into consideration in any peace formula meant for restoring peace and stability in that war-ravaged country.
