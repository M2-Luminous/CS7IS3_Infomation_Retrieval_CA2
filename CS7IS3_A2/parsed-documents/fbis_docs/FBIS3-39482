FBIS3-39482 "drweu033__a94050" FBIS-WEU-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Italy & Vatican City Pact for Italy's Position Assessed BR0802131294 Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA in Italian 6 Feb 94 p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR0802131294 Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA Language: Italian Article Type:BFN [Stefano Folli commentary: "Pact's Aim Now To Withstand Impact of Elections"] [Text] It is not surprising that [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni devoted the sharpest parts of his speech yesterday to [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi and the errors committed by the media magnate and would-be politician. Over the past few days the winds of change have blown strong, and while Segni is launching his appeal to voters on the theme "we are the new," he must keep in mind that the scenario is changing. The problem now is no longer just the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], the greater or lesser distance that separates [PDS Secretary] Occhetto from [Communist Renewal Secretary] Bertinotti, the danger that the center will allow itself to be seduced by the progressive forces' arguments, their desire or ability to put themselves forward as an alternative. Now Berlusconi's dizzying rise and the alliance rudely imposed on [League Secretary] Bossi (and tomorrow perhaps also on [National Alliance coordinator] Fini) confronts Segni's movement with a new and urgent problem. Much more than [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli's Popular Party, the Pact constitutes a border area. Segni's desire to "rally" votes to the center-right so as to justify a possible government agreement and his own personal leadership after the elections, has prompted him to explore League territory, thoroughly and boldly. But the famous document signed with [League lower house floor leader] Roberto Maroni, subsequently repudiated by Umberto Bossi, and, last again confirmed last night by Maroni as "still valid" seems to be no more than a worthless piece of paper. The Berlusconi-Bossi political accord creates in the North that which Occhetto would call, with roles reversed, "a joyful war machine." Now everything is more difficult for Segni -- including the local "technical" alliances with the League and perhaps the Berlusconi grouping that he still believed in until a few days ago. They are still possible, of course, but on different conditions and with a clearer supremacy for Berlusconi over the Pact. This is why Segni yesterday chiefly wanted to stress the "liberal democratic" character of the center -- first and foremost, with regard to principles, but also with regard to policy. Behind Berlusconi's offensive -- which is effectively taking over some of the themes propounded by Segni (free enterprise, the rejection of state control) -- there is the prime necessity to withstand the huge impact of the elections. The impact is damaging the Pact in the North, where several sectors are at present submitting to the temptation of reaching an agreement with the strongest. As Guido Bodrato so accurately put it, the center risks meeting the same fate as Poland, crushed and split between Hitler and Stalin. This also explains why the most moderate members of the Popular Party, such as Formigoni and Buttiglione, were worried yesterday. On the one hand, there is the strategy of the center's approach, from still solid positions, toward the League and the Berlusconi group. On the other hand, there is the agreement between Berlusconi and Bossi and all that this entails. It is not without significance that [Radical leader] Marco Pannella too has tried to drive a wedge into Berlusconi's war machine. By saying "no" to an alliance with Fini under any circumstances, Pannella's aim is to ruin the plan to encircle the Martinazzoli-Segni center. "Neither Fini nor Occhetto," the Radical leader is saying, in an attempt to recreate a political space that at the moment is in danger of running out of air. The paradox -- as Pannella well knows, and as Segni and Martinazzoli do, too -- is that the center would still remain strong at the tactical level. If, as many still believe, no definite winner emerges from the elections, the Catholic-nonconfessional group ("Only idiots believe that this is a new edition of the five-party alliance," Buttiglione protested yesterday) would have a crucial role to perform. But unfortunately, the elections are before that. And Martinazzoli's and Segni's Poland, with their numerous nonconfessional allies, must withstand the convergent offensive being mounted by Berlusconi and Occhetto. This is the scenario of right-left polarization imposed by the situation -- the worst possible one for those performing an intermediate role, or who aspire to do so.
