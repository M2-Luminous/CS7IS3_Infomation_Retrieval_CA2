[see 22 March Terrorism Report for report of incident] According to your information, was it an isolated incident or was it premeditated? Shanudah: I do not know the motives of those people; they are in their minds and hearts, and I cannot express them. But the incident apparently took place as follows: Some monks were seeing off guests to a microbus outside. The monastery's door was opened. A terrorist happened to be passing by in his car. The door was open, the man had a machine gun in his hand, and the chance was there. He fired his bullets and killed two monks and some guests. It was merely an opportunity that he found too good to miss. Al-Sinnawi: Do you believe that the attack was not planned? Shanudah: I believe that it was not planned or premeditated. No one knew that the monastery's door would be open at that particular time and that some monks would be out seeing some guests off. It was merely a chance incident. [passage omitted] Al-Sinnawi: When was the last time a monastery was attacked? Shanudah: This is the first time in the modern age. The whole thing means that the attacker had no feelings of love and was far from right. What was the sin of some monks or monastery guests? Monks are virtuous, humble worshipers who have nothing to do with any disputes or rivalries. Why should they be attacked? But do not forget that the al-Muharraq Monastery is located in Asyut, which is raging with violence. Al-Sinnawi: Some people say monasteries and churches are storing weapons for the decisive time. Shanudah: What is the decisive time? Al-Sinnawi: When the prestige of the state is about to fall and the groups of political Islam come close to governing. Shanudah: No. The state's prestige cannot be lost. Anyway, this is a rumor that has been proved false and that we have repeatedly denied. If some people are exaggerating things to the point where they say without thinking that the monasteries contain weapons arsenals, then my response to them is clear: First, our monasteries and churches are open to anyone, including non-Christians. Our Muslim brothers frequently visit these places for social and national functions. I say it once more: You have carte blanche, go see for yourselves whether there are weapons. [passage omitted] Al-Sinnawi: After the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the al- Azhar shaykh called for liberating Jerusalem. He said that this is the duty of every Muslim. Is there a possibility of coordinating stances with the office of al-Azhar shaykh on this issue? Shanudah: Yes. We call on him to discuss with us the practical stances for liberating Jerusalem and retrieving our Islamic and Christian holy shrines. [passage omitted]
