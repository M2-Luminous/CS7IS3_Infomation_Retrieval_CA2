Interfax learned this in the scientific-industrial amalgamation Taifun which was one of the organizers of the expedition to the Far East. Currently, scientists have preliminary data on cesium-137. The study of sea water and bottom at sites where Russia had buried nuclear waste did not show excessive levels of radiation. However, as Taifun noted, it would be possible to make a conclusion on whether nuclear waste damaged the environment only after a study of the data on the levels of strontium-90, plutonium, and a number of other radionuclides, expected to be finished not later than in October. The expedition which was organized at the initiative of Japan and South Korea made a study of regions where Russia buried its nuclear waste. This summer it is planned to study the burial sites at sea of Japanese and South Korean nuclear waste.
