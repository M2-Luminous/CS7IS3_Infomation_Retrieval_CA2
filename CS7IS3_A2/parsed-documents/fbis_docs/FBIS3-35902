This is a drop in the ocean compared to the millions-strong Russian communities in other independent states of the former USSR. Just a few years ago there were twice as many Russians in Armenia. They were concentrated in Yerevan and Vanadzor (formerly Kirovakan), as well as in Sevanskiy, Stepanavanskiy, Gugarkskiy, and Krasnoselskiy Rayons. However, the dramatic events in the once-flourishing Soviet republic have led to a significant exodus of a section of its inhabitants. Among them there have been many Russians. According to Viktor Derega, counselor at the Russian Federation Embassy in Armenia on questions of migration, there are several reasons for this: the very acute economic situation, which has left not just individual enterprises but entire industrial sectors standing idle; the transport and power blockade, which has led to inhuman living conditions; and the fact that some border regions where Russians live, including Krasnoselskiy Rayon, are in the zone affected by Azerbaijani artillery bombardments.... The Armenian parliament's adoption last summer of a language law which to all intents and purposes deprived a section of the Russian-speaking population of the opportunity to obtain an education in their native language had a negative effect. Even those in employment began to have some problems. Under this law all documentation in the republic's establishments and departments has to be in Armenian. It is the opinion of "Russia" Society Chairman Galina Chernousova that this document will without doubt have to have further work done on it. "We have already met with Armenak Kazaryan, minister of state of the Republic of Armenia," she says, "and he promised to assist in increasing the number of Russian schools in areas where our community is concentrated, particularly in Yerevan." The question of setting up a Russian-Armenian university in the capital is also now being decided at the highest level. At the Russian community's request not only the Armenian but also the Russian leadership will play an active part in this undertaking. Incidentally, not only Russians but also Armenians will study in this higher educational establishment. After all, a great many representatives of the indigenous nation have not only been educated in the language of Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Chekhov but have become cultured thanks to the classics of Russian literature and art. ...The following fact is very interesting: Three ethnic Russian organizations have been formed and are operating in the Republic of Armenia: the Society of Friends of Armenia, the "Harmony" International Center for Russian Culture, and the "Russia" Society. Galina Chernousova considers that the existence of several societies does not divide but on the contrary actually to some degree unites the ethnic Russian population, since each one on its own would hardly be able to draw in everybody living on Armenian territory. "Although nonindigenous nationalities live here no worse and no better than the Armenians," Galina Vasilyevna continues, "our main task is to help them in some way at least." The Russian organizations' activities include the following areas: defending Russians' rights, charitable works, cultural life, education, and sociological research. At the Russian community's request the Russian Federation Government recently sent the republic humanitarian aid in the form of 30 tonnes of food. In November "Russia" for the first time in several decades organized a competition for vocalists, to mark the 100th anniversary of Petr Ilyich Chaykovskiy's death. In short, the first steps are being taken to unite the Russians in Armenia spiritually. This will definitely reduce the number of those wishing to leave the Republic of Armenia. In the end, the Russians in the republic are the basic link between Russia and Armenia.
