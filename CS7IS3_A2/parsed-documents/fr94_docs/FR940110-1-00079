FR940110-1-00079 FR940110-1-00006 Under §960.17(d)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule, if the Bank contracts with the loan fund or loan consortium to meet the monitoring requirements in §960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule, the Bank shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the monitoring requirements of §960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule. The Bank also shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to the loan fund or loan consortium such reports and certifications as are required under §960.15(c) of the proposed rule. In addition, the loan fund or loan consortium shall report to the Bank any new loan or grant made using repayments of loans by the borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such funds must be reported separately. The monitoring and reporting requirements in §960.17(d) of the proposed rule are a change from the provisions on monitoring and reporting in the Board's existing policy guidelines, which require the applicant to monitor the loan fund or loan consortium and require the Bank to monitor the applicant. This change is intended to conform the monitoring and reporting requirements for projects involving loan funds or loan consortia with the proposed monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to AHP-assisted housing projects generally under §§960.14 and 960.15 of this proposed rule. Section 960.17(e)(1) of the proposed rule provides that a loan fund or loan consortium receiving loans or grants from applicants pursuant to the AHP and the project sponsors and owners receiving loans or grants from loan funds or loan consortia are subject to the corrective and remedial actions contained in §960.16 of the proposed rule for fraud and non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements. Section 960.17(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in the event of a loan fund's or loan consortium's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part, the full amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the loan fund or loan consortium by the applicant and returned to the Bank, or if previously agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the Bank from the loan fund or loan consortium. Section 960.17(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule requires an applicant that provides a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to the AHP to have in place either: (1) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable mechanism that permits the applicant to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium, in the event of fraud or willful non-compliance by the loan fund or loan consortium with respect to the AHP requirements, the full amount of the AHP subsidy; or (2) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the applicant, and the loan fund or loan consortium, that permits the Bank to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium, in the event of fraud or willful non-compliance by the loan fund or loan consortium with respect to the AHP requirements, the full amount of the AHP subsidy. Section 960.17(e)(3)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, the full amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered by the loan fund or loan consortium from the sponsor or owner to be used for additional AHP projects.
