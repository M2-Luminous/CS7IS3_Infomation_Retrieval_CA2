During April 13-18, Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, inspected a number of major state-owned enterprises and township-run factories in south-west China's Sichuan Province. Qiao asked local officials to firmly implement various reform measures taken since the last quarter of 1993, by seizing current domestic and international opportunities favorable to China's economic construction and following Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. "Everyone has noticed that these reform measures have played a significant role and reported initial successes," said Qiao, who is also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. The leader also noted that problems are bound to crop up when profound reforms are being carried out in a vast country such as China. "We must be calm and sober-minded when encountering problems," he said. Qiao Shi also stressed the need to strengthen the Communist Party's leadership in the course of implementing reform measures. He urged party and government officials at all levels to guard against corruption, work in the interests of the people, improve their style of work, go to grass-roots units, show concern about people's work and livelihood and lead the people in overcoming difficulties. Speaking of enterprise restructuring, particularly major state-owned companies, Qiao said that all enterprises must get in gear with the market, invigorate their operational set-up, improve their product quality and economic returns, and enhance their competitiveness. It was imperative to continue strengthening the leadership over the farming sector and rural work and take practical measures to solve problems that have cropped up in agricultural development, he said. Moreover, effective measures must be taken to increase farmers' incomes and ensure an increase in production of grain, cotton and cooking oil, he added. He expressed the belief that China's rural areas will become increasingly prosperous by expanding production of township-run factories and speeding up construction of small cities and towns. Speaking of surplus labor in rural areas, he said that Sichuan should solve this problem by providing labor services to other areas, expanding production of rural factories and accelerating infrastructure construction in a variety of forms, such as mobilizing farmers to build roads and water conservancy facilities. While visiting the Sichuan provincial museum and a number of other cultural facilities, Qiao said that in China's modernization drive, it was necessary to draw on what is good in foreign cultures and carry forward outstanding Chinese national culture.
