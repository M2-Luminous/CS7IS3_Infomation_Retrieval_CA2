Our correspondent in Washington Arye Golan reports that, in all, eight meetings attended by only few officials were held far from the media. Despite this format, no substantial progress is reported on any of the tracks. The talks will resume in Washington in about two weeks. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres hopes it will be possible to finalize two or three clauses with Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo next week in order to pave the road for implementing the autonomy agreement in the territories. Minister Peres spoke with correspondents in the White House before meeting U.S. Vice President Al Gore. He emphasized that the two sides are trying to adhere to the timetable, but it will not adversely affect the negotiations if they continue another week or another month. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has rejected a proposal to send Yo'el Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, to talks with the PLO representatives in Cairo this week. Mr. Rabin decided that the talks will not be resumed before Foreign Minister Peres returns from the United States. This is reported by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz. In the Davos talks it has transpired that the Palestinians want to establish outposts manned by Palestinian policemen along the traffic axes in the Gaza Strip. Israel is opposed to this. Prime Minister Rabin is also opposed to the deployment of Palestinian customs inspectors at the crossing points.
