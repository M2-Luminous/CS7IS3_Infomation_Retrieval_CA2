Premier Li Peng will open the annual session with a reading of his government work report which will lay down the themes of the congress and the government's main tasks for this year. Li is expected to call for 9 percent economic growth this year and an inflation rate below 10 percent, while he will push forward reforms in the banking, financial and tax sectors, Chinese sources said. Much of Li's report is based on the decision by the Third Plenum of the 14th Communist Party Congress last October to construct a "socialist market economy," sources said. The report is expected to address China's main economic problems including inflation, high fixed asset investment and an inefficient state sector, as well as other problems including corruption and excessive bureaucracy. Not much new is expected in the report, although Li will announce new regulations on fixed assets investment and the establishment of a state development bank to stabilize the funding of basic construction projects, well-placed sources said. Li will also announce a plan for reappropriating funds raised by state-run enterprises for infrastructure projects to help pay for the bankruptcy of inefficient enterprises and displaced workers, the sources said. The report will briefly praise the work done in 1993 in nearly every area of government including, propaganda, science and technology, culture, health and education, while laying down the work outline in these areas for 1994. Li will stress that continued economic development will need a stable social environment and call on all levels of government to safeguard social order and fight corruption in government. On foreign policy, the premier is not expected to harshly criticize the British handling of issues concerning Hong Kong, but in a veiled reference to the U.S. he will staunchly maintain that China will refuse to accept any form of hegemony or power politics, sources said. On Friday, Chen Jinhua will give his report on the implementation of national economic and social development and submit his draft plan for 1994, while Finance Minister Li Zhongli will report on the 1993 and 1994 state budgets. During the congress, the 2,970 deputies will later debate, amend and approve the reports along with reports from the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procurator and the NPC Standing Committee.
