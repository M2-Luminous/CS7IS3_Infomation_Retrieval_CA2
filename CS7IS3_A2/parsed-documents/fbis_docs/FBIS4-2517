Over the past 30 years, he has been "warm like spring toward his comrades"; while doing a good job of work at his post, he did voluminous good things for the masses and was honored as "a person who is spiritually rich." Love is the foundation of dedication. The reason why Lei Feng "put his limited life into unlimited service to the people" was that he likened the party to his "mother" and socialism to "the root of life," while cherishing the party, the people, and socialism with utter devotion. Likewise, Sun Maofang has unremittingly done good things for the masses, because he has the lofty idea of "dedicating his love to the motherland and the people." For scores of years, Sun Maofang's heart has been filled with devotion to the party and the people, while regarding the development of the cause of the party and the people and the happiness of other people's lives as his own greatest wish. For the cause of the party and people, Sun Maofang does not care about his personal fame and position and is willing to serve as a "human bridge." He said: "`Human bridges' were set up in wartime to wipe out the enemy; in peacetime construction, `human bridges' are set up to lead to the four modernizations." To enable five elderly widowers, who had no children, to live happily in their old age, Sun Maofang waited on them as if he had been their own son. The elderly praised him and likened him to their "good son." Some people believed that it did not pay for Sun Maofang to have taken all that trouble. However, Sun Maofang said: "It is no easy job to be a fine son of the people! If the people recognize me as their good son, that would be the greatest prize for me!" "Head bowed, like a willing ox, I serve the children." This spirit of Sun Maofang is commendable and admirable. Beyond a doubt, a person who dedicates his love to the motherland and the people is spiritually rich. In our society, people who are spiritually rich like Sun Maofang are numerous. Xu Honggang, Bao Qifan, and Jin Zhenghong [6855 2973 3163], who have been covered by this paper recently, are all spiritually rich and have lofty ideals and pursuits. There are a far greater number of people who are working diligently at their posts in obscurity, dedicating themselves to the people. However, we may put it bluntly that under the pounding tide of the commodity economy, there really are many people who have neglected spiritual pursuits. In their eyes, the Lei Feng spirit with selfless devotion as its core is outmoded; other people's sorrows, the rise or decline of the nation, and the future of the motherland all have nothing to do with them. Only money, only the individual's private gain is the sole target of their pursuit. These people might be materially rich, but they are definitely spiritually impoverished. "A man must have some spirit." Such a spirit is precisely the dedication to society and mankind and the spirit of serving the people heart and soul. This spirit was called for in the times of revolutionary war as well as in times of socialist construction. Today, the times have changed as well as the situation and our tasks. However, "the essence retains its identity while appearances may wary"; our party's purport has not changed. The spirit of selfless devotion and serving the people heart and soul will always be an important source of strength for the prosperity of our country and nation. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping indicated, in the course of the conversion to the socialist market economic structure, we must grasp building of the two civilizations simultaneously, we must do a good job in building socialist material civilization to make people materially rich, but do a good job of building socialist spiritual civilization so that people will become spiritually rich too.
