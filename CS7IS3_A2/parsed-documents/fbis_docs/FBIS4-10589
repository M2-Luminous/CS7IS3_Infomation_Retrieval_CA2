The central characteristics of our foreign affairs activities can be summarized in the following basic objectives: to pursue national development, establish democratic values, defend international peace and security, and struggle for a politically fairer international economic order. The illusion that a new order has been created following the end of the Cold War, fortunately, is already been discarded. We are living a period of transition between two structures -- like so many other times in history -- and it is difficult to forecast how long it will last. The most marked characteristics of this period can be concocted into unsteadiness between political hegemony -- which is currently concentrated in a single center -- and economic hegemony which is concentrated into at least three centers. Another characteristic is the revival of conflicts based on cultural and ethnical differences, although this sort of conflict seems to have already been forgotten. As it is well known, changes in the international order present risks and opportunities. Brazil's role in the new international order is still in the "pending" tray. In face of the frequently mentioned dichotomies between globalism and regionalism, we must consider a basic surmise: As a result of its size, its complexity, its social fabric, the ethnical and cultural composition of its population, and the diversification of its trade partners, Brazil must have a foreign policy with universalist characteristics and discard the possibility of making exclusivist options. This, however, does not prevent our policy from having priorities and different emphases. I will refer to some of them. The first priority that comes to our minds is South America where we have been intensifying contact with our neighbor countries. The consolidation of democracy in the continent has facilitated the materialization of informal mechanisms of political consultation -- such as the Rio Group -- and stimulated the adoption of measures to overcome old suspicions and antagonisms. In the regional sphere, we are decisively engaged in an ambitious project to consolidate integration within the framework of the Common Market of the South [Mercosur], with any corrections that may prove necessary. The implementation of the zero-customs tax within Mercosur continues to advance as foreseen, with a strong positive impact on trade among the four countries. Trade among these countries has increased virtually 300 percent since the Asuncion Treaty was signed in 1991. The Mercosur priority is complemented with two initiatives launched during Itamar Franco's administration: First, to negotiate a series of accords for economic complementation with the countries of the Amazon region and, second, a proposal for the establishment of a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which will comprise the countries that make up Mercosur, the Andean Group, and the Amazon Initiative, plus Chile. This way, a free trade zone will be established in South America before the year 2005. These initiatives, to which our main regional partners have reacted positively, encompass realistic alternatives to improve the competitiveness of our industries in a way that will not contradict the goal of implementing a zero-customs tax system internationally. This does not preclude the possibility of uniting, at the right moment, all other South American integration processes. It is especially important for Brazil, with its diversified trade profile, to strengthen the multilateral trade system in open and flexible patterns. The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the GATT, the final act on which will be signed in a few weeks, has opened to Brazil auspicious prospects, although some results, not specially satisfactory, have been registered in certain areas. These prospects are particularly auspicious because the decisions made in relation to regulations -- such as safeguards, the solution of controversial matters, and antidumping [preceding word in English] measures -- will noticeably reduce the chances of establishing protectionist and unilateral measures. In the multilateral plan, we will continue to energetically defend the need to reform the UN Charter and increase the number of permanent seats at its Security Council, on which Brazil is again occupying a non-permanent seat, to grant it more representativity and legitimacy without harming its efficiency. Thus the imbalance between developing and developed countries that currently exists in the United Nations will be reduced. In view of its size and influence in the regional and international scenarios, Brazil has often been considered a natural candidate for an additional seat on the Security Council. Brazil has actively participated in debates and discussions about this issue within the specific framework of the United Nations, as well as in bilateral political contacts with our main partners. The foreign policy implemented by Itamar Franco's administration obviously cannot overlook our relations with developed countries. It is of extreme importance to intensify and diversify our relations with these countries -- the United States, the European Union, and Japan -- because they represent invaluable sources of investment and technological know-how, as well as impressive markets for our products. The key word in this context is negotiation. For a country such as ours, the possibility of signing "compulsory support contracts [contratos de adesao]" is "initially" excluded. The progress made in our relations with the United States (over intellectual property) and with Germany (nuclear area) illustrates the determination with which this priority is being pursued. In addition to confirming the importance of our relations with Portugal, the initiative to institutionalize the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries is a natural result of the priority we have always given to relations with the African Continent. Based on this and the geographic link -- the South Atlantic -- which connects us to Portuguese-speaking African countries, Brazilian diplomacy plans to dedicate special attention to the other countries in southern Africa, where a large part of the continent's economic, trade, and financial resources are concentrated. Now that opportunities have been opened by this series of profound changes, we must be attentive and actively participate in everything relevant to the formulation of a new international order. Brazil certainly has a role to play in the construction of this new order, through the defense of an effective democratization of international relations, the prevalence of multilateralism in the political and economic spheres, the legitimate right of the developing countries to have access to the so-called "sensitive" high technology as long as it is used for peaceful objectives, and the inclusion of the right to development among the priority topics of the international agenda. We must not limit ourselves to adopting attitudes that are merely a reaction to agendas drafted abroad, but to be in a position to define our own foreign affairs agenda.
