Police said they gunned down 32-year-old Tal'at Yasin Hammam, head of the group's armed wing, and six other militants in a dawn raid Monday on his apartment in northeast Cairo. In a statement sent to AFP, al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (the Islamic Group) warned Mubarak, saying: "your head, as well as those of hundreds of torturers in the Interior (Ministry), will not be enough for our revenge." It mocked the government's effectiveness in fighting militants, saying Hammam used to plan his operations from a building located "a few meters (yards) from the general intelligence offices" in central Cairo. Hammam "dealt one blow after the other" to the regime, the statement said. The Egyptian authorities said Hammam was, among other things, in charge of sending statements to foreign press agencies.
