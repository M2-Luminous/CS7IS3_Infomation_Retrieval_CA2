This is the predicted outcome of a facilities upgrading project in the Shenyang Smeltery, which emits up to 40 percent of the city's sulphur dioxide. The project, scheduled to be completed in 1996, will slash sulphur dioxide emissions from the smeltery by 80 percent. Density of emissions will be far below limits set by the state. The project recently received a loan of 5.89 million U.S. dollars from the Canadian Government through the Shenyang branch of the Bank of Communications. The pollutant is mainly discharged by the smeltery's out-of-date purifying equipment, used in the preparation of sulphuric acid. In 1994, this industrial city is reportedly to improve 70 percent of its combustion and dust removing installments to meet state requirements.
