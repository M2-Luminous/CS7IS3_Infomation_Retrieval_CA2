FR940202-0-00117 FR940202-0-00013 For example, two California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) projects in San Diego County and an Orange County Water District water conservation project in the Prado Basin that involve Federal funds, permits, or authorizations prompted formal section 7 consultations because of proposed impacts to vireos and/or vireo habitat irrespective (and in advance) of critical habitat designation. In each case, the overall project-related impacts to the vireo were evaluated and disclosed, and mitigation was proposed in the required environmental documentation. Mitigation was appropriately developed in each instance that compensates, to the extent deemed reasonable and prudent, for unavoidable direct and indirect impacts to the vireo, vireo habitat, and public fish and wildlife resources in general. Therefore, the Service fully anticipates, in these instances, that no additional mitigation would be required, prudent, or even possible as a result of the designation of critical habitat. In this regard, the Service cannot summarily dismiss the Orange County Water District's (District) position that ``barring unforeseen circumstances, the mitigation and conservation measures that have been implemented and proposed for implementation'' as a result of a current section 7 consultation will fully mitigate for impacts associated with the District's water conservation project. Issue 6: Since conversion of land to residential or commercial development would adversely affect critical habitat, property owners would lose beneficial use of their land. Critical habitat designation within certain areas, such as the San Luis Rey Municipal Water District, would thus constitute a regulatory taking of property. Service Response: Property owners within the critical habitat boundaries are not expected to lose beneficial use of their land as a result of critical habitat designation itself. In evaluating proposed projects within critical habitat boundaries, under section 7 of the Act, the Service would first determine if the specific area contained foraging or nesting habitat for least Bell's vireos. The designation of critical habitat would only affect those areas that contained elements of nesting or foraging habitat. Areas that lack foraging or nesting habitat would not be affected by the designation. Furthermore, within critical habitat, only those activities with Federal involvement would be subject to section 7 consultation. Such involvement is most likely to occur when a project involves dredge or fill of waters of the United States. In cases where section 7 consultation is required, reasonable and prudent alternatives or measures are likely to be developed that do not preclude the development of private property. Given the pertinent data pertaining to past section 7 consultations involving the vireo or other listed species in southern California, it is extremely unlikely that any project would be effectively stopped or significantly modified because of the section 7 process. In fact, a World Wildlife Fund study, using 12 years of data from the entire United States, concluded that ``The vast majority of federal activities subject to consultation successfully proceeded to completion while accommodating the needs of endangered and threatened species.'' Less than 1 percent of the actions that were the subject of formal consultation during this study were ``blocked'' because of section 7 (Barry et al. 1992). In the rare cases when the Service issues jeopardy opinions without acceptable reasonable and prudent alternatives, the action agency may take the project to an exemption committee and ask that its projects be exempted from the requirements of the Act. The Service anticipates that few, if any, opinions would not contain acceptable reasonable and prudent alternatives. Issue 7: If it is found that water extraction is damaging to least Bell's vireo critical habitat, then restrictions on water extraction would impinge on the rights of landowners and have a large economic impact on agriculture. Such restrictions would also threaten the supply of domestic water necessary to meet the water demands for certain communities.
