The problems related to the establishment of the system were discussed at a news conference on Tuesday [5 April]. Members of the association of trade unions participated in the news conference. One of the participants, Roma Dovydeniene, said that social partnership existed in Lithuania only on the theoretical basis. According to her, none of 42 international working union conventions were ratified by Lithuania with the exception of a few ones which had been ratified before the war. Trade unions have been seeking that a tripartite agreement on the cooperation in the job market should be signed among employers, Government and trade unions since November, 1993. According to the participants of the news conference, the employers -- businessmen and industrialists -- were not ready to sign such agreement. Thus trade unions consider possibilities of signing the agreement with Government. Leaders of the trade unions regretted that Seimas [parliament] had not approved amendments of the draft law on trade unions and labour. Trade unions demanded that a certain procedure should be legalized according to which the employee could not be dismissed from the job without the approval of trade unions. Seimas also rejected the demand that members of trade unions could not be dismissed from their jobs without the approval of trade unions. No approval was given to the demand to supplement the law on trade unions with a provision which would oblige the employer to allot money for the education and further qualification of members of trade unions. So trade unions appealed to the president with the request not to approve the amendments of the laws on job contract and trade union. Dainius Paukste said that estimations showed that trade unions united 25-30 percent of working people in Lithuania. The association of the Lithuanian trade unions unites nine trade unions with 81 thousand members.
