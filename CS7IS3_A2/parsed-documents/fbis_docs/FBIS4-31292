Namely, over half a year ago, Greece marked its reserve trump card with which it "threatened" its European and U.S. partners in the political poker game that it would start bargaining if it is left in the lurch. Now Greece wants to decrease the supposed suspicion in its intentions by emphasizing that the "relations with the European Union and the United States are still of greater priority compared to the relations with Russia," on the one side, and that there is a "much greater space for enhancing its relations with Moscow, which should not distress Washington," on the other. One of the points of approach has been the repeated thesis of the threat or "attack against Orthodoxy and Hellenism from coordinated Turkish action through Skopje and Tirana, with some unidentified non-Balkan forces" -- as Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said. It is exactly in that light that we must observe Greece's chairing of the European Union last month and the expectations of the Athenian political circles that Russia, through its cooperation with Greece, may, in the future, contribute to the solution of some disputes in the southern Balkans -- explicitly noting Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Albania, as well as that, in future, a greater contribution from the Russian diplomacy is expected in the dispute between Greece and Turkey. Of course, this will be of special importance if it comes out as a serious part of the Greek Prime Minister's statement that the "problem with the name [of FYROM] will be ultimately left to the Security Council." Nevertheless, I take the liberty of having certain reserves regarding such an outcome. At least not in the form in which the Security Council can agree to change the name of a state with a resolution, particularly because two of its members (Russia is the one) have recognized our country by its constitutional name. The second matter on which we should have reservations is the fact that the Security Council resolutions are mainly not implemented and accepted by the country they are dedicated to. One would say that everything is in its place and in conformity with Papandreou's policy, who obviously doubts the promptness of Washington in meeting his wish -- in the dispute with Macedonia -- and making him a national hero and a diplomatic winner. Evidently, the formula of Clinton's policy -- without winners or losers in Balkan disputes, is not a result desired by the old Greek fox, and therefore he reaches for his reserve card. After the two controversial statements of the Greek prime minister, one after the other, given in the course of only 24 hours, and related to the "Macedonian case," the current dispute has hardly become more clear. Nevertheless, while we are expecting [U.S. presidential envoy] Matthew Nimetz's visit to Skopje and Athens, and the new round of [FYROM Foreign Minister] Stevo Crvenkovski's discussions in New York, we are able to make assumptions founded on the known information: 1. Papandreou's statements, repeated several times, that he "will never recognize a state with the name of Macedonia," and that the "dispute is practically on the eve of a solution," only seem to be contradictory. We can suppose, for instance, that Greece will accept the Irish formula for the solution of the dispute, which will provide Papandreou and his government with an alibi for the Greek domestic public -- that he really did not accept a state with the name of Macedonia. In all this, the rest of the world will be left aside. 2. If we talk about finesses, we should then examine the tension in relations with Albania in that light. The sharp turns and stresses of the Albanian-Greek political dispute in the last two weeks can be interpreted in the light of the known Serbian formula: Close a problem, open another with the aim of distracting the attention of the people. Actually, following the seasoned Greek formula for conducting a national policy, this case is also being followed in meetings in Salonika, this time against Albania. The people have been allotted a new cut-off time, and Papandreu has been left with some breathing space. 3. The situation with Albania was strained just after the shock the north [FRY] and south [Greece] neighbors had after the informal meeting between [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov and [Albanian President Sali] Berisha in Podgradec [Albania] and Ohrid [FYROM]. Therefore, the easing of relations with one country causes tensions with those following the other plan, particularly because strategies and practical political steps founded on false theses have been abandoned. Moreover, if Sali Berisha remains consistent in his claim that the Kosovo problem will be solved pragmatically -- that is that the Albanian president has accepted the existing borders with Serbia -- it will be difficult for Greece to accept that relaxation in the southern Balkans and rejoice in it openly. 4. Meanwhile, following the Greek political pulse and the same timing, Serbia has also strained relations with Macedonia in the past few weeks. We have already commented on the statements of Serbian Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic regarding the recognition of Macedonia by Serbia and Montenegro, which are continually becoming more radicalized. Now comes the time for warnings from the Serbian army for the transfer of some watchtowers on the Macedonian-Serbian border or.... The timing has been set, and the threatening "or" will be enforced when the census in our country begins. It seems that, in a range of consequentially linked reactions in the Balkans (including the reinforced Bulgarian campaign for proving the Bulgarian character of Macedonia, as well as of those "realists" who accept the "existence of Macedonianness as armor for the protection from alienation, but not the Macedonian national recognition") the key position is occupied by the census that has to begin in a few days. This event, always and everywhere considered to be an ordinary and necessary statistical operation, except in this region -- particularly in Macedonia -- is becoming a primary event for many known and often elaborated reasons. [Text] That is why the state was expected to play a more active role in this act. If a party is calling on the Macedonian people to boycott the census and protest, if the operation depends on "how the wolf will count the sheep," if the editorial houses have received information that the political parties in Western Macedonia are making propaganda and pressuring the Macedonians to declare themselves as Serbs, if large groups of retired and active Serbian officers have, just now, chosen to come to our country for recreation and on week-ends, it does not look too good and it should be succeeded by a more serious process. One must bear in mind the assessment of Defense Minister Vlado Popovski, transmitted by REUTER, that the increased activity on the Serbian-Macedonian border, and similar activity that is also to be expected in the south, certainly toward Albania, can be understood as open pressure and threats. Nevertheless, it can also be taken as a danger sign, indicating how the political leaderships of friendly Serbia and Greece view the solution of problems in the southern Balkans. That is exactly why it is necessary to follow the growing tensions with the neighbors and the reverberations that will certainly be felt in our domestic political life in the next two weeks.
