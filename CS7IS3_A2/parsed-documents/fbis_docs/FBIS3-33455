The UDI, which recalled that the Cuban regime has denied freedom to its people, demanded that Chilean authorities express their solidarity with that suffering, and abstain from supporting a government that violates human rights. Deputy-elect Ivan Moreira said there are clear indications that the future Chilean Government will attempt to reestablish the relations. Among such indications he mentioned the visit to Havana by Senator Carmen Frei and Deputy Eugenio Ortega, and the meeting they held with Fidel Castro, which Moreira considered extremely serious. [Begin Moreira recording] We therefore believe that the symptoms that we have described -- the visit to Cuba by Senator Carmen Frei and Deputy Ortega, the invitation extended to a high- ranking Cuban Government official [not further identified], and also the visit that a Christian Democratic Party delegation will reportedly pay to Cuba in March -- are tremendously serious. All this means, to a considerable extent, that the future government of Mr. Frei has the will or intends to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba. We categorically oppose this. [end recording] Moreira added that it is advantageous to maintain consular-level relations, but reestablishing diplomatic relations would be equivalent to attaching legitimate status to the Cuban regime, at a time when this country has a chance to return to democracy. [Begin Moreira recording] This measure would give legitimate status to this regime, and we are not willing to give legitimate status to Fidel Castro. Unfortunately, Latin America and Chile apparently do not remember things, forgetting the situation that we suffered in the 1970's. [end recording] UDI leaders finally said that their party will do everything in its power and will use all legitimate influences to avoid reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. As a political party, the UDI will work in the eyes of people through Congress, and will contact all public offices.
