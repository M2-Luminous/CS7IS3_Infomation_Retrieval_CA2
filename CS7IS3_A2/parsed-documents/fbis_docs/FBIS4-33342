The issuance of the real will be backed by part of the Brazilian exchange reserves, which currently stand at $38 billion, considering the concept of international liquidity (which includes both available and applied resources). The opening of checking accounts in dollars will not be permitted and the current rules governing the exchange of foreign currency will be maintained. Thus, there will be no free convertibility of the real. Ricupero stated that the real will be backed only by exchange reserves, consisting of foreign currency and gold. Stocks of state-owned companies will not be used to back the issuance of the real. [passage omitted]
