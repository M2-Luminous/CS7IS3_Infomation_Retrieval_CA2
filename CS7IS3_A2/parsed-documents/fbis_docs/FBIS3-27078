Asked by XINHUA to comment on the latest developments in Bosnia at a press conference this evening, Juppe said that he hoped a peace process will take place in the war-torn republic. NATO agreed on February 9 to threaten Bosnian Serb forces with air strikes unless they withdraw their big guns from around Sarajevo within a maximum of 10 days. Under an agreement brokered by the U.N. Commander for Bosnia, Michael Rose, Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo continue to turn their big guns over to U.N. control and Sarajevo was reported to be quiet for the fifth day by Monday. But tension remains high over NATO's ticking ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons by February 20 or be bombed. Juppe, who arrived in Israel Sunday for a three-day official visit, met Monday with Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Juppe told reporters at the press conference that a new page has begun in relations between France and Israel, adding that there is now an improvement both in the political and military spheres. French defense minister will pay a visit to Israel next month to advance cooperation in the areas of research, development and technology. Earlier today, the French foreign minister also met with Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories in east Jerusalem and promised an additional aid of 10 million U.S. dollars to the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho to be granted self-rule under Israel-PLO accord signed last September 13.
