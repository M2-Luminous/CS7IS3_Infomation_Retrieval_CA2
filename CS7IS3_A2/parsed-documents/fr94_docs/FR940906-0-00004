FR940906-0-00004 FR940906-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AWA&hyph;10] Revocation of the Sacramento, Mather AFB, CA, Class C and Class E Airspace Areas and Revision of the Sacramento, McClellan AFB, CA, Class C Airspace Area and the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D Airspace Area AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document contains a correction to the final rule published on August 9, 1994, which incorporated a revision to the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area. The correct revision to the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area was reflected in Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;13, published on May 27, 1994, which became effective August 18, 1994. Because this action was inadvertently included in Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AWA&hyph;10, we find it necessary to remove the airspace designation from the final rule. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Norman W. Thomas, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9250. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 9, 1994, the FAA published a final rule that removed the Class C and Class E airspace areas at Mather Air Force Base (AFB), Sacramento, CA, due to the closure of Mather AFB on May 15, 1993 (59 FR 40465). The rule also altered the Sacramento, McClellan AFB, CA, Class C airspace area and the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area. The correct revision to the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area was reflected in Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;13, published on May 27, 1994, which became effective on August 18, 1994 (59 FR 27451). Because this action was inadvertently included in Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AWA&hyph;10, we find it necessary to remove the airspace designation from the final rule. Correction of Final Rule Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the publication in the Federal Register on August 9, 1994 (59 FR 40465; Federal Register Document 94&hyph;19406) is corrected by removing the amendment to the Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Class D airspace area designation. Issued in Washington, DC, on August 24, 1994. Harold W. Becker, Manager, Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division.
