As a leader of the Palestinian opposition, how do you view the summit? [Hawatimah] The Geneva summit has once again emphasized that U.S. Middle East policy still operates on a double standard. The U.S. President announced that he was for a comprehensive and just solution in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. But when it comes to the tangible agenda, we immediately notice the use of double standards. The U.S. Administration is ready to do that on the Golan front, Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territories. The same also applies to the occupied Palestinian territories. This was clear in the Geneva summit talks, and was also tackled during the al-Asad-Clinton news conference. Clinton stressed his administrations' commitment to international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace regarding the Golan, southern Lebanon, and Jordanian territories, but he adopted the Oslo accord, which conflicts with the resolutions of international legitimacy. Replying to questions on settlement in the occupied territories, he said that these territories were disputed areas, in conflict with Resolutions 242 and 338 and with other Security Council resolutions. This double standard was also clear when he replied to a question on implementing Security Council resolutions on Iraq, while Israel ignored Resolutions 242 and 338. He used two standards--the standard of the heavy club and comprehensive destruction for Iraq and the standard of bypassing everything that might embarrass Israel. At the same time, he left the door open for the settlement process, which was condemned by Security Council resolutions as illegitimate and illegal, in addition to turning the Palestinian territories into disputed areas. The Syrian side adhered to a comprehensive withdrawal in return for peace and to the unity of all the tracks in the peace process, because all the occupied territories are Arab and are subject to international resolutions. This shows the big mistake 'Arafat made when he moved from secret talks in Washington to secret talks in Oslo, struck a partial agreement, and accepted all the Israeli peace conditions without regaining an inch of land. He approved the Oslo accord and recognized Israel's right to exist in accordance with Rabin's conditions, as well as normalization and security and economic cooperation, without getting anything in return. This conflicts with the principle of land for peace. This reveals the extent of the crime committed by the Oslo team when it accepted all the Israeli conditions. Thus, the Palestinian territories became, as Clinton and Israel put it, a disputed area in violation of the principle of land for peace. Regarding the Gaza-Jericho agreement, pressure is being exercised in the Taba talks regarding secondary issues like the crossing points, the redeployment of the occupation forces, and the areas that will not be controlled by the Israeli forces, as well as the alternative Palestinian conditions. All these secondary issues will fall, and insistence on the principle of land for peace will survive. This necessarily requires the cancellation of the Oslo accord and the return to the peace negotiations based on international legitimacy and halting the settlement process. Israel is drawing up plans to make a complete geographic and demographic change in Arab East Jerusalem in two years, after which no Arab East Jerusalem land will be left for negotiations. In addition, the settlement process is going on in the West Bank and Gaza. Therefore, we have warned against falling into the trap of recognition, normalization, and security and economic cooperation, which are Israel's peace terms, without securing withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territories in accordance with Resolution 242 and other Security Council resolutions and without solving the issue of the refugees in accordance with UN Resolution 194. [Mansur] Nothing has yet been implemented from the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Will there be an Israeli withdrawal, or will things remain the way they are? [Hawatimah] Even 'Arafat himself could not drink the poison of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and is trying to escape from it, using superficial issues. We therefore call for that agreement to be annulled; for a return to the home of national unity, which is the strongest weapon in our hands against occupation and settlement; and for the negotiating equation to be rebuilt on the basis of the land-for-peace formula, which is the complete opposite of the Oslo formula. After the Geneva summit, the Israeli Government is playing two very serious games, and we warn against them. First, the Israeli Government's statement on declaring Syrian sovereignty over the Golan Heights in return for a clear Syrian statement on readiness to accept normalization, the exchange of diplomatic and commercial ties, and the opening of borders. We remind everyone of the success Israel achieved by pushing 'Arafat to such a statement. Israel has managed to get all Israeli conditions without relinquishing an inch of land. We also remind everyone of the example of southern Lebanon. Since 1978, Israel been making statements about Lebanese political sovereignty over south Lebanon, saying that it does not covet a single inch. However, Israeli occupation has continued since then. Declaring Syria's political sovereignty over the Golan Heights is similar to the Israeli declarations on Lebanese sovereignty over south Lebanon. Israel must recognize the principle of withdrawal and then set a timetable for that withdrawal. The example of south Lebanon is flagrant. For 15 years, Israel has been declaring that Lebanon has political sovereignty over south Lebanon -- that is probably why it set up the South Lebanon Army. Israel has also been stating that it does not covet a single inch of Lebanese territory or a drop of Lebanese water. However, it has been more than 15 years and we have still not seen Israel withdraw its occupation troops from a single inch of south Lebanon in compliance with Resolution 425. Therefore, the Arab states should learn from the south Lebanon experience and from the deep abyss into which the advocates of the Olso agreement have fallen. The Arab states should not fall in the trap of a declaration of political sovereignty over their territory in exchange for normalization and ties because this means accepting the Israeli conditions without withdrawal from a single inch of the occupied Arab territories. South Lebanon is an example. They should also not fall in the Oslo agreement abyss -- to accept normalization in return for farfetched illusions. We also warn the Arab states against attempts to deal with the Oslo team. The Tunis team is now trying to involve itself again in the Washington talks. Washington is now pressing to promote the Tunis team and the agreement on the separate Gaza-Jericho agreement by inviting that team to Washington despite the fact that it has no work there. This team already has an agenda for negotiations over proposals for choosing a self-rule administrative council. The real objective for that team's trip to Washington is to provide a cover for the Oslo agreement, which is now drowning, and to give it an umbrella by the cordon states. Israel's second dangerous game is its threat to put the question of withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, south Lebanon, and Jordanian territory to a referendum. These are occupied territories that should be vacated as provided for by UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Under a referendum, the Israeli public opinion would be in a position to override UN resolutions. The principle of referendum lends the Golan Heights, south Lebanon, and Jordanian territory the status of disputed rather than occupied land, the future of which would be a matter for the Israeli public opinion. The Israelis are thus extending the crime committed by the Oslo agreement to other Arab fronts. The Oslo agreement has, virtually, turned the occupied Palestinian land into disputed territory. This is because the agreement satisfies Israel's peace terms even before it ceded a single inch of land or acceded to the principle of a pullout from the occupied Palestinian territory as envisaged by UN resolutions. [Mansur] The Israeli Government has hinted that unless 'Arafat accedes to Israel's terms, it will quicken the pace of the talks with Syria. What do you think? [Hawatimah] This is not the first time that Israel has sought to use intra-Arab contradictions to its advantage and capitalize on parochial and isolationist attitudes in the Arab arena. The idea is to promote its occupation of Arab land. Israel has applied the same tactic since the sixth round of the bilateral Washington talks. In August, 1992, the Israelis created the impression that the road was clear for progress on other tracks by way of getting the Palestinian leadership in Tunis to run after secret talks in Oslo behind the backs of 'Arafat's negotiating team in Washington. Let's remember that the Washington negotiators were mostly unwilling to make the kind of astonishing concessions 'Arafat was pressing Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi to make. Throughout the negotiating exercise in Madrid, Washington, and Oslo the Palestinian and other Arab peoples were kept in the dark. What took place in Oslo were secret negotiations held behind the backs of the Washington team and Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who began to balk at the considerable amount of concessions the Tunis leadership wanted him to make. The Arab parties must beware of these Israeli tactics. Otherwise, they will fall one after another and be made to go along with Israel's terms for a settlement, without any of the UN resolutions stipulating an Israeli pullout from the occupied Palestinian territory being honored. [Mansur] Some say that the U.S.-Syrian Geneva summit will lead to a peace agreement between Syria and Israel. As a leader of the Palestinian opposition, how much room will you have to operate on Syrian territory? [Hawatimah] Whether Syria reaches an agreement or not, this is Syria's business. We hope that narrow regional interests and views will not take precedence over the common national and pan-Arab interests of our people to struggle to end the occupation, dismantle the settlements, exchange land for peace, and implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. Such befuddling arguments have been going on for years. They will continue after the Geneva summit. Those who try to depict the situation as if the Palestinian movement depends on administrative offices in the Arab capitals are under a great illusion. Whether these administrative facilities remain or go, this will not affect the genuine Palestinian democratic forces that call for a balanced and comprehensive peace on the basis of full withdrawal in return for full peace. Actually, some of these facilities are no longer provided. For us in the DFLP, this is a very minor issue. We exist within the organizational, popular, political, professional, and armed ranks of our people inside the occupied Palestinian territory and in the diaspora. Our offices exist inside the hearts of the people, their homes, and in several social, trade, and professional institutions in the occupied territories, which have been in existence for over 25 years. Our people's camps in the diaspora are the arenas in which our organizations operate. Also, the homes in the camps are our offices. It is useful to have administrative facilities in the Arab capitals. However, should some constraints be imposed on us, this will not affect us. This is a minor issue, because the democratic and nationalist forces of opposition exist in the occupied territories, the camps, and the diaspora, and not in administrative offices in this or that capital. [Mansur] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi is now leading an opposition movement for democratic reforms in the PLO. What can you tell him? [Hawatimah] I have said, and I say again, that we welcome the person who discovered 'Arafat's dictatorship 26 months late. We tell him that if he really wants to democratize PLO institutions, make collective decisions, and reestablish Palestinian national unity, then he should join the democratic and nationalist opposition, spearheaded by the DFLP. Now, we have a unified central command for the 10 factions. We will operate by having reference to popular legitimacy at conferences at home and abroad and by electing leaders from the base to the top by democratic means. I tell Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi that his major mistake was that after the eighth round of the peace talks, he did not declare a halt to the bilateral talks and boycott the multilateral talks. 'Abd-al-Shafi made another mistake when he traveled to Tunis. He came back sad and disappointed. He said that he was sure this time that the decision was in the hands of one person. Therefore, he can now return to the people and the masses, along with us.
