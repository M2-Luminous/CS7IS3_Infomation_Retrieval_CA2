FR940613-2-00072 FR940613-2-00044 Decisionmakers should view Reg-Neg as one of a variety of information-gathering and consensus-building or consultative processes used to achieve effective, efficient, rational, and fair agency policy. Although the Negotiated Rulemaking Act does not address less formal decisionmaking processes, including, among others, policy roundtables and public meetings, such nonadversarial processes may help gather information to assist the Department in policy development. Participation in informal regulatory development processes can require significant commitment of resources on the part of all participants, including federal agencies. The Department's experience, however, has shown that consensus-building techniques can result in better policy, reduce the high rate of litigation, and lower the costs of program implementation for the Department's bureaus and the regulated community. III. Interim Policy A. Application of the Interim Policy The Department encourages the effective use of ADR and Reg-Neg to the fullest extent compatible with existing law, and the Department's resources and missions. Based on almost one hundred and fifty years of experience, the Department recognizes that the use of consensus-building techniques and nonadversarial planning processes can increase the wisdom, efficiency, equity, and long-term stability of departmental decisions. The interim policy is intended to govern both the programmatic side of the Department's broad responsibility, as well as many of the human resources aspects. With regard to human resources, this interim ADR policy embraces the ADR policy of the Department's Office for Equal Opportunity. The use of ADR is expected to be very useful in matters involving equal employment opportunity. Workplace dispute issues outside the jurisdiction of actions governed by regulations issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board will also be governed by this policy. Where the use of ADR would impede effective supervisory action in routine matters of employee discipline or performance appraisal, supervisors may elect not to use ADR. B. Purpose of the Interim Policy The Department has developed a two-year ADR interim policy in response to the requirements of the ADR Act. The policy encourages the Department's bureaus to identify disputes amenable to ADR and to use ADR, whenever practicable. After testing ADR methods in a variety of contexts, the Department, through the Interior Dispute Resolution Council, at the conclusion of the two-year interim phase, will assess the appropriateness of the use of ADR and determine which program areas could most benefit from the institutionalization of ADR processes. Existing bureau ADR efforts should continue as this final policy is developed. The Department's interim ADR policy is also designed to disseminate knowledge about ADR both within the Department and to those whom the Department serves, as well as to introduce new ADR initiatives and to provide guidelines for bureaus to apply in the implementation of ADR pilot programs. These initiatives will produce a baseline of experience that will be used in developing the Department's final ADR policy. Without the full commitment and cooperation of all involved in the two-year interim phase, the Department will lose a valuable opportunity to learn what works, what does not, and how best to capture potential benefits from ADR use. C. Implementation of Interim Policy 1. Role of the Department's Dispute Resolution Specialist Pursuant to the ADR Act, the Secretary appointed the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to serve as the Department's Dispute Resolution Specialist (DRS). This high level, Department official was appointed as the DRS in order: (1) To facilitate intra-departmental coordination and communication; (2) to ensure consistent, quality training; (3) to establish minimum qualifications for mediators, arbitrators, and certain departmental employees with ADR responsibilities; and (4) to reduce administrative redundancy. The DRS will maintain an ``open door'' policy, welcoming inquiries from and offering assistance to the bureaus and interested persons. During the period that the interim policy is being implemented, ongoing input from the public is encouraged. The DRS will also develop and make available a roster of neutrals who are trained in ADR and who would be available to participate in a dispute resolution proceeding. Despite this focal point for ADR activity, the Department's interim ADR policy is to encourage decentralized decisionmaking to the greatest extent possible. 2. Role of the Interior Department Resolution Council In order to keep the Department's bureaus informed during the implementation of the interim phase, the DRS shall, 30 days after publication of the Department interim policy, convene the Interior Dispute Resolution Council (IDRC). Composed of the Department's Assistant Secretaries, Solicitor and the Director of the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), or their respective designees, and chaired by the DRS, the IDRC shall monitor and evaluated the Department's use of ADR and Reg-Neg and assist in intradepartmental policy and process coordination. The IDRC shall act as an information clearinghouse, recommend personnel training courses in ADR techniques and program design, and act as the liaison between the ACUS and FMCS.
