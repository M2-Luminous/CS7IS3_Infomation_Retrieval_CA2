Burelli Rivas will make his withdrawal official at Miraflores Palace (government headquarters) this afternoon, even though last week he insisted to foreign journalists that he would continue his candidacy until election day, this Sunday in Washington. According to media reports, the Venezuelan foreign minister had only received the support of the Haitian Government in exile. With his withdrawal, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus and Colombian President Cesar Gaviria remain in the competition for the hemispheric post.
