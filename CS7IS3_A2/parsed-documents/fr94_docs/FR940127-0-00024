FR940127-0-00024 FR940127-0-00004 The final rule also revises the existing paragraph addressing privately-issued mortgage-backed securities in the discussion of the types of assets assigned to the 50 percent risk weight category. The amendment clarifies that in order for a security backed by a pool of conventional mortgages on multifamily residential properties to be accorded a 50 percent risk weight, each underlying mortgage must meet the eligibility criteria described above at the time the pool is originated. A bank that purchases such a security will not be required to monitor the eligibility of each underlying mortgage on an ongoing basis to ensure that a 50 percent risk weight remains appropriate for the security. Instead, the security may remain in the 50 percent risk weight category as long as principal or interest payments on the security are not 30 days or more past due. Finally, the final rule amends the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines by stating in a footnote that a multifamily housing loan that is sold subject to a pro rata loss sharing arrangement is to be treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) to the extent that the sales agreement provides for the purchaser of the loan to share in any loss incurred on the loan on a pro rata basis with the selling bank. This means that, in such a transaction, the portion of the loan that is treated as sold by the selling bank is not subject to the risk-based capital standards. This footnote also provides explicit guidance on the risk-based capital treatment of sales of multifamily housing loans in which the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on other than a pro rata basis. It states that these other loss sharing arrangements are taken into account for purposes of determining the extent to which such loans are treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under the risk-based capital framework in the same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income. The instructions applicable to such transactions are contained in the Glossary entry for ``sales of assets.'' This final rule is effective January 27, 1994. The FDIC has determined that good cause exists to waive the customary 30-day delayed effective date since the rule relieves a restriction on insured state nonmember banks by permitting them to utilize a lower risk weight for eligible multifamily housing loans and securities collateralized by such loans in calculations of their risk-based capital ratios. In addition, insured state nonmember banks may choose to utilize this lower risk weight in their Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for December 31, 1993. V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis The FDIC certifies that the adoption of this amendment to its risk-based capital guidelines will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ). Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. The amendment will benefit insured state nonmember banks by reducing the minimum amount of capital that they are required to maintain for certain multifamily housing loans and securities collateralized by such loans. The proposal would apply equally to all insured state nonmember banks, regardless of size, and should not disproportionately affect a substantial number of small banks.
