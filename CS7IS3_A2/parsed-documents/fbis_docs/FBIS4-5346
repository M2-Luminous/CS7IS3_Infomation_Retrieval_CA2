The news analyst goes on: After unilaterally aborting the third round of talks with the DPRK on unreasonable pretexts, the U.S. imperialists openly talked about stepping up military threat and pressure on the DPRK and have massed their aggression forces in and around South Korea. The racket of confrontation and war against the DPRK kicked up by the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors by taking advantage of it has now reached an extremely reckless phase. It goes without saying that should their such reckless military moves be overlooked, peace and security on the Korean peninsula would be disturbed and our nation would suffer a holocaust of nuclear war. South Korean students and people could not tolerate it, so they rose in vigorous anti-U.S. protests to remove the source of their misfortunes. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are ruthlessly cracking down on the people's righteous patriotic struggle at the point of the bayonet. This is an anti-national criminal act that could be done only by such sycophant traitors as the Kim Yong-sam group which is seeking to prolong its stay in power under the patronage of outside forces, bartering away the dignity and interest of the nation lock, stock and barrel. Nothing can break the unshakable will of the South Korean people to live in a peaceful and reunified country free from foreign domination and interference.
