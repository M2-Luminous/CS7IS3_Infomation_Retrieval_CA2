How can Japanese corporations protect themselves from having to pay huge damage claims? Under the Clinton administration, the U.S. Congress approved the 1993 National Joint Production Act on 27 May, making it possible for rival U.S. companies to enter into joint production arrangements, something which they had been severely restricted in doing before. Relaxing antitrust policies to boost the competitive strength of U.S. companies, legislators seem ready to let companies do whatever they can do to improve their competitiveness. Now that the cold war has ended, national rivalry has become economic rivalry, and under the Clinton administration, the newly created National Economic Council was quickly added to the already existing National Security Council. One the central themes of the new council is protecting and nurturing the growth of U.S. high-tech industry, which forms the basis of U.S. economic strength. Toward that end, it seems the administration is promoting a pro-patent policy, which aims at providing greater safeguards for U.S. intellectual property. U.S. history shows two competing attitudes toward patents, and the United States has gone through an antipatent period, when new technology and discoveries were considered the common property of society, as well a pro-patent period, which gives precedence to the rights of the inventor. During the 1950's and 1960's, the heyday of American power, the winds were blowing strongly in the direction of a free economy and an antitrust, antipatent mood prevailed. In the 1970's, however, key industries like automobiles, steel, and home appliances and electronics began showing signs of decline and the call went out to strengthen U.S. industrial competitiveness. In October 1976, then President Carter announced his "industrial technological reform policy." Clearly, he was indicating a pro-patent policy as part of U.S. national strategy. The secretary of commerce and others who were advocating such a policy continued to advise the White House on the importance of protecting intellectual property rights even after their departure following President Reagan's election. The Reagan administration continued Carter's pro-patent policy, further boosting its importance by making it part of the administration's national strategy. What sent shock waves through the nation was a report by the President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness concerning the competitive capabilities of U.S. industry. In that report, which was released in January 1985, the chairman, [John A.] Young, released an estimate that Americans stood to lose millions of dollars if they did not protect their intellectual property overseas, clearly taking the stand that intellectual property rights were a national interest. As public sentiment grew, the U.S. Congress in 1982 established a court of appeals in the federal circuit (CAFC) to specialize in patent cases. A revised trade act was put through in 1988 [1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act], giving teeth to patent regulations protecting intellectual property rights; the United States also saw the creation of the new Section 301 and revisions to Section 337 of the Tariff Act. The revision to Section 337 made it much easier for U.S. companies to petition the International Trade Commission (ITC) to place a ban on imported foreign products that are in violation of existing patents. Again, through Super 301, the U.S. Government was required to create a list of countries in which intellectual property rights were not being given adequate safeguards and to demand that the situation be remedied. When during Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks, a revision to Japan's patent system, including efforts to speed up patent investigations, was sought, the incident caused a flurry of reporting in the newspapers that is still fresh in this writer's memory. Patent Mafia Active Behind the Scenes Quick to take advantage of this pro-patent tide in the United States and turn it into a business is a group of patent management companies known as the "patent mafia." One of these patent management companies, Refac Technology Development Co., bought the patent for laser-related technology developed in 1977 by an inventor named Gordon Gould and then sued over 200 prominent companies, including General Motors Corp., International Business Machines, and Toshiba Corp. After more than 10 years in the courts, Refac was able to get each of the companies to sign licensing contracts and even now is getting over $10 million in revenue annually as a result. Refac used its experience in the courts to make a career out of patent disputes. The one who pushed this strategy to the front was the vice president of Refac, Philip Superba. His shrewdness has given many of those working with patents at Japanese companies cause to weep. The strategy that Superba, himself a patent attorney, devised was as follows: First, one of Refac's technical consultants makes the rounds of trade shows and companies and painstakingly goes through newspapers and magazines to dig up products that are in violation of a patent. Next, the company buys the patent in question from the inventor. Most times, it is only part interest in the patent (about 5 percent). Refac then sends a warning notice to manufacturers it thinks are in violation of the patent, asking them to sign a licensing agreement. If everything can be settled at this stage, the company is promptly paid the licensing fee. If the manufacturer refuses to agree to a licensing contract, Refac brings the case to court. But instead of filing directly against the manufacturer, Refac files its lawsuit against a selling agent or shop. For the manufacturer, who values his relationship with the agent, there is no other recourse but to accept a compromise in order to protect his agent. Refac then hires an attorney, hoping for an early settlement, and promises to pay the attorney on condition that the case is successfully concluded. One of the patents Refac bought was for laser-related technology from an inventor named Jerome Lemelson. The technology, which has had broad applications, was used in VTR's [video tape recorders], laser disks, and laser and magnetic memory formats. From an inventor named Melvin Clark, Refac brought a patent that had to do with electronic musical instruments. Based on the patent for this kind of instrument, Refac sued Matsushita, Yamaha, Kawai, and Casio. The case was recently settled out of court. Casting sidelong glances at the patent mafia and their behind-the-scenes activities, big U.S. companies finally jumped into the fray in the mid-1980's, making their imprint on patent strategy in some very important ways. Rather than making money by creating products, they turned the patents they had been accumulating over the years into the seeds of a new business. Since licensing fees were a quick way to get cash into their coffers, it was an attractive proposition for corporate managers, especially when facing fourth quarter statements. The first company to try it was the semiconductor giant, Texas Instruments [TI]. Under attack by Japan's semiconductor makers, the company's then first vice president, Melvin Sharp, was groping for a way to survive. According to one account, when he heard that Polaroid stood to gain a huge amount of money in damages if the courts ruled in its favor in a patent dispute with Eastman Kodak, Sharp slapped his knees and said, "This is what we should be doing!" In 1991, after five years in the courts, Polaroid won its suit over Kodak, and was awarded over 100 billion yen in damages. Texas Instruments followed suit and in 1986 filed a lawsuit against nine semiconductor manufacturers in Japan and Korea, claiming they had violated TI's patent rights. The following year, the case was settled out of court. The company ended up getting over $200,000 from each of the violators in patent-use fees, which quickly pulled the company out of the red. Recently, Japan's mass media was kept busy with Honeywell Inc. versus Minolta Camera Co. and Jan R. Coyle versus Sega Enterprises Ltd. In the end, Minolta was ordered to pay 16.5 billion yen in damages and Sega, 5.6 billion yen, causing a shudder of fear to pass through Japan's corporate world. Both cases also drew a lot of attention in Japan because the outcome was based on a jury trial, something one doesn't see in Japan. Jerome Lemelson got out-of-court settlements from Japanese automakers and electronics manufacturers under a patent related to the automatic inspection and imaging devices used on production lines. Usage fees are said to have amounted to a total of 50 billion yen. He has now turned his attention to automobile parts manufacturers. Behind Skyrocketing Damage Awards Actions from the 1980's to grow money trees from patents were backed by a change in the views of the court. In the midst of the pro-patent current, a transformation occurred in the U.S. judicial branch. Among other things, pro-patent judges were appointed to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which, as mentioned earlier, was established in 1982, and since the 1980's, the pro-patent line has taken root. What became especially noticeable is the skyrocketing value of intellectual property; huge amounts are being awarded in damages for patent violations. The biggest reason is a change in the method used to calculate damage awards for patent infringements. The method used before, a formula based on market values in the industry, was replaced by another method, which is based on fictitious or "supposed negotiations." In the "industry market value method," damage awards were computed by taking into account market values (values current at the time of the signing of a licensing contract) in whatever industry (automobile, semiconductor or toy industry, for example) that was relevant to the patent case. According to this standard, license fees could be as little as 1 percent of market value or, as was usually the case, somewhere between 2 and 5 percent. The criterion now used to decide the size of damage awards follows this line of thought: "Hypothetically, if the patent holder and the party who wants to buy a license from him were to negotiate in good faith, how much would the fee for such a license be?" Compared to the "industry market value formula," which tends to ignore the value of a specific invention, this criterion, when used in determining the amount of damage awards, takes into account the value in use, or usefulness, of the invention itself. If the product, which was made on the basis of the discovery, yields a high profit ratio, then, naturally, a high licensing fee can be demanded and this, of course, means a high damage award. In fact, it is not unusual for U.S. courts to decide on licensing fees as high as 15 or 25 percent of sales value and, in at least one court decision, a licensing fee of 30 percent was even recognized. The second reason for the high value that intellectual property demands is found in the system of triple damages awards. In fact, in Sega's case, the company faced the threat of having to pay three times the amount of actual damages incurred. This system of triple damages awards is uniquely American and has a punitive aspect to it. In U.S. patent law, when the court finds a deliberate infringement has taken place, the injured party (that is, the patent holder) can demand as much as three times the amount of actual damages. Whether triple actual damages is in fact awarded is left to the discretion of the presiding judge. In Sega's case, the jury recognized the infringement as being "deliberate," so there was a possibility that this threefold rule might be applied. Sega ended up settling out of court before the judge ruled on the final amount, but with this triple indemnity hanging over its head, Sega would seem to have been handicapped while negotiating an "amicable" settlement. Third, even when, as in Minolta's case, the infringement involved only one part of the camera, the autofocus mechanism, the basis for computing the licensing fee is the sales price of the entire camera. In other words, when the courts recognize an infringement for a part, damages are calculated on the basis of the entire finished product. Naturally, with this method, when the sales price of the finished product is high, the amount of the damage award is high. There is one additional reason for the high price of intellectual property in the United States--the U.S. jury system. No matter what, juries tend to decide in favor of the small inventor over the large corporation and in favor of U.S. enterprises over foreign enterprises. This tends to put Japanese companies at a disadvantage. Not used to the jury system, Japanese companies, in many cases, have also not adequately prepared their defense strategy. Moreover, in determining damage awards, juries have broad discretionary powers and are said to have a tendency to grant large awards. Learn From Japan's Successful Court Cases There are cases where a Japanese litigant, having been accused of patent infringement, goes to court and wins, and such cases should serve as useful references. In the case of Refac Technology Development Co. versus Hitachi Ltd., Refac claimed to hold three patents for liquid crystal display (LCD) technology and sued 108 companies, including licensees, for patent infringements. Objecting on the grounds of legal procedure, Hitachi claimed that Refac had failed to conduct an adequate inquiry prior to filing the suit. In April 1992, the Federal District Court in California not only ruled again Refac, it ordered the company to pay $1.5 million, including the defendant's legal costs. Without letting itself be swayed into an out-of-court settlement, Hitachi succeeded in cleverly piercing the other party's Achilles heel. Another company that fought its case successfully, this time before a jury, is Izumi Precision Industries Co., headquartered in Matsumoto City in Nagano Prefecture. In 1986, the company won a patent infringement case brought against it by Philips of the United States for violating the latter's patent for an electric shaver. The company, which has about 100 employees, deserves special mention as an example of a small enterprise beating out a large multinational corporation like Philips. A lot can be learned from the case by Japanese companies, which dislike ligitation and have a tendency to rush into out of court settlements. Up until now, disputes and collisions over patents where leading edge technology has been involved have been in areas like the semiconductor field, music instruments, and fiber optic telecommunications. After this, however, the areas where it seems there is going to be a growing number of patent disputes are biotechnology and computer software. In the United States, technical resources have been directed into biotechnology from very early on, especially into the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is located in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. The earliest example of a patent dispute involving biotechnology is the suit brought against Toyobo in 1987 by a California company named Genentech over a medical product based on gene recombination technology. In the area of computer software, pressure from the United States will probably grow over issues like Japan's use of illegal copies of U.S.-made software. The prologue to such disputes over intellectual property rights began in 1982 in a case involving Hitachi and IBM. Today, 10 years later, the issues are more pressing than ever. The United States has been issuing warnings about illegal software copies being used in Japanese offices for a long time, and the atmosphere is now all but ready to explode. Japanese companies mustn't forget that they are doing business in the midst of an unprecedented pro-patent mood based on national strategy. In order for Japanese companies not to get drawn into a patent dispute with the United States, prior investigation to determine whether or not they might be in violation of an existing patent is very important. Research of this sort should be carried out before a company even considers introducing its product on the U.S. market. Companies should also get the opinion of an attorney regarding the results of their investigations. Such precautions are an added safeguard against being found in "deliberate" violation of a patent, a finding that opens the way for awards three times the amount of actual damage. Companies must also carefully save and manage internal documents. Because of a peculiarly U.S. system based on a "first-to-discover" [rather than first-to-file] criterion in granting patents, if there is a lawsuit, it is important that companies be able to show the opposing side all documents relevant to the case. Development of Basic Technology Is Needed One of the strategic measures that Japanese companies must take against U.S. pro-patent offensive is the development of basic technology. Business managers will probably see such research as eating into their profits and would much rather turn their attention to applied research, where the prospects for a successful outcome are much clearer than the uncertainties of basic research. But the success of the top companies representing Japan in the 21st century--whether they will be up there with the best companies in the world--depends on how much technical resources managers have invested in their companies and how successful they have been in developing basic technologies. Without changing their present attitudes, they can't expect their companies to be world-class representatives of their respective industries. If companies have developed a store of basic technology, when and if patent disputes do arise, this technology can be used for cross-licensing purposes. With the revenue from such licensing fees, companies can also stabilize their operations. The government also has a very important role in regard to the development of basic technology. It is true, in certain respects, that such technology doesn't add to a company's profit line. Thus, we have to place some of our expectations on the universities and the country's research institutes. It would be difficult for Japan to imitate the United States in terms of putting the latest technology into the hands of the private sector through its development of military technology. To the degree that Japan can't expect basic technologies to be developed through such means, as a nation, we must prepare to develop alternate means. And to that end, there will have to be substantial increases in the budgets of our universities and national research institutes. We should remind ourselves of the 1980's, when official development assistance (ODA) was steadily increased even though Japan's fiscal budget at the time was following a strict "no growth" line. In compliance with constitutional restrictions on Japan's contributing militarily to international situations, the government instead increased ODA funding. In much the same way, as long as there are restrictions on the development of military technology, Japan must substantially increase the budgets for universities and institutions carrying out advanced research. It is in such a way that the development of advanced, basic technology capable of surpassing developments in Europe and the United States becomes a possibility. The development of this kind of technology, moveover, will not only contribute to Japan's technological development but also to the transfer of technology to developing nations. The kind of technological containment surrounding the United States freezes existing differences in technology between such countries and developing nations. Contributing to such differences is not the path that Japan should take given its national policy toward assisting developing nations. The U.S. National Institutes of Health gathers leading researchers from all over the world, including some 300 from Japan, and has become a mecca for biochemical research. Japan, too, should establish a science and technology center that is open to researchers in every field of advanced technology, inviting those not only from the United States and Europe but from the developing nations as well. Promoting projects that can contribute to the world in this way can be thought of as creating a link in the global partnership espoused by Japan and the United States. Such projects will be useful on a road that leads--not to confrontations between Japan and the United States in what is expected to be intensified trade conflicts between the two countries over leading edge technology--but to harmony and cooperation. Concrete projects of this sort, based on discussions with the Clinton administration, should probably be encouraged as joint enterprises between our two countries. Hiroyuki Kamano. Attorney-at-Law.
