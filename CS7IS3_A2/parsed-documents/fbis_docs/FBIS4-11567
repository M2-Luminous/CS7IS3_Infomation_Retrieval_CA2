Speaking at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the ambassador said economic support will be reinforced. The recent events that occurred in our country will not alter the good relations between Mexico and Canada, Ambassador David Winfield said. On the contrary, he added, there will be greater economic support for Mexico. [Begin Winfield recording] Canada is very interested in investing here in Mexico now in order to expand and strengthen our economic ties. The three finance secretaries of the three countries approved a new trilateral swap [preceding word in English] in Washington yesterday so as to maintain the value of the currencies.

[Begin Winfield recording] It is a terrible, unacceptable crime; it is a method that is unacceptable for solving problems. We reject this type of action, but such actions will not change our trust in the country. [end recording]
