He noted that reconciliation and dialogue are the basis for any solution in Yemen. In an interview published by al-Shariqah AL-KHALIJ today, Makkawi said the Document of Pledge and Accord remains the ideal formula to achieve stability in the country. Makkawi, who was appointed a member of the Presidential Council in the declared Democratic Republic of Yemen, said ending the military operations hinges on the will of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, noting that these operations cannot achieve a final solution to the situation unless the northern army turns into an occupation army, which is unacceptable and out of question. Makkawi hinted at the possibility of a meeting between President Salih and 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Paris soon. He said: If agreement is reached to avoid the negative aspects that accompanied the declaration of unity, then results will be promising.
