"In accordance with the protocol, Russia will also supply Hungary with nuclear fuel," Georgiy Kaurov, head of the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy's [Minatom] Information and Public Relations Department, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "Furthermore, our organizations will begin to receive nuclear fuel exhausted at the Paks AES after a five-year interval at the station. We cannot refuse to accept it. That would mean breaking obligations and undermining Russia's international reputation as a reliable partner." "Let me explain", Kaurov added. "Russia receives exhausted fuel and not radioactive waste from Hungary. The two things are not at all the same. During processing, useful components are given off that are used as repeat fuel for an AES. Russia's Minatom enterprises have highly effective and ecologically sound processing technology for nuclear fuel. I would also point out that the protocol guarantees a stable hard currency income that allows resources to be channelled into rehabilitating polluted sites and implementing programs for handling radioactive waste."
