The demonstrators intend to hand in a petition demanding implementation by the government of the undertakings included in the agreement on the take-over of the Warsaw Steelworks by the Luchini Italian industrial group. Jan Szul is in front of the Council of Ministers building: [Szul] About 3,000 steel workers are taking part in the demonstration. They have marched 10 km from the steelworks gate to the Council of Ministers building. Apart from the fact that they want to hand in a petition to a government representative, the steel workers also want to point out the fact that in the process of negotiating the agreement by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Ownership Transformations employee interests have not been taken into account. Trade unionists are prevented from taking part in such negotiations. They usually learn what the agreement entails when it becomes a fait accompli. The government claims that it should not be the addressee of the steel workers' demands. It believes that they should approach the steelworks board, because the steelworks is a private company now. The Italians own 51 percent of the shares. The steelworks board, however, claims that it is unable to meet the workers' pay demands because this would undermine the plant's financial situation. It does not want to launch any large investment projects either because, according to the board, the legal position involving the ownership of the land where the steelworks is located has not been properly sorted out. At this time the demonstration is ending. In a few minutes the steel workers will set off on their way back to the plant.
