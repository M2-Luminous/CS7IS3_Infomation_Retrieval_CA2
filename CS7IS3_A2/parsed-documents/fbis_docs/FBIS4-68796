To the editors of the newspaper KURANTY In the issue of your newspaper for 16 December 1993 you attributed the following statements to me: "We must provoke war among the tribes," "we should think about colonies," "we must force our republics to return"--which do not belong to me and which could be perceived by the readers as propaganda for war and violence. [Signed] Chairman of the LDPR faction V.V. Zhirinovskiy Such was the letter our editors received from V. Zhirinovskiy. We were forced to publish it since the correspondent who submitted the article to us did not keep the dictaphone recording tape. And although he was prepared to affirm wherever necessary that the LDPR leader did say all these words, alas, verbal assurances cannot be tacked on. [Signed] The editorial board. [end box] ...But these statements do belong to V. Zhirinovskiy. And he made them not in some back room or in a small group but at a congress (already the fifth) of his own Liberal Democratic Party held recently in Moscow (the texts are from a stenographic report of the congress). One can understand why V.V.Zh. sent us this letter: The procuracy had begun to study his statements to see the extent to which they approached violating one law or another. V.V.Zh. tries to look angelic: He is concerned about the well-being of the Russian people and at the same time he does not want to offend any other people. What kind of provocation of conflicts and wars is there in that? What kind of violence? What kind of degradation of other peoples?... Such a Gentle V.V.Zh. "Here we are before you, delegates to the Fifth LDPR Congress. We are not preparing for war. We are not seizing foreign territories, we are not offending anyone. We are speaking about our position and relying on constitutional support from our constituents." "We are making it a point to express ourselves in gentle terms so that people will fear us less. We always speak this gently, but people fear us so much in Russia and abroad that I do not know which tender and kind words to choose..." (Applause) But if such harmless creatures have gathered in the LDPR under Zhirinovskiy's banners, why is it that many normal, psychologically balanced people when hearing the gentle statements of V.V.Zh. feel their skin crawl and have only one association: Zhirinovskiy means war? Actually, there could be nothing epochal in the speech of the chairman of the LDPR. It was neither an accountability report nor a report on the current moment. It was really not a report at all but a "speech," that is, a spontaneous spate of words typically in the spirit of V.V.Zh. It did not contain even a hint of a program of actions with the exception of a distant objective--in the next elections to be president and a closer-range objective--to establish a personal dictatorship in the party. And all the rest was words, words, words... I want to apologize to our readers: I perceived so ironically V.V.Zh.'s empty, Khlestakovian promises, his attempts to change from a toad into a prince--the new savior of the Motherland; I believed so strongly in the political acuity of the readers, in their inherent lack of receptivity to any attempts to return to totalitarianism that I have never once spoken out about the activity of the LDPR and its creator. Moreover, I have not considered it especially necessary for any publicists to take up space on the pages of KURANTY to fill this void. My only excuse is that many other people made wise by life have ended up in the same position. It is quite obvious to me that the phenomenon of V.V.Zh. is another instance of the phenomenon of Mussolini, Hitler, and Lenin-Stalin. How did they reach the political heights? With all the particularities of this ascent, they still have something in common. In all of their countries there was a postwar crisis--economic confusion, loss of confidence in authority, and, as a result, uncontrollability. And hence--all-encompassing FEAR. Further. None of the "ascendants" was in power; moreover they were persecuted, they were viewed as ODD BALLS, as completely "a breed apart," degraded and pushed aside in the same way... (Remember when V.V.Zh. shouted at a rally: "I am one of you!") And who does not suffer in a time of universal hard times... All of them made the sweetest promises of any kind. All of them were like MESSIAHS. It would all come true, everything would be all right. If only...we come to power. And you had better believe it! Rip out the tongues of the doubters. All of them are sent by the enemy, agents of imperialism, communism... Only boundless devotion and blind faith! No, they will not be saved by collective reason but a leader--a general secretary, Il Duce, der Fuehrer, the CHAIRMAN.... The scenario is familiar, it has been studied, read and reread, it is printed in thousands of kilometers of artistic and documentary film--and on you: The hungry, Russian people have taken the live bait once again. It is nauseating to talk about this. But necessary. Whipping Up Fear "The country has been suppressed as a state--it has fallen to pieces, the economy has been plundered, the national question has been presented in the most distorted form: When Russians are protected, that is fascism, but when Russians are murdered or insulted and degraded--that is democracy. None of the ideologists of the past could have come up with such a monstrous lie. (Applause) There have been conflicts among states and among groups of states, but to cut into the Soviet Union so successfully, to place the accents so well that we are in a state of war, but there is no war. We are perishing, the population is decreasing, we are going hungry, we do not have enough medicine, there are no places for recreation, science is not developing, and the population is getting nervous, but there is no war... "This is a well-considered large provocation of a worldwide nature. The Americans are the good guys. They have learned the mistakes of Bonaparte, the mistakes of Hitler and other conquerors of the West and the East who came to Russia with a sword and ultimately died by that sword. It is better to come to Russia with tights, with chewing gum, with McDonald's, with pornography, with horror films, and you will be welcomed. They will be glad to see you. The word 'dollar' will enter the child's consciousness, and instead of going to school he will be glad to take a rag and wash other people's cars in order to earn this green paper...." "The country is in agony, the regime is perishing, the regime will leave the political stage and as it leaves, wounded, it will take as much as it can with it to the grave..." "...The country is constantly in a state of covert civil war, on the threshold of more possible putsches, coups, and strains on the scale of the state...." Russians--The Odd Men Out "And everything is done very efficiently, it is camouflaged, covered by pretty-sounding, correct slogans: 'democracy, law, justice, human rights'--but the result is expressed in that again the best part of society has been destroyed or cast aside. They dealt their main blow to the CPSU. This party and some of its leaders did indeed make enormous mistakes, but the CPSU during all the 70 years of the existence of that regime recruited the best of society, and therefore for us, for Russians, it was important for these best people to continue to work for the new Russia. But the blow was planned in such a way as not to give them a chance to work, having developed anticommunist propaganda, anti-Russian propaganda, because Russians made up the majority of Russia...." "On the territory of the Soviet Union states were illegally created, states which had never before been on the political map of the world. In not a single historical reference work, in not a single encyclopedia could you ever find the name of such a state as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, etc. All this was territory of the Russian state." (Applause) While the Lithuanians picked for themselves the year 1938 and restored the 1938 Constitution, the Georgians liked 1921 and they chose it as the year that was best for the Georgian state, and in Central Asia they returned generally to the 14th and 15th centuries, we too have the right to determine for ourselves the point to which we will return so that there will be a point of departure, where the borders of Russia...." But let us recognize the borders of Russia, say, from the 13th century. I Came To Bring You Happiness "...Our Fifth Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is a congress of winners. We have won not only within the framework of Russia, we have won on a worldwide scale. Never before in the history of mankind has there been a political party that has achieved such phenomenal success, never...." Dear Vladimir Volfovich, that was enjoyed by Iosif Vissarionovich--the congress of winners. And the dear Ilich shouted in his guttural voice: "There is such a party!" You went too far regarding the victory too: You have not yet won in Russia (otherwise I would not be writing these lines, if I wrote them they would not be printed legally). That, excuse me, is nonsense, since a victory is a minimum of 51 percent in the State Duma, and you.... Well, you yourself know how many. So you can fool old auntie Dunya from Shchekov. But a victory on a worldwide scale.... Even Khlestakov himself would not have risked saying such a thing, in fear of being ridiculed, if only by Osip who was strictly a subordinate. "We wanted these times of trouble to pass as quickly as possible, these times when our people are dying every day, every day if they are born they are frequently born sick and deformed. Millions of women of Russia are suffering to this day, to this day they are living poorly, they have no husbands, they have no children, they have no means of existence. Therefore our task is to save our women, daughters, sisters, our children, to create more realistic prospects for our grandchildren and not build castles in the air. We will be able to start to improve life during the first months after we come to power. During the first years, and if we had been given the nine years that were in the hands of other political forces, Russia would be a prosperous state today." (Applause) Taught by the bitter historical experience of building the most just society, I now want to know not the final goal (it is the same for everyone) but the methods of achieving it. And V.V.Zh. game me an answer to the unasked question: "We will put a stop to the genocide against the Russian people, against Russians and any other nationality, we will stop the collapse of the economy, we will make the borders peaceful, just, and legal and eternal." And it was as though he drove the last nail into the coffin of the enemies of the Motherland: "Russia's historic mission is to save human civilization." As a citizen of Russia and a Russian as well, I am--for it. It is just that this phrase reminds me of another: "Deutschland Uber Alles!" And here is another thing our half-Russian-half-lawyer-son promises us: "We will give you an assignment like children in school: Ladies and gentlemen, let us divide up the spheres of influence once and for all." And who will agree to a new repartition of the world right now? Is this "assignment" not an appeal for oppression of other peoples, will it not provoke tension? We Say--Party, We Mean... Etc.--according to the well-known classical scenario of socialist realism. That is the way things went at the LDPR congress as well. "I hope that you all understand quite well that the leader and the party are the same thing... (Applause) But you must understand that if the leader of the party, like a good helmsman on a ship, could steer this ship through the reefs...and we have no rivals near us...in order to keep a stronger hold on the wheel of this fighting ship farther through the expanses of ocean until we reach the port of victory with the word "president" above it, we must make it possible for the helmsman to hold this wheel more tightly." "Therefore the party congresses will take place once every three years and the authority of the chairman of the party will be raised to the authority of the congress.... This is being done in order to promptly make a decision which previously, according to the regulations, could be made only at a party congress... "Therefore in the new version of the regulations the party congress will elect only one elective organ--the chairman of the party. All the rest of the elective leadership organs and top leaders will be appointed by the party chairman..." Where would this lead? Well, let dictatorship be dictatorship (or--authority, merits, etc.) but there must also be arguments for the doubters. They are very simple. "All this is related to the democracy under which we are developing--when there is a gangster economy in the country, when all norms and constitutional rules are being flouted, when they fire at the parliament from tanks... Under these conditions of dictatorship, violence, and arbitrariness the LDPR has to exhibit a dictatorship of the party leader in order to break the resistance of forces that are hostile to the party...in order to definitely reach their final goal--to make the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia the ruling party...to form a one-party government and occupy the highest post of Russia--the post of head of state." "Hostile forces"--that is quite Bolshevist, even Stalinist. And, of course, these forces are: the CIA, British Intelligence, the Mossad, the Germans, the Japanese--all of them, naturally, are pitted against "our party" to ruin it, to ruin its leader. And, of course, nothing will keep them from sending their agents. They do not name names but they hint at those "renegades" who recently tried to rebel against the leader who has overstepped his authority. "...If we allow them to rise higher in the party hierarchy, obtain deputy mandates, go to the parliament, then they will begin to bare their fangs, to show that they are wolves in sheep's clothing...." So stop talking nonsense, Ivanushka, sit there and be quiet, or you will turn into a beast... And if this is how he talks to his fellow party members, those who believe as he does, what will he do if he comes to power along with people who think differently? It Is a Terrible Weapon--Demagogy Like almost any other politician, V.V.Zh. resorts to devices of demagogy or else he simply makes things up. I have already mentioned his party's "victory" in the elections. But what kind of victory is it if, according to the complaints of V.V.Zh. himself, the LDPR is not now in a position to change anything: He says, give us power. "We (meaning the LDPR--A.P.) are free because Russia has not attacked anyone in the 20th century, has not committed aggression. And if Russian and Soviet troops turned up somewhere, 90 percent was for real aid. They took preventive measures to save the civilian population from the threat of destruction that was hanging over their heads." And there was no attack on Finland or Poland? And our troops were protecting "our interests" in the Baltics? And our "advisers" were not involved in Korea, etc.? "There is no extremism in our party, no fanaticism. There has never been a single drop of blood, a single political action which would cause uneasiness in our society. The most peaceful rallies, the most peaceful news conferences, the most peaceful party congresses. Never once has anything happened." And to call for redefining our borders, restoring them to what they were in 1975--is that not extremism? And the threat against the leaders of Estonia because of their Parteigenosse [party members]--is that not fanaticism? And the brawl between the deputy and the correspondent--is that "nothing" too? And the withdrawal of a whole group of deputies who were members of the LDPR from the faction, at which he himself even hinted at the congress?... Like those who voted for V.V.Zh. and his party, I can admit that I am prepared to agree with certain of his statements. Yes, the "party program" is based on the backwardness of society. Yes, the present government itself could be sent into retirement. ("And the longer this inept government remains in power, the more votes our party will receive in all subsequent elections.") But even with these points of contact I would never vote for V.V.Zh. and the LDPR. Since it is quite obvious to me (and this can be seen from V.V.Zh.'s speech at the congress) that the party's goal is to seize power, and not in defense of the interests of the people. And regardless of how mixed the "people" may be, they have one common desire--to pass through the mine field of reform without shock waves. The heirs of the totalitarian Fuehrers will not give us this guarantee. On the contrary. The danger from them is much more real than the one from imported tights and chewing gum...
