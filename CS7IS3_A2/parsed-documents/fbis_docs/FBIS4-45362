The document was signed between the Paraguayan and U.S. Governments in November 1993. Deputy Constantino Mencia Ayala, head of the Drug Enforcement Committee, argued in favor of approving the bill considering the need for mutual cooperation to control drug traffickers' international money laundering. He said the agreement's purpose was to eradicate money laundering through adequate cooperation between the two governments, particularly considering the major increase in mafia-linked financial operations to launder dollars obtained through the sale of narcotics. Deputies passed the bill by a broad margin and immediately sent it to the executive branch for promulgation. [passage omitted]
