During their conversation, both officials discussed issues related to the condition of Belarusian-French trade and prospects for its development. As its positive factor, Mr. (Boillo) pointed to the Belarusian-Russian monetary merger agreement and, among others, the results of the customs union between Russia and Belarus. According to both sides, trade between Belarus and France will only gain by the introduction of common customs tariffs on the Belarusian-Russian border. Mikhail Marynich emphasized that as a result of the customs union with Russia, a range of Western countries will view Belarus as a springboard for entering the Russian market, which, in the opinion of M. Marynich, will serve the Belarusian economy well.
