In particular, an important step will be taken to introduce foreign funded and operated chain stores this year. Zhang Haoruo said: China will pursue a macropolicy of walking on two legs in running its chain-store businesses. One of the legs is to bring in foreign capital and make vigorous efforts to run chain stores, which means policies governing Chinese-foreign joint retail operations will be relaxed further. He was certain that this measure would promote the renewal of China's traditional mode of commercial operations to a great extent and would speed up the reorganization and reconstruction of China's commercial system. The second leg is to use large and medium-sized cities as the basis, choose some solid commercial enterprises as the core, and reorganize and develop chain-store business and chain-store groups with Chinese characteristics. This senior official in charge of internal trade revealed that China is, taking sight of reality, actively communicating with major chain-store operators abroad. It will draw inspiration from the free and franchise chain-store practices of Japan and Southeast Asian countries. As long as conditions are adequate, restaurants, supermarkets, fast food shops, garment shops, optical shops, Chinese and Western medical pharmacies, bookstores, photo processing companies, and jewelry shops may all consider operating chain stores.
