FBIS4-6307 "dreas076__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-076-A Daily Report 20 April 1994 ANNEX Japan Politicians, Economic Circle on Political Reform Politicians, Economic Circle on Political Reform 942A0085A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 Feb, 1-4 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0085A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Article in five installments by reporters Shuzo Mochida, Midori Matsushima, Ko Hirai, Seiichi Nakamura, Yomei Tsuji: "Undercurrent of Political Realignment"] [28 Feb 94 p 1] [Text] On the late afternoon of 2 February Mr. Gaishi Hiraiwa (adviser at Tokyo Electric Power), chairman of Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations], and Mr. Shoichiro Toyoda (chairman at Toyota Motor), who has been selected as the next chairman of Keidanren, grabbed Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] on the corridor of the National Diet. They went into a small room. "I want you to repeal the special corporate tax that you introduced during the Gulf war when you were secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]" (Mr. Hiraiwa). "I want you to reduce the extra consumption tax on automobiles from 4.5 percent to 3 percent as promised" (Mr. Toyoda). "I don't know, [if I can...]" replied Mr. Ozawa curtly to the current and the next leader of the economic circle. The meeting lasted only three minutes. Repeal of both the special corporate tax and the extra tax on automobiles was incorporated in the "public welfare tax" plan, which was announced by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the early morning of the following day, 3 February [1994]. Therefore, the government policy on these issues had already been set quite a while ago. Condemn the LDP on Its Attitude Toward Political Reform Six months or so have passed since the birth of the coalition government. There has been a big change in direction of the economic circle's influence peddling -- away from the LDP toward the governing coalition parties. Such was the case also in behind-the-scene activities to pass the Political Reform Law. On the morning of 26 January, five days after the rejection of a political reform bill by the House of Councilors, Mr. Eiji Suzuki (adviser at Mitsubishi Chemical Industries), former chairman of Nikkeiren [Japan Federation of Employers' Associations], contacted the leaders of four associations in the economic circle and said, "We must speak up to promote political reform." He also telephoned the prime minister. [Mr. Suzuki] You should have a top-level meeting with Mr. Yohei Kono, president of the LDP, and reach some kind of an agreement. [Prime Minister] Would you in the economic circle also try to stir up public opinion? In the afternoon of the same day Mr. Ken Nagano (chairman at Mitsubishi Materials) of the Nikkeiren sent a fax to the LDP's headquarters, expressing his contempt for the party: "It seems odd that people who oppose the reform bill are the majority." On the evening of the same day Mr. Hiraiwa telephoned the prime minister and told him: "Unless the political reform bill is passed, we won't be able to advance our economic measures or Japan-U.S. talks. We must avoid a political vacuum." Also, Mr. Kosaku Inaba (president of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries) of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry said to the prime minister over the telephone, "We want you to yield when necessary." Clearly the objective of the economic circle was to compromise with the LDP and to avoid dissolution [of the Diet] and general election. The prime minister asked Mr. Inaba, "Please convey your message to the LDP, also." Hiraiwa Refused To Be Interviewed The LDP interpreted the offensive from the economic circle as "pressure" (per a person close to Mr. Kono). Especially offended were the people in the LDP's "anti-corruption" group. Between 25 and 26 January Mr. Taro Nakayama, former minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] and a leading advocate of the group, tried to communicate with Mr. Hiraiwa and others to express their thought: "Even if political reform is postponed, we will not attack the Hosokawa administration. We will go forward with economic measures and the budget." However, Mr. Hiraiwa and others didn't even offer to be interviewed. Mr. Nakayama was angered by this and said, "The economic circle refuses to listen." The LDP's promoters of reform, however, also contributed to the behind-the-scene maneuver of the economic circle. The reason Mr. Suzuki telephoned the prime minister was that he was prompted to do so by a telephone call in that morning from former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who said, "We must set up a top-level meeting." Former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu Gotoda asked Mr. Hiraiwa, "Please tell Mr. Hosokawa that if the bill doesn't get passed, he will have to assume political responsibility as prime minister." "They Are the Permanent Governing Party" The relationship between the LDP's executive branch and the economic circle had cooled even before then. On 30 November 1993 the leaders of four associations visited the LDP headquarters with a document calling for quick implementation of political reform. Mr. Kono snubbed this and said, "I don't understand why you don't ask for economic measures by suspending your call for political reform? We are much more knowledgeable on the issue of political reform than you are." Secretary General Yoshiro Mori was more adamant and said, "If you were told to do this by the Prime Minister's Office, it's disgraceful." To Mr. Nagano and others who began to rebut, he proclaimed, pounding on his desk, "The Nikkeiren should focus its attention only on wages and labor issues." A person who was at the meeting remembers that Mr. Hirawa's hands were trembling. The meeting generated a ripple effect: "I don't want to see the LDP executives any more" (per a vice chairman of Keidanren). There was no contact between the leaders of the economic circle and Mr. Kono even during the last stage of political reform. "People in the economic circle do what they are told to do by the Prime Minister's Office. After all, they are the permanent governing party," says a person who used to hold one of the LDP's three top executive positions. The close relationship of the past no longer exists between the LDP and the economic circle. We will follow the "current relationship between the political and economic circles" that began to oscillate after the birth of the Hosokawa coalition government. [1 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] Last summer the LDP borrowed 10 billion yen from nine city banks for its election campaigns. Repayment schedules have not been worked out yet, as an executive of a big steel company says, "Probably, they won't be able to repay the loan. They will probably have to arrange for repayment in installments over 10 years or so." An executive of a big city bank says, "If collection on the loan becomes doubtful, Sumitomo Bank, which is going to be the next presiding bank (of the Federation of Bankers Association of Japan), will have to negotiate for mortgage." Keidanren Issues a Document to City Banks Four individuals made a decision to request the city banks to lend 10 billion yen to the LDP, which played havoc with party breakups, and to have Keidanren support its repayments. They were Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa (adviser at Tokyo Electric Power) and four vice chairmen, who used to work for the automobile, steel, electric, and banking industries, respectively. But, the city banks strongly demanded a "guarantee" of repayment from Keidanren. This was due partly to the fact that the LDP had not repaid 4.5 billion yen of the total 15 billion yen it borrowed for its campaigns for the 1990 general election. Also, there were rumors that the LDP might slip from power after the election and be at risk of further breakups. "If the party breaks up again, we will be wondering which splintered party will be the LDP (to repay the loan)" (per a person in charge of the loan at a city bank). According to several people involved in lending at these city banks, it was finally agreed that Keidanren would deliver to each bank a "letter of de facto guaranty of repayment of the loan" signed by Managing Director Natsuaki Fusano, who had been in charge of [political] contributions. It was the first time that Keidanren had been asked for such a guarantee ever since it started to play the role of middleman for campaign contributions to the LDP. This is why the Keidanren declared that it would "continue to play the role of a middleman for repayment of this 10 billion yen loan" at the same time when it decided last September to discontinue its arrangement for annual contributions of about 12 billion yen to the LDP. Keidanren's discontinuance of its role as a middleman, however, had more than a little impact. Keidanren used to convene executives of its member companies in charge of funds in January each year. Following greetings from the LDP secretary general and others, the chairman of the Keidanren used to request cooperation from each of its member companies. Continuing, Stopping, or Reducing Contributions Keidanren gave its "official go-ahead" for subsequent "collection of money" from its member companies by the LDP's Treasury Bureau and persons on duty from the Kokumin Seiji Kyokai [National Political Association]. Because of the discontinuance of such arrangement, this kind of meeting will no longer be held. "With this recession, and as the LDP has become an opposition party, we can't give them money as we used to" (per Hajime Murata, chairman of Japan Petrochemical Industry Association). "There is no longer such a justification like defending the free market economy. It will be awful if somebody brings about a class action lawsuit of stockholders [against us], the filing fee of which is now only 8,200 yen" (per Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon). There were some industries that made contributions according the LDP's request late last year. But all steel companies curtailed contributions; the banking industry including city banks and Japan Petroleum Industry Association cut their contributions by 20 percent; and the Japan Camera Industry Association discontinued contribution all together. It became known in October that the electric power and gas industries, which were supposed to have discontinued political contributions as public utilities corporations, continued to make de facto contributions to the LDP as advertisement expenses. The electric power industry is called one of "five regent families" along with the banking, automobile, electric appliances, steel industries. It had been playing a leading role in making contributions billed as "advertisements." Along with the gas industry, however, it was pressured to "discontinue advertisements," and the estimated advertisement cost of 1.1 billion yen for the LDP was cut in half last year. The Pipeline Is on the Brink of Collapse Repayment of the 10 billion yen lent to the LDP means that each industry must increase its political contribution accordingly. Last fall's talks at Keidanren over the method of repayment didn't produce any results because of the diversity of proposals, ranging from "five-year installments" rather than "three-year installments" to a suggestion saying, "Instead of increasing the amount of contribution, we must handle this within the normal amount of contributions." Since that time, there has not been any discussion on this issue. Now, Mr. Hiroshi Saito (chairman at Nippon Steel), vice chairman of Keidanren, who objected to Mr. Hiraiwa's decision to back the 10 billion yen loan, says coolly, "Before asking others to pay, the electric power industry should pay for it first." On the evening of 10 December [1993] Mr. Hiraiwa and other Keidanren officials were planning to have a meeting at a restaurant in Tokyo with the LDP executives, including President Yohei Kono. However, the LDP cancelled the meeting on the very morning, saying, "The atmosphere [of the meeting] is likely to become uncomfortable" (per Mr. Kono). The largest pipeline for funds -- the "Keidanren route" -- is on the brink of collapse. [2 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] A caption next to a child holding a teddy bear says, "Give me dreams." A girl running with a balloon in her hand is accompanied by a caption saying, "Give me a season." These are part of a full-page advertisement placed by Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, Inc. in the LDP bulletin JIYU SHIMPO. Report on a thermal power plant in Hokkaido was paid by the Federation of Electric Power Companies [FEPCO]. The Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan paid for an interview between its chairman and the chairman of the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council. Leading industries, such as automobiles, electricity, and banking have made a substantial increase in their advertisement expenses for the LDP since 1990 so as to help the party repay its 15 billion yen loan from the banks for the general election of 1990. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, for example, placed full-page ads, such as an advertisement calling for the use of seat belts, in 32 of the total 48 issues published in 1991. Warning for Increased Unit Cost "After all, how many ways are there to gather funds? We make contributions to the party, its factions, and individual Diet members. Are we going to pay for advertisements, also?" "Jiyu Kikaku-sha," an advertising agency for the LDP, began to handle advertisements in earnest for the bulletin in the late 1970's. The above prediction conveyed by a businessman to a salesman from the agency became the reality in two to three years. In 1980 the agency received a request for advertisements valued at more than 300 million yen from FEPCO, which had supposedly discontinued political contributions. A former executive at Jiyu Kikaku-sha confides: "It was unusual, because up until then an ad at the bottom of a page on JIYU SHIMPO had sold for 300,000 yen to 500,000 yen. The amount of the fee had been determined first, so we were told by the LDP to make things appear reasonable for that amount of money." From the autumn of that year on, a report on nuclear power generation appeared in the bulletin almost every week. A person who was in charge of such advertisements at the LDP remembers the warning by the tax office: "If you increase the unit cost of an advertisement further, we will have to consider it as a political contribution." Jiyu Shimpo-sha's annual sales revenue stood at around 1.7 billion yen to 1.8 billion yen until 1989. Then, it jumped to about 48 billion yen in 1990 and 69 billion yen in 1991. "It has become inexplicable" even by the sponsors themselves (per a businessman in charge of general affairs). Adviser Jinpachiro Hanamura, who established the Keidanren route, points out that repayment of the loans for campaign financing prior to 1990 were made from funds obtained through the National Political Association. He adds, "If the LDP doesn't pinch and scrape, there is no other way to repay the loans than through advertising expenses." To Dietmen Through the Party Among contributions made through the National Political Association, it was reported recently that Mr. Hideo Watanabe, former minister at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT], had received "contributions with strings attached" in the amount of 40 million yen from a large general contractor over four years from 1988. A former chief of the LDP Treasury Bureau says, "Such contributions became widespread for zoku-Dietmen linked to particular industries. During my days, the party charged a 20-percent commission." Contributions through advertisements have also some "strings" attached to them. In 1984 a large mail-order company paid about 10 million yen to Jiyu Kikaku-sha for an ad in the LDP's monthly journal, RIBURU. Most of this advertisement fee was distributed to local Dietmen as organizational activity expenses and so on through the LDP's Treasury Bureau. This was done according to a prior agreement reached between the company and the Dietmen with an LDP official as a go-between. The "Keidanren route," which had been regarded as a pipeline for "clean money" that has no linkage of vested interests between politicians and particular corporations, also generated various forms of "exterior" and "interior" worlds. How much money in total is flowing from where to where? Many people involved in this within the LDP and the economic circle say that only Mr. Natsuaki Fusano, managing director of Keidanren, and Mr. Jin Motojuku, chief of the LDP Treasury Bureau, know the entire spectrum. Mr. Motojuku has been specialized in the accounting field throughout his work life and is also an executive of Jiyu Kikaku-sha. He is quite "influential," as one staff member of the LDP says, "Neither the general secretary nor the chief of the Treasury Bureau knows the total picture, and they both just rubber-stamp according to what the chief of the Accounting Department says." On the other hand, Mr. Fusano, a successor to Mr. Hanamura, handles the entire aspect of contributions at Keidanren. Right after Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa decided to discontinue the role of a middleman for contributions in August 1993, Mr. Fusano gathered people in charge of political funds from leading industries and told them that "I'm different from the chairman," suggesting that he would continue to play the role of middleman, albeit unofficially. Unsatisfied Over the Prospect of No Rewards Upon discontinuance of the Keidanren's role as a middleman, criticism from the business sector erupted over contributions through the Keidanren route: "They are like rent fees for a gambling house. No rewards" (per an executive from the securities industry). This is because a practical calculation that rewards to corporations are uncertain and also because of mounting dissatisfaction over putting money into a "black box" (per an official at Keidanren). [3 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] "I visited the vice chairman of Keidanren, but I couldn't accomplish anything." On 15 February [1994] Mr. Asahiko Mihara, chief of the Treasury Bureau of Sakigake [Harbinger], visited Keidanren to see Secretary General Masaya Miyoshi and Managing Director Natsuaki Fusano. Ever since Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, chief representative of party, paid a visit to Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa last year, the party officials have continued to request contributions from major industries. But these visits have not generated any results yet. Mr. Miyoshi and others advised Mr. Mihara: "You must be patient and should make frequent visits to the presiding company of each industry association." Looking at the Maximum Limit on Contribution About 10 days before Mr. Mihara's visit, Mr. Muneaki Samejima, chairman of the Finance Committee of the Japan New Party, had a meeting with Mr. Shoji Okuda (president of Daiichi Kangyo Bank), chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan. "If city banks make a decision, other industries will follow. I sincerely beg your cooperation." Mr. Samejima believes that February is the best time to request companies whose acconting year ends in March to appropriate money for contributions to his party for the 1994 fiscal year. It was February last year when Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa, chief representative of Japan New Party [JNP] before becoming prime minister, visited Keidanren to see Mr. Fusano and bowed to him, saying, "I beg your support." After launching his party, he sought advice from his close friends in the economic circle on how to raise funds. "He seems to have been thinking of some ways to gather money in small amounts and on a general basis from the citizens. But his ideas were all impractical" (per a young financier). Eventually Mr. Hosokawa gave up on his idea of gathering money "in small amounts and on a general basis," and visited Keidanren. One reason new parties are hurrying to gather contributions is that on 1 March [1994] the House of Representatives passed a bill on contributions to political parties, which would set the "upper limit at two-thirds of the prior year's revenues" for contributions for the next year. The amount of contributions to Sakigake is estimated to be about 600 million yen. But, if it doesn't approach 1 billion within this year, it will be cut down. JNP has also set its target of contributions at 3 billion yen. On 25 June, two days after launching Shinseito, Mr. Tsutomu Hata, head of the party, requested support from Mr. Hiraiwa and other leading businessmen: "Several of us have borrowed money, but there is a limit. I beg your consideration and support for our new candidates." Steadily "Organizing Their System" However, Shinseito, which "tided over the general election with funds provided by its executives, largely by Mr. Ozawa (Ichiro, head of the party)" (per an executive), has not made any requests publicly so far for contributions from leading industries. People in the economic circle are quite apprehensive about "how the party is going to raise funds." Having learned well the know-how of gathering contributions during their days in the LDP, however, members of Shinseito have been steadily "organizing their system." On the morning of 3 March [1994] a meeting is going to be held at Shinseito headquarters for the "yutakana jidosha-shakai o suishinsuru giin renmei" [coalition of Dietmen to promote an affluent automobile society]. It is to hear from representatives from three industries -- taxi, trucking, and automobile repair services -- on their "political wishes." The coalition is composed of 68 members of reform-minded Shinseito Dietmen from the upper and lower houses. Its chairman is Mr. Keiwa Okuda, former minister of the Ministry of Transport [MOT], and its secretary general is Mr. Shinya Izumi, a member of the upper house and former MOT official. People in the automobile industry predicts: "First, they are trying to cement their relationship with the MOT-related industries. Next will be us, in relation to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]." As this industry is closely related to the LDP's Obuchi faction, the LDP can't conceal its apprehension: "Shinseito is trying to squeeze in" (per an executive of the LDP). Between November and December last year, Shinseito had 10 or so breakfast meetings at a city hotel, gathering each time the chairman and other officials of each of various industry associations. Various opinions and wishes on budget and tax policies were communicated to Deputy General Secretary Kozo Watanabe, former minister of MITI, and Mr. Moriyoshi Sato, former chief of the National Land Agency, who is in charge of finance and tax policies. People in the economic circle still remember 1990 vividly when Mr. Ozawa was the LDP general secretary and made strong requests for support on general election campaigns to leading industries, including the automobile industry, by-passing Keidanren. One of Keidanren's vice chairmen says, "If he starts doing that on an individual company basis, it will be horrifying." Corporations Want To Avoid Sticking Out The "umbrella of Keidanren as a middleman" (per Mr. Hiroshi Goto, managing director of Japan Petrochemical Industry Association) is gone. As the LDP requests the same amount of contributions as before and three new parties enter the scene, industries and corporations are unable to decide on "how much money should be contributed to which party." "Keidanren is not making a decision, so our association can't make a decision on allocation. We decided to let each company decide" (per Mr. Higashi Tsuboi, chairman of the Fudosan Kyokai [Real Estate Industry Association]). "We are waiting for the next restructuring [of parties]. Even if we make some contribution now, we don't know what will happen in the future" (per Mr. Haruo Ito, managing director of Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, Inc.). Businesses want to avoid sticking out and are conscious of the lateral unity. "They will feel more comfortable if Keidanren makes decisions" (per one of the vice chairmen). The atmosphere seems conducive to generating voices for reviving the Keidanren's role as a middleman. [4 Mar 94 p 1] [Text] On his flight on 11 February [1994] to Washington, D.C., to attend a Japan-U.S. businessmen's conference, Mr. Ken Nagano (chairman of Mitsubishi Materials) of Nikkeiren sat next to Mr. Kosaku Inaba (president of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries), chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Renew a Meeting With the Prime Minister Mr. Nagano: "How about having a monthly meeting between the prime minister and the leaders of four economic associations? The information the prime minister gets tends to be from government offices only." Mr. Inaba: "That seems like a good idea. Let's do it." A meeting will begin after May when Mr. Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor, becomes the chairman of Keidanren. When the LDP was in power, the leaders of the four associations used to have a breakfast meeting every month with the party's four executives, including the secretary general, to convey their wishes. After the change of administration, such meetings were discontinued. There has been no regular meeting with the executives of the coalition government. "We don't have time to visit each of the coalition parties individually. Although we are not quite sure how much power the prime minister has in making policy decisions, we must rely on him" (per a top business executive). Holding a regular meeting with the prime minister is one way for the economic circle to rebuild its relationship with the government. Mr. Ozawa Criticizes Top Executives However, there is no unified way the parties in the coalition government look at the economic circle. When Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, chief representative of Shinseito, had a study meeting with executives from the financial sector on 17 February [1994], he made a reference to the Japan-U.S. economic summit, which had ended without any agreement on new economic framework talks, and criticized strongly the attitude of leaders in the economic circle toward Japan's current account surplus. "(Reduction of the surplus) can be achieved by either using numerical targets or strengthening the value of the yen. But they don't like either of these approaches. If we don't start working on restructuring the economic system, we will keep having the same problems. Nothing will be solved. Current leaders don't understand this at all." The executives gave him a big nod. Themes that the economic circle focuses on have gradually shifted from "benefits for the entire economic circle" to "reduction of corporate taxes" and "economic buoyancy." Depending on industries, there seems to be much more conflict of interests. Among management in the steel, chemical, and textile industries, some began to call for establishment of an organization other than Keidanren to represent the interest of the materials industry. At a meeting of managing directors of four economic associations on 6 February, Mr. Masaji Shinagawa (adviser at Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance Company) of the Japanese Association of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai] said, "If the people in the economic circle want deregulation, they should be saying, `We will give up on special tax treatment if corporate tax rates are reduced accordingly.'" Other attendants were shocked, saying, "Not to that extent." Under the LDP's reign, the economic circle contributed funds to zoku-Dietmen through Keidanren as a pipeline, and obtained such rewards as reduction of corporate tax and restriction on tightening the Antimonopoly Law and environmental protection regulations. At the core was "special tax treatment," and contributions were like "entry fees" to participate in this system (per a member of Keidanren). Uneasy About Independent Allocations A person in charge of political funding at a large manufacturing company seems worried. He says, "The reason why we continued to make contributions is that we had absolution -- the Keidanren was a middleman. Now that this absolution is gone, it seems too much for a salaried man to use his judgment in allocating funds to each party and to accept responsibility for the consequences." The uneasiness of corporations is also multiplied by a possible class-action lawsuit by stockholders that can be brought forth with only 8,200 yen and by the strengthening of investigation by the National Tax Agency on unspecified expense accounts. Contributions through the Keidanren route were also "membership dues" in the corporate society called "Japan, Inc." that was structured like a pyramid. The essential feature of the managed contribution was the balance among the industries -- half of the total was contributed by the five leading industries, such as electric power and steel, and the remainder by other industries. Maintenance of the order in such a corporate society was the reason that the electric power industry, which received criticism from the consumers and declared "discontinuance of political contributions," began to pay contributions as advertising expenses. According to a top executive in the electric power industry, Mr. Gaishi Hiraiwa was the chairman at the time when FEPCO began "advertising contributions" around 1980. As chairman of the Keidanren last year, he decided to stop playing the role of a middleman for campaign contributions. It seems that he had to close the curtain for the old system by himself, as corporate managers saw the era of rapid economic growth ending, and had to review the market share-oriented approach of their lateral thinking. The political circle is heading for restructuring at a rapid pace. Unreversable crustal movements have also begun to be felt by the economic circle
