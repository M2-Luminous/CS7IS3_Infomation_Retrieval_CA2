This is the question that interests the Bogota government in the midst of the huge scandal that surrounds Washington and Moscow. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry has already asked the State Department to explain if Casas Dupuy worked for the CIA when she was the cultural attache of the Colombian embassy in Mexico. Casas Dupuy, a 41-year-old intellectual, was arrested this week in the United States with her husband, Aldrich Hazan Ames, a high-ranking officer of the CIA, who is accused of selling secret information to the former USSR and then to Russia since 1985. Sanin said the Colombian Government cannot condemn the former diplomat until U.S. authorities clarify this question. She also warned that many times people accused of certain crimes turn out to be innocent. According to the Foreign Ministry, Casas Dupuy held the post in Mexico from April 1982 to December 1983, which means she would have been playing the double role of a CIA agent and a member of the diplomatic corps. According to FBI documents, the woman has worked for the intelligence corps since 1982. According to Gustavo de Greiff, prosecutor general of the Republic, if it is proven that Ames' wife was a CIA agent and a Colombian diplomat at the same time, she would be charged with treason to the fatherland. In addition to clarifying the functions the woman had in the CIA, the Colombian Government has also asked Washington to explain what was the purpose of Ames' visit to Bogota on 30 October to 3 November 1993, when he apparently met with Russian Secret Service agents. One of the clues the United States used to capture the Ames-Casas couple was an ad published by THE WASHINGTON TIMES last October that said "we are ready to meet in the city you know well." According to investigations, that city would be Bogota. The arrest of Casas Dupuy surprised everyone in Colombia, inasmuch as her friends remember her as a brilliant person who never showed any political inclinations. The woman, accused of espionage, graduated from the School of Philosophy and Letters of the University of the Andes in Bogota, and she has written poetry and philosophical essays.
