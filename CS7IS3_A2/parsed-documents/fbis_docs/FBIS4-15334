The press secretary of the president of the republic, Tofik Abbasov, told this to an AZER-TADZH correspondent. He emphasized that Azerbaijan's position remains constructive and is fully based on commonly accepted norms of international law in keeping with the resolution of the UN Security Council on a cease-fire, the withdrawal of all Armenian armed formations from occupied territories, and the conduct of peace negotiations. The principle of inviolability of borders and territorial integrity of states is a political reality, on which the entire system of modern international relations is built, and no one will be able to ignore this reality through use of violent means.
