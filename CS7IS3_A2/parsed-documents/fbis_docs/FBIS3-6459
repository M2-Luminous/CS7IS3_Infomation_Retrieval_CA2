"We haven't received calls for greater protection, but we will keep closer watch on those which deserve greater attention," said Chaiyasit. A secretary from the Israeli Embassy, Zosar Suk, visited Lumpini Park and inspected the truck yesterday. He met Pol Lt Col Aphichat Chuachet, deputy chief of southern Bangkok police, and asked for details of the March 11 accident. The diplomat declined to talk to reporters. Police sources said that after the Hebron incident, senior government officials instructed police to tighten security at a Jewish synagogue in Sukhumwit Soi 22 and at the Israeli Embassy. Police bomb expert Somkiat Nakhon said if the explosives on the truck had been detonated, the resulting blast would have spread over at least a one-kilometre radius. A police report seen by reporters said the explosives had an "inestimable destructive power". "I have been involved with bombs for 10 years," said Sgt Maj Somkiat. "This is the largest amount I have ever seen. It is the work of real professionals." Crime Suppression Police said they were joining with Bangkok police to investigate the case. All "suspicious" Middle East immigrants in Thailand were having their records checked, said Crime Suppression Commander Pol Maj Gen Wannarat Kaacharak. A police source said a number of Arabs had been under the police surveillance, but law enforcers could not restrict them because "they have done nothing illegal". He added that it was very likely the plotters were not on the police blacklist. "International terrorist groups like to use people who are not blacklisted in a country to strike in that particular country," he said. The source dismissed the possibility that the explosive-primed truck was the work of southern Thai secessionist terrorists. "Southern terrorists have never operated outside the southernmost provinces. And in this case it's quite obvious that a foreign facility, not our government buildings, was the target. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said there was no concrete evidence so far to link the explosives to international terrorism. "It's sheer luck that the truck owner sensed something wrong with the water tank," Banyat said.
