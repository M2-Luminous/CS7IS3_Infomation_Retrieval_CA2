It is possible that the situation in occupied Palestine may appear rather erratic: On the one hand, the people in Gaza and Jericho celebrated the departure of the Zionist soldiers and on the other hand one of the most intense armed clashes took place between the Palestinian combatants and the Israelis in al-Khalil [Hebron]. Is there a dichotomy among the Palestinians? Does this mean that there is one group that is in favor of jihad against the Zionist regime and another that is seeking a normal life--even though vicarious--on the sidelines of this regime? We should view the issue in a more comprehensive manner. What will the changes in the Palestinian movement be, the political role of the Middle East and even of the regions beyond it in light of current political moves in the region in which the United States, Israel and the West have used all their weight? 2. The motives behind the moves of the United States and Israel with regard to the Palestinian movement and the intifadah are quite clear. They obviously want them to be snuffed out as soon as possible. Military pressure has not yielded any results and efforts to sow political discord have also not been able to drive a wedge in the ranks. The only hope that is left for them is that the intifadah should be contained within narrow geographical confines and should be pitted against 'Arafat's forces. 'Arafat should be given serious support (military, political, financial, and propagandistic) and what the Zionist regime was unable to achieve, should be done by 'Arafat. What should the Islamic movement do in such circumstances? In my opinion, the current dual policy is the best one! In Gaza and Jericho, the Islamic movement should not become embroiled with pro-'Arafat forces who until yesterday were among the ranks of the intifadah. They should be strongly inducted into the management! Outside the confines of the autonomous region, the intifadah should continue with all its strength. There is no doubt that 'Arafat and Israel are apprehensive of any kind of victory of the Islamic forces in all kinds of elections and their effective participation in the management. Some reports indicate that Israel prefers that 'Arafat personally be in charge of administrative affairs for some time, and that there be no elections. In either case, the path will be opened for the victory of the Muslims, that is, if there are elections and they win or if there is a dictatorship and 'Arafat's supporters stand behind him. 'Arafat will be forced to ask the Israelis for assistance once again for his own perpetuation and the extent of the intifadah will continue in its own sphere of action! 3. Worry with regard to the assessments that I have mentioned above have motivated the United States and Israel to pay attention to the role of the Islamic Republic of Iran as regards the course of the intifadah and they are exceedingly afraid of the spiritual and political effect of our stances. The strong stance of the U.S. secretary of state during his address to a gathering of Jews in New York is a clear indication of this fear. Thus, the fabrication of a new preoccupation with regard to Iran has been placed on the agenda. Perhaps the most appropriate pretext and in fact, one on which they would have greater control would be some Arab countries in the Persian Gulf. An important point that merits the attention of the officials of Islamic Iran and the regional governments is: Our friends in the littoral states of the southern Persian Gulf should know that the United States does not have the ability to bring about a change of regime in Baghdad! The United States has extracted an exorbitant price for this promise so far. Therefore, it is seeking to clear its ledger, in practice, by its propaganda of a stronger threat, such as Iran. Right from the outset, it was clear that the United States did not have the ability to fulfill its promise, as Iraq is not a Panama or a Grenada! Even if it were, it would not have been to the benefit of the region that the door be opened to such intervention by the United States. This means that the sole path that remains for maintaining stability and peace in the Persian Gulf region is collective cooperation among the regional countries and that is all! 4. The Washington echelons have recently broken a world record in tactlessness: Their policy from the PRC, Japan, all the way to the Middle East and Iran is characterized by an egocentricity and stupidity which is the best way to describe their stances and behavior. In such circumstances, our foreign policy should be based entirely on the main axes of our national interests with extreme poise and we should refrain from getting involved in controversial and marginal issues, regardless of whether these controversial issues pertain to any links with the IRA or are provocations in the form of awarding literary prizes to Salman Rushdie. We have a momentous task ahead of us: To support the great Islamic renaissance [preceding word in French] and to prove that in today's world, we can transform our Islamic country into a modern and advanced country. Every step that we take forward toward the attainment of this objective is the biggest slap in the face of the enemies of dear Iran, proud Islam, and the great movement that our nation has brought about in the Islamic world.
