FBIS4-52973 "dreas095_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 13 May 1994 North Korea Daily Denounces ROK's `Joint Tactical Exercise' Daily Denounces ROK's `Joint Tactical Exercise' SK1505000994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 13 May 94 SK1505000994 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1225 GMT 13 May 94 Korean BFN [NODONG SINMUN 13 May commentary: "Dangerous Game of Fire Aimed at Launching Attacks for Northward Invasion"] [Text] Under the code name of joint tactical exercise for the first half of this year, the South Korean puppets started a joint military exercise of the puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force on 9 May. This game of fire, which reportedly will continue until 14 May, is being played more frantically as time goes by. This war exercise includes an exercise for combat preparations, an exercise for chemical, biological, and radiological warfare, an exercise for transportation of troops and equipment, and an emergency take-off and landing exercise, all of which are aimed at launching attacks against us. This exercise is being conducted more frantically in the northern part of Kyonggi Province, close to the Military Demarcation Line. On 9 May the puppets mobilized a large-scale (?flotilla) composed of various warships and conducted provocative war exercises, such as a maritime mobile exercise, while babbling about a need to get ready to take a countermeasure at the initial stage of war. The warmongers also conducted a joint airborne jump exercise and a joint field exercise with the U.S. Forces on the East Sea of Korea [as heard]. All these facts show that the war exercise which the United States and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique started this time is a dangerous game of fire aimed at attacking us in three-dimensional operations in the air and on land and sea. As usual, the puppets propagandized that they started this war exercise to get ready for someone else's surprise attacks and infiltrations. This is a mere sophism aimed at concealing their bellicose colors as those who deliberately aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula and rush to confrontation and war. As is well known, we hope that the problem of peace in the country and its peaceful reunification will be solved through dialogue and negotiations and are constantly making efforts toward that end. To hasten the country's reunification, we made public the 10-point program of the great unity of the entire nation and, recently, advanced a proposal for convening a national meeting. Moreover, under a tense situation in which the danger of new war is ever growing on the Korean peninsula, we advanced a momentous proposal on turning the Armistice into a stable peace and is making efforts to implement this proposal. It is clear even to a very small child that our efforts for peace and reunification are not intended for surprise attacks or infiltrations. It is the U.S. imperialists and South Korean warmongers who pursue surprise attacks and infiltrations on the Korean peninsula. As disclosed, the South Korean puppets have already mapped out new Operation Plan 5027, a plan to provoke a war of northward invasion with the United States. The United States is concentrating massive aggression forces on South Korea and its vicinity to inflict a nuclear catastrophe on our nation. It also has deployed Patriot missiles and attack helicopters in South Korea. The U.S. warmongers unhesitatingly make powder-reeking remarks that they would not hesitate to wage a war or refrain from launching preemptive strikes. U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, a ringleader of war [chonjaeng tumok], sneaked into South Korea and had a war confab. In the tactical exercise, the puppets moved massive troops and equipment close to the Military Demarcation Line and played a game of fire in the air and on land and sea. Needless to say, in so doing, they aim to complete their readiness to launch attacks for northward aggression according to the U.S. imperialists' policy of war. The United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must know that their dangerous game of fire, which leads the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, will never bring good results to them. The South Korean people will never forgive the warmongers who pursue fratricidal conflicts [tongjok sangjan].
