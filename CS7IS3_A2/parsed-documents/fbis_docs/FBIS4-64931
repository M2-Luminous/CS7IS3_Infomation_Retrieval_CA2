In the May poll a clear majority say no to the European Union [EU] even if Sweden and Finland join. Opinion's EU poll was carried out from Monday to Wednesday [2-4 May] this week and is based on 1,000 interviews. The poll leaves little doubt that the no side has a favorable wind behind it. Since February there has been a majority in favor of Norwegian EU membership on the condition that both Sweden and Finland join. In April, 42 percent of voters said yes, 37 percent no, while 21 percent were undecided when asked whether Norway should become an EU member if both Sweden and Finland joined the EU. The trend has now turned. In May only 36 percent said yes to EU membership if the two other Nordic countries join. A total of 41 percent said no, while 23 percent of voters had no firm opinion. The yes side is also on the retreat when voters answer the general question of their attitude toward the EU. Some 29 percent say yes to Norwegian membership, a fall of 4 percent since April. The no side falls back 1 percent, from 48 to 47, while the don't know group increases by 4 percent, from 19 to 23. [passage omitted]
