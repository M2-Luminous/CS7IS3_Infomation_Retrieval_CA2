Narasimha Rao, on Wednesday announced that presidents of Pradesh and District Congress Committee [PCC and DCC] would henceforth be not allowed to contest the Assembly elections. The party rules in this regard would soon be amended, Mr Rao said, while addressing a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) here on Wednesday morning. The Congress president said: "If they (PCC and DCC chiefs) (Pradesh Congress Committee, District Congress Committee) want to contest the Assembly elections, they should resign the party post first." Coming down heavily on PCC and DCC presidents, Mr Rao said, amid the thumping of desks by members that party posts should not be treated as `stepping stones.' "It was a wrong practice on the part of the PCC and DCC chiefs to contest the elections and thereby confine themselves to their own constituency. They should rather volunteer not to contest and work for all party candidates," he added. Mr Rao said if the PCC and DCC chiefs worked for all the candidates contesting the elections they themselves could become MLCs (Member of Legislative Council) or fight the next elections. The Congress president concentrated his attention mainly on the States going to polls next year, like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and stressed the full involvement of the party MPs (Member of Parliament) in explaining the policies and programmes of the government. He said the pattern adopted in the last month's Assembly elections in the northern States, sending district and State-level observers three to four months before the elections to work for the party, would be followed in the States going to polls in the next year. With regard to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and other States, where elections are due next year, State-wise in-depth study would be undertaken and corrective actions would be taken. He had expected that the PCCs and DCCs would take up this responsibility, but from the feedback he had this has not happened so far. Mr Narasimha Rao said from now on the MPs of these States should work out a methodology to face the challenges in the coming elections. In the next few days, he would like to meet as many party MPs as possible from these States for a general assessment of the political situation in their respective States and to evolve a strategy to be adopted by the party. Stating that the situation in the southern States going to polls was different from northern States, the Congress president analysed the problems the party has to face in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, such as internal squabbles and the phenomenon of regional parties. The party's approach has to be totally different if the Congress has to win against the regional parties. Another factor which the party has to take note of is the attempts of the Bahujan Samaj Party [BSP], headed by Mr Kanshi Ram, to cut into the Dalit vote bank of Congress. The BSP stands no chance of coming to power, but it might be able to cut into the votes of the Congress. He said in the normal course it was not easy to defeat the Congress, which has a vote bank of 40 to 47 per cent of the electorate. But, in a situation, where other parties forge a united front with the sole objective of defeating the Congress or where other parties raise religious and caste factors, the party has an uphill task of politically facing the challenges. To face such a challenge, the Congressmen and party MPs should explain to the people the adverse impact that would have if the Congress is defeated and the Opposition combine is elected. The people should be educated on the fact that the combine would disintegrate and there would be anarchy in the country and hence it is not in their own interest and the country's interest to elect such Opposition-combine. The people should be educated how development would be relegated to the back seat if the Congress was not returned to power. Briefing reporters on the meeting, the Congress spokesman, Mr V.N. Gadgil, said the Prime Minister was the only speaker at the meeting. The report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the securities scam did not figure at the meeting.
