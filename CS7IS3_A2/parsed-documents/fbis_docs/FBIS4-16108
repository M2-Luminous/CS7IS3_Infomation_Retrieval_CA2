The two TV-companies had their own TV-channels which, however, did not cover the whole territory of Estonia for technical reasons. After Ostankino TV broadcasts were stopped on March 28 because of a debt of 2.5 million kroons of the Russian TV company to the Estonian Broadcast Transmission Centre, the channel was allocated to RTV and EVTV at their application.
