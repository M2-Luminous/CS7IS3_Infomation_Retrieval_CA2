Based on selected interviews with 848 persons, representing 48 million Italians over 18 years of age, CIRM found that 48 percent felt that the economic situation will improve over the next six months, while only a week ago a similar poll showed only 39 percent so optimistic. This was slightly offset by 21 percent who thought the economic situation would get worse. While optimistic over the economy in general, Italians remained less optimistic over their own family budgets with 52 percent of those interviewed, against 60 percent a week ago, expecting no change for their personal budgets, although the percentage of optimists rose from 27 percent last week to 34 percent in the more recent poll. The number of those expecting things to get worse remained at 14 percent. On more political matters, the CIRM poll showed how a growing number of people see the formation of a coalition government, one of the two poles plus outside forces, with 61 percent holding this view compared to 54 percent a week ago. According to 28 percent of those interviewed, however, it will take between one to three months to forge a new executive, while 23 percent thought it may take more than three months, compared to 29 percent last week. The die-hard optimists, who saw a new government in less than a month, accounted for 12 percent of those interviewed, while 19 percent saw no hope for a government and thus new elections. The general uncertainty over the political-economic situation was also reflected in how Italians treat their money with many preferring temporary "parking" investment until a new political scenario and guarantee greater security and opportunity. According to the CIRM poll, in fact, 42 percent of those interviewed said they held checking accounts, 22 percent held state bonds, 19 percent were home owners, 15 percent invested in mutual funds and 13 percent in the stock market. The CIRM poll also found how 46 percent of those interviewed, against 52 percent a week ago, did not expect to be spending more, while those seeing their spending on the upswing rose from 28 percent to 33 percent.
