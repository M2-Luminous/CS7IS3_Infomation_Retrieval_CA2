Popov by Yuriy Strukov; place and date of interview not given: "Andrey Popov: `Will Bankers Begin Sowing?'"] [Text] Accusations against commercial banks have already become traditional. Inflation, the crisis of nonpayments, delays in the issue of wages, merging with the criminal world -- that is a far from full list of the sins ascribed to nonstate banks. Moreover, many specialists in macroeconomics believe that commercial banks, controlling up to 70 percent of the country's financial resources, are releasing them mainly for "short-term" trade and middleman credits while industry and the agricultural sector are expiring without long-term investments. The most unpleasant thing is perhaps that in many cases these descriptions of the banks are justified. What state laws and actions can be used today to direct the banks' activity into the channel of social harmony, to ensure that their revenue goes not only toward improving the prosperity of commercial bankers but also toward benefiting society? This is considered by A. Popov, a member of the State Duma agrarian faction, in a talk with our correspondent. [Popov] First of all let us describe the current situation in the banking world. Over the five years since the first bank was registered over 2,000 of these financial institutions have appeared in Russia. Each bank has occupied its own market niche. One group finances "short-term" trade and middleman operations, obtaining superprofits. As a rule these are small "fly-by-night" banks whose characteristic feature is the payment of quite high dividends. These banks' money is constantly in circulation so no effective investment return should be counted on here. Another group is far smaller numerically but it is represented by well known banks with a substantial incorporation capital. Here the interest rate on deposits is incomparably lower, which is understandable: The money has been invested in major projects and will not produce a rapid return. It is on these banks that we should count in planning investments. [Strukov] There is just one thing I cannot understand: Why do your "respectable" banks give themselves an unnecessary headache over long-term expenses when it is possible to effect an excellent money "turnover" through trade.... [Popov] The point is that a number of nonstate banks has reached such a level of stability and concentration of financial resources that it is simply not to their advantage to run risks by investing money in rather unpredictable trade operations: If they do not collapse they may still substantially damage their reputation. And reliability is strengthened only by joint ownership, through investments, of industrial, agricultural, and civilian real estate into which bankers will naturally put progressive technologies. [Strukov] But somehow the banks' desire to invest in plants and state farms is so far going unnoticed.... [Popov] I disagree. This process is developing. Whereas last year of 13.5 trillion rubles surplus in bank accounts just 0.5 trillion went in investments, this year the latter indicator increased to 3-3.5 trillion. But in one thing you are right: So far the state and its legislative organs are giving only feeble encouragement to this trend. For instance, everyone knows of the very grave situation in the agrarian sector. God grant that we can pay off the state's "Gaydar" debts not to mention long-term expenses. Some large banks have proposed to the top organs of executive power that they invest in the countryside. For instance, the following scheme has been proposed: We invest half the resources for a specific program under a Ministry of Finances guarantee, the state pays for the other half. A sensible approach, in my view. On the one hand the commercial banks are not yet so wealthy that they can take on all concerns for the countryside. On the other, it is possible to halve the "agricultural" burden of the state budget with its deficit and to lend impetus to the countryside's development. There is a similar situation in industry. But the government and the Ministry of Agriculture seem not to notice this initiative on the banks' part. I stress, they are not rejecting it but nor are they supporting it. It remains for us to pin our hopes on the federal assembly.... [Strukov] Perhaps this position on the part of the executive power can be explained by the information on the allegedly planned introduction of a state of emergency in the economy. Many experts are inclined to believe that this is borne out by the recent Central Bank decision to raise the minimum incorporation capital for commercial banks to 2 billion rubles.... [Popov] This measure on the Central Bank's part is in my opinion fully justified. There should be some kind of limitation on the dissipation of financial resources. A bank is a solid institution. The previous minimum incorporation capital -- 100 million rubles -- considering inflation can no longer ensure the reliability of a particular bank. Furthermore, as I have already said, small banks are most vulnerable to criminal structures. As for the state of emergency, I think our economy has long been working in this state. If someone has only noted this now, then I do not think there are grounds for global conclusions.
