Studies conducted in the past few years have demonstrated that capsaicin reacts with the C-fibers of the autonomic nervous system, facilitates the removal of substance P from the latter, and thereby lowers a patient's sensitivity to pain. Capsaicin has also been shown to affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and smooth musculature. Toxicity studies have established that capsaicin has a DL[.sub]50[/] of 1.1 to 120 mg/kg, guinea pigs being most sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] = 1.1 mg/kg) and hamsters being least sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] > 120 mg/kg). Its toxicity is highest when injected intravenously [IV] and lower when administered rectally or applied cutaneously. Three minutes after IV injection into Sprague-Dawley rats, capsaicin is already detectable in their brain, spinal cord, and liver in amounts several times higher than in their blood. When injected subcutaneously, capsaicin reaches its maximum levels in the tissues and blood after 5 hours. After 48 hours, rats that had received capsaicin in doses of 20 mg/kg had excreted 8.7 percent unchanged and in the form of eight metabolites. Capsaicin has a lasting antinociceptive effect. When administered in an aerosol (2-5 ï¿½mol/l), capsaicin stopped coughing in test subjects without altering the depth or frequency of respiration. When used as an inhalant, it has been shown to increase the minute volume and average frequency of respiration. In anesthetized dogs, capsaicin injected IV in doses of 10 to 300 mg/kg has induced a short-term increase in mean arterial pressure followed by a long-term decrease. Its hypotensive effect in dogs and rabbits has been attributed to cholinergic mechanisms but not linked to any effect on the heart. Capsaicin has also induced relaxation of an isolated band of porcine coronary artery that was accompanied by hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle only in the presence of endothelium and has had various effects on isolated segments of guinea pig ileum depending on the concentration in which it was administered. Capsaicin's main targets are the central and peripheral nervous systems. When injected intraperitoneally into guinea pigs in doses of 0.125 to 0.15 mg, it attenuates behavioral responses to irritants in areas such as the eye and nose. Practical application of capsaicin is based on its predominant reaction with the peripheral receptors of formations of sensory nerves. It is highly selective, and it maintains its stimulating properties when diluted to concentrations as low as 1:11,000,000. References 31: 1 Russian, 30 Western.
