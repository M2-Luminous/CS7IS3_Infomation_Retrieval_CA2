Social Democratic Party Secretary-General Wataru Kubo said in an interview with the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Wednesday evening that the justice minister's remarks would prompt the Diet to call Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to account and question Nagano's fitness to serve in the cabinet, suggesting that his party would make an issue of the comments when the House of Representatives (the lower house of the Diet) opens. Nagano has said the war was intended to liberate the colonies and create a greater East Asian co-prosperity sphere. He also called the Nanjing massacre of Chinese civilians and prisoners of war a hoax. "We have to attach importance to his having said that it is wrong to call the Pacific war a war of aggression," Kubo said. Pointing to former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks that the Pacific war was wrong and Japan was the aggressor, he noted that Nagano's comments indicate the new cabinet's policy has changed from that of its predecessor. All Japanese television networks, including NHK, reported that the justice minister's remarks were causing ripples in South Korea, China, Russia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia on their news programs Thursday. In particular, NHK reported that Chinese President Jiang Zemin had expressed regret over Nagano's comments in a roundabout way on Thursday when he met Bunpei Hara, speaker of the Diet's Upper House. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government and the ruling coalition, concerned about the unexpectedly strong reactions from Korea, China and other countries, will take action to clear up the fallout from the controversial remarks to preserve friendly relations with these nations. The steps will include having Nagano accept political reponsibility for the remarks and issuing a statement that they were his personal opinion and not related to the Hata cabinet's policy in any way. A government source said Friday the steps would be taken as soon as Prime Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa return from tours of Europe and the Middle East, noting the ruling minority coalition is in a difficult position as the majority opposition, including the Social Democratic Party, is moving to make a political issue of the remarks. The Hata government is worried that Nagano's remarks will harm relations with South Korea, China and other countries as they brought up memories of past suffering, he added.
