Perry and Hata also agreed in a meeting at the Foreign Ministry on the importance of a diplomatic solution to the problem and close cooperation among Japan, the United States and South Korea, the officials said. Hata told Perry if North Korea does not change its position, it is inevitable that the UN Security Council will have to discuss stricter measures, such as economic sanctions, against Pyongyang. "In such a case, Japan intends to take a responsible stance within the framework of the constitution," Hata was quoted as saying, adding that close consultation with the U.S. is important in such circumstances. He also pointed out that it is important for the Security Council to proceed with the discussions "gradually and step-by-step" so as to leave the doors open for dialogue with Pyongyang. Perry and Hata also agreed on the importance of China's role in persuading North Korea to change its position, the officials said. They agreed to closely watch developments between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the unofficial meetings with Washington, they said. The officials declined to disclose the details of the 75-minute meeting because of the sensitivity of the issue. "I don't feel free to say (the contents of the meeting)," Perry told reporters after the talks. Perry, who flew to Tokyo from Seoul Thursday night, was quoted as telling Hata that he does not think a military clash is likely on the Korean peninsula at the moment. Perry said in Seoul Thursday that North Korea may be ready within weeks to remove enough plutonium from a nuclear reactor to build four or five nuclear bombs. The IAEA inspectors were allowed into North Korea last month to check its nuclear facilities but were unable to determine if radioactive materials had been diverted to military purposes because Pyongyang blocked the inspectors from a key laboratory. Pyongyang in March of last year announced its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. On the bilateral front, Hata told Perry that relations with the U.S. will be an important "axis" for Japan's new government and that the country wants to deepen cooperation with Washington, the officials said. Hata is the most likely candidate to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Perry told Hata that the security arrangement between the U.S. and Japan is the pivot of security in East Asia, they said. Hata told Perry Japan is studying whether the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system is effective for Japan's security. He said he wants continued talks with the U.S. on the matter. The TMD system, an advanced version of the Patriot missile, would destroy incoming missiles while they are flying above or through the atmosphere.
