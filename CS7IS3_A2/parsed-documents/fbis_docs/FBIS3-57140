In his opinion, the new cabinet will prove to be a government of inflation. This is why the Russia's Choice faction cannot assume the responsibility for all its work. "The faction," Ignatyev said, "will apparently oppose some steps of the government, maybe even many, while supporting only two areas --privatisation, for which Anatoliy Chubays is responsible, and the international policy. "When we recommended Andrey Kozyrev, who is a member of the Russia's Choice movement, to stay on in the government, we were guided by the conviction that the Zhirinovskiy policy called for a serious, competent and balanced alternative, capable of preventing extremism from getting the upper hand," Ignatyev stated. Economist Pavel Bunich, also a member of the Russia's Choice faction, told ITAR-TASS that the the formation of the new cabinet tended, without doubt, to reduce the vector of economic reforms. But this, in his opinion, could partially produce some rather sound results. "The point is," Bunich said, "that inflation was slightly checked by means of both sound and unsound means. Combatting inflation by not paying wages to people was an impermissible method, while the restriction of credits and subsidies to poorly functioning enterprises was a positive measure. It will only be for the good of the nation if the new government manages to do away with this harmful aspect of combatting inflation," the economist believes. "Radicalism's attenuation in this sphere should be welcomed," he added. "However, regretful though it may be, the scales may be tilted further towards greater inflation," Bunich stressed. "Today," he believes, "there is a state of temporary balance. There is now an axis between the president, premier, and chairmen of the two chambers of the parliament. But as soon as inflation soars up, attempts will immediately be made to find a scapegoat. The parliament will point to the government, and so will the president. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the question of the cabinet's inefficiency will be raised within a matter of four months from now. At present, the situation within the government largely depends on the behaviour of the premier. Whereas formerly we used to claim that it depends more on Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, today we are witnessing the emergence of a one-man theatre." Leader of the Russian Communist Party faction Gennadiy Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS that a very difficult struggle was being fought over the new government. "At least two loyal associates of Gaydar -- Anatoliy Chubays and Andrey Kozyrev -- are now holding key posts in it," he added. "It remains to be seen whether the new line will prevail, the line aimed at stabilising and normalising our work, when workers and commodity producers will be encouraged, or we shall again get a compromise hybrid, which will not yield anything positive," Zyuganov stated. In his opinion, this is the crux of the ongoing struggle. "For the time being, it appears that the pragmatic line is getting the upper hand," Zyuganov stated.
