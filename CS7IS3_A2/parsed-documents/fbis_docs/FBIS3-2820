China's domestic situation is very good. In particular, a good situation of political and social stability and sustained economic development has emerged since the publication of the remarks made by Comrade Xiaoping during his inspection of the south in 1992. The international situation is also conducive to China's socialist construction. We should seize the opportunities and work hard together to develop the economy. Qiao Shi is a deputy of the Zhejiang delegation. At 0900 [0100 GMT] today, Chairman Qiao Shi arrived at the Labor Building, where the Zhejiang delegation is staying, to participate in the joint discussions of the delegation's second and fourth groups. At the discussion meeting, while focusing on the government work report, deputies Shen Zulun, Zhang Qimei, Peng Guozhen, Ding Bingyan, Sun Yongsen, Xu Cangen, and Liu Minchun, delivered speeches in connection with the struggle against corruption; the agricultural issue; economic reform; the relationship among reform, development, and stability; invigorating the state-owned large and medium enterprises; and the development of town and village enterprises. A lively atmosphere prevailed at the meeting. Many deputies from basic-level units vied with one another to express their opinions. While the deputies were delivering their speeches, Chairman Qiao Shi listened very carefully. Occasionally he interposed. He said: "Because of my participation in this discussion meeting, your speeches are fairly blunt and come straight to the point. This is good." When Deputy Lei Wenxian, head of the Jingning She Autonomous County -- the sole She autonomous county in the country -- spoke on how to accelerate the pace of helping poor areas to free themselves from poverty and become well-off, Qiao Shi interposed, saying: It is our resolute objective to free the remaining 80 million people of China who are still poor from poverty and to become well-off by the end of this century. To realize this objective, we must have resolve, and adopt resolute and effective measures. He said: China is a huge country, where development is uneven. There are poverty-stricken areas not only in the western but also in eastern part of the country. The party and government have always attached importance to this question, but it is not possible for the state to take over the entire work of helping poor areas. However, it is necessary to adopt appropriate preferential policies to help poor areas. The coastal regions in the east, which are relatively more developed, should work vigorously to solve their own problem of helping poor areas become well-off, but they should also do their best to assist western regions. When the deputies finished speaking, Chairman Qiao Shi expressed his opinions in connection with agriculture and reform. He said: When we say it is necessary to push the economy forward, we must first advance agricultural development. Agriculture was the foundation of our national economy; it is and will remain the foundation. If the foundation is not strong, it is not possible to develop the entire national economy successfully. Qiao Shi said: Our reform began in the countryside; it began with the all-around contract system. It was on this basis that surplus labor in the countryside could be diverted to developing town and village enterprises. China's development is out of the question without the changes that have taken place in rural areas. Therefore, at no time should we forget or relax our efforts in agriculture. Qiao Shi said: In attaching importance to and developing agriculture -- the foundation of the national economy -- we must not indulge in empty talk. We must have down-to-earth measures. To permanently preserve the enthusiasm of the peasants, we must not be satisfied with our development level of the past. We should continue to develop agriculture in depth and in breadth, develop diversified undertakings in all sectors of the rural economy, and develop farming operations on a massive scale that stress high yields, high quality, and high efficiency. At the same time, town and village enterprises should continue to upgrade the quality of their products. Qiao Shi stressed: Secondary and tertiary industries have expanded rapidly in recent years, but their growth has been closely related with agriculture. We must not assume that there are no more agricultural problems because we have reaped bumper harvests for many consecutive years and because the vegetable supply has not posed any big problem. We should always closely link secondary and tertiary industries with agriculture. Only thus can we build socialism with Chinese characteristics better. Concerning reform of the economic structure, Qiao Shi said: Reform is an unprecedented undertaking. The process of reform is one in which explorations are made, and it is not at all strange that some problems will be encountered. Of course, we should constantly sum up our experiences and strive for gradual improvement. We should undertake reform after drawing up a comprehensive plan and making all-around considerations. Of course this is good, but in practice this is not possible and does not conform to the law governing the process of knowing things. He urged the deputies to make proposals and offer their opinions to help the central authorities make policy decisions in a more scientific way, to constantly improve reform measures, and to ensure the smooth progress of reform. Qiao Shi said: Reform will inevitably result in the readjustment of the relationship among all sectors, and this requires all to increase their understanding of and support for the formulated reform measures. He said: We have the resolve and confidence to advance our reform to successfully build a socialist market economic structure at an early date. In response to some deputies' suggestions that it is necessary to overcome formalism, Qiao Shi said: Overcoming bureaucratism and formalism has always been a principle of our party. Currently, formalism is quite serious in some areas. The reasons are varied. There is formalism in leading cadres, in localities, and in departments. Therefore, joint efforts from all quarters are required to overcome formalism. After attending the meeting of the Zhejiang delegation, Qiao Shi called on some deputies of the Anhui and Hubei delegations at the Labor Building.
