As Palestinians, aware of our pains and the paths of our hopes, we, who are continuing to bleed, hope to transform the Hebron horror into action, provided we do so in calmness and with the firm heart of the warrior engulfed by burning fire, exactly as we ourselves are engulfed. We are aware that the Hebron massacre is one of the bricks with which Israel was built; a foundation made of massacres such as Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, the holy al-Aqsa Mosque, and others. As Palestinians, we are aware of the monster residing in the Israeli mind. Therefore, we must -- more than anyone else -- make the Hebron Massacre the last massacre. We must hold a sharp sword to cut off the head of this Israeli monster. This can be realized by adhering to two interconnected conditions: the first is national unity; and second, unity of aims. Let us now ask what we exactly want in terms of dues from the Israeli enemy and the international legitimacy following the Hebron massacre. For its part, the PLO, and in a proper international climate, presented its terms and said: Negotiations are suspended until an international response to our just demand for protecting our people is forthcoming and until Israel submits to our people's right to live securely without any harm and without the evils of the Israeli occupation. This can be realized by placing the fate of the settlements at the head of the agenda of negotiations. Therefore, the PLO's aim is clear and aboveboard. It is an aim that is commensurate with the peace option and at the same time does not deviate from the slogans of the Palestinian national struggle but rather gives it a realistic and practical push forward as reflected by this all-out international support. Now what do the forces of rejection in Damascus want? What do they want after the Hebron massacre? In short what is their aim? They are vowing three times [reference to Muslim decision to divorce a wife] to divorce the peace option. They adhere to the slogans of the Palestinian national struggle. They are solidifying like fossils inside these slogans, which reflects the current collapse and disintegration. In short, while they cannot stand the peace option, they have no alternative. They have been like this since they spread themselves out and assumed the garb of the opposition. Does this mean that there is a crack in the Palestinian national unity, that is, conflicting aims and disintegration? If we stick to the idea of room for tranquility, which we established at the beginning of this talk, we find that no one Palestinian will be able to outrun his Palestinian brother in his righteous indignation against the Hebron massacre. The feelings are the same although they take various forms. However, what is more important is the Palestinian stand on the causes and not only the results of the Hebron massacre. The Palestinian people have never abandoned their unity under the PLO banner in their rejection of Israel's unlawful existence and settlements on the land of the Palestinian state, an existence which is the primary cause of the Hebron massacre. In principle, we are united under the PLO banner in rejecting the Israeli settlers' existence. This was our stand before the Hebron massacre and will remain our stand until the removal of the settlements which constitute the big obstacle on the path of negotiations and peace. They are the time bombs which threaten to explode in a very dangerous manner. Palestinian national unity and the unity of aims cannot be undermined as the Israeli enemy hopes. In the blood, amid the fire, and in the heart of the storm and its dust, our unified and united people clearly see and are fully aware of how to deal with big events. The Hebron massacre, grave as it is, and with the challenges that it imposes on us, gives us more than just a vista of hope. This is the characteristic of the martyrs blood. This blood gives light. It does not extinguish our fire and does not disintegrate. Let the short-sighted ones understand and desist.
