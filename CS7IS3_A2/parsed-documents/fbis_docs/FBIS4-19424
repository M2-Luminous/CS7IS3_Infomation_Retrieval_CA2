Mr. Claes earlier announced Belgium is withdrawing its blue helmets from Rwanda. I asked him what he thought should now happen to the United Nations forces in Rwanda. [Begin Claes recording] It depends on the decision of the Security Council, of course, but I think that the opinion of the Belgian Government, on the base concrete and pragmatical elements we have obtained in Rwanda, is very clear. There is no longer any reason to maintain UN troops which were sent in order to stimulate the peace process of Arusha on the moment that a civil war is in the country. So we think that it would be wise to follow the decision taken by the United Nations in Angola. That means that, at the moment that a civil war started once again in Angola, the mission was suspended, but that an important unity was maintained in the country in order to promote cease-fire and to try to create the conditions necessary in order to restart the peace process.
