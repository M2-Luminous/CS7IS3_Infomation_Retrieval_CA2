This word is all we hear. And it is no wonder, since the state property is being divided up, and this is being done with a purely Russian sweep. According to the statement of Anatoliy Chubays, a miracle has occurred: "Privatization in Russia has come to pass!" But now let us take a closer look at miracles. When the question of the results of procurator's investigations into implementation of legislation on privatization of state and municipal property was being discussed at the meeting of the Sverdlovsk Oblast procurator's office governing board, the following question was asked, among others: "Is there even one object which has been privatized correctly?" Of course there is. By its rate of privatization, Sverdlovsk Oblast is one of the leaders in the country. Contracts of purchase and sale have been concluded for 2,650 facilities, for a sum of 9 billion rubles (R). A particular onslaught was noted in the sphere of services: Around 75 percent of the facilities in trade, public catering and consumer services passed over to private ownership. But, alas, these tempos and accelerations, these leaps and shocks! Is the state not selling itself off too hastily and generously, sometimes to the point of incredibility? That is banal, you say, we are tired of it. I agree. Yet the facts remain... Let us take, for example, the supermarket "Kirovskiy" which is known to all in Yekaterinburg. By law, it must be auctioned off in such a way that the state will retain its share. However, it turns out that it was sold to individuals--founders of the closed joint-stock company "Yunezis"--for a mere R10 million. A gigantic store--for the price of a one-room apartment. Moreover, the owners have up until the year 1996 to pay 90 percent of this sum. The management of the former production association (today the joint-stock company) "Uralmash" has handed over the former state store to the limited partnership "Orion" for R126,000. Moreover, by decision of the oblast committee on administration of state property, the laboratory unit of the Central Scientific-Research Institute of Metallurgy and Materials was simply given over to the balance sheet of the private firm "MKM-Standart." In this case, the value of the property, according to the certificate of transfer, comprised R1,836,000, although the actual figure is somewhat different--R31,347,000. These are truly czar's gifts. Such examples are not singular. Perhaps we could write them off to the shortcomings of the now former State Program of Privatization for 1992, which existed only until the end of last year. It was this program which set the so-called "accounting indicators for privatization of state and municipal enterprises for 1992 for the krays and oblasts." But to put it simply, the percentages on what and how much must be sold to private hands in one region or another were handed down from above. Moreover, it was reported that these indicators were "minimal." For example, the "plan" obligated Sverdlovsk Oblast to privatization only in the light and food industry, construction, retail and wholesale trade, public catering and consumer services, comprising from 45 to 60 percent of all enterprises. Thus, the fervor of some local bureaucrats stems from the authors of the now defunct program. It was primarily small enterprises, and more rarely medium-sized ones, which fell under these percentages. Yet the large ones which occupied a dominant position at the federal or local levels (and there are also many of these in our oblast) were permitted to privatize only by decision of the government or the Goskomimushchesto [State Committee on Administration of Property] of Russia. And so finally, on 24 December 1993, the new State Program for Privatization of State and Municipal Enterprises in the Russian Federation which had been presented by the government was ratified by edict of the Russian Federation President. As a man who in the recent past has had work experience in the supreme legislative agency of Russia, I am convinced that this program will evoke a non-synonymous evaluation among the Federal Assembly and will be one of the first rather debatable questions. As is the rule, the next program organically stems from the preceding one and at the same time contains much that is new. We would like to note two curious circumstances which lie, so to speak, on the surface. As before, accounting indicators are retained for the regions. However, while before they were directly secured in the program ratified by resolution of the Supreme Soviet and having the force of law, now these "guidelines" will be handed down to the agencies of state power of the republics within the make-up of the Russian Federation, the krays and oblasts by the Goskomimushchestvo of Russia, and moreover with increasing totals. That is the way it is. And there is no need to argue. Read the program, and you will understand why. With the consent of the Goskomimushchestvo of Russia, additional methods of privatization may be used, but only by those regions which, and we quote, "have reached the highest indicators in implementing privatization" and have been included in a special list ratified by the government of Russia. And since they have made it to this list, they have the right to independently make decisions on privatization of those very same large, dominant, all-federal and similar (with certain exceptions) facilities without obtaining any permission from the government of Russia. And so, there are the tempos for you! So it is better not to be indignant, but to get to down to business. And not to forget that "allocation of financial resources to regions is performed with consideration of their fulfillment of the State Program of Privatization." Skeptics will say: "There will not be enough money to buy such enterprises." And again they will be wrong. The program has one other peculiarity in this regard: While before the personal savings of citizens, privatization checks, private as well as loaned funds of legal persons were listed as sources of funds for acquisition of state facilities, today those who have no money can take personal credit in any commercial or, if you like, foreign bank. So hurry to get in line at the banks. Who knows, you may become a large-scale property owner... Of course, we cannot do without shortcomings. And the most unpleasant of these are violations of the laws. According to the effective legislation, the right to appeal to a court of arbitration is granted to practically any organizations, entrepreneurs, or simply to individuals. Here they have once again "forgotten" about the procurator. We are referring to the procurator of a city or rayon who can appeal to a court of arbitration in defense of state and public interests only through the oblast procurator. Although it is clear that this will require additional time and, as a result, the efficiency of reacting to violations of the laws will be lost. The oblast procurators, in turn, cannot independently protest the decision of the arbitration court. They must appeal to the Procurator General's office for this. This question was raised repeatedly at different levels, but without result. Moreover, we know that most of the legal violations occur specifically in the local areas. This is evidenced also by the procurator's investigations. Unfortunately, it has become a customary situation for private owners not to keep the enterprise which they have purchased, despite the conditions of privatization. In one of the largest rayons of Yekaterinburg, with its million-and-a-half population, there is practically not a single operating barber shop, and specialized bakery and dairy stores are violating the conditions of their agreements. There is no sense in listing all the destruction which has been permitted, due largely to the ambiguity, confusion and contradictory nature of the laws, as well as the personal irresponsibility and professional incompetence of the people "making" privatization. It is true what they say: Nowhere are there so many laws and so much lawlessness as in Russia. The new Constitution of Russia states that all types of ownership, including also state property, is equally protected by law. But by which one? By the antiquated criminal code, which has long been in need of radical changes? Or perhaps by the effective law, "On Property in the RSFSR," which merely declared, and nothing more, that the loss inflicted upon an owner by a crime is to be compensated by the state? The new state program will undoubtedly stimulate the process of privatization and give it greater scope.
