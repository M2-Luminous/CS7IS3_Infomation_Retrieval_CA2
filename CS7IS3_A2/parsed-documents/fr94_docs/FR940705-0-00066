FR940705-0-00066 FR940705-0-00009 EPA finds that the structure as provided in New York's SIP is acceptable based on section 507 of the CAA and EPA's Final Guidelines. Therefore, EPA is finalizing its approval of New York's PROGRAM. Comment # 2: The Erie County Environmental Compliance Services Program commented that New York's SBAP should be encouraged to utilize the services of local agencies that already provide assistance to small businesses in the State. The Erie County program, as well as several other local programs throughout New York State, already successfully provide many of the services/functions in rendering technical assistance to small businesses as proposed for the SBAP. The Erie County program endorses that local programs continue to receive state and federal funds, including funds to be supported by Title V fees, so that the local programs can work with the SBAP on technical assistance to the small business community. Response: EPA supports Erie County's endorsement that New York use existing local infrastructures as a means to reach out to the small business community. New York also endorses the concept. One reason DEC chose EFC as the SBAP is that EFC has the ability to subcontract with local agencies. EFC fully intends to limit the size of its in-house staff working on the SBAP and will use existing local programs to perform audits and conduct other field activities where the scope and volume of those activities exceed EFC's in-house staff capacity. C. Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision on November 16, 1992 that implements all required PROGRAM elements or delineates milestone dates for when any remaining PROGRAM elements will be enacted by November 15, 1994. Supplemental information was sent on January 14, 1993 and October 25, 1993, which included Puerto Rico's adopted legislation authorizing the PROGRAM. The final plan was adopted by the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (EQB) on November 4, 1992. Puerto Rico has met the first PROGRAM component by locating the SBAP within EQB's Planning Division and committing in its SIP to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a) of the CAA. Puerto Rico has met the second PROGRAM component and the seventh requirement of section 507(a) of the CAA by recommending that the Governor choose the existing Citizen's Ombudsman's, the Puerto Rico Citizen's Investigating Official as Puerto Rico's Ombudsman's Office. Legislation has been enacted which provides authority for the Ombudsman's duties. To meet the third PROGRAM component and section 507(e) of the CAA, Puerto Rico has enacted legislation which authorizes the duties of the CAP and the appointment of members. Because Puerto Rico has met all the requisite requirements and has the authority to implement all PROGRAM elements, EPA is approving Puerto Rico's section 507 program. However, Puerto Rico still needs to have an Ombudsman's Office in place and appoint members to the CAP, which must occur no later than November 15, 1994. D. The U.S. Virgin Islands The U.S. Virgin Islands has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision on January 15, 1993 that implements all required PROGRAM elements or delineates milestone dates for when any remaining PROGRAM elements will be enacted by November 15, 1994. The final plan was adopted by the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) on January 14, 1993. The U.S. Virgin Islands has met the first PROGRAM component by locating the SBAP within DPNR's Division of Environmental Protection and by committing in its SIP to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a) of the CAA. The U.S. Virgin Islands has met the second PROGRAM component and the seventh requirement of section 507(a) of the CAA by designating the Virgin Islands Small Business Development Agency to be the Small Business Ombudsman's Office. The Ombudsman's Office will be assisted by the Small Business Development Center of the University of the Virgin Islands. To meet the third PROGRAM component and section 507(e) of the CAA, the U.S. Virgin Islands will enact legislation to authorize the establishment of a CAP, and members to the CAP will be appointed no later than November 15, 1994. EPA finds that the U.S. Virgin Islands presently lacks the requisite authority to establish a CAP. Therefore, EPA is conditionally approving the U.S. Virgin Islands' section 507 program. Full approval will be granted once authority to establish a CAP has been enacted and submitted as a SIP revision. III. Final Action EPA is conditionally approving the SIP revisions submitted by the States of New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and fully approving the SIP revisions submitted by New York and Puerto Rico. The revisions were made to satisfy the requirements of section 507 of the CAA. Because New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands have made commitments that EPA believes meet the requirements necessary for EPA to grant conditional approval, EPA is granting a conditional approval under section 110(k)(4) of the Act. New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands must meet their commitment to have their programs fully operational by November 15, 1994 and submit these requirements to EPA by that date. If New Jersey or the U.S. Virgin Islands fails to adopt or submit any of these requirements to EPA within this time frame, this approval will become a disapproval on that date. EPA will notify the State by letter that this action has occurred. At that time, this commitment will no longer be a part of the approved New Jersey or U.S. Virgin Islands SIP. EPA subsequently will publish a notice in the notice section of the Federal Register . If the state adopts and submits these requirements to EPA within the applicable time frame, the conditionally approved submission will remain a part of the SIP until EPA takes final action approving or disapproving the new submittal. If EPA disapproves the new submittal, the conditionally approved Small Business Plan will also be removed from the SIP. If EPA approves the submittal, those newly approved rules will become a part of the SIP and will modify or replace the commitment and the Small Business Plan on which the conditional approval is based.
