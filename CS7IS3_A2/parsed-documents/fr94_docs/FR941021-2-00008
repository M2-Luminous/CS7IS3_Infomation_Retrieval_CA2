FR941021-2-00008 FR941021-2-00004 THE COMMISSION ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY NOTCH ISSUE Notice of Public Hearings and Requests for Written Statements AGENCY: The Commission on the Social Security ``Notch'' Issue. ACTION: Notice of hearings. SUMMARY: The Commission on the Social Security ``Notch'' Issue was established by the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102&hyph;393, September 10, 1992). BACKGROUND: The legislation adopted in 1972 to provide for automatic cost of living adjustments (COLA's) in social security benefits contained a flawed formula for determining benefits which resulted in higher benefits than intended. In 1977, Congress enacted legislation to remove this flaw. The new law was effective for all beneficiaries born after 1916 and the resulting benefit modification for those born for several years after that date created what has become known as the ``Notch'' issue. DATES: The Commission on the Social Security ``Notch'' Issue will hold the following public hearings: Tuesday, November 15, 1994, at 9:00 a.m. in room 111 of the Federal Office Building located at 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri; Thursday, November 17, 1994, at 9:00 a.m. in the Metropolitan II room, on the second level of the ANA Hotel, located at 50 Third Street, San Francisco, California.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Requests to present oral or written testimony at the hearings must be made by telephone to Karen Norrell or Ruth Anne Miller at 202&hyph;336&hyph;8730 before close of business November 4, 1994.
