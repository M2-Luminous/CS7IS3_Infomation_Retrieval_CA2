Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists said the full extent of the testing may never be known to the public. Aftergood told the REUTERS News Service that the CIA conducted covert radiation tests from 1953 to 1967 but many files on the tests were destroyed in 1973. The revelation came one day after the establishment of a joint task force that would coordinate the investigation efforts by about half a dozen of government departments on the tests. The inter-agency probe would involve the Energy Department, the Defense Department, the Veterans Affairs Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The White House said it expects that the CIA would cooperate with the government-wide investigation of the tests, probably involved some 800 U.S. citizens, some without knowing the nature of the testings. Media reports said the testing subjects included retarded children fed radioactive milk and cereal and inmates received x- rays. Aftergood said CIA had also done drug testing and "the drug testing was part of a larger program which included studies on the effects of radiation and a number of other things."
