The organization will be called the 2000 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement [Movimiento Revolucionario Bolivariano 2000 -- a play on the name of Chavez's military movement, the 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement, which emerged during the 4 February 1992 coup attempt]. Chavez and 14 lower-ranking officers of the Venezuelan Army were released today. They were pardoned by President Rafael Caldera who is seeking reconciliation within the Armed Forces after the two 1992 coup attempts. Dozens of supporters were waiting for Chavez when he was released at the military hospital were he had been held. He called on them to search for "the structural changes needed by the country" by forming a "wide national front." The Bolivarian Movement emerged after the 4 February 1992 military coup attempt against then-President Carlos Andres Perez on the grounds that Perez's economic adjustment policies were hurting the people. Meanwhile, thousands of other supporters gathered outside the San Carlos de Caracas military garrison to receive the 14 officres who participated with Chavez in the coup against Perez, whom they accused of being "corrupt and a traitor." Meanwhile, in Peru, General Francisco Visconti, one of the leaders of the 27 November 1992 military uprising, announced that at least 25 officers who took asylum in that country would return to Venezuela to surrender to military justice tomorrow, Sunday. With the release of Chavez and the 14 officers, the number of people granted presidential pardons, which are part of President Rafael Caldera's so-called "pacification policy," has risen to 60. With the exception of Gen. Visconti and the 46 officers who took asylum in Peru, practically all of the leaders of the two coup attempts carried out two years ago have been released.
