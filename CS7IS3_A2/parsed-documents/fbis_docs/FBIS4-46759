The struggle for independence in the colonial republics is a direct continuation of this national awakening movement. As long as the Union was preserved, it is clear that basic democratic reform in some of the republics was not implemented. Thus, there was a need for a political organization with a national orientation in Uzbekistan. The Erk Democratic Party came to the fore to fill this need. From the time the party was formed it set for itself the goal of national independence and used its power in this direction. On the foundation of the earlier national awakening and this movement, basic reform in society was the path selected by Erk. Viewed from this point of view, it was natural that the national aim was not to move toward the literal concept of "democracy" accepted in the West. Forces not completely understanding the meaning of this began to take aim at Erk from various directions the day it was founded. On one hand, representatives of the totalitarian regime placed obstacles in its way (this is why the party was not officially registered for a long time), and on the other, radical communists who had suddenly become "democrats" attacked it. Perestroyka was brought about through the dismantling of the empire, and its colonialized people attained national liberation. Under this historical situation, communists who had turned into "democrats," including representatives of the Birlik movement such as Abdurayim Polatov, completely repudiated the goal of independence; "we will not separate from Moscow: If we separate from Moscow, we will be unable to attain democracy," they claimed. However, the healthy part of the Birlik movement was together with the Erkists in this struggle. The majority of the members of this movement joined the ranks of Erk. This became especially evident during the referendum held to preserve the Union. Under existing circumstances the forming of democratic traditions in the concept of a nation and in society became a regular duty. Thus the Erk party, as a constructive opposition, opted for the parliamentary way of democratic struggle, in other words, entering the government through the electoral process. In the Baltic republics, representatives of the national movement came into the government by means of elections, also. On the basis of the plan and struggle of the Erk party, the passing of the Declaration of Independence at the Supreme Council of Uzbekistan and the participation of Muhammad Solih, the founder and chairman of the party, in the presidential elections was an expression of this goal. These actions undoubtedly raised the political understanding of the nation. After the elections the party continued its path of struggle, and ERK, its press organ, continued to cast light on events in the Republic although it was placed under merciless censorship. Erk did not stop at this. It gave precedence to the people's interests and its own suggestions, and struggled to introduce these into the direction of the government. Forces in favor of strengthening democratic principles in the government began to group around Erk and the Forum of Democratic Forces of Uzbekistan was formed. Birlik also joined this Forum. Birlik cochairmen and activists Bek Toshmuhamedov, Gulchehra Nurullayeva, Dadakhon Hasan, and others demonstrated that Erk was firmly on the road. Not only did the government oppose the formation and activity of the Forum, but also the Polatovs, whose goal and struggle was unknown. Individuals who attach the title of "democrats" to themselves like Abdurayim Polatov, who was then and is now a communist, have found no other function than denigrating the Erk party. For example, it is sometimes forgotten that Polatov, who calls himself a "democrat" and yelled "Down with communism!", was secretary of the Communist Party's primary party organization at the Cybernetics Institute where he worked. I was never a communist, but if I had been, I would have been ashamed at yelling something like that. After the Istiklol Yoli [Independence Road] Party was founded, I expressed my opinion about this on Radio Liberty. In response, Abdurayim Polatov, in a radio interview, said that he was glad and the government was also glad that two traitors had left the Erk party. Polatov lied when he said in his interview that "Erk was founded before the parliamentary elections of 1990." In the first place, the 1990 parliamentary elections took place in February 1990. As for the Erk party, it was founded in April 1990. And Muhammad Solih was not elected to parliament in his capacity as party chairman, but as a writer and public servant known to the people. Polatov has accused Erk of being in the constructive opposition. Yes, we are a party of constructive opposition now and in the future. We are different from the "shadow parties," which declare the government's line to be their own line, and the radical communists, who lack both their own line and proposals for one. The Erk party has a clear program in every sector and concrete proposals which it has stated to the government in every sector. We are fighting to apply this program to life. If we come to the allegation of Abdurayim Polatov, the only reason for this is that he is jealous of the Erk party, because when Erk was organized in April 1990 he himself was struggling to organize a party. He named it the Birlik party. But the majority of Birlikists refused to join it. The basic democratic forces today are grouped around Erk, and the party, under the present serious conditions, is acting in solidarity with all progressive forces in the Republic. Our friends, who know themselves to be true Birlikists, are fighting shoulder to shoulder with us. Following the last party congress, democratically inclined religious officials, who had wavered earlier, joined our struggle. Their activity has been a great help to us since the Erk party wants our nation to be formed as a nation of high principle. There are those who do not recognize this unity movement. But there are more who do than do not. They are the Uzbek people.
