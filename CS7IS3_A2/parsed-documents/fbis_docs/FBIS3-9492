The rump Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- said NATO had used the threat of force without the required authorization of the UN Security Council. Yugoslavia's suit cited the decision taken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at a Feburary 9 meeting in Brussels that warned Bosnian Serbs to withdraw heavy guns from Sarajevo or face NATO air strikes.
