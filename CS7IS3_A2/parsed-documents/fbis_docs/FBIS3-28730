Hata reacted strongly, saying: "The United States may be thinking it is something like a tax rebate. The package worth a total of 15.25 billion yen is the largest in scale in history. The United States does not yet understand what it is about." Asked about the view that the United States might incite a further increase of the yen value on the exchange market should the Japan-U.S. framework talks end in failure, Hata said: "The exchange market is something that reflects the fundamentals [preceding word published in English] of that nation. An incitement by words only does not have a long-lasting effect." He then complained harshly: "An official in an influential position should be very careful about what he says." Speaking about his talks with top U.S. leaders preceding the Japan-U.S. summit meeting, he reiterated the position of not accepting U.S. demands in the economic framework talks regarding numerical targets. He said: "Japan is making steady progress toward removal of its surplus. If I speak frankly, they will probably come to understand it." But he added: "I would like to hold a dialogue, based on the principle that numerical targets cannot be accepted."
