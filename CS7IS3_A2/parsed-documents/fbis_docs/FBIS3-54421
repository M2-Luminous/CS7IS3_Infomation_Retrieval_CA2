Besharati described the dispute between Iran and the UAE over "some islands" as "simple" and to be solved "by dialogue." He added in a press conference in Doha yesterday, Saturday, that relations between Iran and the UAE are "good" and have always been good. Observers think that Besharati's statements, in spite of the fact that they represent the moderate side of Tehran's position on the dispute over the islands, do not offer the truth about the details of the conflict between the UAE and Iran and are not a "suitable" position from which to arrive at a peaceful settlement through direct dialogue. These observers pointed out that Besharati is talking about solving the dispute over "some islands" without naming them, and that it is known that he means the island of Abu Musa, which has been administrated by a memorandum of understanding between the two countries since 1971. The Iranian interior minister does not mean the Greater and Lesser Tunb Islands, which Iran occupied in 1971. In spite of the fact that Besharati's position "is lacking" and does not offer any practical steps leading to a direct dialogue with the UAE on the matter of the three islands, in the opinion of Gulf political circles it is a more advanced position than that of the Iranian foreign [policy] position. [passage omitted on Iranian official statement] Observers indicate that Besharati's statement about good relations with the UAE is a new element in the Iranian lexicon and will permit contacts to be made with some parties in the Iranian leadership in Tehran. It appears that the politicians in the UAE are well versed in the inconsistencies in Tehran, since the UAE's ambassador in Tehran, Muhammad Ahmad Bu-Rahimah, has met with the Iranian interior minister, who affirmed after the meeting that "the differences with the UAE are simple." However, political circles in Abu Dhabi do not see such a meeting as a dialogue with Tehran, because the Iranian position, with all its factions, is not considered suitable to conduct a direct dialogue to arrive at a peaceful solution to the islands issue. UAE Foreign Minister Rashid 'Abdallah al-Nu'aymi states that any meetings with Iranian officials, among them his meeting with 'Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister, on the international and regional conference level, are "contacts" and not "a dialogue." The UAE conditions such a dialogue on Tehran's decision to deal with the three islands in it. [passage omitted on history of the dispute] Political circles state that the position of Iran on the UAE islands issue will have a great impact in determining the Iranian role and cooperation with the other countries of the region in maintaining security and stability. The eight states that signed "the Damascus declaration" support the UAE's position on the islands issue and its settlement by peaceful means. [passage omitted]
