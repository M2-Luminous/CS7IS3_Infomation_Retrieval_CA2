The government of Judge Emile Jonassaint raised a vigorous protest against President Clinton's recent statements, according to which Haiti is located in the United States' backyard. Such untimely statements clearly violate the cardinal and universal principles of sovereignty and self-determination that govern relations among nations, writes the Ministry of Information in a press release. The land of Haiti is not and will never be the backyard of any state, not even of the world's most powerful, continues the government press release which also denounces the unspeakable behavior of unnatural sons of the homeland who, obsessed with the passion of power, offer the country's detractors an opportunity to degrade it.
