Diplomatic sources in Athens revealed that the U.S. ambassador to Greece, Thomas Niles, had personally vetted North Macedonia as the best name for Skopje in a confidential cable to the State Department, shortly before Mr Papandreou's departure for Washington on Monday. The premier arrived last night in Washington. Mr Niles confided to a group of Greek diplomats he had invited for dinner at his home. He said he thought the question of the Skopje flag and any usurpation of Greek symbols were capable of quick resolution once the name issue had been agreed. The ambassador conveyed his optimism that the Greek premier's visit to the White House would be "productive." "If you manage to wrap up the Skopje issue, Greece can then become the major power in the Balkans" and dominate the region economically, the U.S. envoy was quoted as telling his Greek guests. When Mr Niles was asked by his guests whether Skopje President Kiro Gligorov would agree to a North Macedonia deal, their host replied that "this name has already been tabled" at the meetings which UN mediator Cyrus Vance has held in New York with Skopje's Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski and the Greek envoy Khristos Zakharakis. Mr Niles is also said to have revealed U.S. initiatives on armed flights over the Aegean by both Turkey and Greece, pressuring each side to stop the flights which provoke tension in Greek-Turkish relations.
