The face value of the property privatized is US $4.424 million. Lithuania will continue to follow the present model of privatization for hard currency; it is slower but more profitable, said Arvydas Darulis, head of the Economics Ministry's Privatization Department. A new, accelerated privatization method, slightly resembling the Estonian one, will be tested in Lithuania in the near future, he said. The so called Fast-Track privatization plan is currently under preparation in collaboration with consultants from the EC PHARE program and the international consortium Roland Berger and Partner GmbH. According to the program, ten to twenty strategically insignificant enterprises will be chosen for privatization and presented in a single list. The list is most likely to include several hotels, restaurants, huge shops and small industrial companies. The terms of privatization contests will be much more liberal compared to the present ones which limit participation of foreigners. Mr. Darulis noted greatest advantage the fact is of the program that foreigners will be able to privatize property fast and without any major hindrances. The method is expected to attract more foreign investments.
