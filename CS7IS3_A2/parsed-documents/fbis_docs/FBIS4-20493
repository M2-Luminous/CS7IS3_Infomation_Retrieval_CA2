Under the direction of CAS Academician Prof. Chen Jiaer [7115 0163 3167], physicists in the joint research group used a small accelerator providing 374-kV, 1.036-kA electron beams to generate a laser output power of 9.1 MW (at a wavelength of 8.3 mm) with an efficiency of 2.3 percent, an order of magnitude [i.e., 10 times] higher than realized with similar foreign apparatuses.
