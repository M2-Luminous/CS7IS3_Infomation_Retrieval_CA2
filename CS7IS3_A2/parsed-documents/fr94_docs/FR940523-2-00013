FR940523-2-00013 FR940523-2-00007 Zunyi and Novachem assert that the application in this case of the test utilized in Castings is inappropriate for the following reasons. First, since questionnaires were not issued until three months after the Sparklers decision was rendered, Zunyi and Novachem maintain that reliance on an approach in place at time of initiation is inappropriate. Second, Zunyi and Novachem state that the Court of International Trade (CIT) has directed the Department to apply the Sparklers methodology in a remand of Castings, the very case on which the Department based its approach in this review. Third, Zunyi and Novachem claim that in reviews being conducted during the same time period as this one, the Department has utilized the methodology set forth in Sparklers. As an example, Zunyi and Novachem point to the 1988&hyph;1989 review of Shop Towels from the People's Republic of China, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 60,969 (Nov. 29, 1991), where the Department requested information after the preliminary determination to determine whether the respondent qualified for a separate rate under the Sparklers criteria. Zunyi and Novachem argue that not to issue a new separate rates questionnaire in this review would be arbitrary and capricious. Finally, Zunyi and Novachem assert that it is within the capacity of the Department to change methodologies within reviews and that, in light of the above claims, the Department should now issue a questionnaire based on the Sparklers test to determine whether PRC respondents qualify for a separate rate. Petitioner points out that the separate rates test set forth in Sparklers does not, in fact, constitute a new methodology, but is merely a continuation and elaboration of that set forth in Castings. Furthermore, petitioner asserts that respondents were on notice regarding what they were required to show to obtain a separate rate under Castings, since that decision was cited in the petitioner's request for review and because the Department requested from them the information needed to make a separate rate decision. Petitioner also notes that the remand of the Department's determination in Castings was based on the fact that because the Castings test was not enunciated until the final results of that review, respondents had not been given an opportunity to attempt to demonstrate their entitlement to a separate rate, even under the Castings criteria (``a clear showing of legal, financial and economic independence''). Finally, petitioner states that the Department has broad discretion in choosing methodologies, and that the choice of methodology may vary on a case-by-case basis. DOC Position : The Department agrees with the petitioner. The Castings test and the methodology utilized in Sparklers and most recently in Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China (Silicon Carbide) 59 FR 22585 (May 2, 1994) require that producers and exporters in the PRC receive a single rate unless it is clearly demonstrated that a particular entity is not subject to governmental control and therefore merits its own rate. The test employed in Sparklers and Silicon Carbide built upon that used in Castings by outlining specific criteria that we would consider in determining whether an entity had shown such autonomy. In this case, Zunyi did not demonstrate adequately that it was free of governmental control under any of these tests. Indeed, information on the record indicates that Zunyi was controlled by municipal authorities. For example, during this period of review, Zunyi was subject to guidance from municipal authorities regarding output in terms of value and production, and was not allowed to enter into contracts with foreign entities or to export directly. (See DOC Position to Comment 2.) Furthermore, the Department's use of a questionnaire based on the Castings test has not prejudiced respondents' position. The respondents were on notice with respect to their burden of showing their independence from governmental control if they desired to be given a separate rate. The supplemental questionnaire sent to Zunyi and other PRC entities states: ``[I]f you feel that your client is entitled to a separate rate, submit for the record all documentation that supports your client's claim of legal, financial, and economic independence.'' Furthermore, respondents were specifically requested to provide information regarding their corporate organization, relationships with other businesses, state-ownership, decision making processes, and corporate accounting information. In addition, Part Two of Appendix V of the questionnaire, the section directed specifically to manufacturers, requested information on production for export, relationships with exporters and how pricing decisions were made with them, pricing and production methods in general, government policy directives affecting pricing and production quantity decisions, and relevant regulatory systems. Thus, respondents have already been afforded an opportunity to provide whatever information they feel may support their request for separate rates.
