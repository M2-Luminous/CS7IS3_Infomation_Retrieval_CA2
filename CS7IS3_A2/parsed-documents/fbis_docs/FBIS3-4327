This proved the prediction of some experts: In the year of reform, contradictions in relations will appear. How will the Chinese authorities react? Will they make further advances or withdraw? Various signals have attracted attention from all quarters concerned, because the orientation of reform has been continuously discussed by people outside the mainland since last autumn. This year, China's economic train will continue to run at a high speed, and the growth rate may even exceed the high figures of the two previous years. This was predicted by many Chinese economic experts. Both the predictions of experts and the official statistics showed that industrial production in the first quarter of this year would continue to increase rapidly, and it was expected that the total industrial output value would increase by 22 percent over the same period last year. Up to the end of January, the total industrial output value increased by 33.2 percent over the same period last year. The State Information Center revealed more startling figures: Since February 1992, the industrial output value had almost always remained at a level above 20 percent, and in December 1993, the increase rate jumped sharply by 10.9 percentage points to 29.8 percent, with the average daily output being 1.48 billion yuan above that in the previous month. The figures were the main grounds on which the economic experts predicted high-speed economic growth in China this year. Some experts predicted that it was very likely that the Chinese economy would grow at a rate much higher than the government target of around 9 percent. Such runaway economic growth makes people worry that the constraints of the "bottleneck" will become more serious, the economic efficiency will remain low, there will be excessive demand for resources, and such a strained economic environment will make it very difficult to implement reform. Another characteristic of China's economic development this year was that prices remained high. According to the prediction of some experts, the volume of retail sales in the first quarter of this year may increase by 28.6 percent over the same period last year, and the retail price index will reach 14.5 percent. Both figures will be higher than last year's average. In 1993, retail prices in China increased by 13.2 percent, and the living costs in 35 large and medium-sized cities increased by 20 percent. The margins of increase were not only bigger than those in 1992, but also marked the highest record in recent years. In fact, the retail price index in mainland China has already exceeded the warning line of inflation, and in the 35 cities it has exceeded the warning line of serious inflation. The inertia of inflation and sustained high-speed growth in 1993 will continue to have an impact on this year's inflation situation. A pronounced characteristic of inflation last year in China was that the prices of producer goods increased by a much wider margin than the price increases of consumer goods. It was expected that the prices of producer goods would increase by about 35 percent over the whole year. The increase in the prices of producer goods then raised the production costs of consumer goods. Moreover, the prices of some energy products and agricultural products will be raised this year, and the prices of some commodities will be shifted from a low, plan-fixed level to a high, market-determined level. Consumers also anticipated the aggravation of inflation and began to react. All this makes it easy to imagine how great the inflation pressure will be in 1994. The continuing, huge investment in fixed assets is closely related to the inflation situation. According to Beijing economist Wen Tiejun's prediction, the size of investment in fixed assets in the whole country will increase by at least 50 percent over last year, and the investment will mainly be concentrated in the real estate and construction industry. Official Chinese statistics showed that, between January and September 1993, the investment in fixed assets made by state-owned units increased by 66.4 percent over that in the same period in the previous year, and the growth rates in the coastal areas were almost all above 60 percent, with some exceeding 100 percent. In 1993 the overall size of investment in fixed assets in the whole country exceeded 1.15 trillion yuan, or increased by more than 300 billion yuan (47 percent) over the previous year; the growth rate of investment made by state-owned enterprises was 58 percent; the investment rate [tou zi lu 2121 6327 376] increased to 37 percent; and the gross volume of investment in 1993 was more than double that in 1991 and reached the highest level in 15 years. This was obviously an abnormal condition. A more worrisome fact was that there was a nearly 30 billion yuan investment fund shortage, and the economic results of the investment were rather poor. The rate of utilization of fixed assets declined by 5.5 percentage points from 1992. The proportion of agricultural investment dropped from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent, that of investment in the energy and raw material industries dropped from 39.5 percent to 35.6 percent, and the constraints of the "bottleneck" still existed to a serious degree. In particular, in the last three months of 1993, China's money supply was loosened, and nearly 300 billion yuan of credit was made available. This not only enabled the state-owned enterprises to quicken the circulation of their funds, but also stimulated their investment desire. In some localities, people had a stronger desire for expanding investment, and tried to quicken the pace of investment in fixed assets. Only one month after the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee adopted the "50-point Decision on the Market Economy," the prices of grain, cooking oil, and meat increased sharply in various localities. According to the price monitoring organs in 12 cities, the price of mixed grain increased by 3.8 percent, the price of nonglutinous rice increased by 8 percent, the price of polished long-grain rice increased by 9.1 percent, and the average grain price increased by about 30 percent in the whole year. In the last few months of 1993, the prices of cooking oil and meat increased rapidly. Over the whole year, the average price of cooking oil increased by 35 percent, and that of meat increased by about 20 percent. For example, the price of rape seed oil increased from 4.08 yuan per kg in early 1993 to 6.08 yuan per kg at the end of the year, and price of fresh boneless meat increased from 7.03 yuan per kg to 9.55 yuan. Panic shopping ensued in some localities, and people contended with each other to buy as much grain and cooking oil as they could. This resulted in shortages in many places. Immediately after that, the authorities decided to unify the two sets of foreign exchange rates. Some hotels and restaurants took advantage of this opportunity to raise their charges and prices, and this spread panic among customers. The move of unifying foreign exchange rates also made it possible to further decontrol the prices of crude oil and oil products, and this produced chain effects on other commodities and further increased consumers' anticipatory feeling against inflation. In Beijing, many consumers rushed to buy gold. Then came the reform of the taxation system, and this flustered more people in China. Before people really understood the meaning of such new terms as consumption taxes and value-added taxes, rumors about "a substantial increase in the prices of luxurious and durable consumer goods and even all commodities due to the state's collection of special consumption taxes and value-added taxes" were spread rapidly and widely among the general public. As a result, another round of panic shopping appeared before the Chinese New Year. In Beijing alone the total volume of retail sales in December 1993 reached 5.42 billion yuan, an increase of 30.5 percent over the same period of the previous year, and this was also an all-time high for monthly retail sales. The three strong winds swept across many places of the mainland, and added another layer of frost to the icy situation of the inflation pressure. At the beginning of the new year, the situation in China's economic reform was rather stern, and things had an unfavorable start. The high growth rate, high investment rate, and high inflation rate all continued, and were not any milder than the situation in 1993. The three gusts of wind also showed that if there were any loopholes in the implementation of the reform measures, which must be well-coordinated, some major trouble would be brought about, especially because the reform measures were put into practice when the "three high rates" existed and when the risks were increasing. Reportedly, the CPC top leaders made a sober assessment of the situation in 1994, the year of reform. The CPC leadership took a number of resolute measures to cope with the situation. The three top leaders, General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji personally took up the matter of curbing the price hikes. At the year end national meeting on stabilizing grain and cooking-oil prices, Premier Li Peng announced a number of urgent measures to check the price hikes. Before the Chinese New Year, Jiang Zemin inspected Beijing's retail markets. He asked shop assistants what commodities became more expensive and how much the prices had increased and whether the prices were lowered to a reasonable level. Zhu Rongji went to Fujian and Anhui to make an inspection tour. He pointed out many times that "some people thought there was no need to manage the grain prices after they were decontrolled, and this was a misunderstanding of the market economy." He hoped that shops would lower grain prices to a level specified by the state plan, and would further lower prices before the Chinese New Year so that there would be greater room for maneuvering in this year's price adjustments. The State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Internal Trade, the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the State Grain Reserve Bureau jointly took action to check the price hikes of grain, cooking oil, and meat. After that, the State Council once again held a national work conference on the supply of grain, cooking oil, and meat. Li Peng required the local governments to "actually give top priority to the improvement of the people's livelihood." On the one hand, the CPC top leadership drew a lesson from the problems, and "adopt effective macrocontrol measures" to curb inflation and stabilize prices. On the other hand, the authorities also tried hard to reduce people's misgivings about the reform measures through various channels as such misgivings increased after the abrupt increase in grain, cooking-oil, and meat prices. When the new reform measures were put into practice, there were risks, especially as the situation of the "three high rates" was stern and worrisome. All this showed that, as the reform deepened, it would certainly be facing unprecedented contradictions and certain difficulties. Many problems that piled up under the old system would impact the course of the across-the-board reform and would obstruct the adjustment of the interest pattern. The inflation pressure, the recession of the state-owned enterprises, and the increase in the jobless population would all create a dilemma for the top authorities: If they continue to expand the scale of investment in order to stimulate the economy and improve the business condition of enterprises, the people will face increasing inflation pressure. If they reduce the issuance of currency and tighten up money supply, the state-owned enterprises will once again be bogged down in the mire of chained debts. If they further the radical reforms, which will affect the vested interests of various social strata, various localities, and various departments, this may bring about social turbulence and thus endanger social stability. But if they are overcautious and even try too hard to maintain stability, they will effectively end the reform. At the same time, facts also remind people that first, the risks from reform come primarily from the problems of the old system, so in order to reduce risks, the only way is to substantially advance reform. Second, it has become more and more important to maintain stability, because nothing will be accomplished in reform and economic development if there is no stability and the people will have to pay even heavier costs. Third, the feasibility and proper arrangements of the reform measures have also become more and more important. In these eventful days, it is no longer possible to advance reform in any single field, and there must be no major mistakes in the implementation of the reform measures. However, differences exist between the central authorities and the local authorities. Some local governments are overanxious to quicken the pace of reform and to speed up economic development. They even misunderstood Deng Xiaoping's remark that "development is the last word." Therefore, in the past, senior officials in Beijing often discussed the approach to the relationships between reform, development, and stability and the way to deepen the reform. It is said that all this caused deep concern in Zhongnanhai. Zhu Rongji was the first to call for: Grasping the opportunity, deepening the reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability. Li Ruihuan, another member of the CPC Central Political Bureau, pointed out: Reform is the driving force, stability is the precondition, and development is the objective. Li Peng pointed out: Development is the aim, reform is the driving force, and stability is the precondition. He also said: Reform will be further deepened, and the scale of opening up to the outside world will be further expanded. Then, before the Chinese New Year, Jiang Zemin made the final decision on the general guideline for this year's work: Grasping the opportunity, deepening the reform, expanding opening, promoting development, and maintaining stability. These 20 characters give much food for thought. First, reform, development, and stability are arranged in a certain sequence, and deepening reform is placed first. The three things will be coordinated and integrated in a dialectical way. Second, the word "quickening" is not put before the words "reform" and "development," but this does not mean that reform and development need not be quickened. Instead, the key point in this year's work is to ensure coordinated operations in the aspects of reform, development, and stability. Third, importance is attached to stability. Fourth, stress is laid on grasping the opportunity. Undoubtedly, seeking a prudent path of reform, opening, development, and stability is the core of the 20-character guideline. Zhu Rongji, who continued to play a role as a trouble-shooter in the CPC top leadership in recent years, recently once again took resolute action to deal with some difficult problems. According to the 20-character guideline laid down by Jiang Zemin, this year's guideline for the monetary work in China is: Continue to rectify the monetary order, steadily advance the monetary reform, strictly control the gross quality of credit funds, and effectively exercise monetary management and supervision. Before the Chinese New Year, Zhongnanhai eventually formulated the macrocontrol principle for this year's economic operation: First tightening control and then relaxing control, and pursuing an economic policy for "a high growth rate and intensive operation." Whether or not the size of investment in fixed assets is reasonable is a key factor for determining whether China's economy is able to maintain stable growth and prevent serious inflation. Zhu Rongji precisely decided to take action on this point. The "monetary commander-in-chief" issued an order: "Beginning this year, the credit funds for infrastructural facilities and key projects in basic industries will all be arranged and coordinated by the newly established Development Bank of the state;" "No loan will be offered to projects going beyond the gross size of credit, to projects which are started without the approval of the authorities, and to any projects which are turned from a whole to parts; and not even one single penny can be given to any one such project." RENMIN RIBAO also published a commentator's article to cool down the excessive enthusiasm of the local authorities for increasing investment. Reportedly, when told that a province planned to build more than 10 airports this year, Zhu Rongji was very angry and openly blamed some local officials for being "unrealistic." Sources said that he was determined to keep the size of investment in fixed assets below 1,450 billion yuan. At the same time, the State Council issued a red-headed document, ordering the local authorities and the relevant departments to strictly scrutinize new construction projects and shorten the front of construction. The State Planning Commission then formulated the concrete measure for turning enterprises into investment bodies. According to the measure, construction projects will not be started until legal persons are formed, and legal persons will take full responsibility for the whole process of investment. The corporation responsibility system will be adopted in order to change the situation in which investment results are poor and no people are responsible for investment. The top authorities are also quickening the process of investment legislation. Thus, according to the speculation of the experts in the State Information Center, the pace of investment growth in fixed assets will be temporarily slowed, and capital construction investment made by state-owned units in the first quarter of this year will be 36 percent, which is slightly lower than last year's average. At the same time, however, the State Council will increase investment in basic industries in order to prevent the situation from exceeding the limits in adjustments. On the other hand, Zhu Rongji also made great efforts to advance taxation reform. This indicated that the financial system in China would enter a new path; the new taxation system will become a mechanism for stabilizing the growth in central finances and will increase the macrocontrol capacity of the central policies; the local authorities will pay more attention to fostering tax sources; and the state budgets will certainly play a tougher controlling role and the results of financial expenditure will be gradually enhanced. In order to give stronger guidance to taxation reform, the State Council decided that Finance Minister Li Zhongli was concurrently appointed to be director of the State Administration of Taxation, and Jin Xin, former director of the taxation administration, was appointed to be deputy director (remaining at the full-ministerial level). Six sets of taxation rules were put into practice on a trial basis. In order to remove consumers' misgivings, Jin Xin led taxation officials to the streets to explain the new tax rules to the general public. Before the Chinese New Year, six ministerial- level officials gave a series of lectures through CCTV, and the first lecturer was Jin Xin. Various signs showed that the Chinese authorities had gradually replaced administrative control with market regulation and control. The most effective means of economic control was the issuance of currency and the retrieval of currency from circulation. The two major economic levers, the interest rates and the tax rates, were also used to adjust economic development. It seemed that Zhu Rongji was learning key skills through practice, and was trying to bring the runaway economy under effective control. Sources in Beijing said that Zhu Rongji and other officials had always tried to bring the rate of economic growth and the index of inflation below 10 percent. If they achieve this target, the economic environment for China's reforms in the second half of 1994 will become much more favorable. Changing from "urgently applying the brake" to a "soft landing," the mainland economy may be free from the repetition of a "hard landing" as in previous years. Recent facts showed that the CPC top leadership was adjusting some specific steps promptly in order to cope with the stern situation. Some reform measures may be postponed, but this does not mean that the authorities will backtrack from reform. There were four main aspects in recent adjustments: Exercising macrocontrol in order to prevent major ups and downs and to create a more benign environment for the adoption of new reform measures; prudently advancing reform and development to make steady and solid progress and to prevent major errors; improving the reform plans and ensuring that they are well-coordinated and feasible and are put into practice in opportune moments; preventing reckless action across the board and ensuring solid results in reform and development. Recently, Zhu Rongji particularly pointed out: "The reform orientation of changing the specialized banks into commercial banks must be kept firmly, but this is a long-term task and only the first step will be taken this year. There must be no reckless action across the board [bu yao gua feng 0008 6008 0450 7364]. The remark reflected the intention of the CPC top leaders to postpone certain reform measures. Some economic experts commented positively on the CPC top authorities' adjustment steps, and said that this was a pragmatic and feasible approach. Most of them held that when facing the dilemma, the authorities should not recklessly advance or flinch from difficulty, and the sensible approach at the current stage was to make minor adjustments and make stable and solid development. Of course they also found that, in the course of developing the market economy, some reform measures were changed shortly after they were put into practice, and brought about various abnormal phenomena as a result of various backward economic relations caused by the combination between the disadvantages of the planned economy and the disadvantages of the market economy. Therefore, economist Fang Hengshan, who participated in the formulation of the "50-point" document on the market economy, openly issued an urgent call for solving this problem. The experts held that at this moment, the adjustment of the reform steps would be favorable to removing the misunderstanding of the market economy and the reform measures in some localities and departments. At the same time, they also warned the authorities against softening their determination for reform while facing various difficulties. Although reform is facing increasing risks, the risks would be even greater if reform were not carried out. Economist Wu Jinglian held that fighting fragmentary battles outside the establishment was not cheaper. Economist Wen Tiejun held that the impact of various factors might force the process of reform to slow down this year. The general view of China's economic situation before the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress clearly showed the intention of Zhongnanhai: This year, economic reform should mainly lay a solid foundation for the across-the-board adoption of the market economy and for more intensive reforms between 1994 and 1996 in order to achieve the objective of establishing the market economic structure on a full scale by the end of 1996. The efforts to carry out prudent reforms and to make effective development will exist throughout the whole process of the tough reform battles in 1994.
