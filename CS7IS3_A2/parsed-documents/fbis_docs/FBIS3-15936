He claimed that allegedly the rights of the Armenians in Akhalkalakskiy and Akhaltsikskiy rayons--where the Armenians are the majority of the population--are being violated. Tengiz Sigua, the former Georgian prime minister and now a deputy at the Georgian Parliament, speaking during the parliament session on 8 March, expressed serious concern regarding such accusations. It was stated during the session that unless urgent measures are taken this region of the Republic could become a second Karabakh. It seems that the Armenians, who have always looked upon foreign territories with heinous intentions, have now coveted the territory of another neighbor. Unless their covetous approach is obstructed, they will continue to claim other territories.
