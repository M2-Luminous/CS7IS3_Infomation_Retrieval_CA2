In 1993 in particular, more than 60 suspects died during detention. The report also said suspects were quite often victims of extra-judicial execution by policemen. The U.S. State Department indicated in its 1 February record on human rights in 193 nations that many countries in Asia are found to violate human rights. They include Thailand, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Pakistan. According to the report, criminal suspects under detention often complained that they were victims of several kinds of torture by police authorities, including electric shock to force confessions. The report also noted that human rights violations in Thailand included the abuse of women and children -- the procurement of women for prostitution and forced child labor are widespread. Not a single leader in the government either acknowledged or rejected the State Department report on human rights violations in Thailand. Undoubtedly, Thailand in the eyes of the world is a country whose people still lack due rights and freedoms enjoyed by those under democratic governments. The prevailing human rights violations are a reflection that Thai people do not fully enjoy rights and freedoms prescribed in the Constitution which is the highest law of the nation. The government therefore must review administrative policy and follow up implementation by authorities, especially when it concerns the justice system at all levels which directly involves people's rights and freedoms, and basic human rights in general.
