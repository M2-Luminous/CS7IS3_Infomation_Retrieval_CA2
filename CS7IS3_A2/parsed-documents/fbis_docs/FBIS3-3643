This was announced by an official from the Tianjin municipal government at a recent conference. The city, rich in geothermal energy sources, has reserves of underground hot water estimated at 7.876 billion cubic meters. Baodi County, north of Tianjin city, has the biggest reserves of the city's subterranean hot water, which cover a total area of 8,700 sq km. Ten of these heat fields, extending to 3,074 square kilometers, are especially rich in underground heat resources. The underground hot water, with temperatures between 25 and 150 degrees centigrade, is widely used in the city's timber manufacturing, home heating, domestic hot water supplies, greenhouses, warm water swimming pools, and scientific experiments. The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has so far invested tens of millions of yuan in exploration of the city's underground heat resources. The United Nations Development Program has also invested five million U.S. dollars in the exploration. The city has by now tapped more than 250 underground hot water reservoirs. The deepest involved drilling to a depth of 3,654 meters and the hottest is 98 degrees centigrade. The city uses about 38 million cubic meters of underground hot water annually, with thermal energy equal to that produced by 2.5 million tons of coal. Tianjin is one of the biggest underground heat energy centres in China. More than 140 overseas experts have visited the city to exchange views on the exploration of underground heat resources. Business people from the United States, Iceland, France, Italy, New Zealand and Japan have expressed interest in investing in the development of the city's subterranean heat resources. A Tianjin-Hong Kong venture was set up earlier this year to exploit this resource. So far more than 80 countries and regions have explored and made use of their own underground heat energy resources.
