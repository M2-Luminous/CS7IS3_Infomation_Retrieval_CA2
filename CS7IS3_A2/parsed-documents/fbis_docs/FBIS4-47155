Vladimir Orlov, in an interview with a SEGODNYA correspondent, explained what prompted his meeting with the president and its possible consequences. According to the chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources, economically useful minerals and products from the primary processing of these minerals are, and will remain for the foreseeable future, the basic source of foreign exchange receipts for the state treasury. Thus, if all of Russia's material assets now being used are estimated at about $2 trillion, then proven economically useful mineral reserves that have been entered on the state balance sheet equal about $28 trillion. According to calculations of experts, all the free capital on the planet is not enough to master Russian fields. At present, according to all parameters of per capita consumption of basic strategic forms of resources, Russia lags behind the West by two to five times. Thus, according to the president, it is necessary not to take the path of reducing consumption of resources, but to qualitatively change the structure of consumption. And, the market will force, and is already forcing, conservation of resources, in terms of use per unit of national product. A reduction of the entire mining and mineral extraction complex is now taking place, necessitating in the current period the activization of a purposeful state policy with respect to this issue. Weak spots in the development of Russia's raw materials base and ways of overcoming them were discussed in the conversation. The president emphasized in the first place that Russia, as a great power, should and does have "raw materials" interests not only in the countries of the CIS but in the whole world as well, including the world's oceans (in particular, the president, in the course of the discussion, repeatedly showed interest in the development of technology and equipment for underwater extraction of economically useful minerals). In other words, problems in developing Russia's mineral-raw materials base have a geopolitical as well as an economic character. Boris Yeltsin was interested in the reasons for the decline in oil and gold extraction, and the state of affairs with respect to other strategic forms of raw materials, especially those that have remained outside Russia. Of particular concern to him was how quickly and at what cost the problem could be solved. In this respect, the president expressed understanding of the fact that geologists' work yields a return in 10 to 15 years and that the euphoria over the so-called "excess of proven reserves" of mineral resources is quickly passing. Meanwhile, investments in the mining and extraction industry yield a sufficiently rapid return. For example, in explored fields, it is possible to begin industrial extraction of oil in 1.5 to three years, scattered gold--in 1.5 to two years, and gold ore--in four to five years (at most seven years). In connection with this, variants for attracting additional investment, including by the state, were examined, as was the question about what is blocking the attraction of domestic and foreign investment in the country's mining and mineral extraction complex. A second set of questions concerned the organization of the geological service in Russia, which recently has undergone major changes and, as a result, has broken up into two components. The smaller of these (15 percent of overall expenditures in geology) is linked to providing for Federation-wide needs, including defense, and is financed through the budget. Included here are drilling of very deep wells, space programs, drawing geological maps on a small and intermediate scale, predictions of earthquakes, work in the world's oceans and the antarctic. Work of this kind is financed through the state budget in practically all countries in the world. The remaining 85 percent of geological expenditures go to providing for current requirements in mining and mineral extraction, and related branches. These expenditures are financed through clients' funds. Measures for state support of the development of Russia's mineral-raw materials base and geological service will be discussed on 7 June at a meeting of the commission for operational questions in the government. In this connection, the chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources noted that geologists were less in need of new budget infusions than of a resolution of the nonpayments problem. In accordance with the system introduced as of 1 January this year, all payments for utilization of mineral resources and taxes remain with regional geological enterprises. However, this has not substantially affected their financial position. By way of an example, Viktor Orlov [name as published] showed the correspondent from the newspaper SEGODNYA a letter from the general director of the association Tomskneftegazgeologiya, Mr. Frinovskiy, saying that Tomsk oil workers had not paid R6.3 billion for work carried out in 1993. They had only given the geologists the right to sell part of the oil extracted for R4 billion and to keep the money for themselves. According to the chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources, if the nonpayment problem is solved, then the mechanism developed by the geologists for fulfilling the work on Federation-wide and commercial orders will function properly. Viktor Orlov touched on the possible consequences of abolishing quotas and licenses in exporting oil. In his opinion, the consequences of this act will probably turn out to be very unfortunate for the geologists, who last year extracted about 3 million tonnes of oil and exported practically all of it. In connection with the reduction in budgetary allocations of almost 90 percent, income from oil exports allowed the geologists only to support social welfare activities. And, in recent years, about 30 percent of all expenditures in geology have gone to these. And, this in spite of the fact that the excise tax rate for geologists was the very highest--24 percent. Taking into account that geologists extract oil in absolutely uninhabited places, where there are no pipelines and the extracted oil has to be shipped in gasoline tankers and mainly on winter roads, the imposition of a customs duty of 30 ECUs per tonne can completely undermine the social welfare sphere. Thus, one of the questions to be examined by the commission for operational questions on 7 June will be the abolition of excise taxes. For now, Viktor Orlov is not taking it upon himself to predict how the question will be decided. Work abroad on a commercial basis has become another avenue for obtaining additional funds for geologists. At present, at least 10 agreements have been concluded with countries in which during the USSR era geological exploration work was conducted. But, geologists then worked using state credits. The new agreements create not only new working places, but also a base for supplying Russia with economically useful minerals that are now in short supply for the national economy. (A classic example is bauxite, large reserves of which have not been found on Russian territory for over 60 years.) For at least another 15 years, the country will import certain mineral raw materials. And, even after that, imports of mineral raw materials could increase. In concluding the interview with the SEGODNYA correspondent, Viktor Orlov pointed to the growing interest in mineral resources on the part of all regimes. If success is reached in resolving the nonpayments problem and in adopting the package of documents talked about above, then the volume of geological exploration work will achieve the optimal level, which will constitute half of the most that was achieved in the 1980's.
