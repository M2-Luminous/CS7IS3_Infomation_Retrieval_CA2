The recently established Freedom Front unveiled its election manifesto on Monday [28 March]. Tonight we have with us in the studio the leader of the party, General Constand Viljoen, to discuss the issue. Welcome, General. We have discussed the election manifestos of several parties, but I see yours is rather brief, so it indicates that you have worked quickly to get all this together. The essence of this, as I see it, is that you desire a confederal system, an independent homeland -- fully independent. Is that correct? [Viljoen] What do you mean by fully independent? I do not think you are interpreting the matter correctly. You are correct when you say.... [Robinson, interrupting] Constitutionally speaking, confederation means that the states are separate, but independent. [Viljoen] Look, if you say a confederal or a strong federal system, if you talk about political independence, then we agree. Economically, we cannot be fully independent. That we know. We are economically interwoven. So we are actually concerned about freedom. It concerns the freedom of the nations in South Africa. It concerns a political system that prevents domination over groups in South Africa from occurring again. [Robinson] But do you want to establish a strong local government -- a homeland, a strong federal state within specified borders? Is that so? [Viljoen] No, let us talk about the homeland issue. We have stated this very clearly for a long time now. We know that this homeland of ours will be economically dependent on the new South Africa. Our farmers still want to sell their things there. We will have to make use of the same electrical power distribution system, and so on. Economically, we will have to work very closely with the new South Africa, but politically we want to be free. This means that the central authority should not be able to dominate us, concerning political decisions. [Robinson] But what about foreign affairs? What about defense? [Viljoen] I will come to that soon. By saying that we don't want to be dominated I mean, first, we want the right to write our own constitution, and second, we want the right to amend that constitution. We don't want to be prescribed to on what to include in that constitution and how to amend it. If we decide to give the function of foreign affairs to the central authority, that is our right. This is one of the issues we have considered in the Volksfront [National Front], and we say that this homeland of ours will most probably delegate its foreign affairs function to the central authority. Certain aspects of this -- for example, agriculture -- we think that if agricultural attaches have to be appointed overseas then we think that the homeland will be the one to appoint these agricultural attaches at South African embassies overseas. That is one of the issues. Policing is a function we believe rests with the homeland -- territorial defense, almost like the system in Switzerland, where the territory will have specified powers. [Robinson] For a defense force or for a police force? [Viljoen] No, for a territorial defense force. The central authority, however, will have the responsibility of national defense. This means that if southern Africa is attacked, the central authority will establish a defense mechanism or a defense headquarters to control the more sophisticated, the more professional parts of the defense force, and who will then ask for the various states to supply manpower to carry out the real task at national level. In other words, what I want to tell you.... [Robinson, interrupting] But why do you want the local force? [Viljoen] This is extremely important in South Africa in the future, so that we do not give communities the perception that they will be defenseless in the new South Africa. For this reason it is important for the Afrikaner to preserve its commando system for a considerable period after the 27 April, so that the Afrikaner does not feel he is completely defenseless. You know, the commando system is an absolutely integral part of our culture. In this respect it is important that we not give the Afrikaner a culture shock, and that we ensure the continued existence of the commando system, since it will form the nucleus of the future territorial defense force for the homeland. [Robinson] But then, General, one could argue that one would have different states, each with its own territorial force, as you say, a sort of defense force. [Viljoen] Yes, why not? [Robinson] But then it could happen that they will be constant conflict with each other, that they will fight against each other. [Viljoen] No, such a force serves as a deterrent and if it is responsibly applied then it is actually a force that ensures peace. There is an old saying: If you want peace, prepare for war. Now in South Africa's future, it would lead to chaos if you create a situation where either the central authority or other provinces are able to act against, the homeland for example, without the homeland having the ability to defend itself. We must accept that in the future there will be a need for such a force. I call it a balancing of forces -- through the creation of forces to serve as a deterrent and as a guarantee --to provide a feeling of security for the Afrikaners in that area. [Robinson] General, but it is stated in newspapers that your involvement in the Bophuthatswana debacle was not necessarily a success, that you did not exercise the necessary authority, and that the army was not impressive. [Viljoen] let me tell you a little about the Bophuthatswana issue. I challenge another organization to mobilize 2,000 troops virtually overnight and to move into a given area, under the leadership of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force, in support of the Bophuthatswana Defense Force, at their request. They were to have supplied the weapons. We had an agreement. What was the purpose? The purpose was to assist President Mangope to survive over the weekend, until that Monday, so that a parliamentary session could take place on Tuesday in which they could make decisions without any form of intimidation -- decisions forced upon them following a coup. [Robinson] General, I don't really want to discuss Bophuthatswana. All that I want to discuss is the issue of the army, that that entire episode was an indication that a private army, or the territorial army you envisage for the future, could create problems and that there will not necessarily be the required discipline. [Viljoen] Look, if you are talking about discipline, we know that there are certain levels of discipline. That is well known. It's a pity that that incident took place because the lack of discipline was responsible for the failure of that exercise. If we had acted correctly, that operation would have been successful. President Mangope's party would still be in power today, and most probably Mr. Khoza's party would also not have been powerless. This process has led to the elimination of at least two other political parties, and the third political party, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], is now on the way to being eliminated, now three or four weeks before the election. [Robinson] Let me link this discussion to another issue. If in your homeland you delegate certain functions to the central government, such as foreign affairs and defense, there must be another law -- the constitution as such must be applicable to you, for example, the Human Rights Charter -- in which there is a fundamental principle of no discrimination. Would this, for example, apply to your state? [Viljoen] Freek, without doubt, we will have to do this. Can I add that I believe that the Afrikaner -- although we are chiefly interested in the homeland's constitution -- that the Afrikaner will not be able to divorce himself from politics, and especially from the constitution to be adopted by the rest of South Africa, for the simple reason that economically, we will have to work with those people. [Robinson] What people? [Viljoen] The new South Africa. Secondly, we are faced with the problem of 50 percent, at least, of our own people, our own Afrikaners, who will be situated outside the homeland. We cannot desert those people and say: We have a homeland. We are going to build that homeland and not pay attention to the others. [Robinson] How will you pay attention to them? [Viljoen] There is a very interesting development in negotiations at the moment. Initially we concentrated on the idea of a homeland. It was difficult to sell the homeland philosophy to people. We have succeeded. It was also difficult to convince the people about the practicality of the homeland. I think we have succeeded in that also. There are still a few questions concerning that, but the new development is that we want to link the homeland to certain concentrations of Afrikaners in the rest of the country. We could call them community councils. The idea, for example, is to investigate this and we are busy with final negotiations in this regard -- to investigate the possibility of linking community councils outside the homeland, through representatives, to the people's council of the homeland, so that the homeland's council also ensures certain functions for the Afrikaner in the rest of South Africa, so that we can ensure the cultural survival of the Afrikaner. The homeland and the people's council, settled in that area dominated by Afrikaners, will have an influence inside and outside the area, through which we can determine the future of the Afrikaner. This is what we want. Self-determination means the right to determine your own future. [Robinson] I also asked you about the whole issue of the Human Rights Charter, discrimination. What about those people inside such a homeland who do not want to be there? [Viljoen] About the people who do want to be part of the homeland -- I have often explained that we want to create a situation where there is Afrikaner dominance. In South Africa there is an area where Zulus dominate. There is an area where Xhosas dominate, but there is no area where Afrikaners dominate, for specific reasons. Research indicates the fault dates back to 1910, and the effect of the separate development policy actually denied Afrikaners the right to certain areas. You have already heard the argument on the peace of Versailles -- when a delegation of blacks and a delegation of Boers came together, and both asked to have a say in the new South Africa. The Boers wanted to reclaim the old Boer Republic, and the blacks asked to be accommodated in one way or another in the constitution. Both were rejected. We are asking now, after this election, for certain issues concerning the Afrikaner as a nation to be rectified. We have a right to ask for this, and defining the area is our problem. Together with the Zulus we can ask for self-determination, but the Afrikaner does not have an area, and in an attempt to define these borders we will have to use the polls to prove sufficient support and to ensure that we can implement a people's council and also that we can determine the distribution of Afrikaner support to put the borders of the Afrikaner homeland down on paper. [Robinson] I want to come back to the issue of the homeland borders, but I want to repeat my question -- very directly. If I am a colored and I live near Lydenburg, where you yourself live, and I find myself as part of this homeland, will I have voting rights? Will I have equal educational opportunities? Will there be equal employment opportunities? Will I, as a person, have equal legal access and the same human rights? [Viljoen] Yes, Freek, it is no longer possible in South Africa or the world to have a homeland or state where you do not give people certain rights. We are busy negotiating the details of the homeland. These issues you have referred to are actually issues that will be referred to the homeland council, to be negotiated on a bilateral or trilateral basis, or with the future constitutional bodies of the new South Africa. These are important issues. We gladly want to give those people what we ourselves are asking for, but we do not want to create a system where people will again oust the Afrikaner -- through squatting, for example. [Robinson] So you actually want them away from those areas? [Viljoen] No, we don't want them away from those areas. We say that we will not have any forced removal of people. If people want to leave themselves, then they can leave. What we actually envisage is to resettle Afrikaners in those areas, to offer those Afrikaners who have lost their jobs through this so-called affirmative action, an opportunity to come back to Afrikanerdom and to build a homeland through hard labor. That is what we have in mind. [Robinson] I have a lot of follow-up questions, but let us leave that for the moment. I just want to ask you the following question. Do you approve of the map unveiled by Dr. Hartzenberg over the weekend? [Viljoen] This map unveiled by Dr. Hartzenberg is a so-called discussion map. In other words, it takes into account the historical demands of the Afrikaner. In this regard it is correct. Dr. Hartzenberg himself said that this is not the final map but that it is subject to negotiation. [Robinson] Do you accept this? [Viljoen] On the issue of further negotiation, yes, I definitely agree with that. [Robinson] That this be used as a basis for negotiation? [Viljoen] Yes, I think it can serve as basis for negotiation. Let me tell you this: If we look at what the Afrikaner wants -- self-determination in an independent area, in a homeland, as well as the right to negotiate self-determination for its people, as far as possible, in the rest of South Africa -- then there is one more thing the Afrikaner must remember, and that is that our demand is a reasonable one, but it must also be a practical one. The dear Lord placed us in this country together with other people. Those other people have certain rights, and we also have rights. [Robinson] The same rights or not? [Viljoen] We say that the rights of nations, the rights we grant to ourselves, should also be granted to others. All that we must do now is to sort out the constitutional mess South Africa finds itself in, to rearrange this, taking into account all the different population groups, including the Afrikaner nation and the other nations, as well as other people living in the Afrikaner nation's area, people who have lived there for a long time -- to give them these rights so that we can coexist peacefully alongside each other in the future. [Robinson] Do you want to say then that you will also fight for the rights of others in this election? Will you, for example, try to get the Inkatha vote? [Viljoen] No, that is not want I want to do. What I want to tell you is that the Freedom Front undertook to fight for freedom. [Robinson] Just for the Afrikaner? [Viljoen] No, no. Freedom is a concept that should not only be seen in the political context. Freedom in the true sense of the word, and freedom which especially excludes domination. [Robinson] But would you want blacks to vote for you? [Viljoen] If we want.... [Robinson, interrupting] No, answer the question. Would you want blacks to vote for you? [Viljoen] At the moment I can't.... [pauses] I will explain in a minute. Constitutional clause 34, says specifically that a community should prove that they want self-determination. If I campaign, for example, for the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] to vote for me, then the constitutional court could turn around after the election and say this proven support is not accurate enough. [Robinson] What is proven support? What number would qualify as proven support for you? [Viljoen] Look, if one includes a constitutional clause in a constitution, then that clause should not only apply to the Afrikaner but also to all other nations who want it. In other words, we cannot say that if 500,000 people vote for a homeland then that is proven support, because if the Indians come and say they want self-determination then we are speaking about different numbers. [Robinson] But one has to arrive at some figure. [Viljoen] If we talk about support, majority support, then the constitutional clause would have said majority support -- that is, more than 50 percent. [Robinson] Of Afrikaners? [Viljoen] Of Afrikaners, yes. Of the community asking for self-determination. If there is sufficient support then I would say .... [Robinson, interrupting] More than 50 percent of Afrikaners? [Viljoen] No, more than 50 percent would be a majority of Afrikaners. If we say sufficient support, then we would say there should be close to 50 percent, or more than 50 percent, but it should not be so small that it becomes laughable. Let us say that a court might rule -- and here I don't want to predict want a court will say -- that 30 percent or less would be unsuitable. So one doesn't want to put forward a precise definition of this, but I think the court will be guided by circumstances that will surely include the size of the community asking for self-determination, and, of those communities, how many voted for or against the idea. [Robinson] General, in conclusion, you were in a partnership with several other people in right-wing politics. There were harsh words between you and some of those people, especially from their side. Is there division in Afrikaner ranks? [Viljoen] Look, the Afrikaner is undivided in his struggle for his goal. We are undivided in our struggle. We are targeting the same eventual goal. We only differ about the method. It is a question of, for example, of driving to Bloemfontein via either the Kimberley route or the Kroonstad route. It does not matter. If we differ, we have agreed to differ, and we said we will accept the two-stream policy. We said that we would not oppose each other because we believe that both groups are equally honest and equally serious about the manner in which they want to achieve self- determination. Eventually, before reaching our goal, we will take hands again and we will stand together again. I, for example, am still a member of the Volksfront. I am still strongly linked to the defense mechanisms of the Volksfront and as such, I still associate myself with the Volksfront, but I had to establish the Freedom Front to bring about this specific alternative and strategy, so that there would not be any setback to the development of a homeland, but to ensure that we can secure a homeland as soon as possible after the 27 April. [Robinson] General, thank you very much for your contribution tonight.
