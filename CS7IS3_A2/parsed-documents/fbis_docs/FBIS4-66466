The result is Japan's prices are overwhelmingly costlier. Although the rates in Japan were less than one-half when compared at the initiation of service, several differences exist with the U.S. These rate differences cannot frustrate the realization of a multimedia society in which high-speed, high-capacity circuits will be in common use. Charges for NTT's high-speed digital transmission services were cut on February 1 of this year. The rates were decreased to less than half the rate level at the initiation of service. Nevertheless, the gap with the U.S. is huge. Therefore, we will compare the two countries to evaluate the current situation. Elements other than rates such as the communication quality were not considered to be targets of this comparison. A Large Gap Exists between Japan and the U.S. Despite the Rate Cut Starting with the conclusion, we can say that although the rate calculation methods differ in the two countries, Japan's rates are several times higher. Figure 1 compares the rates of NTT's 1.5 Mbits/second high-speed digital dedicated circuit to those of the Terrestrial 1.5M (T1) service of AT&T, a long distance telephone company in the U.S. Figure 1. Comparison of 1.5 Mbits/second Services in Japan ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1 AT&T's Rates for Dedicated Digital Circuits | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Speed |Basic Rate |Measured Rate (per mile) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1.5 Mbits/second |$2,600 |$3.65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |64 kbits/second |$281 |$0.33 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |This rate is based on AT&T's interoffice distance. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |In addition, an access charge from the central office | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |to the user's residence is required. 64 kbits/second | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |went into service on 20 November 1993. 1.5 Mbits/second | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |went into service on 18 September 1993. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It was noted beforehand that comparing the two services of NTT and AT&T on the same graph is not strictly correct. In contrast to NTT's offering end-to-end service, AT&T's service target is only the relay portion. Therefore, the methods for calculating rates differ.[.sup]1[/] Only the relay portion offered by AT&T is shown in Figure 1. The circuit access charge that varies with the users' conditions is not considered. In fact, the access charge is about several hundred dollars. Nonetheless, when this point is considered, Japan's dedicated circuit rate is very high. (An example is explained later.) The results are almost identical at other speeds. For example, a comparison at 64 kbits/second is shown in Figure 2. The disparity is about the same as in the 1.5 Mbits/second case. Figure 2. Comparison at 64 kbits/second. The comparison Comparison of 1.5M between Tokyo-Osaka and NY-LA: The Distance Is One-Tenth But the Rate Is Doubled As a concrete example of rate calculations including the access charge, we will present an example using the 1.5 Mbits/second circuit between New York and Los Angeles which are separated by about 2,500 miles (about 4,000 km) (Figure 3). In this example, the monthly fee is about $12,500 (about 1.32 million yen). The distances of the access circuits were each 2 miles in both New York and Los Angeles. The access charges used are determined by each local telephone company, NYNEX and Pacific Bell. Since rate is determined by each local telephone company, rates differ for the same distance. Figure 3. Calculation Method for Long Distance Dedicated It is a bit forced to select the Tokyo-Osaka route (408 km) as the Japanese example corresponding to the New York-Los Angeles route in business activities, but the circuit usage rate at the same speed is 2.7 million yen. Compared to the New York-Los Angeles route, the distance is one tenth, but the rate is almost double. A Shorter Distance But 4 to 5 Times More Expensive In Japan the charge calculation method does not change for short distances from several kilometers to several tens of kilometers. Only rates corresponding to distance divisions are determined. While in the U.S., if confined to within the service area of the local telephone company, the rate structure of the local telephone company is used[.sup]2[/]. For example, the rates for the New York Metro LATA (Local Access and Transport Area: region provided service by the same telephone company) of NYNEX in the U.S. adds basic rates and measured rates between the user and the central office and between central offices (Table 2). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2 Monthly Rates of NYNEX's Superpath (1.5 Mbits/second) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Basic Rate |Measured Rate (per mile) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Interoffice Rate |$115 |$30/mile | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Access Charge (one end) |$210 |$5/0.25 mile | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Rates were effective 1 October 1993 in the New York Metro LATA. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Based on a survey by the United Communications Group in the U.S. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In this case the access condition is not fixed, thus, a comparison on the same graph is difficult. Figure 4 was graphed when the distance of the access circuit is 0 and only the interoffice distance is changed. A large gap is evident. Figure 4. Comparison at Local Distances (1.5 For a comparison of realistic conditions, we will calculate an example between Marunouchi and Shinjuku in Tokyo (Figure 5). The distance between NTT's Marunouchi office and Shinjuku office is 6.5 km. The users at both ends are 400m from the Marunouchi office and the Shinjuku office. Figure 5. Example Calculation of Dedicated Circuit Rates In NTT's rate calculation method, a rate of ¥33,700 is applied up to a distance division of 15 km. In contrast, the rate of NYNEX in the U.S. is adapted to each case. The rate ($695 = ¥73,000) is the combination of the rate between the two offices ($265, corresponding to part A in Figure 5) and the rate based on the distance from the office to the user's residence ($215 on one end, part B in Figure 5). Japanese rates are 4 to 5 times higher. Considering the Causes The gap between rates in Japan and the U.S. is confirmed by NTT. The Dedicated Services Division stated ``We are aware of the problem. People within the company have pointed out the need for further reductions.'' Firstly, what is the cause of this gap? One reason is NTT's internal rate structure. Historically, NTT has had high earnings services and low earnings services. Dedicated services have high rates relative to costs. When we look at the profit rate in which ordinary profit and loss were classified by the business income for different work (telephone, telegraph, dedicated services) at NTT in 1992, the profit rate for suburban calls (subscriber telephone) is 59.8% and that for dedicated services is 14.6%; both are in double digits. Considering the rate system with respect to costs, the rates of both services should be further reduced. However, while services with high earnings decrease in price, there is the fear that low profit services, like the current rate for intracity calls of ¥10 for 3 minutes, will experience price increases. If the rates for users of dedicated circuits fall rapidly, placing the burden on users who make many station-to-station calls would be pursued. Also, there is the high probability that NCC (new first-time communications commercial customers), who increase earnings in dedicated circuits, will receive a heavy blow. Another reason may be the difference in costs to provide communication services in Japan and in the U.S. According to the NTT Special Services Promotion Department, ``There are elements that cannot be explained only by the difference in the relationship between costs and rates in each service. Ideas about networks also differ in Japan and the U.S.'' Specifically, there are the amount of backup circuits and the refined monitoring system. In addition, because the depth at which cables are buried is set in Japan, the road construction costs are 10 times higher than in the U.S. One telecommunication analyst gave one reason for high rates as ``the manufacturer's protection policy followed in the past by NTT.'' During the training period of the manufacturer, the equipment used by NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) was purchased at high prices from domestic manufacturers. This had the effect of a high level of R&D strength at the manufacturer. However, when NTT was privatized, procuring domestically or overseas without distinction became possible. If manufacturer protection is carried out, the danger of pushing up telecommunication costs is exhibited. In realizing a multimedia society focused on transmitting images, a premise is the ability to inexpensively use high-speed, large capacity circuits. But high rates will become a major obstacle. Of course, to secure lower prices, a review of the old framework will be involved. In reforming the framework in rate theory, a wider range of view must be assembled. Footnotes 1. Dedicated Circuit Calculation Methods in Japan and the U.S. NTT uses a rate table corresponding to the 24 distance divisions. In principle, the rate is determined based on the distance to the MA (message area, unit of individual charging area) the user belongs to. However, at short distances within an MA, the distance between the receiving offices is applied. While in the U.S., the relay circuits provided by long distance telephone companies like AT&T and the access circuits provided by the local telephone companies must be combined. The rate of each circuit consists of the basic monthly rate and the special rate corresponding to distance. 2. Rate Structure of Local Telephone Companies Local telephone companies in the United States have different rates for end-to-end services such as the access circuits of long distance telephone companies.
