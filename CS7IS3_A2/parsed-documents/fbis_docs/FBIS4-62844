The Russian defence minister is to fly to Brussels soon to take part in the NATO Council session. Grachev said his ministry has prepared specific proposals, which have been agreed with the Russian Foreign Ministry and will be handed over to the Russian president for approval today. If NATO shows interest in the position of Russia, the Russian defence minister is prepared to formally present its proposals to the members of the North Atlantic Alliance. Grachev stressed however that the main objective of his trip to Brussels was not to discuss Partnership for Peace but to address the NATO military ministers and other invited defence ministers from European and some Commonwealth countries and explain Russia's defence doctrine, including the use of nuclear arms.
