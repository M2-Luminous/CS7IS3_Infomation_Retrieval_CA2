Mr. Meyer said he had asked the Freedom Alliance to make specific proposals regarding changes to the interim constitution earlier this week, but thus far no response has been received. He says that the Freedom Alliance has failed collectively to arrive at a common consensus, that is why the possibility of progress with indinvidual parties within the alliance was currently being investigated.
