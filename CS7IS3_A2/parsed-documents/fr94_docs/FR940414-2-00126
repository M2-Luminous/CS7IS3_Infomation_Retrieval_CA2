FR940414-2-00126 FR940414-2-00080 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. Applicants' Representations 1. The Trust is a registered open-end management investment company organized in series form. The Trust currently has six series: Money Market Series, Government Securities Series, Priority Selection List Series, Zweig Strategy Fund, Zweig Appreciation Fund and Zweig Managed Assets (collectively and individually, the ``Series''). The Trust has from time to time created new Series and may do so in the future. The Adviser serves as the investment manager of the Trust. The Distributor acts as the principal distributor of shares of beneficial interest of the Trust (``Shares''). Pursuant to the Prior Order, the Trust presently offers two classes of Shares: Class A shares and Class B Shares. 2. A new series of the Trust, Zweig Cash Fund (``New Cash Fund'') is being created to become the successor by merger to Money Market Series, a series of the Trust, and Zweig Cash Fund Inc. (``Cash Fund''), an affiliated money market fund with the same investment adviser and distributor as the Trust. In connection with that merger, the Trust proposes to create a new class of Shares (the ``Class M Shares''), which will be exchanged for the assets of Cash Fund and then distributed to Cash Fund shareholders in complete liquidation of such Fund. In addition, Money Market Series will transfer its assets to New Cash Fund in exchange for Class A and Class B shares of New Cash Fund. 3. Class A Shares of five Series of the Trust are sold with a sliding scale initial sales charge. Class A Shares of Money Market Series are sold without an initial sales charge, and Class A Shares of New Cash Fund will also be sold without an initial sales charge. As provided in a plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act (the ``Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan''), the Class A Shares of each Series pays the Distributor distribution fees of .05% and service fees of .25% of average daily net assets per annum. 4. The Class B Shares of the Trust are sold without the imposition of an initial sales charge, but they are subject to a CDSC of 1.25% of the net asset value of shares redeemed within one year of purchase. No CDSC is imposed on Class B Shares redeemed thereafter. Under the rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan, the Distributor is paid a distribution fee of .75% per annual of average daily net assets of Class B Shares of four Series, .50% for one Series, and .05% for Money Market Series. In each case, the Distributor also is paid a service fee of .25%. New Cash Fund will have the same pricing structure as Money Market Series, and the Class B Shares will pay an annual distribution and service fee of .05% and .25%, respectively, of average daily net assets (the same as paid by the Class A Shares). 5. Under the Multi-Class Plan, the Trust will continue to offer Class A and B Shares on the same terms as are presently offered, and New Cash Fund will also offer Class M Shares. Class M Shares will be sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC but subject to a Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan that requires the Class M Shares of New Cash Fund to pay up to .15% per annum of average daily net assets to securities dealers, financial institutions and other industry professionals for distribution, promotion and administration of and/or servicing investors in Class M Shares, and for payment by the Class M Shares for prospectuses, reports and promotional material in an amount not to exceed $100,000 per year. The Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan for Class M Shares of New Cash Fund will be identical to the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan presently in effect for shares of Cash Fund. 6. Although there are no present plans for offering other classes of shares of the Trust (including Class M Shares of the other Series of the Trust), the terms of which may differ from the classes of shares described herein and in the application, the Trust may choose to do so in the future. Any such new classes, however, would comply with all of the conditions set forth below. The sum of any initial sales charge, asset-based sales charge, and CDSC for the existing or any new classes will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided for in Article III, Section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers. 7. Under the Multi-Class Plan, each share of a Series will represent an equal pro rata interest in a Series, regardless of class, and will be identical in all respects except for: (1) The amount and type of fees permitted by Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans and the terms of service agreements, if applicable; (2) voting rights on matters concerning Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans; (3) exchange privileges; (4) any expenses which the Board of Trustees determines should be allocated or charged on a class basis (``Differential Expenses''), which are limited to (a) transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as attributable to a specific class, (b) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing class specific material such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders, (c) Blue Sky and Commission registration fees incurred by a class of Shares, (d) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, if any, (e) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to a specific class of Shares, (f) trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of Shares and (g) other expenses that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order; and (5) the designation of such classes.
