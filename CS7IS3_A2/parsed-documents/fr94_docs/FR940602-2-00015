FR940602-2-00015 FR940602-2-00013 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;161&hyph;001] Avoca Natural Gas Storage; Petition May 26, 1994. Take notice that on May 17, 1994, Avoca Natural Gas Storage (Avoca), One Bowdoin Square, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, filed in Docket No. CP91&hyph;161&hyph;001 a petition, pursuant to Rule 207(a)(5) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.207(a)(5), and section 7(c)(1)(B) of the Natural Gas Act, seeking approval of a temporary exemption from certificate requirements, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Avoca seeks an exemption to construct and test three water production wells and five monitoring wells. The data received will enable the Susquehana River Basin Commission (SRBC) 1 to review the water withdrawal impacts of the Avoca project. Avoca states that the SRBC's review and approval of the proposed water withdrawal is necessary before construction commences on its natural gas storage project pursuant to the issuance of a section 7(c) certificate by this Commission. 1 The SRBC was created pursuant to a federal compact. The compact was ratified by New York, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, the three states which border the river basin. The SRBC's regulations are found at 18 CFR 801, et seq. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before June 3, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have heretofore filed need not file again. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;13359 Filed 6&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
