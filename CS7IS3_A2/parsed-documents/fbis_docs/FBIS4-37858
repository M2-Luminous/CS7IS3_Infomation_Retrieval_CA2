[Al-Husayni] Actually it will be my third visit to Saudi Arabia. But it is the second with regard to the Jerusalem issue. The main aim is to discuss the city's position in the current political process, in addition to the Saudi political and moral role. [passage omitted] [Abu-'Id] You talk about practical measures in the face of Israel's escalation with regard to Jerusalem. What measures do you believe should be taken? [Al-Husayni] Israel has recently stepped up its measures against Jerusalem, closing and besieging it, hence forcing its residents to depart. It has prevented them and continues to prevent them from building [their homes]. This is in addition to the demolition of hundreds of houses and buildings on the pretext that these buildings were built without licenses. But on the other hand it has stepped up the building of Jewish settlements inside and around the eastern part of the city. Israel's aim behind all these measures is to destroy the infrastructure and economic structure and prevent Jerusalem from communicating with West Bank cities and the Gaza Strip. These practices require from us a resolute position in order to confront the challenges. I believe that this can only be done through practical organization. [passage omitted] [Abu-'Id] What is your opinion of the Israeli practices aimed at preventing the setting up of self-rule institutions in Jerusalem? [Al-Husayni] The Palestinian institutions present in Jerusalem should not be hampered. According to the message we have received (from Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and the Norwegian foreign minister), these institutions should be encouraged. As for the institutions set up after this message to play a role alongside the Palestinian National Authority under the recent accord, it is natural for them to be in the self-rule areas. In practice, there are no self-rule institutions in Jerusalem. The media clamor aroused by Israel regarding Jerusalem institutions reflects some Israeli concerns that this Palestinian presence, which has begun to develop its mechanisms, is alarming them. [Abu-'Id] Have Israeli authorities asked you personally to move to Jericho to live? [Al-Husayni] Actually no one has asked me to live there. They said that, if I want to be a National Authority member, I should move my offices to Jericho. What is meant is the office, not the accommodation. [Abu-'Id] And are you prepared to take such a step? [Al-Husayni] No. From the outset I have stressed my agreement to join the National Authority, provided this is not going to keep me away from Jerusalem. And as Jerusalem requires a lot of time, I prefer to be responsible for issues related to Jerusalem. [Abu-'Id] Will Jerusalem be subject to political bargaining? [Al-Husayni] East Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state.
