The participants, who have come from the United States, have numerous questions on the possibility of the gradual expansion of ties between Cuba and the Cuban community abroad. The increasing number of people wanting to travel to Cuba was discussed, as well as the growth in the number of people abroad who are against the economic blockade. Jorge Gomez Barata, an official of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, spoke at the meeting about the willingness of Cuban authorities to show greater flexibility on emigration issues and stressed that one of the duties of the state is to ensure the security and tranquility of the population; hence, the existence of controls and requirements. This is the second meeting of its kind with members of this group. The meeting was chaired by Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of the Politburo, and Sergio Corrieri, president of the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples.
