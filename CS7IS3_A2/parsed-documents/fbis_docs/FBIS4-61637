Luzhkov believes that the Moscow leadership is forced to make this due to permanent debts of the federal budget to the Russian capital. As the Minister of the Moscow government Yuriy Korostelev, leader of the finances department, reported to Interfax, as of January 1, 1994 this debt was 117 billion rubles, and as of early May - 126 billion rubles. The resolution of the capital's government says that "the program on social-economic development of the city for 1993 has been successfully fulfilled." At the same time the resolution points out that "the results of the budget's fulfillment have failed to create a base for financial support of additional measures and to comprehensively form the funds for the starting financing of this year." In the course of the sitting chief of the state tax inspectorate in Moscow Dmitriy Chernik reported that a total of 2,635 trillion rubles and 58 million dollars have been transferred to Moscow's budget at the expense of taxes collected on the territory of the city. In his estimates, about 21 trillion rubles will be transferred to the city's budget at the expense of taxes. The city's budget will be approximately 21 trillion rubles. A more precise prognosis of the capital's social-economic development and Moscow's draft budget for 1994 are to be submitted to the Moscow government before June 15. On the proposal of Yuriy Luzhkov the Moscow government dismissed several people guilty of using budget funds at their own disposal. In particular, it fired chief of the medical department of the Western administrative district where the budget funds were spent for the procurement of "21 cars for non-medical purposes and payment for foreign business trips." According to Luzhkov, "today there is no more complex and important work but the work aimed an efficient search for ways to replenish Moscow's budget funds."
