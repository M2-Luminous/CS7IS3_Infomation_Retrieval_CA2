B. Gorev, Ye. F. Prokhorov, A. T. Ukolov, Institute of Technical Mechanics, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] The threshold voltage of the onset of negative differential conductivity is studied in a thin film n-GaAs structure with a Schottky barrier and with a semi-insulated compensated substrate. When the Schottky barrier depletion region is adjacent to the film-substrate junction depletion region, as cut-off voltage increases at the barrier there is not the usual decrease in the threshold voltage of the onset of negative differential conductivity, but an increase. This is because the voltage at the gate increases with the ratio of the longitudinal field at the drain end of the gate to the longitudinal field at the source end (the distribution of the longitudinal field becomes more homogeneous).
