The articles sharply condemn the terrorist attack. The commentary of MAGYAR NEMZET notes: "Nothing can justify this brutal action against defenseless and innocent people. For the time being, one can only guess what steps will follow in the wake of the attack against the Bosnian capital, (and also against the civilized world). It is obvious that the chances for resolving the crisis through negotiations are diminishing. "The Muslims demand that the West use air strikes to deter the Bosnian Serbs from the continued siege of Sarajevo and the ongoing violent territorial conquests, or that the West make it possible, for the Bosnians to protect themselves by lifting the arms embargo. "Meanwhile, there are more and more calls in the western capitals, as well as in the Brussels NATO command, for military intervention. Islamic countries may decide to provide assistance to Bosnia, seeing the continued helplessness of the western states and international organizations. "It became clear after the Sarajevo market-place drama that the international community must take steps, either through military actions or by introducing stricter sanctions. It must force an end to the war as soon as possible, and achieve a final settlement through negotiations. Otherwise, the leading world politicians and the international organizations, be it the United Nations or NATO, could once and for all lose their credibility, and will always have to bear responsibility for this," writes the article in MAGYAR NEMZET.
