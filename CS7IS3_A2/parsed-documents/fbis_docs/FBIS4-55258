They are primarily boasting of the powerful arms that they possess, claiming at the same time that the Muslims have nothing, and therefore, not a chance of resisting them. They illustrated all this with a reportage about the 2d Armored Brigade. They showed a self-propelled howitzer, a multiple rocket launcher, a self- propelled antiaircraft gun [words indistinct]. The engineer boasted that they have laid thousands of mines, a gift to their enemies, as he said. Then they showed parts of the 27th Motorized Brigade in Derventa. The commander boasted that the Brigade is motorized in the true sense of the word, equipped with the most modern hardware and arms. An inevitable question arises: Where has Karadzic got all this from when we know that the majority of the (?500,000) residents of the so-called Srpska republic are illiterate and that their industry is literally at a standstill while their economy is in tatters? Where did such modern arms, such a quantity of ammunition, spare parts, and fuel come from? Not even many of the more-developed countries can afford this. The answer is clear -- [words indistinct] from Serbia. This is not all. Analyst Karlo Jeger, on the pages of Zagreb GLOBUS [words indistinct] the forces of the Serbian aggressor that attacked Gorazde. Of a total of five brigades, two had arrived from Serbia [words indistinct]. A special police battalion from Serbia and the units of the antiaircraft defense with the most modern rocket systems that Serbia possesses were also there. It is clear, therefore, that there will be no end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina before the borders with Serbia and Montenegro are hermetically sealed. Karadzic's Serbs would behave entirely differently had they known that the potential of the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army, [words indistinct] $200 billion, and the armed forces from Serbia and Montenegro are no longer behind them. Many of them would not fight a day longer, therefore, the West, if it wants to stop the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, must [words indistinct] the Serbs behind the negotiating table. Participation at such talks must also be secured for those Serbs who stayed on the free territories or have abandoned the temporarily occupied territories. One must not forget that they represent 60 percent of the total number of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Serbs. Only in this way can a just solution for all be found, that is, by blocking the borders on the Drina and Sava Rivers and nothing more.
