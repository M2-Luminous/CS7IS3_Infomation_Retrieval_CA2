FR940527-1-00096 FR940527-1-00014 B. Removal of the 1986 Malpractice Rule (§413.56) We propose removing from the regulations ``the 1986 malpractice rule'', which is set forth at §413.56. We also would remove all cross-references to §413.56. This proposal is a technical change designed to conform the regulations to the various authorities that have previously established that the 1986 malpractice rule is invalid. The history of Medicare reimbursement policy under the cost-based reimbursement system for provider malpractice insurance costs is described in detail in Sections I. and II.A. of the March 27, 1987 final rule (52 FR 9833). To summarize briefly: for cost reporting periods beginning before July 1, 1979, provider malpractice insurance costs were included in the general and administrative cost center (``G & A pool'') with other overhead costs, and apportioned to the Medicare program in accordance with the provider's Medicare utilization rate (52 FR 9834). (See also §405.452(b)(1) (``the pre-1979 utilization method) redesignated at §413.53(a)(1)(i).) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1979, ``the 1979 malpractice rule'' removed provider malpractice insurance costs from the G & A pool, and directly apportioned those insurance costs based on the ratio of provider malpractice losses paid for Medicare patients compared to losses paid for all patients (52 FR 9834). On April 1, 1986, we published an interim final rule with comment period that replaced the 1979 malpractice rule, effective May 1, 1986, with the 1986 malpractice rule (51 FR 11142). The 1986 malpractice rule was set forth in regulations at §405.457, subsequently redesignated as §413.456, and then confirmed in our above-cited March 27, 1987 final rule. The 1986 malpractice rule reestablished reimbursement of skilled nursing facility malpractice insurance costs under the pre-1979 utilization method, §413.56(c), whereas hospital malpractice insurance costs were reimbursed based on both a hospital's utilization rate and aspects of the claims-paid approach of the 1979 regulation. (See §413.56(b).) The Secretary's authority to apply the hospital payment provisions of the 1986 malpractice rule has been eliminated through a series of events. As promulgated initially, the 1986 rule applied retroactively, subject to the Medicare program's general rules of administrative finality, to cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1979. (See §413.56(a).) Subsequently, however, the Supreme Court held that the Medicare statute does not generally authorize retroactive rulemaking, Bowen v. Georgetown University Hosp. , 488 U.S. 204 (1988) (`` Georgetown ''). Therefore, the Administrator of HCFA issued HCFA Ruling 89&hyph;1 (Jan. 26, 1989) which, first, discontinued retroactive application of the 1986 rule and, second, required application of the pre-1979 utilization method to all open hospital malpractice insurance cost claims, and all properly pending appeals of the malpractice issue, for cost reporting periods beginning before the May 1, 1986 effective date of the 1986 rule. The prospective applicability of the 1986 malpractice rule was circumscribed from its outset by the prospective payment system. For hospitals subject to the prospective payment system, malpractice insurance costs attributable to inpatient services paid under the prospective payment system are subsumed under the prospectively determined payment rates that are applied to the various diagnosis related groups. Thus, the 1986 malpractice rule applied prospectively to only malpractice insurance costs attributable to: (1) outpatient services furnished by prospective payment hospitals; and (2) all services furnished by specialty hospitals and distinct-part hospital units excluded from the prospective payment system.
