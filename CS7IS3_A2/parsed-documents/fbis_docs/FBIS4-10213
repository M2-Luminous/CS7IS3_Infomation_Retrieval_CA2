There is mistrust. [Senate] President Firmin Jean-Louis is being keenly criticized and is suspected of working to get named prime minister. Yvon Gislain, vice-president of the legal office [title as heard], explains that he can convene the Senate if he wishes. Here is a report by Daly Valet: [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] It is true that the [Senate] office presided over by Bernard Sansaricq did not follow Senate regulations to the letter when it was being set up. It is true that this office trampled underfoot certain articles of the nation's Constitution. It is true that a climate of fear, worry, and insecurity was established at the Senate. It is also true, however, that Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the legitimate [Senate] office, is not a wholly innocent party in the Senate crisis. Thus said several parliamentarians who have broken their silence to condemn the dilatory maneuvers being effected by Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis in order to prevent the Senate from holding sessions. This time, the reactions come from Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis's side itself. Sen. Yvon Gislain, vice-president [title as heard] of the legitimate Senate office, condemns the fact that the office of which he is a member has not created any means for holding sessions at the Senate since [acting Prime Minister] Robert Malval was ratified. [Gislain] The Senate crisis began back at the time of Malval's rafification. From the time Malval was ratified, nothing has been done at the Senate. There is an office, of which I am a member. I admit that the office has never taken any initiative to hold further sessions. Other elements within the Senate take the initiative to form a second office without respecting the constitutional norms regarding the Senate's internal regulations. This is what has made this office ineffectual. It is really unconstitutional. I think, however, something must be done so that we can come up with something because the country is collapsing due to the fact that the Senate remains totally tied up. [Valet] Rumor has it that through the empty-seat policy at the Senate, Sen. Jean-Louis is defending his personal interests. Some say Sen. Jean-Louis is seeking to become prime minister. According to such people, this is why he does not want to hold Senate sessions. We have said: Well, these are rumors that Firmin Jean-Louis has not confirmed. The vice-president of the legitimate Senate Office, however, calls on Sen. Jean-Louis to hold sessions so that personal interests can be set aside for the benefit of the nation's interests, which are suffering. [Gislain] The whole thing is a question of holding sessions. If sessions are held, the [parliamentary] plan will be passed. It will be ratified, because there will always be a majority that will allow the plan to pass. [passage omitted] [Valet] After Deputy Duly Brutus, [Deputy] Antoine Joseph, and [Senator] Gislain, the ball is now in Sen. Jean-Louis's court, and he can do one of two things: either he will decide to create the means to hold Senate sessions or he will decide to let rumor continue to claim that, at the Senate, he is defending his own, personal interests.
