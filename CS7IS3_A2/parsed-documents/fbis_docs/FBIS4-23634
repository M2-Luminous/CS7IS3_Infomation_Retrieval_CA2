Our beloved country was adrift, threatened with imminent anarchy and disintegration. Some component parts of the nation threatened secession. Critical elements within the society openly invited the Armed Forces to intervene to secure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Nigerian state and to stem the tide of dangerous national descent into chaos and disorder. As a result of this nationwide concern about the state of our country and following intensive consultation with a wide range of interests, including the principal actors of the 12 June crisis, the Armed Forces, along with other patriotic Nigerians, took the initiative of (?devising) a way forward by forming a government of a grand national coalition. To facilitate reconciliation, this coalition comprised eminent political leaders from all shades of political opinion. It is, therefore, clear that this administration came in to perform a mission of national salvation. Fellow Nigerians, we have undertaken to lay a solid foundation for the growth of genuine democracy in our country. This is the agenda of our administration. We are determined to accomplish this historic task firmly, objectively, decisively, and with all sincerity of purpose. Guided by mature advice from the best political insides available in the country, we considered all options that could move the nation forward. Some of the options were practical but undemocratic. Others were emotional, among a vocal few, but not practicable. After exhaustive appraisal of all the options, we recognized as our best choice the convention of the constitutional conference. The constitutional conference is an opportunity for the duly elected of representatives of all Nigerians to come together for unfettered national dialogue and discussions on a wide spectrum of issues confronting us as a nation. I have already signed into law the decree establishing the conference. On 27 June, I shall inaugurate the constitutional conference. The conference agenda has been derived from more than 1,000 memoranda received from individuals and groups from all strata of our society across the length and breadth of this country. Let me state categorically our firm determination to see to the successful implementation of the program towards democratization. We must warn that our pursuit of this noble objective is unequivocal and cannot be compromised. Therefore, those elements in our society engaged in acts of confrontation, sabotage, rumor mongering, false alarm, and distortion of facts must bear in mind the full consequences of their acts of disservice to the nation. They must also be prepared to face the full force of the law of the land. This country is greater than any individual or group. No individual or group will be permitted to hold this country to ransom. We have had enough and we have seen enough. All well-meaning Nigerians condemn the attempt of some individuals and groups seeking to translate their personal ambition into a national trauma. It is clear that the constitutional conference would afford any group or individual with genuine grievances ample opportunity to discuss them. Choosing the path of confrontation and subversion at this time of our national history would not be tolerated. Such acts would be sternly punished. We acknowledge the interest demonstrated by the international community concerning our great nation. We know most of you are doing so with very good intentions. We urge you to continue to appreciate fully the magnitude of our problems and give support to our determination and courage to grapple with them. We, indeed, hope that in the true spirit of our national interest you should do nothing to encourage the idle dreams of self-seeking individuals or the parochial interests of small opportunistic groups within our society who are bent on acts of destabilization under various covers. This administration appreciates the political and economic crises confronting us today but we are determined to contain and control their painful effects on our people. Indeed, the economic policy of this administration has been realistic in appraising both the depth of the crisis as well as in offering genuine short- and long-term solutions. Fellow Nigerians, this administration has a solemn responsibility to maintain the corporate existence of Nigeria. We have a responsibility to achieve this objective through the enthronement of the principle of justice, equity, and fair play. Our mission is to ensure that we establish a very enduring democratic base that will form the bedrock for a sustainable, nationally acceptable governance for our nation. We enjoin all patriotic Nigerians to participate in this great national endeavor. Government wishes to thank all our citizens for their patience and show of understanding at this critical moment of our history. We ask all members of our society to continue to be peaceful and law-abiding. This administration wishes to reassure everybody of our commitment and determination to protect all lives and property. Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria! Thank you.
