Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), told an NPC forum marking the 40th birthday anniversary of the five principles of peaceful co-existence that they "conform to the spirit of the United Nations charter and illustrate the fundamental characteristics of a new-type international relations." The five principles of peaceful co-existence, namely the mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence, were first formulated by China and later advocated by China and its neighboring countries of India and Myanmar (the former Burma) in 1954. At that time, Tian said, these principles represented the common aspirations of the newly independent nations and their peoples. Over the past 40 years, the five principles have been accepted by more and more countries and "have played an important role in maintaining world peace." Tian said China is not only an advocate but also a faithful follower of the principles. The country has established diplomatic ties with 158 countries and developed economic, trade, scientific and cultural exchanges and cooperation with more than 200 countries and regions in the world. The NPC also pursues active exchanges with foreign counterparts on the basis of the five principles, establishing friendly ties with 130 foreign parliaments and international parliamentary organizations, he added. Tian stressed that China will continue to adhere to the five principles and will constitute no threat to any state or region, even after it becomes stronger economically. "China will forever be a stable factor for peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world," Tian said, adding "China has never sought for hegemony, nor will it begin to seek it." Vice-chairpersons of the NPC Standing Committee Fei Xiaotong, Lei Jieqiong, Qin Jiwei and Li Peiyao attended the forum. Leaders of non-communist parties and the foreign ministry made speeches on the birth and development of the five principles, and on the ever-growing role the principles play in the international political and economic arena. The forum was sponsored by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the NPC.
