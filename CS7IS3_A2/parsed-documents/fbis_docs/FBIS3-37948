According to the press center, leader of the Georgian delegation Jaba Ioseliani accused the Abkhazian side of waging "ethnic cleansing" in Abkhazia's Gali Region and said that "the Abkhazians respect only the language of force." He expressed doubt with respect to further continuation of the negotiations. Leader of the Abkhazian delegation Premier Sokrat Dzhindzholia rejected Ioseliani's assertions and called them "insulting." Meanwhile, member of the Georgian delegation Irakly Makhavariani reported in his interview with the Georgian TV on Thursday [24 February] that two days of the negotiations were fruitless. In his words, the parties are coordinating the document to return refugees to Abkhazia. Machavariani pointed out that the parties occupy controversial positions on this issue, that's why "it is difficult to find common approaches." He did not rule out that negotiations to be concluded February 24 would be continued on February 25 because, to quote Machavariani, "there is a certain advance in the position of the Abkhazian party."
