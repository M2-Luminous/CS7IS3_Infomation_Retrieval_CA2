Wang, one of the leaders of the brutally-repressed Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, was sentenced in 1991 to 13 years in prison, the heaviest term handed to any of the activists. He was released in late April and took refuge in the United States where he received medical treatment before coming here for a few days at the invitation of the journalists' group Reporters Without Borders. Wang is to give a news conference here Friday on the just published French version of the book "Like a Blade of Grass in the Desert," by his wife Hou Xiaotian, about her fight to win his release from jail.
