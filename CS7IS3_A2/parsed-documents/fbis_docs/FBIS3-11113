This is the government reaction to the indifference shown by the oligopolies to the stabilization plan and to excessive price increases. The list includes food products (canned food in general), cleaning and hygiene products (razor blades, toothpaste, tooth brushes, etc.), tires, ink, dyes, varnish, and chemicals used for the production of medicines. The minister said: "This measure will solve this problem. The country cannot bear speculation. Speculators will see that the government will take a firm line." The measure is a victory for the group within the government which advocates stronger intervention to check price increases, over another more liberal group which managed to shelve a provisional measure that sought to regulate action against abuses. Minister Cardoso said the government saw that prices of products whose import tariffs will be reduced were increased far beyond the inflation rate of the past 12 months. Cardoso said the resolutions to reduc these tariffs -- there are approximately 20 -- will be published in today's official gazette. Consequently, as of today importers will be able to bring those products to the domestic market at lower prices. Cardoso said: "I believe this measure will send a strong signal that the government is determined to prevent speculation." Beside reducing customs tariffs, the government will enforce measures to de-bureaucratize imports and facilitate the purchase of foreign products. The government published in yesterday's official gazette a list of 33 chemicals used for manufacturing medicines whose import tariffs were reduced to zero. The measure is valid until 31 December 1994, because Mercosur [Common Market of the South] regulations will come into force on 1 January 1995. Jose Milton Dallari, a special adviser to Minister Cardoso and a member of the so-called more liberal group within the government, does not support a control on the prices of oligopolies' products. He said: "If I go to a supermarket and protested against price increases, what would happen? Nothing, because people are tired of it." He says this is the main reason why he supports negotiating abusive price increases, discarding the idea of imprisonment, which Minister Cardoso has advocated.
