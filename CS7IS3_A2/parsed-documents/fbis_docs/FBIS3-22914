The shouting down of General Constand Viljoen by his own followers, the spate of explosions in the Transvaal and [Orange] Free State, and threats of "total war" have all been offered as portents of large-scale resistance by the far Right. While these developments undoubtedly reflect a hardening of attitudes among the conservative whites -- and the willingness of a minority to take up arms -- security analysts believe they do not signify the start of a major terror campaign. Instead, the analysts argue, the major rightwing groups -- the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], the Conservative Party and the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] -- are likely to continue to negotiate and/or use disruptive strategies before resorting to open violence to achieve their aims. Bill Sass of the Institute for Defence Policy says he doubts whether the current bomb blitz -- railway lines, pylons and ANC [African National Congress] property have been targeted in about 30 attacks since November -- directly involves the major players "yet." SAP [South African Police] public relations chief Major-General Leon Mellet agrees, saying the bombings are probably the work of small radical groupings or "cranks." Political-risk consultant Dr. Wim Booyse argues that the bombings to a large extent reflect the revival of "fundamentalist" groups, of the small "brandy and Coke squads" which were active in 1990/1991. "Some of the individuals may be linked to the formal right-wing but the deeds themselves are being carried out under the auspices of fundamentalist organisations. These, we found in the past, don't have any organisational structure. They are two and three-man bands." Referring to recent police breakthroughs in investigations into the attacks, Booyse adds that he would be "very surprised" if large numbers of people were arrested. However, while the small groupings lack identifiable structures and are more security conscious after the police successes in 1990/1991, the groupings tend to be vulnerable to police penetration. Booyse says police solved 87 percent of the 56 incidents in 1990. When, then -- if ever -- is the formal right wing likely to enter the fray in earnest? Mellet says that while many conservative whites who are disenchanted with the political process are preparing to defend themselves, "the actual number of people prepared to take up arms and start a war is few." He adds: "On the other hand, you take the IRA. They're only about 300-strong. You don't need an army to cause trouble. "A lot of these people are also ex-military people and you can't ignore that fact. "One can expect an increase in acts of sabotage and terror attacks ... I think they can cause enough trouble, but I don't think they have enough to ensure the election won't take place." Despite the probability of a Freedom Alliance election boycott, Sass says the major right-wing groupings appear to have written off the election as "political action between the NP [National Party] and ANC to put themselves in a better position." He says: "The next step is to keep making their point, making their emphasis with the future government. I don't see a sudden escalation (in right-wing violence). What we are seeing now is not just because of the election -- it's going to continue past the election." Booyse and Sass suggest that a real showdown could be delayed as long as five years after the election -- when the Constitution has to be implemented -- and then only if the formal right wing is not accommodated politically. Sass says that even before resorting to bloodshed, the Right -- because many of its supporters are farmers, miners and electricity supply workers -- has the ability to severely disrupt the country. Although collective campaigns involving white labour unions and agricultural unions -- and possibly the Right's Freedom Alliance partners -- would be difficult to organise, they "could come later." If the Right threw its full weight behind a concerted sabotage campaign, the results could be very costly for the new government. On the strength of the various right-wing para-military formations, Sass says, the AWB could have as many as "5,000 or 6,000 trained men," a relatively well-organised logistical line and, significantly, strong community support. On the other hand, the more significant of the smaller paramilitary groupings would be able to deploy "tens or maybe hundreds" of combatants. In terms of weapons, the organised right wing would have 9 mm pistols and shotguns in abundance and "probably quite a few AK-47s, R-4s and R-5s," Sass says. Also, because of strong support from white miners, they would have access to "a fair amount of commercial explosives." All told, they would have adequate quantities of weapons to wage a terror campaign, but not enough to take on the new government. Booyse echoes this view, saying that although the Right would have the ability to carry out a sophisticated IRA-type terror campaign, it would lack the resources to wage low-intensity guerilla warfare. Despite concerns about the extent of right-wing support in the SADF [South African Defense Force], Sass dismisses the prospect of a coup attempt -- in the short term -- by the generals who are currently negotiating the new National Defence Force with the ANC. However, he says sympathetic SADF members -- particularly in commandos in the rural areas where the right wing has strong support -- could break ranks if there was a major reaction on the part of the ANC against the Right "or if they perceived whites in general were under threat."
