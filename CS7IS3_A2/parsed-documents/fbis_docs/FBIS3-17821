Although most electoral districts still face a second round and the names of the new Supreme Council deputies will at best be known 10 April, two conclusions can be drawn now. The first is that today the republic is to all intents and purposes split. On the one hand, the western oblasts are the bastion of Ukrainian "independence," where most voters voted for Rukh and other "patriotic" movements. On the other hand, you have the east, which leans toward Russia and where candidates advocating rapprochement with Moscow celebrated their success. The results of a poll conducted in Donetsk Oblast showed the mood of inhabitants of the eastern regions today. According to preliminary figures, 87 percent of the oblast's residents were in favor of Russian being recognized as the second official language and 85 percent were in favor of Ukraine fully entering into an economic union with Russia. Both these demands are unacceptable to the "national-democratic" parties which won a decisive victory in the west of the republic. There is a real threat that the future parliament, torn between two irreconcilable political forces, will be unviable. Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil stated unequivocally that he will be unable to find a common language with former Premier Leonid Kuchma, who is "entirely Russia-oriented." However, it is Kuchma who is deemed the favorite in the coming presidential elections. He confirmed his popularity 27 March: In Chernigov Oblast, which borders Russia, Kuchma's candidacy won the support of over 90 percent of the voters. The second conclusion concerns Crimea. Eighty percent of the peninsula's inhabitants who took part in the poll of the population answered "yes" to two questions that Leonid Kravchuk has declared unconstitutional. As Kiev feared, the people of Crimea voted in favor of dual citizenship (Ukrainian and Russia) and greater autonomy from Ukraine. The outcome of the ballot not only threatens a fresh crisis between the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities but may well affect relations between Moscow and Kiev. [Crimean] President Yuriy Meshkov is making no secret of his plans: Based on the will of the people he will demand that the Crimean parliament adopt the appropriate laws. Aware that Kiev takes an extremely adverse view of this, the Crimean president is deliberately heading for a conflict, relying "on himself, on his administration, and the help of the Black Sea Fleet." For their part Ukrainian radicals are urging Kravchuk to use force to impose order on the peninsula. And although the Ukrainian president will hardly take their advice, the threat of armed confrontation is looming large. Especially if the Black Sea Fleet responds to Meshkov's appeals and backs him in violation of the Russo-Ukrainian accords. It is no coincidence that in a recent television interview Kravchuk spoke of the possibility of another Karabakh. Russian diplomats are giving assurances that Moscow's plans do not include exacerbating the situation in the Crimea. Russia is primarily interested in Kiev's nuclear disarmament, which may be suspended if a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity arises. On the eve of the Crimean poll the Russian authorities took an emphatically neutral stance, reluctant to interfere in the sovereign state's domestic affairs. Nevertheless events are largely developing contrary to Kiev's wishes. No matter how Yeltsin and Kozyrev urge restraint on Meshkov, the Crimean president is considerably closer in spirit to other Russian politicians. It is no coincidence, according to REUTER, that in one of his interviews he spoke of his enthusiastic view of Zhirinovskiy. If the crisis in Ukraine worsens while relative stability at least is preserved in Russia, separatist aspirations will receive a fresh boost -- and not just in Crimea. In that case Moscow may find itself involved against its own wishes in the maelstrom of events in the neighboring country. And even if Yeltsin takes a moderate stance, it is unlikely that the Duma, dominated by communists and nationalists, will resist the temptation to play the Crimean card and, in the future, the Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk cards.... A foreign diplomat accredited in Moscow admitted that during private conversations Russian officials have already begun testing the water in an endeavor to find out how the West would regard the dismemberment of Ukraine. At the moment these hypotheses are no more than that. At any rate Yeltsin's entourage has no intention of forcing the process. Annexing the Crimea would not improve the economic situation in Russia and would hardly strengthen its international position. The Russian Federation itself has enough trouble spots, is it worth adding another? The Kremlin has opted for wait-and-see tactics with regard to Ukraine, weighing up all the "pros" and "cons" and leaving the Kiev authorities themselves to unravel knots that are growing tighter by the day.
