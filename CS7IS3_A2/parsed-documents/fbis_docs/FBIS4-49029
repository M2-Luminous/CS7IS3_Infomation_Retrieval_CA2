Rabin emphasized the importance of secret talks in peace talks and criticized Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for refusing to give favorable response. He also blamed Syria for Hezbollah attacks in South Lebanon. To start the talks, Rabin and Christopher had a 15-minute private meeting and then were jointed by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, U.S. Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Talks Dennis Ross and other senior officials from both sides. Rabin said that Syria has made the maximum territorial demand, but not given the slightest hint of confidence-building measures, which can prove to Israeli public that Syria desires for peace. There are two major problems on the way to peace, namely, attacks by Hezbollah in Lebanon instigated or tolerated by Syria and Palestinian terrorism in the (occupied) territories, Rabin said. In the attacks in South Lebanon, Rabin disclosed, Hezbollah has deliberately targeted Christian villages, shooting at Christian villages, and shooting from inside the villages which are not situated in the "security zone." He noted that to allow Hezbollah to open fire from inside the villages is a violation of the understanding reached between Israel and Syria after the "operation of accountability" last year because it means that they can use the villagers as a human shield against Israeli retaliation. On Syria's refusal to conduct secret talks, Rabin said it is difficult to work with someone who says he wants peace but refuses to talk face to face. Christopher listened without a comment. But one of the U.S. diplomats said America's diplomatic activity is not a substitute for direct talks between the parties and this is clear to the Syrians. At Rabin's suggestion, the Israeli and U.S. officials split into three working groups on Syria, Jordan and Lebanon on detailed discussions. Later today, the entire party will reconvene and the working groups will report on their deliberations. According to Minister of Environment Yosi Sarid, who attended the meeting, Rabin did not make any hint that he will propose complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for full peace with Syria at this stage. However, Sarid said, Rabin has declared that he will uproot the Jewish settlements on the Golan Heights for the sake of peace and that the depth of withdrawal will be according to the depth of peace. By combining the two very important statements, people can come to their own conclusion.
