Our military affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that the security forces are continuing the manhunt in search of the murderers, but so far without any results. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will beef up its presence in the Trans-Samaria highway and adjacent areas. A senior military source told our correspondent that over the last few months security presence has been increased along the Trans-Samaria highway, but there are dozens of Arab villages on both sides of the road, and this makes it hard to prevent attacks. Some 25-28 wanted men from the rejectionist front organizations and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are active In Judaea and Samaria, as well as three 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that the Palestinian detainees who participated in terror attacks will not be released. He emphasized that first the problem of the Israeli MIA's must be solved, as well as that of the inhabitants of the territories who have aided Israel -- only then will Israel discuss the release of the Palestinian detainees. Over the last few days the Palestinian representatives negotiating with Israel have said that unless it is ensured that all the Palestinian detainees are released, they will not sign the full agreement with Israel.
