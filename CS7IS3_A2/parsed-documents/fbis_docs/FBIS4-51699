The Khmer Rouge 519 Division under Mit Sau pushed government forces from Yeang Dangkum by burning villagers' houses and soldiers camps, according to military sources on the border. The government force was later holding its ground under protection of artillery rounds fired from Ban Nimit base on Route 5. More than 25 shells fell in Thailand around Non Mak Mun and injured one Thai soldier. About 200 Khmer refugees had been trying to escape the fighting but were moved near checkpoint No. 27 of the 12th Ranger Regiment at Ban Nong Chan, a safe area away from the border. Another 300 Cambodians were scattered near the border. An additional Khmer Rouge force was pressing the government base at Ban Sing. A military source in Aranyaprathet said fighting began about noon yesterday about six kilometres south of Poipet. The Burapha Task Force authorized warning smoke rounds to be fired north of the government base after shells fell on Thai soil. A task force source said the Khmer Rouge attack was extremely cruel with reports of decapitation in order to intimidate villagers.
