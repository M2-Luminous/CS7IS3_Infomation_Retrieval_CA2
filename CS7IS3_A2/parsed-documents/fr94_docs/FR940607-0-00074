FR940607-0-00074 FR940607-0-00017 § XX .5(b)␣Appraiser Independence The agencies are adopting the proposed amendment concerning the use of appraisals prepared for financial services institutions other than institutions subject to Title XI of FIRREA. The agencies' prior appraisal regulations provided that fee appraisers must be engaged by the regulated institution or its agent. An exception to this requirement was permitted if the appraiser was directly engaged by another institution that is subject to Title XI of FIRREA. The agencies concluded that the prior provision on the use of appraisals prepared for other institutions was too restrictive. It required a regulated institution to obtain a new appraisal if the borrower originally sought a loan from an institution that was not subject to Title XI of FIRREA and was not an agent of that regulated institution. There also was uncertainty about the meaning of agent in these cases. The amended provision permits a regulated institution to use an appraisal that was prepared for any financial services institution, including mortgage bankers, if certain conditions are met. The appraiser must be engaged directly by the financial services institution and must not have a direct interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or the transaction. In addition, the regulated institution must ensure that the appraisal conforms to the requirements of the regulation and is otherwise acceptable. The prohibition on the institution using an appraisal prepared for the borrower remains in effect. The majority of comments concerning this provision favored the proposed change. One commenter requested that the agencies define financial services institutions and include mortgage brokers within that definition. Other commenters requested clarification of the circumstances under which a non-regulated institution can be an agent of a regulated institution and whether agents are prohibited from receiving a commission on each transaction. The agencies have decided not to adopt a specific definition of financial services institution. This term is intended to describe entities that provide services in connection with real estate lending transactions on an ongoing basis. The agencies do not intend to limit the arrangements that regulated institutions have with their agents, provided those arrangements do not place the agent in a conflict of interest that prevents the agent from representing the interests of the regulated institution. For example, the agencies do not require that there be a written agreement between the regulated institution and the agent, and the agent may represent the regulated institution solely with respect to ordering appraisals. In addition, the agencies' regulations do not prohibit agents from receiving a commission for transactions on which they order appraisals. Some commenters opposed the amendment because of their concern that it would increase the pressure on appraisers to render an estimate of value that favors the interests of the borrower. However, regulated institutions are not required to accept appraisals that are prepared for other financial services institutions. Therefore, the institution always retains complete control over the process of ordering real estate appraisals. In addition, institutions must determine that the appraisal ordered by the financial services institution complies with the requirements of the agencies' regulations and is otherwise acceptable. This should include obtaining assurance that the financial services institution has an independent appraisal. Other suggested changes to reduce the burden on secondary market transactions involving real estate notes, particularly for mortgage warehousing loans, are addressed in the exemption for transactions in real estate notes. IV. Waiver of Delayed Effective Date This final rule is effective on June 7, 1994. The 30-day delayed effective date required under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is waived pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), which provides for waiver when a substantive rule grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction. The amendments adopted in this final rule exempt additional transactions from the appraisal regulation, reduce appraisal standards, and provide other modifications that have the effect of relieving perceived restrictions. Consequently, all amendments in this final rule meet the requirements for waiver set forth in the APA. V. Paperwork Reduction Act OCC Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in this final regulation has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) under control number 1557&hyph;0190. The estimated annual burden per recordkeeper ranges from 0 hours to in excess of 100 hours, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 34.5 hours.
