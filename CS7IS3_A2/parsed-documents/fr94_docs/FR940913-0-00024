FR940913-0-00024 FR940913-0-00005 After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the committee's recommendation, and other available information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The 1994&hyph;95 crop year began August 1, 1994; (2) this rule relaxes minimum size requirements; (3) California olive handlers are aware of this rule as it was discussed and recommended at a public meeting; and (4) this rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization of this rule.
