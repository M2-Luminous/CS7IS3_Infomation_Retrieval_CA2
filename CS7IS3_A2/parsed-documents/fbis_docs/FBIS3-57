Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-23MAR94-GERMANY-U.S. Germany Positive But Cautious on Jobs Conference SUMMARY Reflecting Bonn's preference for structural reforms and opposition to economic stimulus measures, the German participants' positive evaluation of the 14-15 March G-7 jobs conference in Detroit focused on the conference proposals for education and labor market reforms but rejected U.S. suggestions that Germany stimulate domestic growth by reducing taxes and lowering interest rates. German officials were also cool to U.S. proposals for setting up new institutions to deal with the issues of unemployment, technology policy, and education, preferring instead to work through the existing OECD framework or through bilateral ties. END SUMMARY Germany's finance, economic, and labor ministers, all of whom participated in the jobs conference, seemed to devote virtually all their attention to the conference recommendations to promote economic growth through international trade, technological innovation and private enterprise and to achieve structural reforms through education, greater flexibility of the labor force, lower costs, and deregulation. Anticipating U.S. efforts to make the Bundesbank's interest rate policy a central issue, Bonn officials sought even before the conference to focus attention on structural issues and to avoid discussion of stimulus measures (Die Welt 14 March). They also rejected U.S. proposals for setting up new groups to study technology policy and employment and for creating a new institution to exchange ideas about education, suggesting instead that existing institutions and bilateral relations were better suited for dealing with these issues (Frankfurter Allgemeine, 15 March). No New Stimulus Measures Both Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt rejected the U.S. call for Germany to reduce its taxes and interest rates to stimulate domestic growth. Citing Germany's budget deficit, Waigel repeated Bonn's position that Germany's unemployment is a structural problem and that a cyclical recovery will not automatically solve the problem (Frankfurter Allgemeine, 15 March). According to Rexrodt, since new programs to "stimulate the economy" do not offer a way out of the German labor market crisis, efforts must focus on "structural changes" (DPA, 14 March). Structural Measures, Domestic Solutions German conference participants stressed the need to reform Germany's economic structures and, while welcoming cooperation on common concerns, rejected proposals to create additional G-7 institutions: --Indicating that he saw the jobs conference largely as a confirmation of the German government's plans for improving Germany's competitiveness, Rexrodt said he would take away from the conference ideas on "labor market flexibility, trade liberalization, deregulation," and lower wage costs, and said Germany must "learn from U.S. technological and innovation successes." He did not favor U.S. proposals for new study groups for technology policy and employment statistics, however, saying that the OECD framework already dealt with such issues, and he opposed creating a new institution for exchanges on educational issues, saying he preferred bilateral arrangements (Frankfurter Allgemeine, 15 March). --Similarly, Waigel stated that there is no "miracle cure " -- each country "must find its own solutions" and, for Germany, "structural reforms" will make its labor markets "better equipped for the challenges of the future" (Handelsblatt, 17 March). --Bluem, on the other hand, appeared to see more room for international cooperation, saying that the jobs conference had "clearly improved conditions for harmonizing labor market initiatives." Because of current practices of multinational corporations, he said, job developments can "no longer be an exclusively national task" (Sueddeutsche Zeitung 17 March). He cautioned against an "uncritical acceptance" of the U.S. model, however, saying that the drastic cost reductions have not led to the expected rises in profits (Frankfurter Allgemeine, 15 March). Press Reaction Press reaction echoed the largely positive official reaction, with several papers welcoming President Clinton's initiative, the G-7's focus on people's concerns rather than on macroeconomic issues, and the opportunity for international cooperation on employment issues. Most media supported the Government's stance against stimulative measures: --Frankfurter Allgemeine's Washington correspondent Carola Kaps on 16 March called it "remarkable" that a G-7 conference had focused not on "interest rates and exchange rates" but on the "well-being of the average citizen." She defended Germany's stance against stimulus measures, however, saying that the "nasty and trite" controversy over German interest rates shows that the "special German situation" is still being largely "ignored." Nevertheless, she said hopefully that the U.S. administration now "seems to understand" that Germany's current conditions "do not permit an additional stimulation" of demand. --The leading business daily Handelsblatt of 17 March, citing Clinton's observation that job losses in one country lead to higher unemployment in neighboring and partner countries, said that "no country" can fight unemployment with domestic means alone in a world economy that is increasingly interdependent. --Sueddeutsche Zeitung's chief editor Josef Jof fe also saw increased international cooperation resulting from the jobs conference, saying that such issues as "unemployment, health insurance, immigration" have become "international politics" and politicians now realize that domestic policy problems "cannot be solved exclusively" by a single country. He praised President Clinton's "initiative" for highlighting the "necessary shift in awareness" (16 March). --The left-of-center Frankfurter Rundschau presented one of the few negative reactions to the conference outcome, regretting the conference's failure to adopt new stimulus measures. "Any plans President Clinton may have had" for preparing a plan for coordination at the Naples G-7 Summit, it said, were "destroyed" with Rexrodt's "unmistakable rejection" of "any type of Keynesian economic program" (16 March).
