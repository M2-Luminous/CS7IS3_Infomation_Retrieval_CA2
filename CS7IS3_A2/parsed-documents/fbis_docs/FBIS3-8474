The strongest Moslem attacks with artillery support are taking place on Mount Ozren and Mount Trebava, south and east of Doboj. Bosnian Serb military sources said that Moslem troops from Zavidovici are trying to make a breakthrough in the area on Mount Ozren in a bid to link up with Moslem forces from Maglaj. The same source said that Serb fighters stopped the attackers with effective fire and forced them to retreat. The Bosnian Serb Army command said that Moslem Leader Alija Izetbegovic had ordered all his units to take Doboj and Mount Trebava at any cost and that fresh units from central Bosnia have been brought into the Zavidovici area for this purpose since Moslem-Croat fighting there had abated in intensity. Moslem units launched several attacks on Serb positions north of Maglaj, in northern Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military sources said. The Herzegovina corps of the Bosnian Serb Army said on Thursday that Moslem formations on several ocassions opened infantry fire on Serb positions between Mostar and Nevesinje, in southwestern Bosnia, on Wednesday afternoon. After the fire was responded to, the provocations ceased, it was said. A complete lull reigned on this part of the front during the past several months.
