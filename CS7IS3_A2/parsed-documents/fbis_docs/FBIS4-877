International Action Against Hunger said in a statement here that two Liberian nationals working for the group had been "held up for several hours last week at Kanweikan," about 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of the capital Monrovia. "They were held up by local military security officials on grounds that authorities had not been informed that the two employees had been transferred," the group said. It noted that the transfer had in fact been initiated by "the highest local civilian authority." A United Nations spokesman in Monrovia said Monday [18 April] that militants from the National Patriotic Front had seized five workers from the French agency, accusing them of backing a rival militia, the Liberia Peace Council.
