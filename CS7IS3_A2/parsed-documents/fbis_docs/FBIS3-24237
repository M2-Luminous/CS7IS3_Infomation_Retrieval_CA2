Despite a serious bullet wound to the thigh, he came out of the prison by himself, adroitly supporting himself on crutches that have already become habitual. Supporters had been waiting at the gate since 0900. A Russian National Unity honor guard company in full dress uniform was in formation. It greeted its leader with the thrice-repeated yell: "Glory to Russia!" Barkashov embraced each one of them and departed for home, where he has not been since 20 September 1993. The building in which Aleksandr Petrovich lives had two exits as recently as five months ago. One to the courtyard, the other to Leninskiy Prospekt. When in October of last year the sleuths of "democratic" detection were hunting for the leader of Russian National Unity, the second exit was walled up with brick masonry so they would not have to maintain two posts of "operatives" here simultaneously. This wall has remained as a modest monument to victorious "democracy." We met with Aleksandr Petrovich several days after his release at his apartment, which was left in a more than frugal condition. It had neither rugs nor expensive furniture. On the wall, next to Orthodox icons, was an ancient Russian knight's sword as the symbol of a fighting faith. Wounded, wasted by prison, Barkashov appeared the inflexible monk of this courageous religion to which Russia is doomed. After congratulating Aleksandr Petrovich on his release, I asked him how he felt about the amnesty. [Barkashov] I think it is a compromise step on the part of those forces that did not want the investigative activities with respect to the "October prisoners" to reach the court, because this would reveal the true culprits of the mass murders in October of last year. Other forces were able through the act of amnesty to resolve their own concerns, for example, to release the criminals, because those forces do not have another social base. As for me personally, I interpreted the amnesty in a positive way, since I know that in our country an investigation can drag on for years and not come to anything. But sitting in prison is not for me, I have to be active. In addition, I understand that this was an act that the authorities were forced into, and not some kind of sop. The public conscience had reached a level that the authorities could not risk holding us under guard anymore. What is more, I do not feel any kind of guilt for myself. On the contrary, the Procuracy committed such a string of violations in my arrest that I do not know how it would extricate itself were it not for the amnesty. [Turchenko] Our newspaper informed the readers about this in detail. But we have hardly written about the activities of Barkashov supporters in September-October of 1993. [Barkashov] As early as spring, when an attempt was made to introduce OPUS [special procedure for governing the country], we announced that if the president decided to dissolve parliament and usurp power, we were ready with all available resources to oppose this. After the publication of Edict No. 1400, a subunit consisting of 300 persons arrived at the House of Soviets in an organized way. For the first two days, it was on the street. Afterwards, we settled ourselves in the reception room of the Supreme Soviet. Soon, information began to arrive that forceful actions were being planned against the leaders of the Supreme Soviet, and even that an assault on the building was being prepared. The need arose to reinforce the security of higher state officials and the internal premises of the House of Soviets. We were asked to take part in this, and we were assigned specific places to guard, in particular, the Ministry of Defense, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the MB [Ministry of Security], and various vital life-support centers where, through underground communications, it was possible to get through to the inside of buildings. Our people guarded Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at their request. On 2 October we heard growing noise, and even shooting, from the Smolensk Square side. I sent my scouts to find out what was happening there. They went and returned through underground communications. They reported that the OMON [special purpose militia detachment] had provoked a clash and that people had been killed and wounded. That was the first time that weapons were employed against unarmed people. We have documentary pictures from which it can be seen how individual OMON members were firing from pistols at a short distance into the crowd. For some reason I did not see a word about this in the press. In addition, we also discovered that some foreign inspectors who were working under the Red Cross service for some reason were directing the activities of the OMON members, special purpose elements, and the militia. People were sitting in vehicles with foreign infantry weapons, and they were speaking in English. It became clear that a tragedy was developing under foreign leadership. [Turchenko] Do you have documentary evidence of this? [Barkashov] Yes, sir. When the time comes, I will publish it. [Turchenko] But, in your opinion, did the other events of 3 October not appear to be a tragic play acted out by foreign intelligence services in order to eliminate the most active patriotically inclined citizens? [Barkashov] I am convinced that 3 October was a real people's uprising. Almost half a million insurgents. The age group: youths from 16 to 25 and older men from 35 to 55, mainly workers and the technical intelligentsia. Plus a lot of women. Despite the clubs and tear gas, they breached several OMON barricades and in an absolutely sincere outburst broke through toward the House of Soviets. [Turchenko] I absolutely agree, as a people's uprising the October display was spontaneous, if, of course, the fact that for a whole week prior to this people were provoked to uprising by unjustified harsh beatings is ignored. But does it not seem strange to you that it was exactly on 3 October that the militia and the OMON left the House of Soviets? [Barkashov] You know, they did not leave. They scattered. The Dzerzhinskiy division, after receiving information about such a mass of people, quickly pulled out and departed in panic to its permanent station. Special purpose and OMON subunits also scattered in panic. Commanders abandoned their subordinates. We brought to the House of Soviets two companies of soldiers of the Internal Troops whose commanders had abandoned them. Later, two companies from Sofrino simply announced the desire to switch to the side of the insurgents. Only those who established themselves in the mayor's office fired on citizens. For some reason, nothing is being written about this, but I personally saw how people were wounded and killed by this fire. When in an outburst of indignation the crowd desperately hurled itself at the mayor's office, the firing became more intense. In order not to permit unnecessary bloodshed, seven of my companions, plus four fellows from the Union of Officers, rushed over there. All it took was several warning bursts for the mayor's office to quiet down. Then we led the half-drunk defenders of "democracy" away. [Turchenko] But why was it necessary go after Ostankino? [Barkashov] The leadership of the Supreme Soviet in those days undoubtedly displayed high courage. But in addition to courage, an ability to organize the popular masses was also needed. [Turchenko] In your opinion, to organize what? [Barkashov] This does not at all mean to shoot, to assault. It was enough with organized groups to take control of Moscow's main facilities. The march on Ostankino was a purely emotional outbreak: "The empire, they said, lies, a nest of evil..." I agree. But in such situations it is necessary to be guided not by emotions, but by sober calculation. If we need the television airwaves in order to tell people the truth about the events in Moscow, send a group of workers to Shabolovka, which was practically unguarded. And go on the air. There were many organizational miscalculations. As a result, the authorities gained time and the opportunity to organize the shelling of the House of Soviets. All that time our subunit was performing the duties entrusted to it, and was prepared to stand to the end. But when the leadership made the decision about going out, it made no sense to remain in the House of Soviets. On the evening of 4 October we surrendered our weapons in an organized way, and I ordered the boys to go out. I myself remained with Achalov when he was arrested, and demanded that I be taken together with him. However, an officer of the Ministry of Security answered that he had no instructions concerning me, and he advised that I leave with the "Alpha." I want to express my great gratitude to the officers of this subunit. Had it not been for them, there would have been far more victims. In any case, when "Alpha" turned the group with which I came out over to the OMON people, they took us in the direction of the stadium where, as we already knew, massive executions were being conducted. However, when officers of "Alpha" noticed this they raised their assault rifles and said firmly: Release these people. We were released... Unfortunately, not all of our boys remained alive. On 4 October, Dmitriy Marchenko, the editor of the letters department of our newspaper RUSSKIY PORYADOK, was wounded in the leg. He was taken to Sklifosovskiy. But relatives were soon informed that he was dead. When they came for him, they saw traces of brutal torture on his body. His nose and ears were torn off, the tendons in his legs were cut, and the back of his head was shot through. The body of Guards Major Anatoliy Surskiy was also found with traces of ritual torture. [Turchenko] What did you do after you left the House of Soviets? [Barkashov] We received information from our own people in the MVD that there was a directive to arrest a group of activists from Russian National Unity and, in addition, the chiefs would have no objection if anyone was shot while resisting arrest. It became necessary to shift to an illegal situation. [Turchenko] How did the October events affect Russian National Unity, did they not disorganize the movement? [Barkashov] On the contrary, the fighting men became stronger in spirit. We saw a large influx of new people into the organization. Many youths. Workers of many of the Moscow plants sympathize with our views, and the first Russian National Unity cells have been established there. [Turchenko] Would you be able to name at least the approximate numerical strength of your organization? [Barkashov] The fact is that our membership is three-staged. The first stage is the most numerous--these are sympathizers. Those who are most active and who have shown their worth move to the second stage--fellow-fighters. They go through special training in our, so to say, training institutions, they perform one-time or permanent assignments. Achieving a certain level, a fellow-fighter can become a companion-in-arms. This is a direct member of our organization with pertinent rights and disciplinary duties. I will not name the figure for all of Russia. But in Moscow we have about 1,500 companions-in-arms and more than 10,000 fellow-fighters, and there are several times more sympathizers. [Turchenko] What is the system of training in Russian National Unity? [Barkashov] We place the main emphasis on political and ideological training, to put it more exactly, on world outlook. Our main weapon is propaganda and agitation. Further, there is tactics, firing training, and hand-to-hand combat. [Turchenko] What does ideological training mean? Could you briefly formulate its basis? [Barkashov] It is very difficult to do so briefly. Its essence is awakening the national self-consciousness of the Russian people. Because as our statehood was built around the Russian people, so it will be revived around a Russian nucleus. The main thing is that it is necessary to show the whole truth to the people to the end. So that they may see not in words but with their own eyes that they are on the brink of extinction, and so that the instinct of self-preservation be turned on. It is necessary to point out their main enemy. And one exists, for a struggle between good and evil is going on in the world. [Turchenko] What capabilities do you have to report this truth? [Barkashov] First, a press organ--the newspaper RUSSKIY PORYADOK. The circulation is quite high--400,000. But it is also necessary to consider that its dissemination is targeted--only to the social environment that is of interest to us. In the present period, this is most of all workers and servicemen. [Turchenko] What is the base in the military environment? [Barkashov] There are companions-in-arms even in the senior generals milieu. There are fellow-fighters. The main mass is sympathizers. It is technically very difficult to establish primary Russian National Unity cells in the army, for the eyes and ears of the special department are everywhere. [Turchenko] How do you work in the units? [Barkashov] We arrive at the main gate checkpoint in the evening and disseminate newspapers in which there is always a contact telephone. Then you begin to get calls from the military unit, and later people walk in. And it is here that individual work with them starts. People receive individual instructions, they join our studies system, etc. [Turchenko] But are people not repelled by the fact that the symbolism of your movement has an emblem that is reminiscent of the swastika, which gives some journalists a reason to accuse Russian National Unity of fascism? [Barkashov] This is a democratic label. Our sign is the eight-pointed Star of Our Lady, who from days of old was respected in Rus. You will also find it on ancient icons and in the ornamental embroidery of Russian national costumes. We have explained all of this, with documents, more than once in our newspaper. When people read it, all questions are removed. [Turchenko] But why is this sign not seen in today's Orthodox Church? [Barkashov] Today's Orthodox Church promised to anathematize those who were the first to spill blood in October 1993. Instead of this, I see on television how priests kiss the organizers of murder. But God is their judge. As for the Star of Our Lady, its description is in all canonical literature and in icon paintings. All of this was gradually etched out of our memories, probably because previously the common people called this ancient sign a zhidobor [amulet to protect against Jews]. [Turchenko] Fine, let us drop this subject. Tell us, how did you arrive at your present views? [Barkashov] I am from a working family. My father worked all of his life in a TETs [thermal electric power center]. Mama was a nurse. I also worked at the same TETs for a long time as an electrician. As far as I can recall, I was always interested in books on Russian history. After 1985 I joined the Pamyat movement. I sensed in 1990 that it had become outdated. There was a need for a stronger and more united organization. Together with like-minded people, I left Pamyat and established Russian National Unity. My world outlook is from Russian historical science and knowledge of the attitudes of the working individual. But it was the development of the situation in the country itself that mobilized me to political activity. [Turchenko] Of the parties that exist now, which do you cooperate with and which do you like most? [Barkashov] We have a very strict ideology. It is difficult for us to find common language with those who paper over the cracks first and then join political games. We call things by their real names. Therefore, it is difficult to accept something like compromising alliances. But we are always ready to support tactically any political force that comes out for national interests. So the Supreme Soviet made a clear-cut statement about betrayal of national interests, and it said that it will defend them, and we immediately came to its assistance. [Turchenko] What is your prediction for the near-term development of the situation in the country? [Barkashov) Fundamental changes will occur this year. And if they are sufficiently fundamental (that is, if an uncompromising national policy is implemented), then within three years the people will be able to eliminate the consequences of the mess the reformers have created. [Turchenko] But do you see such forces? [Barkashov) I see the psychological condition of society, because I am not separated from it like Yeltsin, or as Khasbulatov was separated from it. Authority must resonate with the condition of society. If this does not exist, authority declines. Therefore, that is why changes have occurred: There is talk of accord, and the Russian question and changes in foreign policy are being stirred up. This, of course, is not out of goodwill. The present leadership simply understands that in its previous capacity it is becoming absolutely unacceptable to an overwhelming majority of the people. It will be forced to bring ever newer figures onto its staff until there is conformity between the will of the people and policy. [Turchenko] The forecast is more than optimistic. Many thanks.
