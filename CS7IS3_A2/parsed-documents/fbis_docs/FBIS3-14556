The attorney general also said that an evacuation would take place only after proper deliberations are held either in the cabinet or the Knesset and after the settlers are given sufficient time to appeal to the High Court of Justice. Similar remarks were made yesterday by Major General Dani Yatom, commander of the Central Command, to settlement leaders in Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. Gen. Yatom said that if the settlers are uprooted from Hebron it will be done in an orderly and public way and not like "thieves in the night." Our correspondent Mikhal Goldberg reports that before this promise was made, Uri Qarzan, a Tall al-Rumaythah resident, appealed to the High Court of Justice to order the defense minister and the Army to give 72-hours notice before evacuating Jewish settlers from Hebron. The court will deliberate on the appeal this week. Likud Knesset Member Mikha'el Eytan yesterday called on the prime minister and justice minister to give a week's prior warning before carrying out any evacuation in the territories. The Hebron march which was due to take place tomorrow will be replaced by a large gathering of settlers in Qiryat Arba' on Thursday, it was decided yesterday following a day of discussions between the settlers and Gen. Yatom and Gen. Sha'ul Mufaz, Army commander in Judaea and Samaria. [passage omitted]
