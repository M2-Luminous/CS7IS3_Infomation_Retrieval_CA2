This article addresses the contribution of HC to the formation of atmospheric NO. Atmospheric HC content is seasonably variable (highest concentrations occur in summer) and depends on the degree of industrialization of a region. HC is photochemically formed at the surface of bodies of water, and is dissociated by solar radiation, forming NO radicals. It is important to determine the rate of photolysis of HC. A slight dependence of this rate on altitude was found. Data is presented of ground-level measurements of HC over the course of the day. It is found that the contribution of HC to the formation of atmospheric NO is probably small compared to known sources of NO. However, on individual days when HC content reaches extreme levels, HC photolysis may lead to the formation of a significant amount of NO radicals. Consideration of the formation of NO from HC may be important in solving local problems, in particular, in the study of air pollution near reservoirs or industrial areas, key sources of HC. The combustion of organic fuel may be an important source of atmospheric HC. Tables 2; references 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.
