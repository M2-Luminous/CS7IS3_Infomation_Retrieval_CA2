Hasan Wirayuda, the ministry's director of International Organization Affairs, told a press conference here Wednesday: "The House of Representatives will have to discuss this matter before okaying the plan and hopefully the discussion can be completed by the end of this year." Wirayuda said that Indonesia had taken part in tough international negotiations on the phasing out of chemical weapons since they began in 1980 up to their conclusion in 1992 although Indonesia did not possess chemical weapons. He added that Indonesia's participation, which manifested the country's concern for national and regional security, was significant because it was the largest country in Southeast Asia and now chairing the Non-Aligned Movement. Vested with such national, regional, and global responsibilities Indonesia had no option but become a party to the convention, a position enabling it along with the international community to strive after the abolition of chemical weapons, and supervise the ban on their proliferation through the convention's system of verification, he said. He added that Indonesia had formed an interdepartmental committee assigned to prepare for the ratification. The committee was made up of representatives of the Ministries of Industry, Defence and Security, Trade, and Health, the Armed Forces Headquarters, the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) and the surveyor company Surveyor Indonesia Co. Ltd. The visiting executive secretary of the Provisional Technical Secretariat, Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (PTS-OPCW), Ian Kenyon, meanwhile has welcomed Indonesia's plan to ratify the convention. At present, only four of its 154 signatory countries had ratified it. Signatories to the convention to date were the United States, Russia, all Western European countries, all former socialist counrties in Eastern Europe, and a number of Latin American and Asian countries, Wirayuda said.
