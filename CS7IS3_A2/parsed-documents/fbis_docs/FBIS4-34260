De Leon, who arrived today in Cartagena de Indias to attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit told EFE that "the discussion of the displaced persons is being concluded." This issue was one of the biggest obstacles in the past two months of talks in Mexico. In Mexico, the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) discussed a solution for the resettling of thousands of peasants who have fled the war torn areas in northern Guatemala since 1960. The return of the displaced persons was not agreed on during the talks in Mexico because the government demanded a cease-fire in the area which the rebels refused to accept if progress was not made in other areas. Ramiro de Leon, who was sworn in as president of Guatemala a year ago following Jorge Serrano's foiled self-inflicted coup, told EFE that he believes the talks in Norway are "positive" and added that he is waiting for more news on the meeting. The Oslo meeting was scheduled to discuss the creation of the Truth Commission which, as in the Salvadoran case, would investigate crimes and human rights violations during the conflict; however, the Guatemalan Government does not want to advance on this issue until an agreement is reached on the displaced persons. The Guatemalan Government and the URNG began peace talks in 1991, but it was not until this year that they reached an agreement regarding human rights and the drafting of a timetable for negotiations that should end this year with the signing of a peace agreement.
