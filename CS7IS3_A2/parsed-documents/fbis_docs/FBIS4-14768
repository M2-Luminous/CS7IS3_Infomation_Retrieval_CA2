In Saturday's interview with Interfax, he said he intended to raise objections to the appointment of Ilyushenko as legal officer monitoring the Barannikov process. In defiance of the State Duma's amnesty decision and its acceptance by Barannikov, the criminal case against the man has not been dropped. According to Shteinberg, cases have been dropped against all the other defendants in the October case in line with the Duma decision. Shteinberg said that Ilyushenko had already indicated his approach to the case was personal and negative. If justice was not restored soon, the attorney would have to use the media to request President Yeltsin as the chief guarantor of the citizens's rights and to the State Duma that they take emergency action to protect the former minister's constitutional rights and freedoms. And, Shteinberg intended to brief influential Russian and international human rights organizations on the unfair treatment of Barannikov by the Prosecutor-General's Office.
