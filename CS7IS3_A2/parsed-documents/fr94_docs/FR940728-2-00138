FR940728-2-00138 FR940728-2-00099 Federal Aviation Administration RTCA, Inc.; RTCA Special Committee 183; Standards for Airport Security/Access Control Systems Pursuant to section 10(a)(2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (P.L. 92&hyph;463, 5 U.S.C., Appendix I), notice is hereby given for the formation of a new Special Committee (183), Standards for Airport Security/Access Control Systems. The notice and the Terms of Reference are as follows: Subject: Invitation to participate in the work of Special Committee 183, Standards for Airport Security/Access Control Systems. At its meeting held on April 19, 1994, the RTCA Technical Management Committee established SC&hyph;183 to develop Standards for Airport Security/Access Control Systems that: •comply with FAR Part 107.4 •recognize the range of user needs •are suitable for use throughout the airports system Mr. Karl Shurm of the Federal Aviation Administration, Civil Aviation Security Division, and Ms. Paula Bline of the Airport Consultants Council, were appointed to the Technical Management Committee to serve as Co-Chairs. The work of this committee will be of particular interest to airlines, airport operators, manufacturers, suppliers, installers and users. The Terms of Reference for the committee, RTCA Paper No. 221&hyph;94/SC183&hyph;2 are enclosed for your reference. All interested individuals are invited to participate in this activity and are encouraged to attend the first meeting to be held on September 13&hyph;14, 1994 at the RTCA Conference Room 1140 Connecticut Avenue, NW., Suite 1020, Washington, DC. Terms of Reference Standards for Airport Security/Access Control Systems Special Committee 183 shall prepare a minimum performance standard for access control systems that complies with FAR Part 107.14, recognizes the range of user needs, and is suitable for use throughout the airports system. Guidance The Special Committee should: 1. Review and incorporate, to the maximum extent practical, information and knowledge gained form the design, test, and implementation of the Universal Access System (UAS) prototype. 2. Review the present security/access control systems from a representative sample of each airport category. To manage this process, an inventory/survey of present systems would have to be conducted. 3. Identify near-term approaches to improvement of maintainability, and easing the difficulties of hardware/software modification. 4. Establish a plan for the progression of existing systems, toward a functionally standard system. This would include, but not be limited to, the development of guidance on function, performance, hardware, software, and communications standards for airport security/access control systems. 5. Establish a standard communications protocol/process and access media. 6. These characteristics, for both hardware and software, would be developed to achieve commonality to save life cycle costs and to stimulate competition to the degree possible, they should promote upgrading of existing systems to the standards. 7. The Special Committee needs to complete its work 9 months from delivery of the initial UAS prototype results. Issued in Washington, DC., on July 22, 1994. Steve Zaidman, Acting Designated Officer.
