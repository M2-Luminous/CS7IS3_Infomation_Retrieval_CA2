The 27 cooperatives and companies set up a coordinating office for the new group in the maritime safety agency's office in Wakkanai on the northern tip of Hokkaido. The consultative body will consider safety measures with regard to all foreign ships visiting Wakkanai port, but focusing on Russian ships. Many of them lack shipowners' liability insurance to pay for damages and rescue costs. The group will also distribute Russian language pamphlets, noting sites near the port where water is shallow and containing information as to where repair work can be carried out. It will also coordinate the quick provision of rescue equipment when called for. Visits by Russian ships have rapidly increased in parallel with growing contacts between Japanese in Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands, and Russians on Sakhalin island, which is directly north. Last year, 1,323 foreign ships made port calls at Wakkanai, surpassing for the first time the number of such ships visiting Otaru, a major Hokkaido port. Some 97 percent of the foreign ships visiting Wakkanai were Russian.
