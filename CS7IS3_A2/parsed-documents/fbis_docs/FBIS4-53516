During a news conference after taking over the chairmanship, Toyoda discussed the pending automobiles issue between Japan and the United States. He said: "With regard to objective criteria (to gauge the openness of the Japanese market), it seems that the government has some ideas of its own. However, I understand that (the two countries) have not agreed on numerical targets." He indicated that JAMA has no intention to set numerical targets for imports of auto parts and finished cars from the United States. JAMA published an "action plan" to help promote the import of foreign-made auto parts and finished cars last March. As Japan and the United States work toward the resumption of the economic framework talks, certain quarters in the United States are again asking for concrete numerical targets. Commenting on this, Toyoda said: "Automobiles is a sector where cooperation is done mainly within the private sector in both countries. On the part of the Japanese makers, we feel that our efforts to increase local production of cars in the United States and working for (the elimination of friction) have not been fully appreciated. Numerical targets have not been approved even between the two governments." Regarding objective criteria to measure the degree of market liberalization, Toyoda took a cautious stance, saying: "Some people suggest setting a number for car importers. Dealers function differently in Japan and the United States. What do we base this figure on? This is an issue that requires further discussion."
