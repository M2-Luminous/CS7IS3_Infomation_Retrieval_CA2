Warrant Officer Andy Pieke said police had been sent to Park Station to prevent crowds of marchers pouring into the city centre, declared an unrest area after more than 50 people died in gunbattles surrounding the Zulu march. The police spokesman said one man fleeing the bullets on Thursday was injured when he ran into a traffic light post and another when he smashed into a shop window. He said several people had been arrested and police were still at the scene of the gathering two hours after the police action, "monitoring" the situation. Police dispersed the group minutes before 9AM. W/O Pieke said the demonstrators were trade union members, preparing for a protest march apparently connected to wage demands.
