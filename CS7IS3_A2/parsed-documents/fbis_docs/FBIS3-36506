"Russia and Georgia are historically bound to cooperate with each other in that region, they are linked by bonds of long-running friendship and need each other," he told Interfax. Ryurikov says that the outline agreement will build up their potential to help towards a peaceful solution to the conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It is this move that was long awaited both in the Caucasus and Black Sea region as a whole. The presidential adviser denies any threat from Russia's commitment to help Georgia set up its own army. Nor will this lead to renewed conflicts in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, he says. Militarily, said Ryurikov, Russia will prefer to deal with a disciplined army rather than separate armed units meddling in politics. In his words, Russia is determined to effectively monitor the process of creating a Georgian army while the Russian military are well aware of how responsible is the job facing them. Speaking to local intellectuals in Tbilisi on Thursday, Yeltsin said that a balanced, unbiased and well-wishing approach to all sides in the conflicts was Moscow's foreign policy priority. He said any other approach would be perilous both to Russia and other countries. In his words, Russia is prepared to offer whatever help is needed to defuse all conflicts in the region. On the framework agreement between Moscow and Tbilisi, Yeltsin said its ratification would depend on the extent of Georgia's drive for a negotiated solution to the confrontation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. He called on Georgian intellectuals to play an important role in the regional peace process. The Russian leader described the CIS as "a very effective instrument for the peoples' rapprochement" and Georgia's entry into the Commonwealth as "a sensible move".
