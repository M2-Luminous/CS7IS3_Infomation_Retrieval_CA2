According to the standing orders, deputies began work by electing a chairman. Eduard Rossel received 18 of the 27 votes. I would recall that about a year ago Rossel was removed from the post of governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast by Russian presidential edict for attempting to proclaim the Ural Republic. After his removal, his popularity rating rose even higher. The oblast inhabitants elected Rossel deputy to the Russian Federation Council and then deputy to the Oblast Duma. In addition, the heads of administrations of the territories adjoining Sverdlovsk Oblast picked Rossel as president of the Urals Economic Cooperation Association, and the nonpolitical movement "Transformation of the Urals" elected him chairman. In this way the Urals demonstrated its disagreement with Moscow's edicts and supported the out-of-favor governor. Meanwhile, Eduard Rossel continued to develop the idea of regional self-government along the lines of the U.S. states or the German laender in the belief that it is necessary to abandon the national division of Russia and switch to a territorial division. He put that idea to the deputies in the Oblast Duma. Incidentally, Vladimir Volkov, the second contender for the post of chairman of the Sverdlovsk Duma, also stated in the pre-election debates that the constitution of the Ural Republic should form the basis of Sverdlovsk Oblast's charter. Now that Eduard Rossel has become chairman of the Duma and the latter is actively supporting the idea of regionalism, we can expect quite an interesting development of events. The Duma is beginning to work on the oblast charter, copying it from the Constitution of the Ural Republic. But whereas the Constitution had to be ratified by a vote of the Russian parliament, the charter is adopted by the Oblast Duma itself. One of the main provisions of the charter is the election of the oblast governor by universal suffrage. Eduard Rossel makes no secret of his intention of running for this post if elections are held. Bearing in mind Rossel's prestige and his reputation in the oblast, it may be said that he has a very good chance of being returned as governor, unless, of course, the president of Russia bans the elections of governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast, as happened last fall.
