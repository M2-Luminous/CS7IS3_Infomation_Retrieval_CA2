FBIS3-28427 "dreas025_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 North Korea Radio Denounces U.S. Report on Human Rights SK0502013494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2308 GMT 4 Feb 94 SK0502013494 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2308 GMT 4 Feb 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] According to a report, the U.S. State Department, in its annual report on the human-rights situation in the world, has raved absurdly as if the citizens in our country are not ensured with even basic human rights while enumerating on human-rights conditions in various countries. This is shameless interference in our country's domestic affairs and intolerable debasement of the popular mass-centered socialist system of our own style. Our government of the Republic, which sets up as a firm policy to value the people and respect the people's rights, practically ensures the true sense of freedom and rights for all citizens and reliably guarantees a bountiful and happy life for them. The policy of the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style which embodies the chuche idea is the true human rights policy that respects and guarantees everyone's human rights to the maximum. The fact that the United States, distorting a stern reality, comes out with the rumor on so-called human rights violations in North Korea is nothing but a cunning scheme aimed at staining the image of our Republic internationally so as to isolate [korip] us. This clearly shows that the United States is strengthening propaganda maneuvers in every way to lay an artificial obstacle in way of the DPRK-U.S. talks for fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, to heighten the tension on the Korean peninsula to the extreme, and to base the Republic. In fact, speaking of the chieftain of human rights violations and the barren land of human rights, the United States and South Korea are the ones. It is ridiculous for the United States to babble about our nonexistent human rights issue without uttering a word on this. If the United States thinks it can damage the superiority and the invincible cause of the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style with this nonsense, it is a miscalculation. The United States must immediately give up the anti-Republic, anti-socialist strategic propaganda maneuvers, such as our so-called human rights issue, the byproduct of the U.S. reactionary strategy.
