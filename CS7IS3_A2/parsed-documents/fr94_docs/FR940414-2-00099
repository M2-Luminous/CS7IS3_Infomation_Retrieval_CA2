FR940414-2-00099 FR940414-2-00069 Lastly, the Commission believes that the automatic exercise feature of capped options necessitates that, when the PSR lists capped options on a specific index, the PSE ensures that the exercise settlement value for the index is accurate at all times. An erroneous exercise settlement value could conceivably result in the unwarranted automatic exercise of capped options and the irreversible elimination of an options position. Accordingly, in this regard, the Commission notes that the PSE has developed procedures to identify and correct any exercise settlement values prior to settlement of such contracts at OCC. 8 8 See Amendment No. 4, supra note 1. The Commission finds good cause for approving the PSE's proposal to list capped options prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register because the Exchange's proposal is substantially the same as the formerly submitted and approved CBOE and Amex proposals to list and trade capped options. 9 The Commission received no adverse comments on the CBOE or Amex proposals during the 21-day comment period. The Commission also does not find any different regulatory issues arising from the PSE's proposal. Thus, the Commission believes it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis in order to facilitate competition between the exchanges for product services, which, in turn, should benefit public investors. The Commission believes, therefore, that good cause exists for approving the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. 9 See note 5, supra. IV. Solicitation of Comments With respect to the PSE proposal, including all amendments, interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by May 5, 1994. It it therefore ordered , Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 10 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;93&hyph;22) is approved. 10 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
