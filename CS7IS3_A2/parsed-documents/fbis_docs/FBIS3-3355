The letter says more than 100 victims of Japanese aggression during World War II were detained Friday in front of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, a day before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa arrived in China for a three-day official visit. "According to eye witnesses, there were no marches, demonstrations, petitions, sit-ins, shouting or similar disturbances. On the contrary, they expressed themselves peacefully and had an orderly attitude," said the letter, describing the activists. "All were crippled after receiving injuries and being forced to labor for the Japanese Army during the time of the Japanese invasion," it said. "The oldest is 85 and the youngest is 56." The letter also called for the release of Tong Zeng, a leader of the compensation movement, who since 1992 has received support from NPC delegates on the matter of demanding compensation from the Japanese Government, it said. Sources close to the movement said the 100 elderly activists were released and sent home Sunday evening, but that Tong's whereabouts were still unknown. Tong's wife also made inquiries into her husband's whereabouts, but was told by police that nothing was known of his case, the sources said. Police took Tong from his home Friday morning after he refused to follow orders of his work unit to leave Beijing during the Hosokawa visit, they said. A group of 32 NPC delegates at the ongoing session of the NPC, China's legislature, earlier filed a motion demanding compensation for civilian victims of the war from Japan and a formal apology by Hosokawa, but the motion has reportedly been shelved by central authorities. Informed sources said the Movement for War Compensation is potentially huge as elderly Chinese still harbor rage at the Chinese Government's agreement to give up demands for war reparations from Japan as stated in the 1972 Sino-Japanese joint communique which restored diplomatic ties between the two countries. Police have singled out Tong because of a letter, forged with Tong's signature and sent to thousands of victims calling them to come to Beijing during Hosokawa's visit, one source said. The one-page letter, which also urges the NPC to make security departments apologize, is accompanied by seven pages of names of mostly elderly Chinese intellectuals. "The play in front of the Japanese Embassy and acted out by public security organs was utterly outrageous, ridiculous and lamentable," the letter said. "This is very incomprehensible and has left us outraged."
