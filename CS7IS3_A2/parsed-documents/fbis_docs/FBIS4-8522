Speaking for the Belgrade evening paper VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Wednesday, Kesic said that a very powerful group of anti-Serb inclined Washington officials, having realized that Washington's peace initiative for Bosnia-Herzegovina had collapsed and fearing the reaction of the public opinion and media, were plotting to continue the aggression against the Bosnian Serbs. He said that the group, which had already made plans of attacks on Bosnian Serbs, was headed by Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security advisor, and added that it was especially influenced by Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Kesic said that the world power wielders had gone so far now that they had to launch airstrikes to prove their effectiveness. They were now, however, trying to find a way out of the horrible situation they had created themselves, knowing that if they backed up now the media would tear them apart. Kesic said that a continued aggression against the Serbs was very likely, which is supported by the fact that plans to that effect had already been made. The bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde is a hot issue in Washington because the U.S. public initially backs U.S. military actions, but as soon as problems arise, it turns to fierce criticisms, Kesic said in conclusion. U.N.-sponsored American warplanes within 24 hours (on Sunday and Monday) launched two air raids on Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde (a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia), just as the Serb forces were about to crush a Moslem offensive, launched from Gorazde, a U.N.-designated "safe area", which should have been demilitarized back in 1993. The anti-Serb lobby in Washington is preparing fresh attacks on the Bosnian Serb republic because it has realized that, after the failure of the U.S. peace initiative, Russia would become more engaged in helping settle the Yugoslav crisis and Europe would urge that the peace initiative for the former Yugoslavia be returned to Geneva.
