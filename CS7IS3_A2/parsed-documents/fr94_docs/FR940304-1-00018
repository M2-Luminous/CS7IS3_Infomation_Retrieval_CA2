FR940304-1-00018 FR940304-1-00004 As of June 1993, only 57 low-income credit unions out of 146 maintained nonmember accounts. The total dollar amount of these accounts was approximately nineteen million, with the average dollar amount per low-income credit union approximately $339,000. Surveys indicate that low-income credit unions maintaining nonmember accounts are currently paying below market rates on the vast majority of these funds. It appears that most low-income credit unions, as most other credit unions, use nonmember accounts prudently and do not maintain excessive amounts of these funds. NCUA recognizes that nonmember accounts can be crucial to a low-income credit union in meeting the fundamental purpose of a credit union: Promoting thrift and creating a source of credit for its members. Nonmember funds can be invested to provide earnings that are paid out to members in the form of dividends, and they can provide a source of much needed loan funds. Moreover, nonmember accounts can generate income that can be a source of badly needed capital. Over the period from the adoption of the regulation in 1988 through June 1993, 50 of 59 waiver requests (85%) have been approved. This suggests that most waiver requests have been justified and acceptable to the regional director. Although a high percentage of the waivers have been approved, the procedure has proven burdensome for some credit unions. Given the small asset size of most credit unions, the 20 percent limit frequently requires waivers for small amounts of funds that pose very little risk to the credit union and the NCUSIF. Both credit unions and NCUA may be expending much more time and paperwork on waiver requests than safety and soundness requires. Although the NCUA Board remains concerned with the potential misuse of nonmember accounts, the Board believes that a modification of the 20 percent limit may be justified. The Board is proposing the following changes to the rule. It is proposed that a credit union be able to maintain permissible nonmember accounts up to 20 percent of total shares or $1.5 million, whichever is greater, before a waiver by the regional director is required. This change recognizes the benefit of a limitation on nonmember accounts but also allows a credit union to maintain a reasonable amount of nonmember accounts, up to $1.5 million, without requesting one or more waivers from the regional director. As under the current rule, all credit unions accepting nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares would be required to have a plan for the use of such deposits. Further, the plan would be submitted to the Regional Director for information. Prior NCUA approval would be required, however, only for amounts in excess of both 20% and $1.5 million. The plan would describe how nonmember accounts will be used to serve the credit union's membership, i.e., by providing loanable funds to its members or through increased earnings. This requirement should ensure that federally-insured credit unions have a reasonable plan in place for the use of the funds. As under the current rule, the plan would provide for matching maturities of nonmember accounts with corresponding assets, or a justification for any mismatch; and provide for an adequate income spread between public unit and nonmember shares and corresponding assets. The credit union would submit the plan to the regional director, prior to receiving nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent, for NCUA's information and monitoring. NCUA approval would not be required before the credit union accepts additional nonmember accounts, unless the aggregate amount exceeded both 20% of shares and $1.5 million.
