The Spanish Government has expressed its support for carrying out actions in the area to serve as a warning, such as selective strikes against the Serb aggressors. Also on the defense minister's agenda: the details of Spain's joining of the Eurocorps. Our correspondent in Berlin, Aurora Minguez, has the details. Good afternoon. [Minguez] Good afternoon. The press conference has just ended here at the German Defense Ministry building and Julian Garcia Vargas has just told RNE that he is opposed to the withdrawal of the blue helmets stationed in Yugoslavia, although he does favor the idea of reducing contingents. [Begin Garcia Vargas recording] That would mean that a particular country could leave for good or temporarily, with the system of rotation operating as one supposes will happen, and concentrating the remaining blue helmets in certain zones where they were essential -- in Sarajevo, of course -- but, at the same time, giving a very clear indication to all the parties that the current situation cannot continue, and therefore that presence may be reduced drastically or, in certain cases as in the case of a particular country, may disappear. [end recording] [Minguez] The Spanish defense minister also expressed support for selective strikes on the Bosnian city of Tuzla in order to break the Serb siege and thus allow humanitarian aid to reach the civilian population, which is protected -- on paper -- by the UN, which considers this Muslim enclave an international protection zone. Yugoslavia was one of the topics in the talks between Garcia Vargas and his German opposite number, Volker Ruehe, but it was not the only one. The two ministers expressed their support for continuing to make a cheap version of the European fighter aircraft and their support for NATO opening up to the countries of East Europe, with whom joint military manoeuvres are in fact going to be carried out this year.
