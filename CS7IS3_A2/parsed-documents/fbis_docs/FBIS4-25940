The threat came as the Nigerian Military Government, headed by General Sani Abacha, is making painstaking efforts to explain its position that the route of the national constitutional conference is the best option for resolving the nation's current crisis. The constitutional conference is the conception hammered out by the Abacha administration shortly after it took power in mid- November last year. In an obvious change in his declared hardline position, Abiola announced Friday [10 June] night the postponement of his swear-in ceremony scheduled for Sunday. In his letter to the National Democratic Coalition (Nadeco), a new opposition group in Nigeria, Abiola said, "As a man who respects the religious beliefs of our people and based on the unanimous advice of our leaders of Nadeco, I confirm to you the postponement of the swearing-in ceremony." However, Abiola's shift does not necessarily mean the disappearance of his former threats. Local press reports said today that the swearing-in ceremony may come up at 2:00 P.M. (local time) on June 13. But the question is, "Can Abiola unilaterally proclaim himself president when there is the military government in power? Or put it simply, can Abiola become a rebel by taking up arms to defend his mandate?" His action will result in a confrontation as the Nigerian military is under the control of the Abacha administration. Asked how he would be sworn-in when Abacha is in control of the military, Abiola told the press that the Nigerians will know later whether the military is backing Abacha. However, such braggings of Abiola are not powerful enough to convince his supporters that he is ready to take any risk to uphold what they called the mandate. Skepticism about Abiola's plans is widespread in the West African country. Unwilling to see their motherland plagued by a series of political crisis, more and more Nigerians prefer that the current crisis in the nation be settled in a peaceful way. The former Nigerian military regime, headed by General Ibrahim Babangida, annulled the June 12 presidential poll last year and plunged the nation into a political crisis. After the annulment, Abiola launched an unsuccessful campaign, which took him to the United States and some European countries, trying to have the military decision reversed. Last July, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of Lagos to protest the Babangida administration's decision to annul the first presidential poll in a decade in Nigeria. But now, the Nigerians largely adopted a lukewarm attitude towards the anti-government calls from the opposition groups. Moreover, there is no indication that those organizations, which supported Abiola last year, are prepared to back him at present. On the eve of the first anniversary of the annulled presidential polls, the Nigerian military and police forces moved to beef up security in Lagos. Which way will Abiola take? Will he be faithful to his pledge to form a government? The Nigerian police is waiting to see what Abiola will do in the next few days.
