FBIS4-12694 "drnes070_l_94013" FBIS-NES-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Testimony on 2d Person at Cave Reported Testimony on 2d Person at Cave Reported TA0804103794 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 8 Apr 94 p A11 TA0804103794 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by Dalya Shehori] [Excerpts] Mystery surrounds the presence of a second person who entered the Cave of the Patriarchs after Barukh Goldstein and who, according to testimonies by soldiers who guarded the eastern gate, was carrying a Galil rifle. When Major Dov Stelman, the cave commander, arrived at the cave and ordered all those present to remain on the premises, this person had already left and was not questioned by the police. Colonel Yo'av Galant, who testified before the Shamgar Commission on 31 March behind closed doors, said "some degree of cooperation may be involved here." Col. Galant believes Goldstein's operation was planned. Galant outlined the conclusions and recommendations he drafted in a report he prepared at the request of Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in the West Bank. The report recommends that the prevailing status quo at the cave be changed and that a full "territorial" division be made between Jews and Muslims by banning the Jews from praying at Isaac Hall; that new security arrangements be prepared and that the cave be reopened to the public only after they are completed, "even if it takes a very long time;" and that the security arrangements include stationing a significant police force, an antiterror team, and a permanent and well-trained military unit. The report also recommends that, after all of the steps are taken, worshipers not be allowed to enter the cave armed. [passage omitted] Col. Galant presented his report to Gen. Mufaz and to Maj. Gen. Dani Yatom, commander of the Central Command, on 7 March, 10 days after the massacre. Upon his request, Galant testified behind closed doors but, following a HA'ARETZ appeal, the privileged status of the testimony was lifted. [passage omitted] Answering a question by Commission Chairman Shamgar, Col. Galant confirmed that "the other person was only seen coming in; no one saw him leave." Shamgar speculated, therefore, that the man could have left the cave along with the Arabs who were fleeing after the shooting, and Galant agreed. [passage omitted] Galant further said that it is assumed that Goldstein entered Isaac Hall from Abraham Hall and that the Jewish worshipers there did not know what his purpose was -- that is, they were not certain he was about to commit an act of violence. Perhaps they thought that "in the framework of the constant provocations that take place in the cave, they would let him in to tease the Arabs a little; after all, it was Purim. No big deal. Then Goldstein went in, and they closed the doors behind him." Galant stressed, however, that he had no evidence to support this assumption and that he only brought it up to illustrate the dilemmas he encountered while preparing his report, but he formed no opinion on this issue. [passage omitted] Col. Galant believes "Goldstein's act was premeditated." This assumption is based on the fact that he was carrying a large number of magazines and that he left notes indicating that he feared he might not return from his operation. "He went there to shoot; otherwise, it is hard to explain why he took earplugs with him. I believe everything he did was perfectly timed to the moment the Muslims kneel to pray to attain the maximum effect during his attack," he noted. Galant added that Goldstein was killed by blows to the head from heavy objects and did not shoot himself, as was initially believed. [passage omitted]
