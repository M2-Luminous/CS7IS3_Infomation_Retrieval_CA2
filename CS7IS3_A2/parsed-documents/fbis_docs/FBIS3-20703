Euphemistically speaking, it did not turn out to be successful. The hosts came up with an idea to seat the delegations at separate national tables during the official dinner. Is this separation a sign that the group will part company? [Jeszenszky] Central Europe specifically represented by the Visegrad Group has a concrete base, bound by historical and dynastic ties, the experience of the 18th and 19th centuries, the loss and regaining of independence, the difficult task of regaining statehood, and the common experience with communism. Today's problems, specifically those of the four countries, our mentality, the state of the environment. Everything is similar. [Pawlowski] One can see that this is still too little. Does the clear lack of interest from the Czech side and the growing strain between the Hungarians and the Slovaks mean that the group has de facto fallen apart? [Jeszenszky] Regardless of whether someone likes the name Visegrad Group and the idea of common meetings and consultations, Central Europe exists because of historical, cultural, and economic ties. Specifically, the last two need rejuvenation. The CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Association] free trade zone should help in this. Paradoxically, foreigners are also helping us; the Americans, who sought to have the four [Visegrad Group] hold a joint meeting in Prague, also the European Union and other European institutions that treat us as a group of states. Hungary and Poland are for continuing this form of cooperation. Slovakia, although with less enthusiasm, is also behind this. The Czechs will also come around to realizing that there are no shortcuts into Europe or NATO and that all of our countries will more or less at the same time enter European institutions. At that point, we should maintain Central European Solidarity, just like the Scandinavian countries. [Pawlowski] Solidarity is a beautiful word. Will Slovenia join us? The Hungarians are already laying the groundwork. [Jeszenszky] Slovenia is doing splendidly and does not deserve to be on the sidelines just because it was a republic in Yugoslavia in the past. [Pawlowski] Who else is waiting in line? [Jeszenszky] I am not against new members, but we should not forget about the Central European Initiative, the CEI, grouping us with many of our neighbors. It does not matter what this organization will be called because we cannot escape from our neighbors. [passage omitted] [Pawlowski] The elections in Europe were a surprise on both sides of the former Iron Curtain. Social frustrations becoming apparent. Extremists are coming to the fore, from both the left and the right. Populists, nationalists. Do you believe, sir, that, in the spring parliamentary elections, the Italian scenario may repeat itself in Hungary, when in the end the socialists, yesterday's communists, and the far right met? [Jeszenszky] Italy is Italy, and Hungary is Hungary. I believe that in Hungary the elections will be between the parties from the center. In Hungary, there are some extremists of various shades, but they are not strong or radical or dangerous enough. [passage omitted] [Pawlowski] Mr. Minister, you stated that Hungarian politicians do not differ on foreign policy. Didn't this consensus collapse when Istvan Csurka attacked the proposal in parliament concerning the final borders between Ukraine and Hungary? [Jeszenszky] Mr. Csurka is finished as a politician who many times has shown the total erroneousness of his ideas. His behavior at the time of the death of Premier Antall (he organized a number of meetings that brutally attacked Antall's accomplishments--the editors) cost him even the weak support backing him. I would not overestimate the fact that he does not support Hungarian foreign policy. [Pawlowski] Istvan Csurka and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy--how do they resemble each other and how do they differ? [Jeszenszky] Zhirinovskiy knows at least a few foreign languages, and Csurka not even one. Csurka is less dangerous than Zhirinovskiy. Csurka was sharply criticized even before he sharpened his tone and changed his words. I am trying to decide whether it was that wave--maybe unjustly--that caused the criticism, that radicalized him. What unites them--and Csurka would deny this--is that they both draw attention to solving problems in a fashion that does not exist, they give prescriptions for healing the economy in an abstract manner, stepping away from reality that is the way demagoguery is fed. Both appeal to nationalistic feelings and set unrealistic goals. Zhirinovskiy's tone is repulsive, speaking of war and force. Csurka has never gone so far. Csurka is a softer, more restrained version of Zhirinovskiy. [Pawlowski] Sir, are you not worried that, with the growth of the popularity of Csurka and similar figures, the Hungarians may cause problems for Europe? With their feeling of having been hurt historically, the complex of [the Treaty of] Trianon, which cut the size of Hungary by one-third; the dream of a Greater Hungary,a country of 15 million inhabitants. Csurka speaks loudly about things people want to hear. Is this true? [Jeszenszky] To a large extent, the press created the Csurka phenomenon. Csurka's popularity is hardly growing--quite the contrary. I estimate his supporters to be below 5 percent. He also has never spoken about a greater Hungary. It is another matter entirely to speak of history's unfair treatment of Hungary, period. The Poles were not treated any better. Csurka, when he speaks about Hungarian minorities abroad, uses such language because he thinks it will be more effective. But that is all. Then comes the realistic way of thinking on which this government stands as does the greater majority of Hungarian society, a tolerant and patient one. [passage omitted] [Pawlowski] Who is a Hungarian? Is it a question of blood, language, or geography? [Jeszenszky] He who speaks Hungarian and considers himself one--just as in Poland during the time of the partitions, when there was no country but the people kept their roots. In some ways, Hungarians today are a divided people. This division cannot be overcome by changing the borders, but by building a European community, a united Europe in which Hungarians will not feel divided and separated. [passage omitted]
