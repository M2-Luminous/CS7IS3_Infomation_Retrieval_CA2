[passage omitted] Liaoning has always been a province placing relatively more Army officers transferred to civilian work. Last year, the province satisfactorily fulfilled the task of placing 5,400 transferred Army officers and 590 spouses of such officers, and 95 percent of such officers were trained to improve their adaptability and professional skills. By combining the placement of transferred Army officers with the endeavor of facilitating the "second pioneering program," the province witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of the transferred Army officers who were working for state-owned enterprises, foreign-invested enterprises, and township-, town-, district-, and neighborhood-run enterprises; who initiated economic entities; and who sought employment by themselves. Of them, 177 officers were self-employed, surpassing the total sum over the past 15 years since the commencement of reform and opening up. This year, the province has been assigned with the task of placing 3,700 Army officers transferred to civilian work. Of them, the officers below the age of 40 account for 77 percent, officers having received the education of specialized secondary school, college, and institutions of even higher levels account for 59 percent, and the officers mastering various kinds of skills account for 25 percent. On behalf of the provincial group for placement of Army officers transferred to civilian work, Xiao Zuofu summarized last year's situation in placing transferred Army officers and set demands for this year's work. He pointed out: Party committees and governments at all levels should, with a high degree of the sense of political responsibility, conscientiously accomplish the task of placing Army officers transferred to civilian work, should make great efforts to maintain the stability and continuity of the related policies, and should actively explore the new ways of appropriately placing such officers under the condition of the socialist market economy. With emphasis on the first line of economic construction, such officers should be primarily transferred to judicial and public security departments, industrial and commercial departments, tax departments, and financial departments. In particular, such officers should be guided to work for enterprises and the places they are needed. This year, the above-mentioned departments should fill their vacant positions with such officers on a priority basis, and the proportion of such officers should not be less than 15 percent of their personnel increase quota. Other departments should also fill their vacant positions with the Army officers transferred to civilian work on a priority basis. [passage omitted]
