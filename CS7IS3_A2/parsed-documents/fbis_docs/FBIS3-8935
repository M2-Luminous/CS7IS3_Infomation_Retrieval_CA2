Several thousand people attended the ceremony, held in Szabadsag Square, in front of the Hungarian Television building. The co-chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, Istvan Csurka, said the Hungarian nation is in extreme peril, threatened by internal deterioration, with the front line drawn between the Hungarian national character and a foreign national character. Csurka said the former system is ideologically still in place, and there is major financial backing for attacks on the national character. "We want a free Hungarian press, in which left-wing lies presented as truth are eliminated, and from which the falsification of history and anti-Hungarian attitudes are banished," Csurka said.
