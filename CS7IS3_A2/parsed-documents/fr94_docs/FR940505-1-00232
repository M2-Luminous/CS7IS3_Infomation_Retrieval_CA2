If the actual values are below the standard, no emission surcharge is due. If either of the actual values exceed the standard for that year, a surcharge would be due based on the difference. It would be determined by multiplying the difference by the number of vehicles affected (in the specific vehicle category) and then by the surcharge rate of $10,000 per ton. It is important to note that so long as a fleet continues to replace vehicles at historical rates, no surcharge would be required. In order to assure the maximum flexibility, EPA is also proposing to allow individual fleets to join together into larger fleets for determining compliance with the fleet standard. This provision should accommodate those fleets which may turn over slower or more quickly than the average, notwithstanding any effects of the enhanced vehicle program. Additionally, it could benefit very small fleets, such as independently owned trucks. The flexibility to join together should ease the impact of the steady reduction in the fleet average emissions allowed on any fleets with special compliance problems. The annual emission rates developed in the above two tables are based on diesel engine values, even though the program applies to all heavy-duty vehicles above 19,500 pounds GVWR. This is consistent with the fact that diesels make up the dominant fraction of the affected fleets. It also could serve to encourage turnover of gasoline fueled engines faster than they otherwise would. This is because, even though they are generally less expensive than diesel engines, they would provide the same credit in the fleet average as turning over a diesel engine. Given the high evaporative emissions from gasoline engines, this is a desirable result. Comments are invited on this approach. It should also be noted that the declining fleet average standards described above are proposed to apply only to heavy-duty vehicles above 19,500 pounds. Lighter HDVs are not included because EPA is proposing to include these vehicles in its enhanced I/M program. Because this group has a large number of gasoline fueled vehicles (which would particularly benefit from an I/M program) and a large number of small fleets (which would find the declining fleet average program particularly burdensome), the Agency believes this to be the best approach for these vehicles. Exclusion of LHDVs from the averaging program would not affect the role of 1999 and later LHDV engines in the other enhanced heavy-duty vehicle requirements already described. Comments are invited on the alternative of including LHDVs in the declining fleet average program. As discussed earlier, EPA is considering allowing enhanced HDVs to be equipped with engines certified to a 2.5 g/bhp-hr standard rather than a 1.5 g/bhp-hr standard as long as an appropriate new vehicle surcharge is paid by the purchaser. Because the surcharge is based on the excess NO X emitted over the entire life of the vehicle, EPA believes that it would be appropriate to count these vehicles in the fleet average as emitting at 1.5 g/bhp-hr rather than 2.5 g/bhp-hr. Otherwise, the fleet owner would be required to pay twice for the same incremental emissions.
