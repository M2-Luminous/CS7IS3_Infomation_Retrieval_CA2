It has not been successful because the authors of the programme were pursuing political, not economic goals," declared Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov at a press-conference in the Moscow government building on Thursday. According to the mayor, the founding of voucher privatisation on the "dictates of the Federal State Property Managing Committee" was not fair to the regions of the Russian Federation. Luzhkov noted that the government never received the expected inflow of funds from the privatisation programme. Over the last two and a half years, according to Luzhkov, the capital's budget gained only a "ridiculously small sum" from privatisation, 52 billion roubles. The most convincing evidence that the privatisation programme is a failure is that even today there is no class of property-owners in the country as a whole and in Moscow in particular. The capital's mayor said that the current market value of one voucher, 30 thousand roubles, is way under the minimum value of half a million roubles a voucher should have if inflation is taken into account. He called that proof of the public's mistrust of the privatisation programme. Five hundred thousand roubles is the real value of one one-hundred-and-sixty-millionth part of the country's wealth, said Luzhkov. "I will be happy to go to the procurator," the mayor said in comment on Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's letter of May 26 which demanded that Luzhkov cancel within three days his ban on the registration of joint stock societies in Moscow. According to Luzhkov, the complaints which State Property Committee Chairman Anatoliy Chubays has lodged against the Moscow government in connection with the failure of privatisation in the capital are based on the desire "to avoid responsibility for privatisation's catastrophic results for the Russian economy and to find a scapegoat."
