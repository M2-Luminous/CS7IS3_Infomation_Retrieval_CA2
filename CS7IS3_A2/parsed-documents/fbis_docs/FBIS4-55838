[passage omitted] The government approved a National Council of the Slovak Republic bill on the issue of state bonds. Its passage will make it possible to gain on the capital market the necessary financial resources to cover the state budget deficit on the Slovak Republic's state closing account for last year. The state bonds should be issued by the Ministry of Finance in a total amount of 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]. Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that, in view of the low level of liquidity of Slovak commercial banks, the bonds would not be issued all at once. A wide range of entities, from individuals to bank consortiums, will have access to them. [passage omitted] The Ministry of Finance submitted to the government meeting a report on the use of budget resources in the second half of 1992 and in 1993. According to the report, individual government departments last year drew Sk248 million and in 1993 Sk543 million without justification. The ministries, particularly the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and the Family, used the resources to purchase computers and passenger cars without preceding public tender. The relevant government members were asked to draw conclusions from the results of the inquiry within a month and to report about them to the government. Draft amendments to the law on the value-added tax, the law on the administration of taxes and fees, and the law on changes to the system of territorial financial authorities as amended by subsequent regulations were added to the agenda of the government meeting. The submitted draft amendment to the law on the value-added tax changes the list of goods and services subject to the pertinent rate of value-added tax. According to Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus, under the amendment, the taxation of about 10 percent of goods that are currently subject to a value-added tax of 6 percent will be raised to 25 percent. The higher tax will not apply to any basic, vitally important goods.
