Kucan is one of the seven Central European presidents who will meet for informal talks in Litomysl, East Bohemia, on Friday and Saturday at the invitation of Czech President Vaclav Havel. It is necessary to seek a solution to the problem of Serbian minority rights in Croatia as well as Albanian and Hungarian minority rights in Serbia, Kucan said. For nationally homogeneous Slovenia, however, Kucan said he sees no possibility for any kind of political union with the lands of the former Yugoslavia any time in the future. But after the war Slovenia would be willing to cooperate with countries on ex-Yugoslav territory in a variety of fields on the same basis as other European countries. Kucan said that Slovenia had never belonged to the Balkans either historically, culturally or even geographically, and pointed out that Slovenia and the Czech Republic have always been close and always belonged to Europe, despite its unnatural division between 1945 and 1989. However, the lack of understanding of the Balkans and its traditional instability is one of the main reasons Europe squandered so many chances to prevent, and later end, the war. With regard to European integration, Slovenia has the same kinds of capabilities and obstacles as other countries of the former communist bloc, and likewise requires both time and support to adapt itself to European institutions, Kucan said. He also expressed his belief that the Czech Republic and Slovenia, with their historical traditions and hidden economic, scientific and cultural potential, could help make the common European house a "functional and successful arena" where all would be equal.
