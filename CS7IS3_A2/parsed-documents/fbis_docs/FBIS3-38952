[Solana] Hello. Good evening. How are you? [Pellicer] We have just heard a moment ago that the use of the word ultimatum is one of the reasons that the meeting of NATO ambassadors went on all day. Does Spain agree to using this term to threaten the Serb militia? [Solana] The fact that the meeting was prolonged is not directly related to that term. It has to do with some of the technical aspects that took longer than expected. However, I can tell you that there is a basic consensus about the general idea of how to answer the letter sent by the UN secretary general to NATO requesting help in solving the Sarajevo problem. This basic consensus will become apparent in the next few hours. [Pellicer] But will Spain agree to use the term ultimatum if need be? [Solana] Spain agrees to the resolution that is being debated right now. It will incorporate a delay of approximately seven to 10 days so that the heavy weapons that are now threatening Sarajevo can be withdrawn to an approximate 20 or 30 kilometer perimeter from the city. These are the topics that are now being debated. These are technical topics as I said, topics in which the military command has to give its opinion since it has to decide whether 20 or whether 30 kilometers are enough to solve the problem we want solved. The problem we want solved is the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo. Sarajevo is today a divided city, but a city divided physically as well as morally, spiritually. We have to be able to overcome this physical and moral division that now exists in Sarajevo. We will do whatever is in our means to help. At the same time we have to give the necessary protection to our Armed Forces deployed in the field. I can also tell you -- and through you tell the Spanish citizens now listening to us -- that the government and the armed forces -- their command -- as well as the UN military command, are doing all they can to protect our blue helmets in the field. [Pellicer] Is there an agreed protection plan in case the Serbs attack? [Solana] Logically, all the measures have been taken. The necessary alerts have been made too. The defense minister [Julian Garcia Vargas] said it clearly yesterday and I do not have to repeat what he said. [Pellicer] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, thank you for answering our questions. [Solana] Thank you.
