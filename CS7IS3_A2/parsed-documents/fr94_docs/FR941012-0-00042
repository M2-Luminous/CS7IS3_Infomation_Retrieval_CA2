FR941012-0-00042 FR941012-0-00011 b. Work activity at time of accident. Table 5 shows that almost one-half of all injured employees were engaged in cutting activities (felling, limbing, bucking) at the time of their accidents, and almost one-fourth of all injured employees were felling trees. Twenty-eight percent of the employees were injured during yarding operations (choker setting or hooking up, tractor or cable skidding, chasing). The remainder of the accidents occurred when the logs were being prepared to move from the landing (loading/unloading and rigging) or were being transported to the mill or other final destination. Other unspecified logging activities accounted for eight percent of the accidents. Finally, servicing and maintaining of equipment accounted for four percent of the accidents, a figure that is consistent with the information found for servicing or maintenance accidents throughout general industry. (See Docket S&hyph;012A.) Table 3 outlines the activity being performed at the time of the accidents and the percentage each activity represents.
