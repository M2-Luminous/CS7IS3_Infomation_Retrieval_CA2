Apparently, although he put the credibility of his leadership at stake, Ramos attaches greater importance to Philippine national interests -- maintaining good relations with Indonesia. What lessons can be learned from the crisis? First, according to REPUBLIKA, East Timor has clearly become a very sensitive point in the context of relations between Indonesia and other nations. This means that we have to reassess how effective our overseas campaigns on East Timor have been and what strategy the Department of Foreign Affairs should adopt to deal with such cases. Second, Indonesia has been very reactive to such cases. The Indonesian Government should have dealt more coolly and [word indistinct] with the Philippine Government with regard to the conference because the reactive stand only benefits groups opposed to the integration of East Timor into the Republic of Indonesia. REPUBLIKA concludes that anti-integration groups may have intentionally provoked Indonesian anger.
