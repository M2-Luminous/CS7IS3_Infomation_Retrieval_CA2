FR940725-0-00155 FR940725-0-00019 Paragraph (e)(1)(iii) requires that shipyard rescue teams practice their skills at least once every 12 months. This provision also requires practice drills that include the use of mannequins and rescue equipment during simulated rescue operations involving physical facilities that approximate closely those facilities from which rescue may be needed. OSHA has included a note following this paragraph to explain that the standard recognizes the performance of an actual rescue as an acceptable substitute for practice drills. Paragraph (e)(1)(iv) requires that at least one employee on each rescue team maintain current certification in basic first aid skills that include maintenance of an airway, control of bleeding, maintenance of circulation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills. Paragraph (e)(2) requires the employer to inform outside rescue services of the hazards that their teams may encounter when called to perform rescues from confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres at the employer's facility. The outside rescue service can then use this information to train and equip their rescue teams appropriately. This will help to ensure the protection of the rescue service's employees and to minimize the time needed to rescue an injured employee. OSHA has included a note following final §1915.12(e)(2) to encourage employers to use the criteria listed in paragraph (e)(1) to evaluate the skills of the outside rescue service and to determine what in-house hazard information would be most helpful to that service. In the notice reopening the record on Subpart B, OSHA requested comments on whether or not the standard should require the use of any protocols (such as preplanning with local rescue services) to accompany the use of an outside rescue service. The rulemaking participants agreed that, while preplanning with outside rescue services was necessary, the standard should not specify any particular protocol (Ex. 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;22, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;25, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;47). For example, the Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 11&hyph;29) stated: We believe that the inclusion of this subject matter will not contribute significantly to an increase in the quality or response time of a rescue team. Furthermore, such protocols, may be inconsistent with ensuring that shipyards have the flexibility to independently work out joint efforts that are compatible with local conditions. Several commenters, however, believed that the standard should require cooperation and planning between the shipyard employer and the rescue service (Ex. 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50). These commenters argued that this cooperation and planning was necessary, if an employer chooses an outside rescue service, in order to ensure effective rescue. The U.S. Department of the Navy (Ex. 11&hyph;30) presented this view as follows: In those cases where the employer does not have an in-house rescue team, OSHA should require the employer to preplan with the outside authority who is expected to provide the rescue services. The outside authority must be familiar with the employer's facility so that delays in performing a rescue will be avoided or minimized. It is recommended that OSHA require periodic drills to document that a rescue by an outside authority can be performed in a meaningful time frame. OSHA agrees with these commenters that planning and cooperation is necessary between employers and outside rescue services. Without planning, the rescue service will be hindered in getting to the rescue site and in equipping their rescue teams. Without cooperation, the outside service's rescue team will be on their own when an emergency arises. Several commenters stated their belief that the language in SESAC's recommendation already required employers to plan for rescue by outside services and to cooperate with these services to ensure that the rescue teams are properly trained and equipped (Ex. 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;39). OSHA agrees with these commenters, and final §1915.12(e)(2) adopts the SESAC recommended language with only minor editorial changes. Paragraph (f) of final §1915.12 contains requirements for exchanging hazard information between employers. This paragraph requires that each employer whose employees work in confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres ensure that all available information on the hazards, safety rules, and emergency procedures concerning those spaces is exchanged with other employers whose employees may occupy the same spaces. The purpose of this new rule is to assure that knowledge of the hazards in the place of employment, particularly those hazards that may change daily or with each new contractor or subcontractor, has been communicated to all employees. The rulemaking participants overwhelmingly approved the adoption of the requirements related to exchanging hazard information between employers as listed in the notice reopening the record (Ex. 11&hyph;1, 11&hyph;2, 11&hyph;3, 11&hyph;4, 11&hyph;5, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;13, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;20, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;35, 11&hyph;37, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;47, 11&hyph;49, 11&hyph;50, 11&hyph;52, 11&hyph;53). These rulemaking participants advocated that the SESAC recommendations be incorporated in their entirety. They maintained that cooperation and the exchange of information between contractor and employer was essential for the protection of all workers involved. Dreadnought Marine, Inc. (Ex. 11&hyph;52), expressed this view as follows: It is essential that contractors who perform work in confined spaces be provided this information by the employer. Contractor personnel who work near [confined] spaces need to understand and adhere to the signs, placards, or other warnings posted by the employer. DMI agrees with SESAC's proposed additions entitled ``(g) Duty to other employers.'' A few commenters believed that OSHA should also require contractors to inform the shipyard employer of any hazard the contractor introduces into the space (Ex. 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;51). They argued that, because the contractor can bring hazards into confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres that endanger all employees in the space, the standard should impose duties on the contractor which correspond to those imposed on the employer. The IBEW (Ex. 11&hyph;51) expressed their recommendations as follows: We concur with the statements made in paragraph (C) noting the last statement, ``Contractors working on a job site can endanger not only their employees, but other employers' employees as well.'' With this in mind, we feel that a contractor is also obligated to inform the host employer of the hazards they will introduce into the work area or confined space. OSHA agrees with the IBEW. Contractors create hazards or bring hazards into the space which affect the safety of all employees working in the space. Therefore, the final rule incorporates the SESAC recommendation modified as necessary to obligate all employers to exchange necessary hazard information. 3. §1915.13␣Cleaning and Other Cold Work This section sets forth locations and further testing and precautions that must be observed before and during cleaning and cold work.
