The mountains of Irpinia, his traditional fiefdom, have produced a flood of support votes with a view to next Sunday's [13 February] runoff organized by the PPI's regional steering committee. This clear message from Avellino gave rise to some controversy following the halt called from Rome: "Hands off our candidate; Ciriaco remains our leader." Midday 10 February was the deadline for putting forward the candidates who will be subject to the vote by party members and supporters in two days' time. There were no less than 8,142 signatures in support of the former prime minister, put forward as a candidate for the lower house in the constituency that comprises all the municipalities of Upper Irpinia, including Nusco. De Mita virtually doubled the number gained by another outgoing parliamentarian, Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, who gathered 4,322 signatures for the senatorial constituency of central Avellino. All the rest were out of the running. There were 2,341 votes for Giuseppe Gargani, chairman of the Justice Committee, competing for the Lower Irpinia lower house constituency; 1,820 for Ortensio Zecchino, the Popular Party's regional coordinator, put forward for the Upper Irpinia senatorial constituency; 1,006 for Gianfranco Rotondi, regional councillor, competing for the central Avellino lower house constituency. Rotondi is competing against Francesco Pionati, the television Channel 1 news reporter who also hopes to stand as a candidate but who has sharply opposed the runoffs, refusing to take part and describing them as "like some kind of San Remo [popular song] festival, where all the winners are known in advance." Gerardo Bianco did not compete in the first round either, having decided to stand down for good. [passage omitted]
