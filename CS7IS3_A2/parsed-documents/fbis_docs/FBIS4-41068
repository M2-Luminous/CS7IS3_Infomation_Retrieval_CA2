Members of the delegation arrived from Baku to Yerevan on June 16, and met First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhirair Liparityan. The delegation left to Stepanakert on the same date, and returned back to Yerevan on June 17 and met the President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. On June 18, members of the delegation met Liparityan again, and then left for Baku. On June 19, Eliasson returned from Baku to Yerevan, and negotiated with the Armenian authorities. He left the Armenian capital on the same day. No other details are reported by official Armenian press services. According to preliminary estimates, visit of the CSCE Minsk group Chairman Jan Eliasson to the region has finished without notable results. Jan Eliasson said that the sides are still keeping rather harsh stances. In addition to this, the incident at the north- western section of the RA border on June 18 may seriously affect further negotiations. Chairman of the Minsk group wasn't able to find any solutions to oppose the Russian project. He met unexpected obstacles in Azerbaijan to implementation of their plan of the Karabakh conflict's resolution. According to "Lragir", Baku suggested to involve the problem of liberating Shusha and Lachin from Armenian forces in the CSCE project. This topic is absent in the current version of the CSCE plan, being unacceptable to the Armenian side.
