The tariff advantage for industrial products was preserved, but the advantage for basic agricultural products and many food products was lost. Three years ago Fazer's exports to Poland skyrocketed with the aid of a relic of the past that guarantees free trade, the Kevsos agreement [free trade agreement with former USSR's East European satellites]. "In just the next few months we'll realize how very important the agreement was to us," Kari Korpela of Fazer said. Korpela manages the Polish candy factory, Baltyk, a majority of whose shares Fazer purchased a year and a half ago. Fazer owns 51 percent of the joint venture, which is located in the city of Gdansk, and the employees own the rest of it. The factory provides employment for 700 people and its sales volume was about 252 million markkaa in 1993. Big Investments Fazer is planning "big investments" in Baltyk in the near future. The Finnish company acquired possession of the Polish factory for many strategic reasons. "Poland's markets were opened up in 1991. Since it was clear to us that the Finns' tariff advantage would diminish within a few years, the purchase of the factory came at an opportune moment. While the chocolate and candy markets are growing in Poland at a rate of 5 to 10 percent, in Scandinavia, for example, they are relatively stable. It's also a good thing for us to export to the East, the West, and the south," Korpela enumerated. So far, in addition to its own traditional candies, Baltyk produes only one Fazer product, the latter's "red" chocolate bar. According to Korpela, in the near future the selection of Fazer products will increase since the profitability of importing them will diminish. Price Remained Unchanged Despite the loss of its competitive edge, Fazer has not begun to change the price of imported chocolate on the shelves of its Polish outlets. "At present we're developing our positions in the market." In Korpela's opinion, one has to be present in Poland if one wants a piece of the pie. Baltyk ranks fourth in domestic sales figures. After the war the market director nationalized the family-owned company, Wedel, which Pepsi-Cola bought up a few years ago accompanied by a big hullaballoo. In addition, the multinationals, Nestle and Suchard, are in stiff competition with Fazer to satsify nearly 40 million Poles' hunger for sweets. Shares of Market Increased In the 1970's Finland signed unique free trade agreements with Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, in addition to Poland. A general agreement removed tariffs on industrial products, and Finland concluded separate agreements with each of these countries to eliminate obstacles to agricultural products. From Finland's standpoint, up until the end of the last decade the agreement was not of any great importance. Once the foreign trade of the former socialist countries was liberated, Finnish exports to them began to rapidly increase, to Poland and Hungary in particular. Kevsos suddenly began to work to Finland's advantage, whereas before trade had even declined and showed a deficit. In five years Finnish exports to Poland have multiplied nearly 10 times, measured in markkaa. While Finland's exports to Poland amounted to 290 million markkaa in 1988, last year exports came to over 2 billion markkaa. Finland exported 276 million markkaa worth of products to Hungary in 1988. Last year they amounted to 770 million markkaa. "Since the former socialist countries imposed tariffs and launched economic reforms, Kevsos has become a valuable asset for us. Finnish industrial exporters have notably succeeded in increasing their shares of the market. The tariff advantage has been of considerable benefit to, for example, Neste [state oil company] as well as the paper and food industries," Kari Mitrunen, the head of the foreign ministry Trade Policy Department, said. Advantages Being Reduced By the middle of last November, however, the tariff advantages had been reduced, especially concerning trade with Poland. Free trade in basic agricultural products and several food products was eliminated entirely following heated negotiations when the new EFTA [European Free Trade Association] agreement went into effect. The EFTA countries, Finland included, negotiated broad agreements with the East European countries that are aimed at gradually freeing trade by 2001. At Finland's insistence, Kevsos will continue to exist alongside these agreements, despite the fact that the other EFTA countries would have preferred to lay it to rest. If Finland becomes a member of the European Union, Kevsos will lose its importance. Tariff Advantages Were Reduced Poland too would have been willing to cancel Kevsos, which had become disadvantageous for the country. To salvage the socialist relic, Finland agreed to reduce its tariff advantages for oil products and the paper industry. A tariff quota of 475,000 tons was agreed on for Finnish gasoline. According to the quota, gasoline was to receive a tariff advantage of 27 percent as compared with the other EFTA countries. The head of Neste's Warsaw office, Ari Rajala, does not think that the advantage is in practice very significant anymore. Nevertheless, Kevsos has raised the hackles on seven other foreign oil companies operating in Poland. "Competitors have even complained about the agreement directly to President Lech Walesa," Rajala said. Foreign trade chief Lea Lastikka of the Food Industry Association said that the elimination of basic agricultural products and many food products--like butter, chocolate, cheeses, pork, and beef--from the Kevsos list for Poland is a great loss. Surplus Butter Becomes Luxury Item Poland has risen to become the fourth largest recipient of Finland's food exports. Valio, for example, has acquired favorable markets in Poland for its surplus butter and other products. A couple of months ago a chunk of Finnish butter hardly cost more than a chunk of Polish butter, but now it has become a luxury item. "It'll be a pity if Valio abandons its markets since its products became well-known during the boom," said Wiktor Szwechowicz, Valio's only remaining representative in Poland. According to Szwechowicz, Valio is thinking about granting a license to a Polish dairy.
