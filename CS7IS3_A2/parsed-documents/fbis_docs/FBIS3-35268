Any attempts to separate southern Sudan from its northern part, whether by the north or the south of Sudan or by foreign quarters, will be faced by a clear Egyptian opposition, he said. Musa was commenting today on reports of attempts to separate the south of Sudan. On the escalation in Yemen, especially after signing the agreement between the Yemeni president and his deputy, the foreign minister said: This is unfortunate, especially as it comes after the signing of an agreement between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. This indicates that the situation is serious. After only a few hours, the signed document had failed to achieve its purpose. Egypt hopes the contents of the Pledge and Accord document will be respected and implemented. Musa asked: If a document is not respected, then what is the point in arranging celebrations and protocols for signing agreements that are not implemented? On the situation in Bosnia, Musa said all reports reaching the Foreign Ministry, as well as the NATO statement, show that the overwhelming majority of heavy weapons have been withdrawn and that some other weaponry has been placed under UN supervision. There is no longer a threat there. He said NATO had reaffirmed that the ultimatum and all other decisions stand, in case any of these guns or missile batteries return to their positions or if Sarajevo is fired on, even if it is not hit. NATO also stressed its commitment to protect the seclusion zone, the besieged area, and the UN forces, Musa noted.
