Although the official explanation of the cancellation of the meeting was "agenda problems," different Central American sources said several presidents did not want to meet Castro because of the scant affinity they feel toward him because of his support for the now nearly extinct guerrilla movements on the isthmus. Salvadoran sources told EFE that, in particular, for President Armando Calderon Sol of the right-wing ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance], such a meeting would have been difficult. Even though peace has come to El Salvador, it would have been objectionable for Calderon Sol to meet with one of the politicians who fostered the military conflict in El Salvador. Calderon Sol, who took office on 1 June, today said Cuba still has a long way to go in terms of encouraging freedom and democracy. He added that as long as Cuba does not create more opportunities for freedom, there will be no progress in cooperation with the island. "All of us who love democracy and expect respect for human dignity must raise this topic (at the summits)," the Salvadoran president added. [passage omitted] Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres today commented on the failed meeting with the Cuban leader by saying it was not held "because the topics we would have addressed with President Castro were broadly reviewed at the (summit's) private session on Wednesday afternoon." Officially, Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal [title as received] and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo told EFE that agenda problems and the presidents' departure for their home nations today made the meeting with Castro impossible. This meeting had sparked interest because the six Central American presidents, who met Monday in Costa Rica to prepare a joint position on the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, had issued in San Jose a communique asking for Cuba's democratization.
