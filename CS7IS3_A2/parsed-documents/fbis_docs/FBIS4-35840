He said if India proceeds with the deployment, a qualitatively new threat will be posed to Pakistan's security. It will lead inevitably to a missile race in South Asia and accentuate the danger of nuclear arms proliferation in this region. The spokesman said Pakistan has repeatedly warned the international community that India's deployment of missiles threatens nuclear arms race and destabilizes the South Asian region. It would also threaten all the countries of the Gulf, Central Asia, China and parts of Southeast Asia, evoking defensive responses and eroding stability. The spokesman called upon the international community, especially the members of the Missile Technology Control Regime, to prevent India from crossing a critical and possibly irrevocable threshold through the deployment of the Prithvi missile.
