ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations relating to reimbursements and other expense allowance arrangements under section 62(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code), working condition fringe benefits under section 132(d) of the Code, and expenses for club dues, spousal travel, and business meals and entertainment that are disallowed as a deduction to the employer under section 274(a)(3), (m)(3), and (n)(1) of the Code. The proposed regulations reflect changes to the law made by sections 13209, 13210, and 13272 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 469 (1993) (OBRA). The persons affected by the proposed regulations are persons who provide or receive the use of club membership dues, spousal travel expenses, or business meals and entertainment. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing must be received by March 24, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IA&hyph;17&hyph;94), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. In the alternative, submissions may be hand delivered to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IA&hyph;17&hyph;94), room 5228, Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Concerning regulations under sections 62 and 132, David N. Pardys, (202) 622&hyph;6040; concerning regulations under section 274, John T. Sapienza, Jr., (202) 622&hyph;4920; and concerning submissions, Christina Vasquez, (202) 622&hyph;7190, (not toll-free numbers). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations under sections 62(c), 132(d), and 274 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to reflect changes made to section 274 of the Code by sections 13209, 13210, and 13272 of OBRA (107 Stat. 469, 542). These provisions amended section 274 of the Code by limiting the deductible portion of meal and entertainment expenses to 50 percent, by eliminating the deduction for club dues, and by restricting the deduction for spousal travel. The amendments to the regulations under sections 62 and 132 of the Code concern the income tax consequences to employees when their employer's (or third party payor's) deduction is disallowed by the amendments to section 274 of the Code. Proposed rules relating to the definition of club for purposes of the dues deduction disallowance under section 274(a)(3) of the Code were published in the Federal Register on August 12, 1994 on page 41414.
