The government will offer him the possibility of reactivating Cordoba's Military Aircraft Factory (FMA) through a substantial investment. Apparently, the idea that Angeloz will finally agree to sign the pact became of paramount importance at the moment of defining which enterprise will be chosen within the framework of the bid opened by the Defense Ministry to modernize the 36 Skyhawk A4M planes. Although the Smith Industries company had signed a letter of intent (and already charged $3 million to replace hoses and repaint the 36 planes that had been idle in the Arizona desert), the U.S. Lockheed company was chosen. The government chose this company in view of the financing it offered for the payment of the loan, which include two years grace and the possibility of having Argentine and U.S. experts repair 18 of the 36 planes at the factory in Cordoba. As a result of this important investment at the Cordoba plant, Argentina will have more possibilities of winning the bid opened by the Vought company in the United States for the manufacture of the Pampa 2000 planes. This is not improbable because the Vought lobby [preceding word in English] in Washington represents the interests of the U.S. Pratt and Whitney companies, as well as the well-known Allis Signal company. AMBITO FINANCIERO published on 14 February that the Bell company is also interested in manufacturing helicopters in the facilities of Cordoba's FMA. Thus, a civilian-military aeronautic center of strategic importance for Latin America would be created in Cordoba. The Air Force will not object to the participation of the Lockheed Aircraft company in the project because it will attract large benefits for the FMA. Initially, however, the Air Force favored the Smith Industries company in view of its work in New Zealand and Kuwait. Furthermore, this will give the Argentine Government an excellent tool to convince Angeloz of the "advantages" that signing the fiscal pact would represent for Cordoba.
