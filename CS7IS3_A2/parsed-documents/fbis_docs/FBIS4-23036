To this end, the Brevibacteria sp. lysine-producer is cultivated in 750 ml bulbs containing 25-30 ml of nutrient medium in a circular rocker spinning at a 220-240 RPM speed for 66-72 h at a 30ï¿½ temperature. The nutrient medium preparation, experimental procedure, and carbohydrate concentration measurement methods are outlined. The total amount of amino acids formed as a result of proteolysis is used as the basic indicator of the proteolytic preparation suitability for plant raw material conversion. Fungal protease from Aspergillus oryzae 251-90 (G10kh) and bacterial protease from Bacillus subtilis G10kh which have the necessary proteolytic activity level for animal proteins within a 4.7-5.3 pH range are used for comparative characterization. The A. oryzae 251-90 proteolytic enzymes containing a highly active protease complex are the most active. The behavior of amine nitrogen concentration in nutrient media under the effect of proteolytic enzymes and the utilization efficiency of the resulting hydrolysates in lysine biosynthesis by the Brevibacteria sp. culture, the effect of A. oryzae 251-90 proteases on the amino acid composition of the plant nutrient medium, the protein amino acid content in the Brevibacteria sp. culturing liquid in various media, the free amino acid concentration in the culturing liquid during the growth of Brevibacteria sp., and the growth amino acid concentration in the nutrient media are summarized. The growth, carbohydrate consumption, and lysine accumulation dynamics are plotted. The A. oryzae 251-90 fungal proteolytic enzymes also indirectly but significantly affect the lysine-producing bacteria's biosynthetic activity. Nutrient medium enrichment with well-metabolized amine nitrogen increases the bioconversion efficacy of cereal and root tuber raw materials and intensifies lysine and protein biosynthesis and bacteria accumulation.
