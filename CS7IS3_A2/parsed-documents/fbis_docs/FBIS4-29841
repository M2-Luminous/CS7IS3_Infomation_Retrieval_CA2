"The summit proposal Kim made through (Former U.S. President Jimmy) Carter is apparently sincere, not just a gesture," Kim said during dinner with ruling Democratic Liberal Party lawmakers at the presidential mansion. "We expected this to happen and we have been preparing a long time for it," he said. "We can meet anywhere, anytime to discuss anything." Carter met with Kim Il-song in Pyongyang last week and relayed the message to Kim Yong-sam that the North Korean leader wants an inter-Korean summit. "Kim Il-song obviously became impatient," the South Korean president said, noting Seoul's growing ties with the world's four most powerful nations. Seoul proposed a working-level contact on June 28 to prepare for the summit. Pyongyang has yet to respond. "Now that we have accepted Kim Il-song's proposal, the only thing left is the time and place," said Kim. "We will decide our government position as soon as North Korea responds."
