The estimated annual burden per respondent is estimated to be 0.1 hour. Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be directed to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503. Background This document contains final regulations to be added to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The final regulations provide rules for the allocation of net operating loss or taxable income and net capital loss or gain within the taxable year in which a loss corporation has an ownership change. Proposed regulations on this subject were set forth in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on November 19, 1992 (57 FR 54535). The IRS received public comments on the proposed regulations. No public hearing was requested and none was held. Having considered the comments submitted, the IRS and the Treasury Department adopt the proposed regulations as revised by this Treasury decision. Explanation of Provisions Following an ownership change, section 382 limits the amount of post-change income that may be offset by a corporation's pre-change loss. Sections 382(b)(3)(A) and (d)(1) require that, except as provided in section 382(h)(5) (relating to certain built-in gains and losses) and in regulations, taxable income or net operating loss must be allocated ratably to each day in the change year for purposes of applying the section 382 limitation. Under section 383, similar rules apply with respect to pre-change capital losses and certain pre-change credits. The proposed regulations provide rules for allocation of net operating loss or taxable income, and net capital loss or gain, within the change year. The proposed regulations generally provide that a loss corporation may allocate such items between the pre-change period and the post-change period (1) by ratably allocating an equal portion to each day in the change year, or (2) if it so elects, based on a closing of its books as of the change date. The final regulations adopt the proposed regulations with few changes. The most significant comments and changes are described below.
