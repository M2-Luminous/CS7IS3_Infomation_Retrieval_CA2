This was said in a statement published by the LDP faction in the State Duma on Friday. According to the statement, a "meeting between Zhirinovskiy and Russian Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik, where all issues which could be interpreted in different ways will be clarified, is expected to take place." However, the faction's representatives warned that if the criminal case "had not been initiated, since Zhirinovskiy had received as yet no information on this from the investigating bodies, those who were guilty of spreading the libel against the LDP leader would bear legal and civil responsibility for this." The Russian Prosecutor General's Office initiated a criminal case against Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the accusation mentioned in provision 71 of the Criminal Code -- propaganda of war -- on January 26. In accordance with the Criminal Code, Zhirinovskiy may face from three to eight years in prison.
