I shall not give up my intention to find a man who is a successful businessman, capable of organizing things well, who works 24 hours a day, and to whom the doors of both the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and the Srpska republic are wide open. "I already have an idea who that man could be, but I am not going to name him, not yet. But the problem is that he will hardly pass, given such a constellation of forces in the assembly. At the next meeting of the assembly I shall officially put him in for the mandator. The coalition in Krajina's assembly is pushing Milan Babic for the mandator, but he does not meet any of the criteria for that position, and I shall not accept that at any price." Milan Martic, president of the RSK, stated this to POLITIKA yesterday. Subversive Behavior of Coalition Yesterday President Martic visited first the community of Mirkovci and the oil industries of Krajina, and then in Borovo Selo he held a working meeting with the representatives of the communities of Slavonia, Baranja, and western Srem, as well as with the representatives of the Serbian army of Krajina and the police. As Martic informed us, the collective conclusion made by all the participants was that local interests must not be placed ahead of state interests, since Krajina is defended by defending each of its regions, so it is necessary to make the things work in such a way that, in the case of aggression in one of Krajina's regions, the military potentials in other parts are automatically activated. "We have to understand that none of the communities is capable of being a state for itself, and defending itself alone," Martic says. The president of Krajina spoke most about the recent events with regard to the election of the mandator of the Krajina government, and with regard to trends in the Krajina assembly. According to Martic, the artificially formed coalition in the Krajina assembly is doing a great harm to the state, while certain individuals are trying to get to power because of their own interests and revanchism toward Serbia, and given such goals, they want to make a weapon out of the people and use it against Serbia. "In the Krajina assembly that coalition is violating the constitutional principles, the assembly's boards want to exert the pressure on the government, strip it of its authorizations, and start governing the country by their own rules. Negative consequences of such a behavior can already be felt in the defense system as well, since the laws have been urgently changed following the decisions by those boards, without asking the government for opinion," Martic claims. "I am determined to prevent that. I am still making efforts to find solutions to make the coalition come to its senses, and to prevent placing the petty partisan and individual interests, particularly by some individuals from Babic's Serbian Democratic Party [SDS] of Krajina, ahead of the state interests. None of them ran in the elections with a platform promising the collapse of the state. The fact is that they were promising prosperity and the strengthening of the state, and for that reason the people voted for them. However, now they are behaving absolutely subversively. "If they continue that way, I will have to use my constitutional and legal authorizations to prevent that. According to those authorizations I am allowed to dissolve the assembly in compliance with the requirements of the state of war. That is the last measure I would want to apply, but if I were forced to do that, I would do it. Because the way they are behaving in the assembly surpasses the way in which the Croatian Democratic Community treated the SDS in former Croatia. The only goal of theirs is to attain power, and to turn my role into one matching the role of the queen of England. What they are doing in the assembly is definitely the subversion of the state," Martic claims. The Krajina Socialists Have Been Asked for Support "Everything that is happening in the Krajina assembly, and the subversive conduct by the coalition, is orchestrated by Babic," Martic alleges. The situation will depend on how strong the other parliamentary parties and independent candidates are to bring such subversive conduct to an end. Martic met with the representatives of the Serbian Party of the Socialists of Krajina, and asked them for help and support. According to Martic, the following important task is the strengthening of the legal system. Martic promised that all those who committed wrongdoings that have weakened the economic power of the state, as well as other sorts of wrongdoings, will have to be brought to trial regardless of who they are or what function they are performing. As he pointed out, police inspectors and financial police have already started investigations. Martic maintains that the republic of Serbian Krajina has actually never seceded from Yugoslavia. "It is our task to establish everlasting connections with the FRY, and to join it as a stable state. In order for us to achieve that, the control of the state and of collective assets must be intensified. "In a day or two I will issue a decree, an order on compulsory work in all the firms in Krajina. We shall introduce a slight form of centralization, in order to concentrate the control over all the assets in one place, and to improve the apportionment of those assets," Martic says. According to Martic, at today's meeting, and also at a meeting of the Supreme Defense Council, an agreement on the Serbian army of Krajina has been reached. "The burden of war must be equally carried by all of us, and for that reason we have to put an end to war profiteering. Therefore we need a higher degree of state control. Because of my ideas some people say that I want to establish a police-run state. That is not true. My ideas are only about having a greater degree of discipline, about having a slight degree of centralization of assets, and the introduction of discipline at all levels. Anarchy leads into disaster, and I am not going to allow that," Martic stresses.
