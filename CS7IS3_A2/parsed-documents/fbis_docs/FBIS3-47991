Kim clarified this view on Thursday, after a policy briefing from Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok. In the current international situation, where every country is competing fiercely, the Korean people cannot survive unless they realize unification as soon as possible, he told Yi. Kim instructed his minister to develop inter-Korean relations so that a South-North Korean commonwealth is established during his term in office, which ends in February 1998. Although he is eager to see inter-Korean relations improved, he has one condition: Settlement of the North Korean nuclear problem. "The government should solve the nuclear problem, which is blocking improvement of inter-Korean relations, this year without fail to revitalize inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation," he told Yi. Once the nuclear problem is solved, the government should push ahead with the promotion of mutual interests and improvement of relations, Kim said. "First of all, the government should make a breakthrough in solving the nuclear problem through an exchange of special envoys, and then it should push ahead with exchange and cooperation with North Korea," he said. Inter-Korean relations were cool last year because of the suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development program. Kim told Yi that he was sure that North Korea had no choice but to change its policies soon, and said that the government should use the change as an opportunity to improve inter-Korean relations. Since North Korea is in a very difficult situation at home and abroad, it cannot avoid changing its policies. When North Korea begins to show a willingness to solve the nuclear problem, the international situation surrounding the Korean peninsula will change rapidly, he said. The government should use the change for a stable improvement in inter-Korean relations and, ultimately, to realize peaceful unification. "For those goals, the National Unification Board should push ahead with diverse inter-Korean talks and North Korea policies," Kim said. He reassured Yi that he will not seek absorption like in Germany, but warned him that the people should guard against sentimental theories of unification.
