In a letter UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali received yesterday, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said this aircraft violated Iraq's airspace on 26 January and on 7, 15, 25 February, flying over vast Iraqi areas after which it left the Iraqi airspace for its base in Saudi Arabia. He explained that these four violations raised to 196 the number of violations by this aircraft. Al-Sahhaf added: While condemning and denouncing these unjustified violations of our airspace, we stress the constant Iraqi position that this aircraft is used for purposes other than those specified by the Security Council and that its activity harms Iraq's sovereignty and security. Al-Sahhaf continued: We emphasize Iraq's constant request for employing Iraqi means in the Special Commission's work instead of foreign means in order to exclude the possibility of using the latter for purposes that harm Iraq's sovereignty and security. Your correct assessment of this aircraft's nature and real task was published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on 16 November 1993, in which you said: I do not want a James Bond spy aircraft at the United Nations. This assessment requires that the United Nations should immediately reconsider the use of this aircraft in violating Iraq's airspace in a way that conflicts with the UN Charter's objectives and principles which call for respecting the equality and sovereignty of all UN member states.
