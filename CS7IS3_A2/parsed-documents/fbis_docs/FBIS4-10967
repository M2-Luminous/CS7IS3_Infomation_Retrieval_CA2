Cardoso's advisers denied he made such a request, but they admitted he had conferred with the team on the status of the economic stabilization plan and the various alternatives for the new currency's implementation. Dismissing the possibility that the meeting could convey the idea of a parallel government, the advisers said the economists called on Cardoso to convey to him their condolences over the death of his younger brother and ended up engaging in a long discussion on political and economic issues. The meeting, which was held at Cardoso's home from 1630 -- when he arrived in Brasilia -- to 1800, was attended by Central Bank [BC] President Pedro Malan, who gave a briefing on the debt agreement signed on 15 April; Gustavo Franco, director of the BC International Department; Winston Fritsch, secretary for economic policy; Persio Arida, president of the National Bank for Economic and Social Development; special adviser Edmar Bacha; Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho; and diplomat Sergio Amaral, chief of Finance Minister Ricupero's staff. After the meeting, Cardoso went to Planalto Palace to meet President Itamar Franco. He was scheduled to meet at night with Ricupero. According to his advisers, in his talks with Franco and Ricupero, Cardoso was to discuss a definition of a minimum agenda for the constitutional revision. One economist described their meeting with Cardoso as a meeting among friends at which they discussed the formation of a comprehensive front to back the presidential candidacy of the former finance minister. PSDB campaign coordinator Euclides Scalco confirmed Cardoso's interest in reducing the transition period toward creating the real. In remarks by telephone from Curitiba, he said: "With the implementation of the real, we will bring inflation down faster." Despite the arguments that it would be better to wait until August or even September to implement the new currency, Scalco deems it more important to obtain economic results as soon as possible.
