The government is also considering opening a hot line between Seoul and Pyongyang so that President Kim Yong-sam and his North Korean counterpart Kim Il-song can discuss key issues over the phone at any time. He noted the hot line is necessary for discussion of important issues to ensure the common prosperity of all Koreans as well as peace and stability on the peninsula. The official said the summit should not be a one-off event. "It is desirable to regularize the summits in such a manner as to hold a second meeting in Pyongyang if the first meeting is held in Seoul," he said. Some Koreans favor a third site other than Seoul or Pyongyang, citing as a precedent the first summit between West and East Germany. The official, however, emphasized that it must be held in either Seoul or Pyongyang from a symbolic standpoint. "The earlier the meeting is held, the better it will be," he said, voicing hope that it would come in early July. Meanwhile, the government will soon discuss matters related to the summit based on the principle of denuclearization of the Korean peninsula agreed between Seoul and Pyongyang, and the agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, exchanges and cooperation which was signed at a prime ministers meeting in 1991.
