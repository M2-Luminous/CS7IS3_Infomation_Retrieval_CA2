I wish you joy and happiness. As you know, our parliament will not resume its work until 18 January, and there are some acute, pressing issues that have to be discussed by both the deputies and the public as a whole. Therefore, let me address you and the members of the Georgian parliament with a short speech. Dear colleagues, friends. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I wish you happiness, together with Georgia. If Georgia is not happy, then God forbid our happiness. We have lived several months through an illusion reminiscent of a temporary mitigation of acute pain through the use of painkillers. The war with the invaders has stopped by our joining the CIS. A definite chance for our survival has emerged. We must use every minute, but we are still slow. Once again, we are facing the danger of physical self-destruction, and we are watching with folded arms how intense Cain-like actions are becoming. There still is the fear: What if we lose the title of a patriot? What if I do not come across as a good man? The question is whether the country and the people are going to survive. It is a question of life and death. All of us have forgotten that we are living in an age of technical civilization, when the global danger of destruction is greater than ever before. If a long time used to be needed to destroy a country, now it requires only a matter of hours. I do not mean a weapon of mass destruction. Georgia has lost thousands of lives in recent years. We have over 200,000 refugees. Georgia has suffered huge financial losses. The country that was built badly--or maybe well--has been destroyed, Marriage and birth rates have dwindled dramatically. Drug addiction is on the rampage. Children's lives and health are in danger. The hereditary potential of the nation is in danger. Every normal citizen must think of only one thing: to save the country somehow from the current catastrophic process of autogenocide. Those who think that this is just excessive panic have ambition that is more important to them than the fate of the country. I may be mistaken, but there is no time for doubts now. Waiting and useless postponement is the evil today. It is not like me to look for the culprit who drove the country to this state and to blame someone or a group of people. We must stop passing the buck if we want to avoid the fate of the Biblical [word indistinct]. Yes, we are all to blame for whatever has happened to us. God will judge us for our sins very soon. It is the punishment for a lie. If we do not stop telling lies, then our judgment will continue. It is clear. All it takes is normal reasoning, an elemental conscience, and a sense of responsibility. The war has changed its face today. It has been socially reincarnated. Our own compatriots--by carrying out a sabotage--are trying to slit those vital arteries that are still pulsating, to break the power and engineering system, to get hold of fuel, and to deprive the country of a possibility for life. The country is being brutally murdered by bandits wearing either ties or guns. The treasury has been destroyed. In effect, we are a country that does not have money. People are dying of hunger. Children and women have become miserable and poor. Moral norms, which still exist, are dwindling day by day. If Davit Guramishvili [Georgian poet] were looking at our conditions today, he would forget the trouble that Georgia was living through in his time. We all know it very well. What will save us? Only telling the truth. We must give our condition a name and an accurate diagnosis and think about tomorrow. Before we say something, compare the thought with the inner voice of our conscience. I will tell you directly what nearly 99 percent of the population thinks, but not a single percent says what they are thinking aloud. I will tell you what I have to say, irrespective of what you do. Trample me over or embellish me with different epithets of a traitor. I prefer to die rather than live such life. Therefore, do not let anybody think that I will be afraid. Neither should they think that they will traditionally go down in history as patriots or traitors. This time it will be God who will decide who is a traitor. God forgive me for using his name so frequently, but even a poisoned atheist must see now that God is near us, and he is not stroking us but is here with fire and a sword because we are telling lies and are lying to the country. If we do not comprehend this, then more disaster will come. It is wrong to say what additional disaster can happen to us. By joining the CIS, we have made one step forward toward Russia, and Russia toward us. They are not throwing their hats up in the air exclaiming: What happiness! Georgia has honored us! Russia is telling us directly that she will move forward to us by as many steps as we move toward her. We will be your brothers if you want to be our brothers. We are talking with Russia by issuing ultimatums, however. We can talk to Russia in the language of brotherhood and trust, and it will be more honorable. Personally, I will be proud to be Russia's brother, but those who will not probably have a better brother. I will tell you honestly that we will not find a more reliable brother than Russia. There are no states or families who do not have brothers or allies. I call on you to talk to Russia in the same language as the great Ilya Chavchavadze [Georgian 19th century writer] used to talk to Russia. Ilya is more alive today than any of us is alive. I call on you to talk to Russia in the language of trust and friendship. If we are late, however, then we will cease to exist. If we were to survive, then nobody would want to be our brother. Let us talk to Russia in the same way as our fathers and grandfathers did. Russia saved us once. She united a country torn asunder. If we do not admit it, then let me remind you that God does not like either an ungrateful man or people. It is a Biblical truth. I know that I will irritate you, but may you be irritated. I would rather kneel before Russia than see my people kneel. If somebody else has a talent to do the contrary, then may God judge them. I support talking to Russia in the language of brotherhood, trust, and openness. I am asking her to support my country actively in order to save it and to help get to its feet. I would like to ask those who have a different view not to waste time by talking about my treachery but to give us, not an alternative for Georgia's heroic self-destruction, but a specific program for saving Georgia honorably. I will be more specific. Let those who have a different view present to us an alternative view, but not the traditional rigmarole like: Some resolution must be found. Let them present only specific views. The issue of joining the ruble zone must be put on the agenda as soon as possible. I am not sure whether we will be accepted, but we must try. We are the country where there is no money, and there are no salaries. History has not seen a country without money for a long time. If anybody knows of other financial sources and possibilities, then I admire him. I will remind you once again. I am talking specifically about cash and not an indulgence. Clever politicians will favor this point of view, but those people whose pockets are lined with dollars and rubles will, of course, oppose it. They are making a mistake here, however, because their dollars or rubles will go down the drain if the country is destroyed. Those who say that order can only be maintained by using law- enforcement bodies are mistaken because a penniless policemen is a potential bandit and maybe a real one. A hungry policeman will be thinking of getting food, and he will not be thinking about high ideals and state order. Deputies, it must not be difficult either for you or for Russia to guess about the tragic state of the author of these lines. I wanted and still want the kind of Georgia that will be able, not only to defend itself, but also to defend others. I repeat: Georgia has to be saved today. I call on all of you to stop labelling me and to think about the way to save Georgia, a way that can be seen. Vakhtang Goguadze. Thank you for your attention.
