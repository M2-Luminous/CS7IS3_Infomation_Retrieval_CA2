Speaking at a inaugural meeting on the prevention of drug abuse, Mr Chen said that most drug addicts were teenagers with the drugs used ranging from opium to refined heroin. Crimes resulting from drug addiction are now on the rise and include burglary and robbery, murder, fraud and the kidnapping of women and children for sale. About 60 percent of AIDS cases in China were due to intravenous heroin injection. As publicity on the dangers of drugs is still inadequate, drug abuse is now quite serious in the country. Mr Chen said he believed that with economic prosperity, the pharmaceutical industry had mushroomed with the appearance of serious drug abuse and the administration of drugs had become an arduous task. The ministry had adopted a number of measures to strengthen drug administration and guide the production and marketing of drugs. As drug abuse is a complicated social problem, it requires a massive input from various sectors to deal with it. An association whose aim is to prevent drug abuse was formally set up today with the approval of the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Civil Affairs with the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Mr Fei Xiaotong, as its honorary president and Mr Chen as its president.
