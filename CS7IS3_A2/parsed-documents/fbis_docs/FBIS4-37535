FBIS4-37535 "drnes120_k_94003" FBIS-NES-94-120 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 IRAQ Opposition Official Criticizes U.S. Stand Opposition Official Criticizes U.S. Stand NC2106111994 Beirut AL-SAFIR in Arabic 17 Jun 94 p 13 NC2106111994 Beirut AL-SAFIR Arabic BFN [Text] According to press reports, there was a meeting in the British capital three days ago between David Late [name as transliterated], an official in the U.S. Department of State, and officials from the London headquarters of Unified Iraqi National Congress [UINC] during which Late asked the UINC officials to close the London headquarters and move it to northern Iraq. On this issue, Hani al-Fakiki, a prominent official in the UINC who did not attend the meeting because he was out of London, has made a statement to AL-SAFIR in which he expressed surprise at this U.S. demand, if the press reports are accurate. He said that the opening or closure of the UINC headquarters is an internal affair which only the organizations, parties, and political forces that are members of the UINC can decide upon. Al-Fakiki said there is nothing new in the reported assertions by the U.S. official that the Baghdad regime should implement the UN resolutions, including Resolution 688, "because we and the Iraqi people have heard of this for two years ago and there is nothing new either in Late's statements or in his administration's stand." Al-Fakiki added: "Events have confirmed that the U.S. administration and its Arab and non-Arab allies are only interested in the implementation of the UN resolutions that deal with the destruction of Iraq's military, economic, and political resources, but have no interest in human rights and freedoms nor any serious interest in implementing Resolution 688 or in putting an end to the Iraqi people's sufferings in the north, center, and south." He said: "Our people are tired and have run out of patience with the sweet words, promises, and slogans because they see what is in fact happening, their silence over the crimes, and the normalization of ties, all of which mean an Arab and regional siege of the Iraqi opposition." The Iraqi opposition figure stressed that "the U.S. administration and its Arab and non-Arab allies have complete knowledge, documented by photographs and films, of the massacres committed by the regime against Iraq's Arabs in the south and the marshlands. A few weeks ago British MP Emma Nicholson screened in the parliament some documentaries filmed by the coalition forces' aircraft showing the burning of villages, the drainage of the marshlands in the areas of al-Bashrah and al-'Amarah, the diversion of river courses, the expulsion of Arab tribes from their camps, the effects of all this on the environment, the destruction of livestock, and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of southern Arab tribesmen, who have been pushed toward the Iranian-Iraqi borders." He added: "The U.S. administration also has no lack of information about the regime's violations of human rights and its crushing of the Iraqi people's national determination to coexist in a unified state. By this, I mean the use of poison gas in the north and south. The regime is making daily announcements on its official radio and in the government press of executions, amputations of arms and legs, and unfair sentences in Mosul, Baghdad, and al-Basrah." Al-Fakiki went on to say: "The Kurds' sufferings and the siege imposed on them, as well as the attacks on UN officials and members of the international relief organizations, are not unknown to the U.S. administration." He warned the Iraqi opposition forces that "despite the importance of dealing with international and regional factors and exploiting them to serve the Iraqi people, this should not give us political illusions. The West's oil interests and its priorities of reaching a peaceful settlement, guaranteeing Israel's security, and drawing up a map of a new Middle East, plus the calculations of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are not necessarily compatible with human rights and freedoms in Iraq or with the notion of bringing down tyranny and its backers." Concluding his statement, al-Fakiki said: "Bringing down repression and establishing a democratic alternative is a national task; to achieve it we must be self-reliant. It is a major historic task of great difficulty that goes beyond the toppling of this or that regime, especially in an oil-producing country such as Iraq, given its position and neighbors."
