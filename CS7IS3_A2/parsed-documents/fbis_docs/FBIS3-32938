According to the source, National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) agents carried out an operation on 6 February and captured 20 SL activists. The detainees were involved in publishing the clandestine newspaper and in the SL's political propaganda. The SL is still active in Peru. The police did not report the printing shop's location in Lima. The authorities believe its discovery and dismantling represents a harsh blow against the SL because the printing shop belongs to the SL group that has not obeyed the orders of Abimael Guzman, the terrorist organization's leader and founder, to reach a "peace accord" with the Peruvian Government. Guzman was detained on 12 September 1992 in Lima and sentenced to life imprisonment by an unidentified military court. He asked for a peace accord in October in various letters he sent to Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. Those imprisoned -- including most SL leaders -- have obeyed Guzman's order, but the activists who remain free emphasize that the man who is allegedly the Abimael Guzman who wrote the letters, and spoke on television to confirm the contents of the letters, is an unidentified person who was trained for one year to impersonate the real Guzman. The raided printing shop was under the orders of the free SL Central Committee, which, according to the police, is headed by [words indistinct] Alberto Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano," the new leader of the terrorist gang. The SL's hard-line faction seems to be headed by Catalina Adriansen, the wife of SL ideologist Antonio Diaz who was killed during the penitentiaries massacre in 1986; "Feliciano;" Margie Clavo Peralta; and Isabel Rengifo; among others. Martha Huatay, Laura Zambrano, and Teresa Durand Araujo, the wife of Osman Morote, who was also detained and is another top Shining Path leader, are among the imprisoned SL leaders who support the "Feliciano" faction. This faction, which pursues the violent actions of the SL, is responsible for the latest attacks in Lima against the Air Force headquarters and the "Barbones" barracks during which two people were killed, many were injured, and there was extensive property damage. SL experts believe there is an irrevocable division within the SL between those who approve and those who reject Guzman's position. The newspaper EL COMERCIO today says that SL leader Martha Huatay managed to take from the prison a message by Guzman when she visited the Navy prison where the Shining Path leader is being held. The message reportedly said: "My detention represents a turn along the way, join the masses, the people shall win." In 1992, Dincote agents raided another Shining Path printing shop in Lima that was managed by Jorge Durand Araujo, who is in prison. Durand Araujo is the brother of Maximiliano and Teresa, who are being described as founder members of the SL.
