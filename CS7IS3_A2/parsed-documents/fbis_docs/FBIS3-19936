Violante, 52, a deputy of the former communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and a former magistrate, sent a resignation letter to the leaders of the upper and lower houses, the source said. Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of rightwing Forza Italia (Go Italy) party, had demanded his resignation, after an article in the LA STAMPA daily quoted Violante as linking a close collaborator of the television magnate to the Mafia. Violante implied in an interview with LA STAMPA that Marcello Dell`Utri, president of Fininvest's advertising company Publitalia, controlled by Berlusconi, was under investigation in Sicily in connection with a Mafia drug and gun-running affair. The Anti-Mafia Committee leader later denied the comments and late Tuesday at a PDS rally in Sicily said he was "considering resigning to attack more freely the man who set a trap for me and is now using it."
