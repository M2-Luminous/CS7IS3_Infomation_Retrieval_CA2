This despicable crime brings to mind other Zionist massacres, like Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, and al-Samu'. Political analysts and observers are unified in their position that the massacre was the natural upshot of unrelenting occupation and settlement activity. They point out that to discuss peace while occupation and settlement activity continue is an exercise in futility and that, if there is to be peace in the region, occupation must end, settlements must be dismantled and settlers repatriated. The savage Zionist massacre was perpetrated in full view of the Israeli military, who checked the identity of worshipers before their entry into the mosque. During 10 minutes of heavy firing at the backs of kneeling worshipers, none of the Israeli military personnel acted to halt the carnage. With a hail of fire raining at innocent Arabs from different corners, the massacre was a systematic act, the scenario of which must have been mapped out by the higher settlement council. The outrage was a message to Arabs and the world that racist, expansionist Zionism and its characteristically blood-thirsty savagery are still there, and that peace rhetoric is so much lip service. Zionism and criminality are natural twins. Zionism cannot possibly be a peaceable movement, since it would thus be at cross purposes with it own psyche and objectives. Right from the beginning of the peace process and the Washington talks, the Arab negotiating teams sought an end to Israeli settlement activity and Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories, with the Israeli Government consistently offering a negative response to these basic demands. Indeed, Israel has put up hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. loan guarantees to expand existing settlements, build new outposts, and arm settlers. The Israeli Government went even further and introduced joint military-settler patrols. Furthermore, leaders of the settler community have issued threats to carry out massacres against Arabs in the occupied territories. It came to light recently that Zionist settlers have started an armed organization. Rabbis have been urging Israelis to commit murder and drive Arabs from their homes. Only a couple of days ago, the Zionist settlers in the occupied Golan Heights declared their full confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for his support and encouragement. They are known to make it a habit to provoke our people in the Golan and to stage violent demonstrations in order to send the message that Israel is not about to vacate the occupied Syrian territories. All these acts of aggression culminated in the monstrous crime against the peaceful worshipers. They point to the Rabin government's involvement in this murderous episode. They prove beyond a shadow of doubt that any bargain with Israel that does not provide for the withdrawal of the Israeli military and settlers from the occupied territory is not worth the ink in which it is written. Peace and occupation and settlements are strange bedfellows. The ABC's of Middle East peace require an Israeli pullout from all occupied Arab territories and their devolution to their rightful owners' control. Yesterday's massacre must be directly or indirectly laid at the door of the Oslo and Cairo agreements and whatever other pact may follow. Talk about Palestinian self-rule while Israeli occupation and armed settlements remain is a waste of time and a stab in the back of the Palestinian people's struggle. It legitimizes a state of affairs rejected by U.N. resolutions and whets the appetite of Zionist settlers to perpetrate further atrocities. It seems Palestinian negotiators forgot Israel's crime-ridden track record, and were too trustful and unsuspecting, thereby facilitating the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Condemnations and denunciations, no matter how strongly worded, are not good enough. The international community must shoulder its responsibilities and work toward dislodging the Israeli occupation and settlers if it cares enough about a just and universal peace in the Middle East. Throughout two years of negotiations in Washington, the Arabs never detected an Israeli willingness to pull out from the occupied territories, cease settlement activity, or disband settlements. All this, then, when total Israeli withdrawal is a key requirement for any progress toward peace. The community of nations and the sponsors of the peace process will have to immediately intervene to end Israel's equivocation, instead of pressing for an end of the Arab boycott of Israel and a blueprint for regional cooperation incorporating Israel. The UN Security Council, which convened to consider the grave situation, must state the need for a total Israeli withdrawal, settlement disbandment, and restitution of rights and territories.
