Nikolay Yermakov, head of the Russian delegation at the conference of the Japanese nuclear industry forum, currently being held here, told this ITAR- TASS correspondent that a first reactor of this type is already being built at one of the nuclear industry centers in Chelyabinsk- 40, and that the local authorities have approved its completion within the next several years. Nikolay Yermakov, who heads the directorate of nuclear reactors at the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry, said the question of Japan's purchase of highly enriched fissile substances from Russia's dismantled nuclear warheads is still ``up in the air'' because Tokyo ``is not showing any activity in response to Russia's proposals.'' The head of the Russian delegation believes that until about 2010 Russian nuclear power engineering will continue to develop light- water reactors, which use thermal neutrons, because the county's power engineering needs are at present satisfied by cheap uranium. However, he believes that from about the second decade of the 21st century there will be a shift to a plutonium program, and a closed power engineering system will be built on the basis of breeder reactors, using both thermal and fast neutrons. ``This will enable us to use breeder reactors not only to produce but also to recycle -- that is to burn -- plutonium from light-water installations with a minimal emission of radioactive waste,'' he said.
