The series of mutual challenges expressed from the Senate floor or from the street, climaxed with a statement made by the senator who claimed to possess intelligence according to which the parliamentary opposition was preparing together with those organizations the assassination of Romania's president and the establishment of monarchy. Supporters of the Greater Romania Party and members of the revolutionaries' organizations had an encounter near the Senate house. Several leading dailies put the number of mobilized forces at between 200 and 500 police and gendarmes to keep them apart. No incident was however reported. "I think decency and reason are needed" told the press Major-General Costica Voicu, deputy chief of the General Police Inspectorate. He added that "it is not the duty of police to check the information on the assassination announced by the PRM leader" and that "this is up to specially constituted institutions". A press release from the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] issued yesterday afternoon reads: "The analysis of the operative situation as well as the data we have in the reference domains do not confirm for the near future the existence of real intentions (or possibilities) of assassinating Romania's president or restoring the monarchy". The release adds that "the dissemination of such information, without sufficient checking of their probability, causes useless confusion and worry or, on the contrary, induce in the public opinion disbelief in the seriousness of the allegation".
