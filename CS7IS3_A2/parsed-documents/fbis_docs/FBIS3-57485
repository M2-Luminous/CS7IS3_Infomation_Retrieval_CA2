The sides also exchanged views on several international problems, including the settlement of conflicts in different parts of the world. Adamishin told ITAR-TASS that the Russian prime minister's visit to Italy was initiated by the Italian side and constituted an important stage in the development of bilateral relations between the two countries. "1994 promises to be a rather intensive year in Russo-Italian relations. A G-7 meeting is to be held at Naples in July. The Italian side, as regular G-7 chairman, has reaffirmed the invitation extended to President Boris Yeltsin to attend the meeting," Adamishin said. "Our countries are closely cooperating within the frameworks of multilateral diplomacy. Russia is ready to help Italy in its efforts as chairman of the CSCE. There are many points of contact in the policies of the two countries," he added. Adamishin said that the policies of the two countries in such a painful matter as the Yugoslavian conflict had much in common. "The Italians, like ourselves, approach very guardedly the ideas of resorting to forcible actions in this neighbouring region," Adamishin stated. "Political cooperation is being continued in bilateral relations, too. Italy is our important partner and a treaty on friendship and cooperation is now in the making. It will be signed soon. Many agreements, signed between Italy and the Soviet Union, have been reconcluded. "The sides have discussed their economic relations. Italy has granted Russia second largest credits after the German loans. This 'generosity' of our Italian partners, frankly speaking, has created definite difficulties in servicing the credits. After all, they have to be repaid. But even in this delicate sphere we were able to find mutual understanding and common language," Adamishin noted. "The level of cooperation in the economic sphere is very high. For instance, the recently signed agreement between 'Gazprom' and the Eni group is a vivid example of the common effort to help improve the trade balance between the two countries, to develop industrial and technological cooperation. "The Russian side expects Chernomyrdin's official visit to Italy to be successful and to serve the interests of the peoples of both countries," Adamishin stressed.
