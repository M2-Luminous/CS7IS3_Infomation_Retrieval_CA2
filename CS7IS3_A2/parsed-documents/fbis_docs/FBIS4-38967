Some people -- and they constitute a majority -- are ready to support Leonid Danilovich without hesitation in the presidential election despite serious failings in the economy under his government. Others -- they, too, are fairly numerous -- place virtually every catastrophe ever to have befallen Ukraine at his door. While the mass media never tire of forging an antihero out of him. Nevertheless, at this point in time he is firmly rooted on the front row of the ratings grid, shunting L. Kravchuk into second place. Kuchma himself attributes this to the following: [Kuchma] I have always spoken the truth; indeed, I always do speak the truth. It may not be very nice, but it is the truth. Most people like to hear the truth, but not everyone. Can you really tell me that my assertion that we cannot survive without economic alliance with Russia will please those who envisage a Ukraine geared toward the West? Or else I am reproached nowadays with not having had a clear idea of the type of state which we are building -- socialist, or capitalist -- while executing the duties of head of the government. In actual fact I did not know, and I was not ashamed to ask the legislators about this in public. [Sverdlov] What do you think of the new Ukrainian parliament? [Kuchma] My position is known. I would like to see the Supreme Council occupied not so much with politics as with economics. Unfortunately, many representatives from political parties were elected to it. On the one hand the parliament is too right-wing, and on the other it is too left-wing. If the extremes fail to meet each other halfway, Ukraine will lie idle for a long time yet. The managerial corps acceded to legislative power in too weak a condition. However, there are many deputies in parliament who are ready to devote their efforts entirely to reviving the economy. I pin great hopes on them. [Sverdlov] You are aware that a consultative poll of the population was conducted in the Donbass during the elections. The overwhelming majority expressed support for Ukraine's entry into the Commonwealth of Independent States, a federal structure, and the attribution to Russian of the status of the second state language. Do you share their point of view? [Kuchma] I have advocated and still advocate Ukraine's entry into the CIS. Nobody is waiting to receive us in the West as yet. Especially with the quality of goods being produced at current levels. Which is why it is essential to make every effort to support integration toward the East. Yet we are doing everything possible to prevent this. It is very easy to lose the sales market in Russia. There will be states poised to fill the niche. Indeed, they are already filling the gaps. It is far harder to conquer the market afterward. Indeed, once it gets used to doing without us, Russia will hardly want to begin focusing attention on us again. In this respect I am in complete sympathy with the Donbass people. As, indeed, I am on the point of the regions' possessing greater autonomy. I stated this on the very first day after Ukraine acquired independence. As for the language problem, I believe that the state language should be just Ukrainian, but that the official languages should be Russian and Ukrainian. [Sverdlov] What is the difference? [Kuchma] The state language is the language of diplomacy and law. Official languages apply in every other sphere. [Sverdlov] It became known recently that you advocate setting up a party of industrialists and entrepreneurs. Have you set about fulfilling this task? [Kuchma] Without an influential party of industrialists and entrepreneurs, it is very difficult to resolve questions of reforming the economy. And we will set up such a party in the very near future. There are many deputies in the new parliament with a tremendous desire to top up the ranks of our party, and this will open the way to forming the type of government which will not be in awe of the Supreme Council. [Sverdlov] What economic program will you be taking to the presidential election? [Kuchma] Look first at what is happening with the republic economy. In the first quarter of this year alone industrial output fell by one third. In the machine-building sector it fell by 40 percent. Hundreds of enterprises have ground to a halt. And both the domestic and foreign debts have hit astronomical figures. My program for getting out of the crisis is primarily the program of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. As for the first steps, it is above all necessary to loosen taxation on commodity producers. They are quite simply being suffocated by them. Accounting by promissory note [vekselnyy zachet] should also be carried out between enterprises, as this will provide an opportunity to identify bankruptcies. Some of these enterprises, having no future, will have to be shut down, while others will have to be retooled. And of course, we should renounce the fixed rate for the karbovanets against the dollar, which renders all our output for export loss-making. [Sverdlov] But if you are gunning for bankruptcies, then it follows, for instance, that coal enterprises first and foremost must be cut back. It is these enterprises which are currently up to their eyeballs in debt. [Kuchma] The wisdom of any government resides in its skill in forecasting. Otherwise the hatchets could come down too vigorously! Yes, the coal enterprises in Ukraine are loss-making. However, we have no other fuel. Which means that investment and state support are necessary. [Sverdlov] Today many people are stressing the inexpediency of holding a presidential election. What is your view on this score? [Kuchma] There is a law, and it should be observed. There are no grounds for calling off the presidential election.
