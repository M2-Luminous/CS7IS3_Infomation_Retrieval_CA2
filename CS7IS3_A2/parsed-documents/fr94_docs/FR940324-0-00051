FR940324-0-00051 FR940324-0-00020 The external gamma dose rate at a given distance above soil containing Ra-226 depends on the source geometry and the self-absorption of the radiation in the soil. For the conditions being assessed, an infinite plane best describes source geometry and the PATHRAE model used an infinite plane dose factor for Ra-226 and its decay products of 1.67 × 10 ^4 mrem/y per pCi/m 2 . As this value is nearly the same as the value of 1.69 × 10 ^4 mrem/y per pCi/m 2 used by the DOE (DOE88), it does not appear to be too high. The effect of self-absorption is quite variable and depends on the soil density and the low gamma energy cutoff value. The NCRP's theoretical value is based on work by Beck (BE75), which assumes a soil density of 1.6 g/cm 3 and used 50 KeV as the low energy cutoff values. These differences, particularly the difference in the low energy cutoff values, account for the differences between the BID and the results that would be obtained using the NCRP's value of 1.6 urad/hr per pCi/g. It should also be noted that both values (1.6 urad/hr per pCi/g and 2.5 urad/hr per pCi/g) are within the variability of field measurements. Objection: The use of a 70 year exposure period for residential scenarios is inconsistent with the Superfund policy of using 90th percentile estimates. The 90th percentile value is 30 years. Response: The BID generally reports lifetime risk per year of exposure. However, in Scenario 7, the risks for a lifetime of exposure are presented by multiplying the risk per year of exposure by 70 years. This is consistent with the EPA's policy under the Clean Air Act which was explained in the preamble to the 1989 National Emission Standards for Radon Emissions from Phosphogypsum Stacks (54 FR 51661) and which has been used in these rulemaking proceedings. However, as explained in the preamble, the difference that would be caused by assuming a shorter period of exposure is not very significant. For an assumed constant rate of exposure, people receive over 60% of their total lifetime risk during their first nineteen years. To change the period of exposure from 70 years to the first 19 years of life would change the final results by less than a factor of two. Objection: Radioactive decay during the 70-year residential exposure period is neglected. Response: Neglecting radioactive decay during the 70-year residential exposure period introduces a negligible conservatism to the results. Accounting for radioactive decay would have reduced the estimated risks by about 1.5 percent. Objection: The BID fails to account for removal of soil during home construction at former phosphogypsum use sites. Response: Some home construction may involve the removal of the contaminated soil. However, it is more likely that the homes would have the contaminated soil under or adjacent to them. Since the analysis focused on the potential risks to the most exposed members of the population, assuming that the contamination remains under and adjacent to any homes that are built is reasonable. Objection: The derivation of the presumptively safe level of 10 pCi/g Ra-226 for phosphogypsum used in agriculture is based on the 95th percentile application rate of 2,700 lb/acre for 100 years. Using the 90th percentile rate, per Superfund policy, would be more appropriate. More importantly, the application rate of 2,700 lb/acre is for soil reclamation rather than soil productivity. Soil reclamation would not require applications at this rate over a 100-year period. By combining the application rate for soil reclamation with the frequency rate for soil productivity the EPA has greatly overestimated the total phosphogypsum application that would occur over the 100-year period. Response: Superfund guidance is not necessarily applicable under this NESHAP. However, TFI has not correctly stated the Superfund guidance. That guidance for calculating reasonable maximum exposure calls for the choice of 95th percentile values where available, or 90th percentile values where 95th percentile values are not available. The 95th percentile application rate for phosphogypsum used in agriculture was calculated from data reported by TFI, based on a questionnaire they sent to users of phosphogypsum (Docket A&hyph;79&hyph;11, XV&hyph;D&hyph;100A, appendix, Tab 38). The 95th percentile was based on considering application rates for a variety of crops produced in California and for peanut production in the South, based on the assumption that agricultural usage of phosphogypsum is about equally split between the California and the remainder of the U.S. Although the data from California show much higher application rates than those for peanuts, we do not believe that California's rates are necessarily associated with reclamation. Phosphogypsum is used for land reclamation in California; however, an expert on the use of phosphogypsum in California estimates that the application rate for reclamation is about 10,000 pounds per acre, considerably higher that the rates reported in the TFI questionnaire. He also estimates that the application rate for production is approximately equal to the rates reported in the TFI questionnaire (Docket A&hyph;79&hyph;11, XVII&hyph;B&hyph;41). Objection: The assessment of agricultural use does not consider the differing application rates in different geographic areas of the country. Response: The risk analysis in the BID gives risks for various application rates. Use of the 95th percentile application rate to select a single value for the maximum permissible radium-226 content in phosphogypsum distributed for agricultural use greatly simplifies compliance and enforcement procedures. Objection: The method prescribed for determining Ra-226 concentrations is for airborne effluents, not solids. Response: The rule references Method 114 in appendix B of part 61. Method 114 provides requirements for: (1) Stack sampling of effluents; (2) radiochemical methods for determining the quantity of radionuclides in a sample; and (3) quality assurance methods. Clearly, the portions of Method 114 that relate to the collection of the effluent sample are not applicable to determining the Ra-226 content of phosphogypsum removed from a stack. However, the portions of Method 114 that relate to radiochemical methods of determining the quantity of Ra-226 present in the phosphogypsum (i.e., ``the principles of measurement'') and the specified quality assurance methods are valid regardless of how the sample was obtained. B. Policy Objections Objection: The EPA analysis of potential risks and the EPA decision criteria with respect to the use of phosphogypsum in road construction are absurd, because even naturally occurring materials would not meet the EPA standard for a presumptively safe level of exposure to radioactivity. Response: It is well known that naturally occurring radium-226 levels in soil can release amounts of radon which are potentially hazardous to occupants of structures built on such soil. Phosphogypsum can contain radium-226 levels far in excess of the amount of activity naturally present in soil. It is not absurd for EPA to take actions to control the additional risks associated with the higher activity levels in phosphogypsum simply because naturally occurring construction materials may also present a risk in some circumstances.
