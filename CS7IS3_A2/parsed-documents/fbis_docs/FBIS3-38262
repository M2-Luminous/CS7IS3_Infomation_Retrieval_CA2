The election date is set for Sunday, March 27, but since that falls on the Jewish Passover Holiday, the government on January 19th pushed through a decree that would extend the voting into the following day, Monday, March 28. The People's [Popular] Party, taking advantage of the fact that the decree must now be debated in the House and Senate, is seeking by way of these amendments to re-introduce a second round of balloting in the general elections. Thus, the party's deputy caucus leader in the Senate, Francesco Mazzola, submitted the amendments Tuesday even as the Senate constitutional affairs committee got down to a study of the government decree this afternoon. The decree goes before the full Senate tomorrow. With regard to elections to the House, the proposed changes to the electoral rules as they now stand would call for a runoff ballot to be held on the second Sunday after the election, for candidates who did not receive 50 percent plus one of the votes in those constituencies where 75 percent of the total seats are assigned according to the first-past-the-post system. All those candidates may take part in the runoff who received at least 10 percent of the votes cast and whoever obtains the greatest number of votes in this second round would be declared the winner. With regard to elections to the Senate, the relevant amendment calls for a runoff ballot the second Sunday following the first ballot for all those candidates where the uninominal system holds who did not garner 50 percent plus one of the votes cast. Antonio Maccanico, undersecretary at the premier's office said that the admissibility of the amendments submitted by the People's [Popular] Party within the context of discussion on the decree to extend the general election to March 28th must be decided upon by the speakers of the two houses. It is not up to the government to express an opinion on this matter, Maccanico stated. It will be the panel on Senate rules that will decide tomorrow morning if the two amendments presented by Mazzola are admissable or not. The Senate Constitutional Affairs committee, meanwhile, ruled constitutional the decree extending the general election date by one day to enable Jews to vote without running into a conflict with their religious practices. Coming out strongly against the amendment bid to change the election rules were the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the Northern League and [Republican leader] Marco Pannella, who wondered if Mazzola wanted the initiative to be seen as a last blip from the Christian Democrats or the first peep out of the new People's [Popular] Party. PDS caucus leader in the senate, Giuseppe Chiarante, said that while his party had always been in favor of two rounds of balloting, it was too late now to change the rules of the game.
