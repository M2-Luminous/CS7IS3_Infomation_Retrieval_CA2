FR940325-1-00076 FR940325-1-00008 The proposed rule would amend this section by revising the grazing fee formula, adding a provision for phasing in the grazing fee over the years 1995 through 1997, providing for an adjustment of the fee formula in the event separate final regulations prescribing qualification criteria for an incentive-based fee are not completed, and providing for a 25 percent cap on changes in the calculated fee from year to year. The section would be further amended to make clear the definition of a billing unit, to provide for assessing a surcharge for the public landlord's share of authorized subleasing associated with Federal land grazing, to provide for multi-year billing in specified circumstances to reduce administrative workload associated with small grazing allotments, to clarify that grazing use that occurs before a bill is paid is an unauthorized use and may be dealt with under the settlement and penalties sections of these regulations and may result in the limitation of flexibility authorized under an allotment management plan, and to provide for free use where the primary objective of livestock use is to benefit resource conditions or management, such as scientific study or the control of noxious weeds. The advance notice of proposed rulemaking proposed to phase in the grazing fee over the grazing years of 1994 through 1996. This proposed rule would also phase in the revised grazing fee, but the initial phase would begin with grazing year 1995. The proposed amendment of the grazing fee formula has been prepared in cooperation with the Forest Service. In reviewing potential modification of the grazing fee formula the BLM and Forest Service identified criteria by which any new fee proposal should be measured. Those criteria are: 1. The fee charged for livestock grazing should approximate market value. Using market value helps assure that the public receives a fair return for the private use of publicly owned resources. 2. The fee should not cause unreasonable impacts on communities that are not economically diverse or to livestock operations that are greatly dependent on public land forage. 3. The grazing fee should recover a reasonable amount of government costs involved in administering grazing permits and leases and should provide increased funds to improve ecological conditions. 4. The fee system should be understandable and reasonably easy to administer. The present fee system, in effect since 1978, has been controversial and criticized for the wide disparity between rates charged for livestock grazing on private lands and those charged for Federal lands. While the forage value in the private market increased substantially over time, the Federal grazing fee has decreased during some periods or had relatively small increases. The proposed fee system would use a base value adjusted annually by the change in the private grazing land lease rate. The proposed base value was derived by using data from two different studies. The first study is the 1966 Western Livestock Grazing Survey (WLGS), where over 10,000 individuals were interviewed to determine the costs of operating on Federal lands, as compared to operating on private land leases. Information on the private grazing land lease rate was also collected. The WLGS determined that the westwide value for grazing Federal lands equalled $1.23 per AUM for 1966. This value is updated to a 1991 base value of $3.25 per AUM by multiplying $1.23 by 264, the percentage change in the private grazing land lease rate from the base years 1964&hyph;1968, and dividing by 100. The second study is the 1983 appraisal of the value of grazing on the BLM and Forest Service lands in the 16 western States. This appraisal involved interviews with approximately 100,000 persons and generated 7,246 usable records of fees paid for livestock grazing. The appraisal divided the 16 western States into 6 pricing regions.
