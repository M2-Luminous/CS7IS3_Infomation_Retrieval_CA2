FR940830-1-00030 FR940830-1-00002 (c) *␣*␣* The burden is on the concern requesting a waiver to specify the ground(s) upon which the waiver is being sought and to demonstrate that it has met that (those) ground(s). * * * * * 47. Section 124.319 would be amended by adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows: §124.319 Contract termination. * * * * * (c) Substitution of one 8(a) contractor for another. Where a Program Participant is unable to complete performance of an 8(a) contract, SBA may authorize another 8(a) Participant to complete performance and, in conjunction with the procuring agency, novate the contract to the substitute Program Participant. 48. Section 124.321 would be amended by revising the second sentence of paragraph (a), by adding a new sentence after the second sentence of paragraph (a), by revising paragraphs (c)(3), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (h)(1)(iii), and by adding a new paragraph (i) to read as follows: §124.321 Joint venture agreements. (a) Prerequisites for joint venture agreement. *␣*␣* A joint venture agreement is permissible only where an 8(a) concern lacks the necessary capacity to perform the contract on its own, and when the agreement is fair and equitable. Where an 8(a) concern brings nothing to the joint venture relationship (i.e., it lacks the management, technical, and financial capacity to perform the contract), the joint venture arrangement will not be approved by SBA. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (c) Contents of joint venture agreement. *␣*␣* (3) A provision stating that not less than 51 percent of the net profits earned by the joint venture shall be distributed to the 8(a) concern. In the case of a joint venture that includes two or more 8(a) concerns, no one 8(a) concern is individually required to receive 51 percent of the profits (e.g., there can be a 50/50 joint venture relationship between two 8(a) concerns). * * * * * (d) Other requirements. *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (2) An 8(a) concern to the joint venture arrangement must be designated as the lead entity of the joint venture. An employee of the 8(a) concern designated as the lead entity must be appointed project manager responsible for contract performance. (3) Accounting and other administrative records relating to the joint venture shall be kept in the office of the lead 8(a) concern, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is granted by SBA upon written request. Upon completion of the contract performed by the joint venture, the final original records shall be retained by the lead 8(a) concern. * * * * * (h) Joint ventures with concerns owned by Indian tribes. (1) *␣*␣* * * * * * (iii) Performs most of its activities generally on such reservation or tribally-owned land; and * * * * * (i) Joint ventures for Small Disadvantaged Business Set-Asides and Small Disadvantaged Business Evaluation Preferences. Joint ventures are permitted for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) set-asides and SDB evaluation preferences, provided that the requirements set forth in this paragraph are met. (1) For purposes of this paragraph, the term joint venture has the same meaning as that set forth in §121.401(1) of these regulations. Two or more concerns that form an ongoing relationship to conduct business would not be considered ``joint venturers'' within the meaning of this paragraph, and would also not be eligible as an entity owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. (2) A concern that is owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals entering into a joint venture agreement with one or more other business concerns is considered to be affiliated for size purposes with such other concern(s). The combined annual receipts or employees of the concerns entering into the joint venture must meet the applicable size standard corresponding to the SIC code designated for the contract. (3) The majority of the venture's earnings must accrue directly to the socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the SDB concern(s) in the joint venture. (4) The percentage ownership involvement in a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals must be at least 51 percent. Example 1. Small business concern A is 100% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern B is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged individuals. The percentage involvement by concern A in a joint venture between A and B must be at least 51%. Example 2. Small business concern C is 51% owned by disadvantaged individuals. Small business concern D is 100% owned by nondisadvantaged individuals. Any joint venture between C and D would be ineligible because the amount of ownership involvement in such a joint venture by disadvantaged individuals would be less than 51%. Even a 90% involvement by concern C in a joint venture with D would mean an overall ownership involvement by disadvantaged individuals of only 45.9% (51% of 90), and an overall ownership involvement by nondisadvantaged individuals of 54.1% (10 + (49% of 90)). 49. Section 124.501 would be amended by redesignating paragraph (c) as paragraph (d) and by adding the following new paragraph (c): §124.501 Miscellaneous reporting requirements. * * * * * (c) Submission of financial statements. (1) Program Participant with actual gross annual receipts of $5,000,000 or more must submit to SBA audited annual financial statements prepared by a licensed independent public accountant (as defined in part 107, Appendix I, ¶II. B) within 120 days after the close of the concern's fiscal year. (i) Upon request by the Program Participant, SBA may waive the requirement for audited financial statements. Waivers under this paragraph may be granted by the appropriate District Director only for the first year the audited financial statements are required. Beyond such first year, only the AA/MSB&COD may waive this requirement for good cause shown by the Program Participant.
