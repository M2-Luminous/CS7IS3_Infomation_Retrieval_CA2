The faction demanded canceling of the agreement on issues concerning social protection of retired Russian militaries and their families, initialed by the Latvian delegation at Latvian-Russian intergovernmental talks. The opposition faction claims that the agreement would pave the way for retired Russian militaries to stay and keep living here safely, as it was earlier demanded by the union of war veterans' rights protection. The Presidium of the Saeima [parliament] on Tuesday [5 April] decided to include the debates on the appeal of the opposition faction into the agenda of an extraordinary session of the parliament due to be held next Friday.
