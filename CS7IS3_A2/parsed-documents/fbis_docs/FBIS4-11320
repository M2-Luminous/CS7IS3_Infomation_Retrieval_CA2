Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, reaffirmed the local government's willingness to continue working toward the normalization of its relations with the emigrant community, despite, he stressed, the rivalry that has existed between Havana and Washington for the last 35 years. Balaguer led the closing session of the conference, which began on 22 April in the capital city's convention center. The conference was attended by 215 Cubans currently living in 29 countries around the world who responded to an invitation from the Cuban Foreign Ministry. The meeting was private. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced yesterday several agreements as the preliminary results of the conference. Vice President Carlos Lage today announced that there is now a better understanding, between Cubans living both on and off the island. According to Miguel Alfonso, spokesperson for the conference, the five-year waiting perod required of Cubans who left the island legally in order to be allowed to visit the country was eliminated. It will no longer be mandatory for emigres visiting their relatives in Cuba to make reservations at a hotel, either. Other changes will allow Cubans and their children living abroad to study on the island if they pay the established tuition and fees. The study will look into the possibility of publishing a magazine directed at Cuban emigres. The emigrants also proposed the creation of an emigrant visa and a more expeditious procedure for traveling to their country of origin for humanitarian reasons. From now on the Foreign Relations Ministry will have the new task of coordinating the work of all Cuban institutions regarding emigration in order to ensure a systematic, efficient, and harmonious process. In addition, Lage confirmed that the emigrants will not be excluded from investing in the island, although he said the specific details and types of investment will be discussed at future meetings. In addressing the plenum, the vice president of the Cuban Council of State said that, in general, foreign investment regulations will be applied in such cases as established by current legislation.
