Especially visitors from the Caucasus. The Moscow militia is frequently accused of purposeful persecution of "persons of Caucasus origin," while rumor has it that the capital city authorities encourage these unlawful actions. Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov does care about the reputation of his city and the city authorities. Therefore he decided to visit the Republic of Dagestan in order to discuss at the point of origin the problem of relations between Muscovites and Caucasus natives. After the trip, Yuriy Mikhaylovich shared his impressions with a OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent. [Luzhkov] When you have a problem, the best way is to go and study it "at the source." In the beginning of March four Dagestanis died in shoot outs here in Moscow. Some figures in Dagestan began to distort the causes of these people's deaths; a version began to circulate that they had died as a result of negligence on the part of authorities, and that in general Caucasus natives are treated badly in the capital city. When I talked in Moscow with republic Supreme Soviet Chairman Magamedov and Ramazan Abdulatipov, they said that people need objective first-hand information. Then I decided to make a trip there and explain to Dagestanis what the situation in Moscow is, how we feel about citizens of this republic, whom we welcome, and whom we do not. You may say that my visit was a complete success. We visited cities and villages; I gave an interview on television, in which I said that the main cause of crime is the dire economic state of the republic. They have to deal with the unemployment problem, use all production and natural resources to get rid of this trouble--mass unemployment. Because many people from the Caucasus go to Moscow and St. Petersburg and join criminal groups because of poor conditions at home. People kept asking me about registration of persons of "Caucasus origin" in Moscow. I said: Dagestan is part of Russia; none of our decrees say anything about registering citizens of Russia, so this question is misdirected. Yes, we require that Chechens be registered, because Chechnya proclaimed itself an independent state. So let them register. As to what "a person of Caucasus origin" is, I do not know. I know the Caucasus; I know numerous nations that live in the Caucasus; they are all very different, very original, and you cannot measure them all with the same yardstick--this is absurd and illiterate. In my opinion, crime does not have a nationality. If 50 percent of the crimes in Moscow are committed by Russians, what do Dagestanis have to do with it? If 10 percent of the crimes are committed by Ukrainians, again, what do Dagestanis have to do with it? We do not divide crime by ethnic attributes. Speaking of the situation in Moscow, the problem of interethnic relations has been resolved. I do not want to brag, but I can say that Moscow remains a city of ethnic diversity, where people live together peacefully, and we do not have serious ethnic conflicts. We are currently opening Korean, Georgian, Armenian, and Tatar schools in Moscow--to make things easier and more comfortable for people of other nationalities who live permanently in Moscow, so that they will not abandon their culture, their language. This is very important. Together with me on the visit to Dagestan was Yuriy Tomashev, first deputy chief of the city administration of internal affairs [GUVD]; he brought additional information and handed it over to Dagestani internal affairs organs and leadership. And this problem got special emphasis in our joint protocol. We agreed that it is necessary to keep each other informed on the state of suppression of crime. Also that a representative of the Dagestani Ministry of Internal Affairs will be assigned either permanently or on an as-needed basis to work in the GUVD with members of the capital city militia. So now we will fight crime together, regardless of personalities and nationalities.
