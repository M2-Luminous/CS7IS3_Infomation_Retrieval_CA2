He believes that the Russian-U.S. summit is of vital importance for the future world situation and character of Russian-U.S. relations. Bessmertnykh believes that the Moscow dialogue should pass on equal terms. Bill Clinton will have to give up the temptation to act not only as the leader of the United States, but as one of the only superpowers whose mission is to rule the world. This approach will not work in Russia because in this country American aspirations for world leadership are not recognized as natural, he said. Bessmertnykh is sure that it is beneficial strategically for the United States to look at Russia as a strong and prosperous state. Clinton is a leader of the new generation, he said. He is able to see the great advantage in U.S. friendship with a strong Russia rather than with a weakened giant spreading disintegration and instability throughout the world. Bessmertnykh believes that Russia should be satisfied in its relations with the United States with the level of partnership. The desire to reach the rank of a U.S. ally is inexplicable, he said. "Why hurry if the willingness is not shared by the other side?" said Bessmertnykh. He emphasized that Russia, as the successor of the former Soviet Union, remains a world power with a broad range of interests which should be respected by the rest of the world. Without the understanding of this on the part of the United States, it would be hard to lay a firm foundation under the Russian-U.S. relations, which in this case will be destined to fluctuate, he said. Unless the two sides reach understanding in this respect, any efforts by Russia within the Commonwealth of Independent States and outside will continue to be interpreted as the manifestation of Russian "imperialism." The most delicate solutions - for example, NATO-extended membership to include the countries of Eastern and Central Europe - will depend on the result of the talks on this subject, said Bessmertnykh.
