However, I refuse to take part in any ideological debates or folkloric manifestations. I will focus on certain issues of major importance, and I believe I will disclose some new information, because it happens that people sometimes jump to wrong conclusions due to a lack of accurate information. Conducting foreign policy is governed by highly complex and multifaceted rules imposed by moral and ethical values and dilemmas, as well as by the necessity of reaching short- and long-term objectives with precisely defined and limited means, by outside rules, and the imperative of the times. What is the basic objective of Croatia's foreign policy, its state policy? A modern, European, democratic Croatian state with respect for human rights, minority rights, and the rights of ethnic communities; a state that guarantees the highest European standards. A state ready to accept international supervision by the Council of Europe or the CSCE. What are its strategic guidelines? First and foremost, the reintegration of the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] into the state and legal system of Croatia -- this is the first strategic guideline. Then comes the resolution of the crisis, the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and the establishment of a just peace. There is the regulation of all disputed issues with our neighbors and joining European integrational processes -- an agreement on associate membership in the European Union [EU], the joining of all European projects -- and, last but certainly not least, global and regional security mechanisms. This includes regional security mechanisms that we have already proposed to the CSCE and, of course, Partnership for Peace -- NATO's latest proposal; an extremely important proposal, especially for the future. Most dilemmas and questions, a joint declaration -- yes or no [as received] -- concerned this first strategic guideline. The only real difference in fact lies in expectation. There are no other differences. I have not heard that anyone is satisfied with the present situation. We all agree about this. Of 295,000 Croats and non-Serb people in UNPAs and Pink Zones, almost all have been expelled. Except a few thousand elderly people. Ethnic cleansing is almost complete. There are still 7,800 people either missing or forcibly taken away. Respect for human rights is zero and practically beyond the control of the Croatian authorities. We have an excellent resolution of the UN Security Council -- 871 -- but it is certain that no fundamental and definite progress can be expected from the present UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] mandate. I have also not heard many people say they were in favor of war. There are some deputies, however, who have taken this stand consistently. This is, of course, their right. I need to warn at this moment that this option would not only cause victims -- and the generals are much better placed to speak about this -- but also total and immediate isolation. Not just sanctions, but also total isolation. This is not guesswork, we were told this directly. What is the third option? Only this, brave and full of challenge [as heard]. The last thing that can be said of us is that we are naive. It is naive to expect that Milosevic will come to Zagreb and say that he is abandoning his policy. However, both the internal and external situation has made him willing to talk. The joint statement means only the first step, but the step that crosses the Rubicon. How far-reaching it is -- time and results will tell. We are not compromising our fundamental objectives: to reintegrate the UNPA zones, enable the return of refugees, and, prior to that, achieve an overall cease-fire and establish traffic links, all this in a consistent process. This will, of course, be our guiding light in the process of normalizing relations. At the first meeting we agreed to form a joint commission for missing persons. I believe this is a step forward. Opening missions means, in any case, establishing good communication channels without drawing any premature conclusions on any other issues. Questions have been raised, I think by Mr. Kovacevic, about why Croatia was not immediately referred to in its borders, as in Security Council Resolution 871. Of course, this is exactly what we demanded. But, since Milosevic was not willing to agree to that, we did not establish relations on the level of ambassadors but on the level of representative offices, refraining from making any premature judgement. The other question was the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the establishment of peace. The second strategic objective of Croatian foreign policy is to reach a lasting resolution of Croatian-Muslim relations -- for political, economic, and strategic reasons. All our friends are giving us advice to this effect. Obviously, the first short-term objective is to halt all confrontation. It is neccessary to say something about the dynamism here. I will not go too far back into the past, only to the beginning of the war or the Serb aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina. We proposed two things, and they were even agreed on during the talks before the referendum [on the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina]: We proposed a united but decentralized Bosnia-Herzegovina and a military alliance. This was not accepted. On 12 July [1992] only the possibility of cooperation in border areas was accepted and it was on the basis of this agreement that certain, very limited, forces [of the Republic of Croatia] were brought to defend the Dubrovnik hinterland. The Vance-Owen plan was accepted in the same spirit. But after six weeks of procrastination by the Bosnian-Muslim side it was rejected by the Serb side. Everything else is well known. This was at the time when the United States was ready for military intervention. They did not get the support of the European Community and the Russian Federation. After that, the European Community proposal was discussed. The basic proposal was a union of three republics. What happened then? A joint declaration was signed by Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic on 14 September, as well as an additional agreement which envisaged a lasting solution for Croatian-Muslim relations. This agreement was not implemented, but certainly not through the fault of Croatia's state policy. President Tudjman's proposal tabled at Petersberg in Bonn was primarily designed to halt the war and establish a lasting peace. It offered options for achieving this. The first option was a union of the three republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the talks that we have held, and I have witnessed all the events in the last two months, the main contentious issues were central Bosnia, Mostar, access to the sea, and, of course, the hydroelectric system. Little was achieved with the first contentious issue, central Bosnia, for what was being proposed was practically for the Croat Defence Council [HVO] to withdraw from Vitez and Busovaca. And that is where things remained. Some progress had been achieved on the issue of the outlet to the sea and on the primarily industrial Mostar and the hydro-energetic system. Proposals were made for an immediate ceasefire and separation, military separation. It was proposed that forces of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croat Defence Council should exclusively face Serb positions. This proposal was not accepted. What happened then? As you can see, the rejection of the European Union's concept -- which had previously been accepted -- accusations about the Croatian Army's presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina are grave. 30,000 troops and 20,000 to be deployed additionally. We informed the UN Security Council in our letter that there were 1,500 to 2,000 volunteers -- some of them former Croatian Army officers and soldiers demobilized in Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is a realistic number. The chief of the Croatian Army General Staff, General Bobetko, is the best person to ask. However, it is certain that the number is much higher -- figures vary from 3,000 to 6,000 and even 8,000. It is hard to tell -- but there are definitely more volunteers from the Islamic countries. There are curently at least five different approaches to the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem: The European Union continues to stick to its proposal and wishes to exert pressure on all three sides; the United States differs in the sense that it does not wish to apply too much pressure on the Muslim side, they have said so publicly; the Russian Federation opposes any kind of military intervention; the Islamic countries advocating a single Bosnia-Herzegovina; and of course we must take into account what the other moral authorities in the world are saying, that the most important thing at this moment is to bring an end to the conflict and the suffering. Our offer to the Muslim side is still open and we are prepared to talk immediately and anywhere about any rational proposal. The first thing is the end of these clashes, but without any preconditions. As far as Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina are concerned, it is well-known that about 200,000 to 210,000 have been expelled as a result of a Serb offensive and about 100,000 to 110,000 in central Bosnia as a result of a Muslim offensive -- this means about 320,000. One has to be sensitive to disquiet, and the interests in certain regions must be different. One must not put special emphasis on the differences but instead insist on unity. As far as strategy, final strategy is concerned, in any case a cease-fire and the resumption of talks... [pauses] We have not moved forward from the EU proposal, no one from among the other international factors has any other concrete proposals. Talks are being conducted in Washington at present between the United States, France, Germany, and England. Russians are included in the talks. We shall see whether any concrete proposals will emerge. But as far as the cease-fire is concerned, there must be no dilemma -- it is most important that agreement on the cease-fire be reached immediately. As for the regulation of relations with our neighbors -- Slovenia -- most problems have stemmed from the break-up of former Yugoslavia. We hope that almost seven agreements, including a solution in principle for Krsko [nuclear plant], will be achieved by Monday, that we shall continue to work on the property and legal solutions and on a solution to the Ljubljana bank and resolve all these problems in a month or so. We also hope that intensive work will be carried out with the aim of defining the borders. A joint commission will meet for the first time on 15th February in Bled. We also discussed Piran Bay. Our proposal for the demaraction line is well-known, but there were a number of very (?useful) suggestions regarding joint use which were welcome. As far as Italy is concerned, I will go there tomorrow to meet Italian Foreign Minister Andretta, and I expect to be received by the Holy Father and Cardinal [name indistinct]. I will have an opportunity to convey President Tudjman's personal message to the Holy Father. It is certain that the situation regarding the deaths of the three journalists in Mostar has made my visit more difficult, especially as far as the Italian public is concerned, because in the past two months Minister Andreatta had adopted very constructive stands during the last meetings in Geneva and Brussels. Our aim is, naturally, to discuss all open questions and there is no doubt that Italy is not just one of the most important economic partners, but also an economic power. Italy has considerable influence within the EU and the settlement of all questions with Italy is one of our priority goals. President Tudjman will visit Romania this month and Albania at the end of this month. As for European integration processes, the Council of Europe [word indistinct] with the EU are above all blocked because of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the main reason. We are cooperating closely. Over 70 different missions of the Council of Europe visited Croatia and our parliamentary delegation was very active and successful in the work [of Council of Europe] for which it was comended. I was present. However, the present situation -- not to pursue the next step, which means the arrival of reporters in Croatia -- is linked exclusively with the situation in and the settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina [as heard]. Of course there are other objections, which is natural for a country developing its democratic system, but they are no longer that important. As far as regional and global security mechanisms are concerned our proposal was accepted and it will be further discussed within the framework of the CSCE. All countries expected to become part of this should adhere to this regional security mechanism. This would be of great advantage for the Republic of Croatia because -- if Serbia and Montenegro, the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], would like to be part of this system -- they would have to reduce their military troops and equipment to the level determined by the regional security mechanism and additionally meet all other conditions in line with the democratic institutions of the system. Croatia welcomed the Partnership for Peace initiative. We are preparing a report we shall send to NATO. But this is, of course, a long-term project and the issue of borders should be resolved beforehand. We must also answer a number of other questions raised by Mr. Pejnovic. Legitimate Serbs were elected to the Croatian Assembly and Resolution 871 envisages that we should have talks with the local Serbs. As for the benefit of the talks with all international factors I agree with you that it is necessary to [word indistinct]. I will answer Paraga's question with a few words, it will be exclusively facts, nothing else. There are 261 persons in all of our diplomatic and consular offices. There are 36 embassies, five missions, and eight general consulates or consulates with an average of 5.3 percent of employed [as heard]. I can also tell you that Hungary has 90, Slovakia 79, Denmark 800 employed. Austria 800, Switzerland 2,000. [previous two sentences as heard] In no way have we exaggerated. The average income is 2,000, or in the case of a vice-consul 2,500 deutsche marks [DM]. A German consul earns about 9,000 DM. An ambassador earns about 5,100 DM. Anyone can get all the information if they want to. As far as quality is concerned, we have some fortunate solutions, some less fortunate and few unfortunate solutions but as far as expert financial control it is total and this refers to all embassies. It is necessary to say a few words about the present situation in conclusion. The pressure over Bosnia-Herzegovina in the past 48 hours has been immense. This concerns the presence of the Croatian Army in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, this is part of the strategic plan of applying pressure on the Republic of Croatia. Things might become even worse -- the Security Council will be in session on Friday [4th February], there might be a presidential statement to this effect, as well as a statement issued by the Council of Europe whose meeting on 7 and 8 February will be devoted to the same subject. This is the agreed form of pressure -- everybody agrees in this respect. It is certain at this moment that we all have to persevere in our adherence to some basic guidelines. I believe that we all agree that a ceasefire and the search for a lasting solution with the Muslims is the first of the strategic objectives, while the other strategic objective is to find a peaceful resolution, through negotiations -- but bearing in mind our fundamental national interests -- with the Serb side. Thank you.
