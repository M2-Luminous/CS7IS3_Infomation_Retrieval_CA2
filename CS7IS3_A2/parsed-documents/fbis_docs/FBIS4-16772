Yeltsin is in splendid physical shape and has a firm grip on the helm of state. All these factors naturally affect the domestic political situation in Russia. It is rather hard to recall another occasion when the Russian parliament has worked as calmly and constructively as during the past week. Yet the week was packed with events every one of which, judging by past experience, could have turned the supreme legislative body into a furious political debating society. However, as we have seen, the Duma adopted a very well-considered decree in connection with the bombing of Serbian targets in Bosnia by NATO aircraft, quite reasonably left it to the president to resolve the problem of the recent Black Sea Fleet incidents (which did much to promote the attainment of encouraging accords), and, last, for the first time in the three-year history of Russia's existence as an autonomous state, began intelligently, in close contact with the government, to discuss the draft state budget. There was an impression that even the "intransigent opposition" was affected by the general mood and moderated its ardor to a significant degree -- the NSF [National Salvation Front] leaders declared that they will refrain from holding May Day demonstrations, while "Working Russia" leader V. Anpilov promised to do everything to ensure that the May Day march by his supporters is exclusively peaceful, announcing that to this end he is even prepared to enter into contact with the authorities. A familiar phenomenon was demonstrated yet again in the past week: As soon as the president becomes active and energetic, the country enters a period of relative political stability and political groupings converge from the extreme flanks toward the center. And, every time, this notional center becomes more attractive to an increasingly wide range of politicians. On the one hand, Ye. Gaydar declares the need to create a socially oriented market economy, and on the other, I. Rybkin, former leader of the "Communists of Russia" faction and chairman of the State Duma, talks frankly of his social democratic sympathies in a TV interview. The program documents of the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] and the Agrarian Party recognize private ownership and market relations. The conclusion that springs to mind is that we are today observing the formation of a broad social democratic movement in Russia, of which the former communist nomenklatura could form the basis. One of the main factors that sharply accelerated the pragmatist communists' progress toward social democracy was October 1993. After this, the classical Leninist plan to seize power had suffered a crushing defeat and a line was thereby finally drawn under a stage of the political struggle in which the objective was to seize absolute power, or rather to restore that power to the former nomenklatura. During the period of reforms a large part of the nomenklatura has adapted quite well to the new economic conditions, not only becoming reconciled to the market, but becoming part of it, since its primary aim had always been the pursuit of its own personal goals. The nomenklatura associated with state ownership gained particularly by the transition to the market. As a result the communist nomenklatura has become a part of the Russian establishment, and recent trips by I. Rybkin to the United States and by G. Zyuganov to France and the United States showed that it has quite high hopes of becoming part of the international establishment too. All that remained, basically, was to change the labels a little. Today's criticism of the actions of the president and government by the CPRF and the Agrarian Party, as can be seen from the Duma debates, is not directed toward institutional postulates of any kind, but deals only with the means and methods of overcoming the economic crisis. Which proves that the parliamentary communists are abandoning revolutionary methods of struggle not just in words, but in deed. The active participation of today's "legal Marxists" in the December elections and their official dissociation from nonparliamentary forms of the struggle mark, basically, the renunciation of Leninism and the beginning of the transformation of the communist party into a party of the parliamentary, social democratic type. The choice is rather brutal -- either go underground, or become a respectable party. Another important factor in the transformation of the communists that can now be observed is their relative victory in the December elections and the relative defeat of the supporters of liberalism. It turns out that power can easily be obtained by legal, civilized means. In general the changes taking place on the Russian political scene indicate that the country is embarking increasingly surely on the path of market transformations. Taking the objective view, social democracy for Russia is a great step forward -- toward the market, and that means toward liberalism. At the same time it would obviously be a mistake to be deluded by the fact that today it seems that virtually the entire nomenklatura and a vast number of political parties and movements are raising the banners of social democracy. The nomenklatura, as has been said before, is pragmatic and hence apolitical, and will raise whatever banners it needs, depending on contingencies. The anticipated start of a period of bankruptcies and increasing unemployment creates the preconditions for another surge of politicians away from the center and toward the extreme flanks. Thus it would be premature to assume that with the strengthening of social democratic trends in Russian domestic policy a period of stability has set in. An apparently more accurate thesis is that the current political season in Russia is an interim stage in the progress from the ideology of liberalism to social democracy. The socioeconomic base of social democracy is only just being formed. It must be founded first and foremost on those sectors of the economy that can realistically exist in market conditions. Primarily joint-stock and privatized enterprises. The regional nomenklatura also fits in here, having already succeeded in converting power into ownership. The bulwark of social democracy is the property owners. How durable and broad it is able to become, depends on the speed of Russia's emergence from the economic crisis.
