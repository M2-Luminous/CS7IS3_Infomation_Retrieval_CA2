Initiated in 1991, the program is aimed at improving soil, and building water conservancy and irrigation facilities. The 314 million yuan (about 36 million U.S. dollars) involved comes partly from loans offered by the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Now the per-capita income of farmers in the five poverty-stricken counties has increased by 70 yuan (about eight U.S. dollars) a year. Three more foreign-aided projects are under way in the province, focusing on water and soil preservation. One is financed by the World Bank, another by the World Food Program, and the third by Japan.
