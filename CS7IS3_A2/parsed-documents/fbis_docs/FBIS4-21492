The government will send a fact-finding team composed of working-level officials to China on 7 March to survey the possibility of implementing the projects by area. Based on the results of the survey, Prime Minister Hosokawa will notify the Chinese side of Japan's basic plan for the fourth yen-based loan when he visits China on 19 March. As for the size of the fourth yen-based loan which has become a focal point, the prime minister will not present the Chinese side with the size because of a delay in China's formal request for the loan. The two countries are expected to continue coordination of their views on the size for an accord within this year. The fact-finding team, which will leave Japan on 7 March, is made up of officials from the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Economic Planning Agency, and other officials from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF). It will examine the feasibility of about 70 projects presented unofficially by China from the standpoint of providing the fourth yen-based loan to China as a "symbolic loan" to finance the projects for Japan-China cooperation," (according to Foreign Minister Hata). For the project for tackling environmental problems, a centerpiece of the fourth yen-based loan, the government is likely to incorporate aid for measures to tackle acid rain that would "eventually benefit" Japan. Taking seriously a conspicuous delay in China's measures to deal with pollution resulting from that country's rapid industrialization, the government plans to provide China with Japan's advanced desulfurization facilities in the fourth yen-based loan that serve to prevent air and water pollution. Japan and China are presently studying the possibility of reviewing China's reform and open up policy that places its priority on production-related facilities and the development of coastal regions and of providing preferentially funds for industrial development in inland regions. China has asked for Japan's cooperation for construction of a Beijing-Shanghai bullet train line and the fact-finding team will examine the demand for inter-city traffic. The government plans to continue Japan's aid in the fourth yen-based loan for priority projects for construction of water supply facilities and sewages which were implemented under the first, second, and third yen-based loans to China to help it improve people's livelihood. The Japanese Government explains that Prime Minister Hosokawa will present the Chinese side with Japan's basic plan for the fourth yen-based loan, but will not present it with the size of the loan because China has yet to make a formal request for the loan following a delay in its domestic procedures and the failure of working-level Japanese and Chinese officials to finalize details of the loan. Japan started providing China with 330.9 billion yen in the first yen-based loan for 1979-1984 and expanded to 800 billion yen in the third yen-based loan for 1990-1995. It has been decided that duration of the fourth yen-based loan will be shortened to three years out of concern over expansion of China's military buildup.
