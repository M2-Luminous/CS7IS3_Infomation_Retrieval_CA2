Spokesman Kyd said that North Korea is building its second nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The 50 megawatt nuclear reactor is scheduled for completion by the end of this year. He said that North Korea is currently building a third nuclear reactor in Taechon, which is even more secluded than Yongbyon, and that the 200 megawatt reactor will begin operations early in 1996. He pointed out, however, that the practical issue regarding North Korea's plan for nuclear development is how North Korea dealt with the nuclear fuel it extracted from the small five megawatt nuclear reactor which has been in operation since 1987.
