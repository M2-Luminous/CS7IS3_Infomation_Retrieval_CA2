Canadian Ambassador Mark Entwistle made the announcement, indicating that "drug consumption is an international problem that can only be solved through international action and coordination." The diplomat said that on Sunday, 26 June, the international day against drug consumption will be commemorated. He emphasized that his country's sponsorship of the training program shows Canada's commitment to the war against drug trafficking. According to a note obtained by PRENSA LATINA, the counternarcotics agencies of 17 other Latin American and Asian nations have also been invited to participate in the course, which will be held in the Atlantic Province of New Brunswick during two weeks in August. The invitation was made three days after Christine Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and Africa, ended a working visit to the island. Her visit was described as highly constructive by both sides. Precisely on Monday, Ottawa resumed official economic aid to Cuba, in line with the plans of the government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien to maintain a foreign policy that is more independent of the United States and with greater rapprochement toward Latin America. According to the training schedule, in the first week there will be classes and workshops on the counternarcotics methods and procedures used in Canada and in the following week, the participants will visit specialized counternarcotics units in several Canadian locations.
