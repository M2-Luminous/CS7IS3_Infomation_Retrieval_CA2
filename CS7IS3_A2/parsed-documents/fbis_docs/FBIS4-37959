This large-scale attack on Aden took place a few hours after Sanaa made the sixth false cease-fire declaration and was accompanied by fierce rocket, artillery, and air bombardment against residential areas and vital economic installations in Aden. Yesterday's bombardment, which extended to schools, mosques, and kindergartens, left at least 75 civilians dead, most of them children and women, and over 150 others wounded. The ADEN NEWS AGENCY said the armed forces defending Aden repulsed the attack and inflicted heavy losses on the forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa. But this regime cares about nothing. It does not care about the losses its forces are suffering daily. It does not care about the hundreds, even thousands, of innocent civilian victims who fall as a result of its forces' indiscriminate shelling of Aden. It does not care about the appeals made by the local, Arab, and international public and the resolutions, appeals, and warnings of international legitimacy and the leaders of the fraternal and friendly countries, including the latest strong warning to the Sanaa regime by the U.S. State Department.
