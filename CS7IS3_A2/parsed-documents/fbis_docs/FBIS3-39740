The Serbs, who have been besieging the town, inflicting thousands of deaths and terrible suffering for the people, have withdrawn most of their heavy weapons, guns, mortars, and tanks, within a radius of 20 km. The weapons that have not been withdrawn are now grouped under the control of UN Forces. The first condition was met within the allotted time. The North Atlantic Council set the deadline on 9 February at the request of France and the United States, and it was meant for both the Serbs and the Bosnian Government. Last night, I invited the prime minister, the ministers of defense and foreign affairs, as well as the chief of staff, to the Elysee in order to take stock of the situation. From the Elysee I called General Cot, who is commanding the UN Protection Forces on the ground in the former Yugoslavia. He told us that the withdrawal of Serb weapons was accelerating. I then called Washington, where President Clinton, who had just talked with Mr. Yeltsin, confirmed the information given by General Cot. We agreed that if events unfold as they are expected to until the deadline [as heard], it will not be necessary to use our military means. Since the information we received from our own services confirmed this, air strikes did not take place. The withdrawal of heavy weapons was obtained thanks to the determination of the allies and the moderating intervention of the Russians with the Serbs. Need I emphasize the role played by France, which from the beginning originated all of the initiatives aimed at settling the conflict, and which has given the United Nations the largest contingent of peace soldiers? We need only look at the most recent events. May I remind you that it was in the wake of the talks that took place 15 days ago between Mr. Juppe and American Secretary of State Christopher, that it was possible to find an outcome. However, much remains to be done. It is necessary to consolidate the lifting of the siege in Sarajevo. The cease-fire has been heeded so far, but freedom of movement for people and humanitarian convoys has not yet been restored. People are still living in fear. It is clear that any violation of the decisions of the Atlantic Alliance will be....[pauses] would be punished tomorrow as we had intended to do today. I hope that the most will be made of the time we have saved and of this first success of reason over so many murderous passions, in order to extend allied pressure to the other Bosnian towns, to the other zones of this country where violence is rife. We will thus give a new impetus to the search for a political settlement, for there can only be a negotiated solution. Consultations will take place within the next few days. As early as this week France will appeal to the Security Council and ask its members to put Sarajevo under UN administration. We shall not slacken our efforts. The minister of defense and and the minister of foreign affairs are following the development of events--under the authority of the prime minister--just as I am, hour by hour. I presided over a restricted meeting this afternoon, as I did yesterday. The same will happen over the next few days, and, if some among you listening to me are wondering, I will tell you: What is happening in the Balkans affects us, it affects France. Beyond the human solidarity demanded by the scope of this tragedy, yes, this affects us, as other things did in the past. Similar conflicts can flare up at any time. Born from the dislocation of the Soviet Union and from the solution which will prevail in Bosnia, many things will happen. I am about to conclude, my dear compatriots. Let us think of the 18 French soldiers killed, of the 281 injured in that part of the world, and let us appreciate together the value of their sacrifice for the sake of peace. Long live the republic, long live France.
