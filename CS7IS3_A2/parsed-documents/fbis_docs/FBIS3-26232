Trading was heavy today, with 33.63 million U.S. dollars changing hands. The amount of dollars traded in the center totaled 467 million dollars in January, averaging 22.24 million dollars on each trading day -- up 39 percent over the same month in 1993. Analysts agreed that the renminbi has been stable and trading has been brisk since exchange rates were unified at the beginning of this year. Altogether, the Shanghai swap center had 21 trading days in January, with the yuan slipping gradually downward from the first trading day on January 3, they noted. The yuan hit bottom at 8.6930 against the dollar, but stood there for just one day before picking up to 8.6970, which lasted for 14 trading days. The yuan dipped again to 8.6960 in the last two trading days of January, they said. Overall, the weighted average of renminbi fluctuated in a narrow range of 0.0059 yuan for the whole month. According to analysts, the slight fluctuation indicates that the 8.7000 exchange rate of the yuan against the greenback is a price acceptable to both buyers and sellers. Practice shows that the reform of China's foreign exchange system has been successful since the beginning of the year, to the welcome of both Chinese and foreign traders, one analyst noted. In contrast, he recalled, the yuan stood at 7.7060 against the dollar on the first trading day of January 1993 and peaked at 8.3580. Moreover, the weighted average of the Chinese currency fluctuated across a broad range of 0.5768 yuan in January 1993. At that time, the yuan exchange rate registered steep ups and downs, while trading was moderate, with an average of 15.95 million dollars changing hands on each trading day, analysts said. In the new year, trading peaked at 34.95 million dollars on January 27, as against 25.62 million dollars in January 1993, they said. However, they also warned against over-optimism, saying that it is still necessary to improve management and step up macro-economic controls in order to prevent the renminbi exchange rate from suffering sharp ups and downs. Now, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Swap Center has brokers representing 21 Chinese financial institutions and 22 foreign institutions. In all, the center reported trading amounting to 5.29 billion dollars for all of 1993, up 49 percent over the previous year.
