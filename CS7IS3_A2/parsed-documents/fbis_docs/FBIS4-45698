Professor Ruberti pointed out that, "This institute is a key element in the mechanism for studying and following up scientific and technological evolution and evaluating the research policy choices which the Commission is in the process of making. A collaboration agreement between the Institute (which will be built in the Cartuja Technological Park) and the University of Seville has also been signed; and a European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) will be set up. The Prospective Institute is one of the CCR's eight institutes, each specialising in a particular area (environment, tele-detection, advanced materials, etc.) carrying out part of their activities in the framework of the specific programmes of the Community R and D framework programme. The Prospective Institute will work closely with bodies specialising in prospective study and technological observation which are members of the ETAN network that is part of the future programme of socio-economic research proposed under the 4th framework programme 1994/99. In the coming years, it will set up a European observatory for science and technology (OEST) which will work with similar national and European bodies to collect, process and disseminate information on R and D policies in the industrialised countries and their evolution. A system of technological observation will also be developed to detect new scientific break-throughs and technological innovations at an early stage and to alert persons in charge of such areas of the existence of these new developments.
