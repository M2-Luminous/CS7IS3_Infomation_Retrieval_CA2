In this respect our "politicized" compatriots surpassed even the traditionally politically inert regions of the Russian hinterland. Barely one-fifth of the registered voters of St. Petersburg went to the precincts to vote the day before yesterday. Yet, according to the statute on elections to the City Assembly of St. Petersburg, they can be considered to have taken place only if 25 percent of the potential voters (plus one person) have participated in them. Sunday evening, when it became clear that the necessary quorum of voters would not appear, the city's mayor, A.S. Sobchak, issued an urgent directive "On Changing the Procedure for Voting in Elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly." "Taking into account the appeal of the Central Electoral Commission, the sociopolitical blocs, the parties, and associations," it says in this document, "the time period for voting in elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly shall be extended, the operation of the electoral commissions being resumed on 21 March 1994 from 0800 through 2200." According to this same directive, the right to participate in the voting has been granted to citizens who went to school or served on active military duty in St. Petersburg. Thus the city voted yesterday for the second day in a row and today we will find out whether, as a result of this unprecedented measure, it succeeded in passing the 25 percent mark for voter turnout. Incidentally, even if this happens, most likely the subject of whether or not the elections to the City Assembly of St. Petersburg really took place will be discussed for a long time to come at the most diverse echelons, including the Central Electoral Commission and the courts. Because no matter what you say, a change in the voting procedure during the course of the voting itself is, we repeat, something unprecedented. And, naturally, even yesterday this and also other details of the election were at the center of the attention of the public and the voter associations of the city.
