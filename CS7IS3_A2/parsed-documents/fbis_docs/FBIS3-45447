Information from the Tianjin Municipal Committee of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation reveals that in 1993 alone, the municipality approved the establishment of 3,538 foreign-funded projects, involving an agreed use of 2.256 billion U.S. dollars, both figures representing big increases compared with corresponding figures of the previous year. According to local officials, more than half of the foreign-funded projects approved for establishment are located in the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, the bonded area of Tianjin Port, and the Tianjin Industrial Development Zone of New Technology. A total of 1.18 billion U.S. dollars of the promised foreign investment went for the service trade. To draw more overseas investors, local governments at various levels of the municipality worked hard in the past year to provide quality services, simplified approval procedures, and sponsored investment promotion events of various kinds, said the officials. Thirteen well-known international consortia and transnational companies decided to invest money and expand their businesses in this north China port city last year, and 30 other international consortia and transnational firms continue to send personnel to investigate the actual situation of Tianjin in preparation for future investment, the officials disclosed. So far, 1,100 foreign-funded enterprises in Tianjin have begun official operation or have started economic activities. Last year, operational foreign-funded firms were reported to have completed 14 billion yuan in output value, making up 27.8 percent of the municipality's total, and created 3.11 billion yuan in profits and taxes.
