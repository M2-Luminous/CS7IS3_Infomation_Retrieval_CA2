Estimating the patrol consisted of around three soldiers from the Reconnaissance Battalion of the Second North Korean Army Corps, they said a rust-covered M-16 rifle and ammunition indicate the weapons had been there for one or two years. The North Koreans probably disguised themselves as South Korean Army soldiers and tried to cross the river to observe construction of a freeway along its southern bank, which was completed more than a year ago, they observed. The weapons, including a .66-caliber Soviet pistol with 17 North Korean-made ammunition rounds, German binoculars, an M-16 rifle with 213 rounds and two hand grenades, were found by Yi Hui-un, 35, of Munsan, Paju-gun, Kyonggi Province, and two friends along the river at 8:00 A.M. Sunday.
