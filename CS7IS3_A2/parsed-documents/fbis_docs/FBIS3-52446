Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said this rank is not just another insignia on the shoulder, but calls for additional work and responsibility and for the use of all possible qualifications in order to see the present and envision the future so as to supply answers to fast-changing problems. Maj. Gen. Mofaz is in charge of a most sensitive region, the prime minister stressed, and his job calls for a variety of qualifications, not just military ones. Our military affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe points out that Maj. Gen. Mofaz will soon also be assigned to a senior job in the IDF's field command.
