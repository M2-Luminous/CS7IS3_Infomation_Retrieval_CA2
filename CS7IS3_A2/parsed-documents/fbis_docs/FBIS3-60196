This amendment will allow the courts to confiscate all land and property of drug smugglers who are sentenced to more than two years in jail. The Pakistan People's Party government has started to take action to rid the society of the cures of narcotics, and has decided to amend the law in order to confiscate property belonging to drug smugglers. This is a very good step, however, the big fish manage to avoid being caught in the present system. They free themselves with the help of the police. The ordinary peddlers and the dealers are arrested. The system should be overhauled so that the real criminals are caught and given exemplary punishment.
