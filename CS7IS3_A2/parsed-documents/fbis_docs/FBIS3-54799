Today is marked as the day of solidarity with Azerbaijani people around the world. On this symbolic day, I congratulate all the Azerbaijanis in the world and wish stronger solidarity among them in the future. The year 1993 was painful and problematic for Azerbaijan and its people. [words indistinct], a part of our republic's territory was occupied as a result of Armenia's aggression, and our fellow countrymen and kinsmen were forced to leave their places of birth and become refugees in 1993. Azerbaijan experienced a serious economic and social crisis. Our republic has successfully emerged from all those difficulties and problems and has confidently entered 1994. The confrontation among individual forces, the harm done to Azerbaijan by the separatist forces, and the [word indistinct] disrupted social and political stability in our republic and brought Azerbaijan to the verge of civil war in mid-1993. The threat of civil war has been averted, but bloodshed occurred and that state of affairs created a very tense situation in the republic. Thanks to our people's awareness, bloodshed was prevented [as heard], the threat of civil war was averted, the confrontation was eliminated, and the separatist forces that tried to fragment our republic were rendered ineffective. Consequently, our republic has been able to resolve its problems in an atmosphere of peace and stability. Azerbaijan tried to obstruct Armenia's aggression and the armed attacks by Armenians in 1993. Regrettably, we have suffered several defeats and lost part of our territory. Many of our citizens were forced to become refugees in their homeland as a result of the occupation of our territory by the Armenian military forces. More than a million refugees have been resettled in the other parts of Azerbaijan. That has had a very serious effect on the general situation in the Republic, particularly the internal situation. However, it must be noted that the situation has changed. Changes have taken place as a result of the establishment and organization of the Republic's Armed Forces and the work carried out to successfully defend Azerbaijan's territory. Our military forces and our struggling young men are heroically defending our territory and successfully retaliating against the enemy attacks. They are dealing blows to the enemy. It can be pointed out that all the attacks launched by the Armenian Armed Forces over the last few months have been rebuffed. Our republic's military forces have defended the positions they hold. In fact, they have shown how strong Azerbaijan's defenses have become. Bloody fighting is taking place on all battlefronts, and the Armenian Armed Forces are to blame for the clashes. We wish to reiterate that Azerbaijan wants a peaceful end to the war, which has caused a calamity for our republic. In fact, our republic has taken several steps in that direction, and we want to reiterate our position at the present time. Regrettably, our republic's initiatives have failed to yield a result. Nevertheless, Azerbaijan is now able to strengthen its military will. I wish to assure our people that our armed forces will take the necessary measures to successfully defend our republic and retrieve our occupied territory. A war is being fought. Casualties are being inflicted on our people. The heroic sons of the Republic's people have been martyred in the battlefronts while defending our territory. I want to take this opportunity to extend condolences to the families and parents of all our martyrs. I bow my head in acknowledgment of their heroic effort. God bless the souls of the martyrs. May their graves be filled with bliss and may God give patience to their families. I am convinced that our people are now able to successfully resolve the serious problems that exist now. I want to convey my greetings to our officers and men who are bravely fighting at the battlefronts and to all our people on this festive day. I congratulate them on the occasion of the New Year and wish them good health and success in performing their sacred duties. The war is continuing. The number of refugees has increased as a result of the Armenian military attacks. I sincerely congratulate the refugees and all the people on the occasion of the New Year. Yes, it is a tradition in our republic that our citizens mark the New Year in their homes. Regrettably, many of our citizens have lost their homes and their parents. They have sought shelter in various places. The people and the state respect them, wherever they are. I pray that they maintain high spirits and morale. A serious crisis exists in Azerbaijan. The economic and social crisis has been caused by nearly six years of fighting and certain objective and subjective reasons. This state of affairs has reduced the standard of living. Our people are living in a difficult situation, but we are aware that our people are [word indistinct] and will resolve the existing problems. They will leave the painful and problematic year behind. Changes will occur in our economy in 1994, and the standard of living will improve day by day. Today is the day of solidarity for the Azerbaijanis. I wish for strong solidarity to exist among all the Azerbaijanis. Solidarity must be established among all the Azerbaijani people in the world, particularly those who live in independent Azerbaijan. Two years have passed since Azerbaijan declared its independence. We are now moving into the third year. We have significant tasks to perform. A state of strong solidarity among Azerbaijan's people is necessary for the realization of these tasks. We can contribute toward solidarity among the Azerbaijanis in the world if we establish real solidarity among the Azerbaijani people in our republic. In view of that, I urge our people to unite and establish solidarity. I also wish to assure our people that 1994 will [words indistinct]. I want to reiterate that we are defending our homeland's territory. We are working to end the war in Azerbaijan. We are working to improve the current situation. We have taken several steps in that direction, and we shall continue to do so. On behalf of Azerbaijan's people, I signed the Paris Charter in France on 20 December. This reaffirmed to the world that Azerbaijan is committed to peace, tranquillity, and security. However, we shall continue to strengthen our defense forces and make an effort to retake our occupied territory. Our people can rest assured that all the necessary measures will be taken to maintain our republic's territorial integrity and prevent the violation of our borders. I want to assure our esteemed countrymen that our territory will be liberated, regardless of what may happen in 1994. The refugees will return to their homes, and Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and state structure will be maintained. I congratulate you again on the occasion of the New Year, and I wish all the Republic's citizens peace, security, happiness, and success. Happy New Year.
