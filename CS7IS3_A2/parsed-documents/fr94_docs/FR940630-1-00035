ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice proposes changes to the powerplant airworthiness standards for normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airplanes. These proposals arise from the joint effort of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) to harmonize the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) for airplanes that will be certificated in these categories. The proposed changes would provide nearly uniform powerplant airworthiness standards for airplanes certificated in the United States under 14 CFR part 23 (part 23) and in the JAA countries under Joint Aviation Requirements 23 (JAR 23) simplifying airworthiness approvals for import and export purposes.
