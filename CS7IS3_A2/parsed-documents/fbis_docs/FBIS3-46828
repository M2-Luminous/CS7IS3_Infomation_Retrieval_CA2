FBIS3-46828 "dreas004__a94006" FBIS-EAS-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Japan `Extraordinary Events' Expected in DPRK OW0401055494 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 Jan 93 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0401055494 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Believing that some extraordinary events will probably occur in the DPRK this year, the government intends to watch carefully the country and work closer in cooperation with the United States, South Korea, and China. Washington is considering imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK together with other UN members if the U.S.-DPRK talks on suspected nuclear weapons development by North Korea are "deadlocked" (according to a government source). It is certain that if the United Nations decides on the sanctions, Japan will be asked to cooperate. Several years ago, a senior government official secretly said: "In the near future, North Korea will suddenly discharge its military power or will collapse because of economic difficulties. It is unlikely that the transfer of power from President Kim Il-song to Secretary Kim Chong-il will be made smoothly." Although his opinion did not represent the government view at the time, it has become common in the last year because of various behaviors by North Korea. The DPRK announced last March that it would withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Also, it keeps rejecting nuclear inspectations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Moreover, it succeeded in the experimental launch of its "Nodong 1" intermediate range ballistic missile over the Sea of Japan last May, continuing to exert its energy in missile development. As for its economic policy, the DPRK, for the first time, admitted that its third seven-year economic plan failed. At the same time, the country has established a new personnel lineup with the Kim family on top. Japan has so far analyzed that North Korea is "seriously" considering developing nuclear weapons (according to a Defense Agency source). It has taken the position that the issue of suspected nuclear weapons development by the DPRK should be resolved through dialogue. Based on this stand, Japan is carefully watching the developments in the U.S.-DPRK talks and is willing to help make progress in the North-South dialogue. It has also given political consideration to the issue. As Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said: "North Korea should not be isolated from the rest of the world." It is true that the actual state of North Korea is not clearly known. Tokyo depends on information given by Washington to know about the DPRK. However, it is said that the U.S. information represents differing views on the country. The government thinks: "It is possible that the DPRK has developed something similar to a nuclear weapon. But it will take another two or three years for the DPRK to be able to load nuclear warheads onto missiles and launch them at Japan" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). Even so, it cannot be denied that the situation has become tense. Nonetheless, the Japanese Government remains negative about imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK.
