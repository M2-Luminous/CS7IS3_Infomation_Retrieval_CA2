"ASEAN members will not compete with one another to attract foreign investors, but will instead cooperate in attracting foreign investors as well as investors from fellow ASEAN members," Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo, minister of state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board, said to reporters after opening a meeting of the ASEAN /working group on the promotion of direct foreign investment/ in Nusa Dua, Bali on Monday. He said ASEAN members should seek a promotional means to attract foreign investors now that the competition has become stronger. Accordingly, Sanyoto stressed the need for ASEAN members to anticipate global economic developments that have led to the formation of regional groups such as NAFTA and the European Union in addition to APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] and AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area]. "They also have to anticipate the implementation of the GATT accord endorsed last April," said the minister of state for investment affairs and chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board. The working group is expected to create an intra-ASEAN investment mechanism as well as a mechanism to attract foreign investors during the meeting. Sanyoto said fellow ASEAN members welcomed Government Regulation No. 20 on Foreign Investment. "They welcome Government Regulation No. 20 on Foreign Investment. I got this impression during an /informal dinner/ in Jakarta on Sunday evening," he said. According to Sanyoto, the government regulation was in fact inevitable. This means that Indonesia must take this step or else it will be left behind. Indonesia must enhance competitiveness in all fields if it wants to /survive/ in an era of globalization. The government regulation is a means to consolidate ourselves to enhance its competitiveness to attract foreign investors. Meanwhile, Sugihono Kadarisman, deputy chairman for promotion of the Investment Coordinating Board, said the working group will discuss the so-called noneconomic pressure in addition to jointly attracting foreign investors during the meeting. Western nations have often exerted noneconomic pressure such as human rights and the MFN [most favored nation] status on the developing nations. "We will discuss a strategy to counter the noneconomic pressure." Sanyoto said Japan remains the largest foreign investor in Indonesia. "Japan may not be the number one foreign investor this year due to a recession, but this country cumulatively remains in the top slot of the list of foreign investors here," he said. The second slot, which was held by Hong Kong from 1967 to May 1994, has been taken over by Taiwan. This is understandable because Taiwan has been aggressive since the president and a number of Taiwan ministers paid unofficial visits to Indonesia. Moreover, the Taiwan Government adopts the so-called /Go South Action Program/ that encourages Taiwan businessmen to invest not only in China but also countries to the south of Taiwan. "For example, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand," Sanyoto said.
