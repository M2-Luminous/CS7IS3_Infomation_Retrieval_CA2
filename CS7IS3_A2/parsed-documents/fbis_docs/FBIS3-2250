The Preliminary Work Committee has now been established, and its purpose is to enable the Hong Kong people to participate in the preparatory work for the Special Administration Region [SAR] during the transition period, to lay a good foundation for the future SAR government and create conditions for a high degree of autonomy and for Hong Kong people to run Hong Kong. He pointed out that this duty is very difficult. Lu Ping said in his speech that the economic development, reform, and opening up on the mainland has promoted Hong Kong's prosperity and stability; conversely, Hong Kong's prosperity and stability have also supported the economic construction of the motherland. As 1997 draws closer, these kinds of ties will become closer; this trend is in accordance with the interests of both places as well as with the common wish of the people of the two places. Lu Ping went on to say that these kinds of relations will be developed on the premise of "one country, two systems." Although the two places will be reunited as one family in the future, Hong Kong will continue to practice capitalism, while the mainland will keep practicing socialism. On 1 July 1997, the Hong Kong people will find that Hong Kong remains the same except that the red five-star flag and the bauhinia [flower that is the emblem of Hong Kong] flag will flutter outside their windows; as for civil servants, all of them will go to work as usual on that day, except for a few major officials who must be nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the central people's government. Lu Ping pointed out that this is not a dream and expressed his firm belief that each element of this vision will come true on 1 July 1997. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office's primary duty is to enable all of this to come true, and it is also the goal of everyone's struggle. Lu Ping said that, in order to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the most important thing to do is to maintain Hong Kong's economic value. Hong Kong brings benefits to the country with its economic value, not its political value. He pointed out that a series of policies and principles formulated by the central government has also proceeded from this point and added that one of the important factors contributing to Hong Kong's success is its status as an economic city -- not as a so-called political city, which it never was. Lu Ping also said that 99 percent of the Hong Kong compatriots are patriotic and hope to get along well with the mainland and do not want to see confrontation. This is the reason why the Chinese side firmly believes that "one country, two systems" will surely succeed in Hong Kong, that the Basic Law will surely be implemented, and that Hong Kong can maintain its prosperity and stability in 1997. Lu Ping explained that, in the past when Deng Xiaoping proposed "one country, two systems" to solve the Hong Kong question, he wanted to maintain Hong Kong's original appearance in every area, to enable it to become a bridge linking the economy of the East to the economy of the West. This is a superiority for Hong Kong which the other three small dragons do not have. The Chinese side has no intention of imposing the mainland's system on Hong Kong; nor does it seek to influence Hong Kong. That type of behavior would not be consistent with "one country, two systems." Lu Ping pointed out that allowing Hong Kong's capitalist system to remain unchanged, allowing Hong Kong people to run Hong Kong, and allowing Hong Kong to have a high degree of autonomy was not an outcome of the Sino-British talks, for it had been decided long before the Sino-British talks started and had been written into the Joint Declaration and its annex as a statement by the Chinese Government. After 1997, the central government will only be responsible for Hong Kong's foreign affairs and defense, and other matters will be handled by the SAR itself. Lu Ping pointed out that, by establishing the Preliminary Work Committee at this time, the Chinese side has primarily sought to embody participation by the Hong Kong people, to enable the Hong Kong people to take part in the preparatory work for the SAR, to lay a good foundation for the future SAR government together and give it a good starting point, and to create conditions for a high degree of autonomy and for Hong Kong people to run Hong Kong. By so doing, what the Hong Kong people will receive on 1 July 1997 will be an SAR which is economically prosperous, financially overflowing, socially stable, and all set and orderly in every aspect. Lu Ping admitted that this is a difficult duty, but he and his colleagues will view it as a sacred mission entrusted to them by 1.1 billion people and will contribute their own efforts.
