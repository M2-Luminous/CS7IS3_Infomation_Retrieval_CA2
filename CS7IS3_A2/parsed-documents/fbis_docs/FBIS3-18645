Constancio's return to active partisan politics is considered "a very important event" by the PS leadership. The political apparatus' "boss," Jorge Coelho, saw it as a "great contribution to the party's central objective of winning the 1995 legislative elections." Together with Constancio, Jaime Gama, Torres Couto, and Jose Lello also returned to the party's higher leadership. The list proposed by Guterres, which will go to a vote on 25 February, also includes former Social Democratic Party (PSD) member Helena Roseta. Guterres now hopes to convince Constancio to head the PS list for the European Parliament elections. Decisions will be made after Guterres's reelection as secretary general, expected on 11 March.
