The rally, which numbered about 1,500 people, however, did not turn into a large-scale event. It demanded that the government should resign, the parliament be dissolved and new elections to the Supreme Soviet be held. Incidentally, the last demand coincides with a demand put forward by the republican federation of trade unions. Meanwhile, the people's deputies who met today after a break in the session were in no hurry to heed the voice of the people. They started with discussing the agenda. Today Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-chairman of the parliament, turned up in parliament for the first time since his resignation. Now he can appraise the Supreme Soviet's work under a different angle. [Begin Shushkevich recording] The parliament does not want to heed the views of the minority. Its overwhelming majority is made up of old Communists elected when the Belarus Communist Party was in power. [end recording] [Vilyuga] The parliamentary majority solved cadre issues quite efficiently today. Three generals took important offices: Uladimir Danko was appointed interior minister, Genadz Lavitski -- chairman of the KGB, and (Anatoliy Novikov) -- chairman of the Supreme Soviet's commission for national security and combating crime. Ivan Bambiza was elected new deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet.
