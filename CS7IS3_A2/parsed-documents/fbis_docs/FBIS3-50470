The San Cristobal prison has practically become the line of combat between an as of yet undetermined number of EZLN members and the forces of the Mexican Army, anonymous sources told EFE. Most of the freed inmates are reportedly Indians, according to the sources. The EZLN is made up primarily of Indians of the Tzeltales, Tzotziles, and Tojolabales tribes. The sources also reported that the town of Ocosingo northwest of San Cristobal has been virtually cut off after EZLN members blew up the bridges of La Florida and La Virgen at the entrance and exit of Ocosingo. It was also reported that the San Cristobal de las Casas Red Cross ordered the suspension of its services given the lack of guarantees for its workers. At least 14 guerrillas have died and some six soldiers and three civilians were injured, two of whom are Red Cross members who were injured when the ambulance in which they were traveling was fired upon.
