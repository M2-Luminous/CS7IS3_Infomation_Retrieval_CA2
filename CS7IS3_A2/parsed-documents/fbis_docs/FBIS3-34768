He stressed the need for dialogue between the Palestinians and Lebanon regarding both side's refusal to accept permanent settlement of Palestinians in Lebanon. Criticizing the Lebanese Government, he said it wants to dismantle, not rebuild, the Palestinian camps and wants to drive the Palestinians to integrate into society so that the population of the camps will lose their cohesiveness. He noted that this policy furthers the permanent settlement of Palestinians in Lebanon. In an interview with the Voice of the Mountain, Salah called for expanding the current camps or building new ones. He praised the great understanding shown by Minister Junblatt on Palestinian civil rights. He said the Palestinian issue will be discussed with Prime Minister al-Hariri soon and urged the labor minister to help resolve the problem of Palestinian employment in Lebanon.
