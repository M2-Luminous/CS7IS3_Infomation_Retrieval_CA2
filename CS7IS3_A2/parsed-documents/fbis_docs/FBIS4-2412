It is also a major issue which has a bearing on the success or failure of reform and the future and fate of the party and the state. He said: Since the central authorities issued the mobilization call to thoroughly wage a struggle against corruption in August, the provincial party committee and the provincial discipline inspection commission have attached great importance to the anticorruption struggle and all localities have given mobilization talks and made effective arrangements for the struggle. Achievements have been scored, in varying degrees, in the three tasks set by the central authorities: 1) Leading cadres at the county and office level have conducted inner-party democratic activities quite conscientiously and earnestly and carried out self-examination and self-correction in terms of incorruptibility and self-discipline. 2) Initial advances have been made in investigating and handling major and important cases. 3) Some unhealthy practices have been checked and initial success has been scored in rectifying selected departments. The whole struggle against corruption is progressing in depth and healthily. Facts have proved that our party is completely able to get rid of corruption by relying its own strength and the support of the masses. He said: As an important measure to maintain political stability, anticorruption work must solve the current outstanding problems in the improvement of party style and building of clean government in an active, reliable, and down-to-earth way; alleviate and eliminate social hot points; strive to create a stable social environment; ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up to the outside world; and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Pu Chaozhu emphatically pointed out: In regard to the anticorruption struggle, on the basis of continuing to consolidate what has been achieved in the three tasks of anticorruption in the previous phase, we should concentrate efforts, in a selective way, on the new contents given by the party Central Committee and the State Council to the three tasks for 1994 and give them a great deal of attention to ensure their gradual implementation. Leadership over anticorruption work should be effectively strengthened. The entire party should be mobilized and principal party and government leaders should personally take charge of anticorruption work and carry out the work level by level downward, with each level being responsible to the authorities above it. We should work hard to achieve marked results in implementing the three tasks, continue to do a good job of the issue of incorruptibility and self-discipline with cadres at the county and office levels, continue to devote great efforts to investigating and handling cases, and continue to check unhealthy practices. As far as the struggle against corruption is concerned, we should encourage all members of society to participate in the struggle, combat corruption in a comprehensive way and by taking both radical and stopgap measures, and do a good job of anticorruption work by fully following the mass line and by relying on the masses. We should work out rules and regulations, augment the building of the legal system, strengthen supervision and inspection through publicity and education and the news media, give wide publicity to model individuals and advanced collectives honestly and diligently performing official duties for the people, foster a spirit of uprightness, make public corrupt behavior that is highly influential, combat evil trends, and teach all party members and the vast numbers of cadres to push the anticorruption struggle forward. Present at yesterday's meeting were He Zhiqiang, Ling Huan, Yin Jun, Zhao Shumin, Lang Dazhong, Li Jiating, Zhang Baoshan, Meng Jiyao, Wang Tianxi, Zhao Tingguang, (Li Qun), (Li Lingge), (Li Lingde), and other leading cadres.
