This was revealed when U.S. Defense Secretary Perry answered a question raised by a senator at the budget deliberation of the Senate Military Committee on 9 February. Also, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff explained that the budget for the Team Spirit joint military exercise is included in next year's budget bill. For the United States to appropriate a budget for the Team Spirit joint military exercise in the budget bill of next year's fiscal year is a planned and intentional maneuver to aggravate tension on the Korean peninsula and to further drive the situation toward a catastrophic war. This is an open challenge against us who hope to achieve peace and reunification. As everyone knows, the Team Spirit joint military exercise is a large scale war exercise to invade the North, which is being committed by mobilizing hundreds of thousands of enormous forces including up-to-date war equipment such as nuclear weapons and U.S. imperialist aggression forces brought in from the U.S. continent and U.S. bases in the Pacific, the U.S. troops occupying South Korea, and the South Korean puppet army. In its character, content, and scope, this war exercise is a very provocative and reckless preliminary war and a test nuclear war aimed at a nuclear preemptive strike toward the northern half of our republic. Whenever this war exercise is committed, tension is aggravated on the Korean peninsula and a strained situation is created in which a war may break out at any moment. That is why the world has been strongly demanding the permanent suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Also, the issue of suspending the Team Spirit war exercise was brought up as one of the important agendas in the North-South dialogues and DPRK-U.S. talks. In fact, under the conditions in which more than 1,000 nuclear weapons are deployed in South Korea, if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, its flame will be easily spread outside the territory of Korea, then a grave consequence will arise. The United States has promised in the DPRK-U.S. talks and contacts that it would suspend the Team Spirit exercise. This is because the United States itself has admitted the danger of the Team Spirit exercise. In the DPRK-U.S. talks and contacts, the United States has promised that it will not use any arms, including nuclear weapons, nor pose a threat to us by them. However, the United States has abandoned its promise and put pressure on us, while talking about sanctions against us. Also, it has officially included the budget for the Team Spirit war exercise into the defense budget for the next fiscal year. This is another mean betrayal, as well as a challenge to the party to dialogue. While smiling at us at the negotiating table, the United States has said that it will not conduct the Team Spirit war exercise. On the other hand, behind us, it has included the budget for the Team Spirit exercise into the defense budget for the next fiscal year. This fact clearly shows that although the United States babbles about the relaxation of tensions or dialogue or peace on words, it does not indeed want them, and that it pursues only the reckless policy of power to crush [apsal] us with military might in cooperation with the South Korean puppets. Also, this has proven that there are no changes in the United States' policy toward Korea. As a coyote's instinct is not changed, the United States' aggressive instinct and ambition will not change. In fact, under these circumstances in which the Cold War ended on the earth and in which our nation wishes peace, not war, there is no reason at all for the United States to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise next year. It will not be even beneficial to the United States itself to squander a great amount of expenditures by introducing a great number of troops and war equipment into South Korea and by conducting the Team Spirit joint military exercise for several months. Nevertheless, the United States wants to conduct the Team Spirit war exercise again next year against us. This shows that it wants, without fail, to set a fire of war on the Korean peninsula. However, the United States will not frighten our people -- who rise up for the just cause -- nor bring them into submission by any military threat or blackmail. Our people and the People's Army, who are ready for either dialogue or war, will return a war for a war if the United States dares to wage a war against us. They retaliate thousand-fold against aggressors. The United States must not commit a rash and thoughtless act, being clearly aware that we do not make empty talks. The U.S. plot to resume the dangerous Team Spirit joint military exercise will be strongly denounced by the broad peace-loving people throughout the world.
