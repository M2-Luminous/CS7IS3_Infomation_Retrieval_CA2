Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), said, "the cabinet reshuffle comes under the jurisdiction of the prime minister, so we will back it if he is determined to do so." But he told a press conference that the cabinet should preferably be reshuffled after the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 state budget, possibly around April. The SDP, the biggest force in the seven-party coalition government, and Sakigake (Harbinger) have opposed an early cabinet reshuffle plan. SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said on a public television news program that he cannot help dropping his earlier dissent if Hosokawa believes the reshuffle is necessary to eliminate policy differences within the cabinet. The focus of the projected cabinet reshuffle concerns the fate of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Takemura, the top government spokesman and leader of the 14- member Sakigake, reportedly alienated Hosokawa and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa over his opposition to Hosokawa's plan in early februrary to impose a new 7 percent indirect tax on goods and services. The plan was later scrapped. Ozawa, a key strategist in the ruling coalition, was reported late last year to have urged Hosokawa to remove Takemura from the key cabinet post. Takemura, who had put up harsh resistance to the reshuffle plan, withdrew his opposition Saturday by saying in Nagoya that it is up to Hosokawa to decide to reshuffle his cabinet. Hosokawa and Takemura met Sunday morning to discuss the projected cabinet reshuffle, political sources said. Sakigake Executive Hiroyuki Sonoda hinted on the same NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corp.) program Sunday that the party is ready to accept the reshuffle if Takemura can retain a cabinet post. "We have not thought of the possibility that our party may break away from the governing coalition," Sonoda said. "If the prime minister is in need of our party, it is the best solution (for our party) to continue to help him by remaining within the cabinet," he said. A reshuffling of the six-month-old cabinet is expected to come at the end of February or early March following passage of a third supplementary budget for the current fiscal 1993, the sources said. Hosokawa's Japan New Party and six other parties, including Sakigake, the SDP, Shinseito and Komeito, make up the governing coalition. Meanwhile, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said on the same program and on a private television program that cabinet changes will take place in late February or early March. Ichikawa blamed the reshuffle debate on Takemura and said the cabinet changes will be "very limited."
