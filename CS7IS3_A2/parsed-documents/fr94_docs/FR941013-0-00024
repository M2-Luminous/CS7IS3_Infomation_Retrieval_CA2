FR941013-0-00024 FR941013-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing 24 CFR Parts 905 and 990 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1681; FR&hyph;2971&hyph;F&hyph;02] RIN 2577&hyph;AA99 Low-Income Public Housing; Performance Funding System: Elimination of Heating Degree Day Adjustment AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule will eliminate the application of the heating degree day adjustment factor in determining the component of operating subsidy eligibility relating to utility consumption under the Performance Funding System (PFS). The rule implements section 508 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For information concerning part 990, Mr. John T. Comerford, Director, Financial Management Division, Office of Assisted Housing, Public and Indian Housing, Room 4212, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington D.C. 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;1872. For information concerning part 905, Mr. Dominic Nessi, Director, Office of Native American Programs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, L'Enfant Plaza, Building 490, Room 8204, Washington D.C. 20410, telephone (202) 755&hyph;0032. Hearing or speech impaired individuals may call HUD's TDD number, (202) 708&hyph;0850. [These telephone numbers are not toll-free.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Paperwork Reduction Statement This rule eliminates a previously required adjustment and therefore reduces the public reporting burden. The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and assigned OMB control number 2577&hyph;0029. II. Background Section 508 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 4187) directs the Department to incorporate into the PFS a methodology to adjust utility consumption to account for Cooling Degree Days that is the same as the methodology used to account for Heating Degree Days. The impetus for this legislation was that housing agencies in the sunbelt who had to pay higher utility bills for air conditioning during hot summers (e.g., in projects that were ``master-metered'' in which the cost of running air conditioning could not be assigned to the tenant) wanted an adjustment in their PFS payments to account for the increased utility consumption. Consistent with the explicit policy stated in the statute, the proposed rule contained a literal implementation of the statutory language. However, the Department was concerned that its implementation of this provision raised some basic questions and could create some major distortions in the funding system. Because of this, it was determined appropriate to open a discussion of policy alternatives in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in the Federal Register on October 1, 1993 (58 FR 51261) and to invite public comment on the issues surrounding implementation of this statutory provision. Because of the potential importance of this change, and because the Department was aware that there are additional factors to consider in calculating cooling load and cost other than ambient temperatures, the Preamble to the proposed rule described three alternate scenarios for addressing the issue of heating and cooling degree day adjustments in the PFS formula: 1. Implement cooling degree day adjustment exactly like the heating degree day adjustment. 2. Isolate the consumption of the meter estimated to be used for heating or cooling by tracking the monthly consumption, and perform a cooling and heating degree days adjustment to the portion of utilities estimated to be used for heating or cooling. 3. Drop all degree day adjustments in the PFS. We invited public comment on these alternate approaches or suggestions of additional alternatives. III. Response to Public Comments There were fifteen public comments on the proposed rule. The fifteen commenters included 13 Housing Agencies (HAs), one taxpayer, and the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities. Fourteen of the fifteen commenters recommended that the Department adopt the third option. Only one commenter did not recommend the third option. Instead this commenter presented options that combined elements of options 2 and 3: (A) Establish areas to receive cooling allowances by geographical zones rather than cooling degree days. A twenty year temperature history could be the basis for the allowance. This would include seasonal starting and stopping dates as well as intensity of energy requirements.
