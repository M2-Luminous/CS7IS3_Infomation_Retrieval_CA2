FR941230-1-00078 FR941230-1-00008 Oklahoma proposed to revise the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations at sections 780.25 and 784.16, reclamation plan for ponds, impoundments, banks, dams, and embankments; section 780.37, road systems; section 784.20, subsidence control plans; section 784.24, transportation facilities; section 800.40, requirement to release performance bonds; sections 816.46 and 817.46, hydrologic balance and siltation structures; section 816.116, revegetation success standards; section 816.121, subsidence control; section 823.12, prime farmland soil removal; section 823.13, prime farmland soil stockpiling; and section 823.14, prime farmland soil replacement. Oklahoma also proposed to recodify its rules in accordance with the standards set forth by the Oklahoma State Legislature and the Office of Administrative Code. OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the September 27, 1994 Federal Register (59 FR 49223), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK&hyph;963.03). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on October 27, 1994. During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of recodified Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 460:20&hyph;27&hyph;20(b) and 460:20&hyph;31&hyph;17(b), primary road certification requirements for road systems and transportation facilities, and Oklahoma's proposed rule recodification. With respect to the recodification, OSM identified concerns relating to OAC 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;12(f)(8), sedimentation pond storage volume; OAC 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;47 and 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;48, subsidence control for surface mining activities; OAC 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;28, protection of underground mining; and various editorial and citation inconsistencies. OSM notified Oklahoma of the concerns by letter dated November 22, 1994 (administrative record No. OK&hyph;963.08). Oklahoma responded in a letter dated December 20, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory information (administrative record No. OK&hyph;963.10). In response to the issue letter, Oklahoma proposes to move the as-built requirements regarding primary road certification for road systems and transportation facilities from the permitting requirements of OAC 460:20&hyph;27&hyph;20(b) and 460:20&hyph;31&hyph;17(b) to the performance standard requirements of OAC 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;53(1) and 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;53(1); to delete at OAC 460:20&hyph;43&hyph;12(f)(8) the requirement that sediment shall be removed from a structure when the sediment storage volume is 80 percent filled; to provide additional information explaining why the provisions at OAC 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;47 and 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;48, regarding subsidence control for surface mining activities, should be retained in its rules; to delete at OAC 460:20&hyph;45&hyph;28 from its underground mining performance standards a provision regarding the protection of underground mining; and to propose revisions and provide additional explanatory information for the recodification of its coal mining rules. III. Public Comment Procedures OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Oklahoma program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Oklahoma program.
