The paper notes that Egypt was among the first countries to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the 1960's, while Israel refused and continues to refuse to sign the treaty or commit itself to the nonpossession of nuclear arms. Referring to the UN inspection committees that have monitored Iraq's airspace and territory since it invaded Kuwait to ensure that it does not possess the capability to manufacture weapons of mass destruction, AL-AHRAM says a similar measure has not been applied to Israel even though it does not allow its nuclear installations to be inspected. The paper urges Israel to comply with the UN General Assembly resolution, as the other countries in the region have, in line with the current effort toward establishing peace and good-neighborliness among them.
