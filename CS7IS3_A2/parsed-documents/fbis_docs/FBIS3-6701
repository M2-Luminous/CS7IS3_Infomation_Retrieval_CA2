DSP leader Keigo Ouchi, speaking to reporters at a news conference in the central Japan city of Tsu near Nagoya, said the proposal "needs careful study." He said, "The foundation of the Hosokawa cabinet may see a major crack if it is pushed ahead in a hasty manner." Ouchi, who is the health and welfare minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said, "Nothing has been decided as far as the DSP is concerned." Ouchi's remark differs from the party's No. 2 man, Takashi Yonezawa, who met Thursday with coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the key coalition party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and agreed to promote efforts toward the establishment of a new party in preparation for a next general election for the House of Representatives. Under the political reform package enacted in late January, the next general election is almost certain to pick 300 lower house members in single-seat constituencies plus 200 seats chosen through proportional representation. There are differences of opinion among the seven parties on how to cope with the single-seat districts in rivalry to the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) and Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) headed by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata have pushed ahead with a plan to unite the seven coalition parties as part of efforts to prepare for the next general election. However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest group in the coalition, and new party Sakigake [Harbinger] led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura have indicated opposition to the idea. Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at a disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame internal rivalry and agreed to file a joint candidate in each of the single-seat constituencies. It is not known when the next general election will be called. The four-year term of the incumbent lower house is to last through July 1997. But many politicians say there will be a snap general election before that time because of the major change in the election system under the political reform package.
