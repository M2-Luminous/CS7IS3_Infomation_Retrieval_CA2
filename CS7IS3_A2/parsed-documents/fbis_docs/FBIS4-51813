In the first quarter foreign tourists spent 799 million U.S. dollars here, a 12.4-percent rise, while Korean travelers shelled out 1.11 billion dollars abroad, up 22.9 percent. The result was a travel deficit of 315 million dollars for the three months, up 60.7 percent from 196 million dollars in the same period last year. The growing deficit was caused by a sharp increase in the number of Koreans traveling overseas. In January-March, 735,000 Koreans went abroad, up 33.8 percent, while 825,000 foreigners entered this country, up 20.1 percent. The Transportation Ministry had hoped to even out travel revenue and spending at 4.2 billion dollars apiece this year, but tourism expenditure is likely to exceed revenue, the officials predicted.
