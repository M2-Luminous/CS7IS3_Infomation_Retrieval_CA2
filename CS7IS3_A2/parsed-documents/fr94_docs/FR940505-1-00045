FR940505-1-00045 FR940505-1-00012 Ventura is classified as a ``Severe'' ozone area, with a November 15, 2005 attainment deadline. 13 For the period 1990&hyph;1992, the design value was .15 ppm. While this design value is the same as Sacramento's for the 1990&hyph;1992 period, Ventura had more than twice the number of expected exceedance days (17.6). 13 Based on a request and supporting information from the State, EPA's designation under the 1990 CAA Amendments divided the Los Angeles Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area into four distinct areas with respect to ozone designations and classifications. This action made the entire Ventura County a separate nonattainment area with a ``Severe'' classification, although the 1988&hyph;1990 design value calculated for the area would have supported a ``Serious'' classification. See 56 FR 56698, 56700, 56731 (November 6, 1991). Prior to this designation, the Ventura ozone nonattainment area included only that portion of the County south of the southern boundary of the Los Padres National Forest. Transport of ozone and ozone precursors from Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and outer continental shelf activity can be significant. However, emissions from Ventura itself can result in ozone standard exceedances independent of transport from other areas. In addition, mountains bordering the Ventura urban areas contribute to a meteorology that favors high ozone concentrations, particularly within the southern portions of the County. Based on recent urban airshed modeling analyses, EPA has determined that attainment requires 40 percent reductions from current levels of both NO X and VOC. 3. South Coast Area The South Coast area (South Coast Air Basin) includes all of Orange County and the more populated portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside Counties. 14 Ventura County lies to the northwest, the Southeast Desert ``Severe'' ozone nonattainment area (portions of San Bernardino, Riverside, Kern, and Los Angeles Counties) is to the north and east, and the San Diego ``Severe'' ozone area is to the south. 14 For a description of the boundaries of the South Coast Air Basin, see 40 C.F.R. 81.305 and 56 FR 56726&hyph;56728 (November 6, 1991). The current population of approximately 13 million is expected to grow to more than 18 million by 2010. The South Coast is the largest industrial area in the United States, with a gross domestic product of $300 billion. Practically every commercial and industrial category is represented in the area's economy. In the year 2010, mobile sources will account for 46 percent of VOC emissions, 81 percent of NO X emissions, and 97 percent of CO emissions in the South Coast. The South Coast area has by far the worst ozone levels in the Country and is the only area classified as ``Extreme.'' For the period 1990&hyph;1992, the design value was .30 ppm and the average number of actual exceedance days was 134.3. Ozone levels are particularly high during the months of July through October, but violations also occur under warm and stagnant conditions in April, May, June, and November. The South Coast is one of only three ``Serious'' CO areas in the Country. Its design value is 16.4 ppm for the period 1991&hyph;1992. The average yearly number of exceedances for those years was 38. In recent years, CO violations have occurred only in the months of November, December, January, and February, and at certain monitoring sites in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. No CO violations have been recorded in the Riverside and San Bernardino portions of the South Coast area since the 1970's. These uniquely high levels of pollution are the result of the massive emissions generated within the area, combined with especially adverse meteorology and topography. A number of factors_sunshine, high temperatures, ocean breezes carrying pollutants into the inland valleys, mountains to the north and east trapping the pollutants within the basin, and prolonged thermal inversion layers_conspire to create ideal conditions for the generation of high ozone levels. Extreme wintertime inversions retard the dispersion of CO emissions from the 9 million motor vehicles within the area. This leads to a buildup of CO concentrations over time, particularly within west-central Los Angeles County. Attainment requires approximately a 45 percent reduction in CO emissions from the baseyear. B. SIP Status 1. Introduction; Relationship of the FIP to the SIP At the same time EPA is proposing federal plans for these areas, the responsible State and local agencies have been developing and adopting their own plans and rules to meet the scheduled Clean Air Act requirements. In relation to the FIPs, the most important of these new SIP requirements and submittal deadlines are: (1) CO plan for the South Coast demonstrating attainment and addressing the provisions of section 187 of the Act_due November 15, 1992; (2) Ozone 15 percent rate-of-progress plans for each area meeting the requirements of section 182(b)(1)_due November 15, 1993; and (3) ozone plans for each area demonstrating attainment and satisfaction of the relevant portions of section 182_due November 15, 1994. EPA has issued preliminary interpretations of the amended Act's provisions applicable to these SIP obligations. See, for example, the ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,'' [see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)], and ``Guidance for Growth Factors, Projections, and Control Strategies for the 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans,'' (EPA&hyph;452/R&hyph;93&hyph;002, March 1993). Ultimately, EPA expects that SIP measures meeting the requirements of the 1990 amendments and more carefully tailored to the FIP areas will supplant the potentially severe measures EPA is compelled to propose here. EPA understands that this scenario presents facilities with the prospect of changing compliance requirements as the FIP is replaced by SIP measures. In the long term, however, it will better serve the area to have in place measures which are designed by State, regional, and local authorities, who are best situated to minimize any disruption of the local economy and communities. In the discussion below, the more important completed and pending SIP submittals for the State and each area are briefly described. To the extent that the submittals satisfy, or help to satisfy EPA's obligations under the existing court orders, EPA will approve the SIPs and refrain from promulgating FIP provisions addressing those aspects of the air quality problem.
