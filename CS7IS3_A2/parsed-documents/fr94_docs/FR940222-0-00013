FR940222-0-00013 FR940222-0-00004 AD 65&hyph;06&hyph;01 currently requires the same actions as this AD on 1,025 of 1,303 airplanes. Of the remaining 307 airplanes affected by this AD, the FAA estimates that it will take approximately 18 workhours for 156 airplanes and 100 workhours for 151 airplanes, depending upon the particular model. Parts are not required for 156 airplanes and cost approximately $1,700 for 151 airplanes. Based on these figures, the cost impact of this AD upon U.S. operators not already affected by AD 65&hyph;06&hyph;01 is approximately $1,241,640 (cost per airplane varies by model). In addition, if the required inspection reveals cracks in the spar cap, replacing the spar cap is required at a cost of approximately $100,000, parts and labor included. An airplane affected by this AD could have a compliance cost as low as approximately $990 (18 workhours) or $7,200 (100 workhours) if cracks were not found during the inspection, and as high as approximately $100,990 (inspection using 18 workhours + spar replacement) to $107,200 (inspection using 100 workhours + spar replacement) if the operator replaces the spar cap. The FAA estimates that the airplanes affected by the required AD are utilized an average of approximately 200 hours time-in-service per year, or an average time-interval between the required inspections of 2.5 years. Based on an expected average remaining operating life of 20 years per affected airplane, the annualized compliance cost would be: •If only repetitively inspecting the spar cap is necessary at 18 workhours: $456 annualized cost (using a 7 percent interest rate); •If only repetitively inspecting the spar is necessary at 100 workhours: $2,700 annualized cost (using a 7 percent interest rate); or •If replacing the spar cap is necessary: approximately $9,971 annualized cost (with 18 workhours for inspection and using a 7 percent interest rate) and $10,372 annualized cost (with 100 workhours for inspection and using a 7 percent interest rate) if the spar cap is replaced during the first inspection. The required AD's from Dockets No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;26&hyph;AD (for Model 500S), No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;57&hyph;AD (for Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720), and No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;58&hyph;AD (for Models 500S, 500U, 680FL, 680W, and 681), also affect certain airplanes included in this AD. The compliance costs of these AD's add to the cost discussed above. However, replacing the spar cap is only required once, so the $100,000 replacement cost, if required, would be a one-time action. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionally burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires government agencies to determine whether rules would have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' and, in cases where they would, conduct a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in which alternatives to the rule are considered. FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, outlines FAA procedures and criteria for complying with the RFA. Small entities are defined as small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated or airports by small governmental jurisdictions. The 307 U.S.-registered airplanes affected by this AD that are not already affected by AD 65&hyph;06&hyph;01 are owned according to the following breakdown: 80 by individuals, 3 by U.S. government agencies, 9 by states or local governments, and 215 by other entities. Four entities own more than one of the affected airplanes that are not affected by AD 65&hyph;06&hyph;01: two own 2 each, and two own 5 each. Three entities own models that will be affected by this AD, as well as AD 65&hyph;06&hyph;01. The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the affected non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance of the costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact can be reasonably determined. The FAA solicited comments concerning the impact of the NPRM on owners of affected airplanes, and received no comments on this matter. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES ''. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because of substantial public interest; and, (3) if promulgated, may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and has considered alternatives to this action that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES ''. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the required action is the best course to achieve the safety objective of returning the airplane to its original certification level of safety.
