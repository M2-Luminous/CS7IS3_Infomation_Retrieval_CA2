Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said Tuesday that a massive operation against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was continuing in the region, and made "a final appeal" to separatist militants to surrender before the summer. "Our state will embrace anyone who surrenders," Ciller said, as local sources in the southeast reported an immense troop deployment to the region and a buildup of Turkish forces on the Iraqi border. Sources said Tuesday that there was a heavy bombardment of separatist targets in the Shiva and Haftanin regions of northern Iraq and that a land operation was continuing near Sinah. A major deployment of Turkish troops was also observed in the vicinity of Kani Masi, an area previously cleared by warplanes and helicopter gunships. An unofficial Turkish military headquarters was established in Kani Masi on Monday, and helicopters were ferrying in new troops the following day. One unconfirmed report had it that Turkish troops had also crossed into northern Iraq near the Iranian border and were accompanied by peshmerges of Mas'ud Barzani's Kurdistan Democrat Party (KDP). Operations in Turkey also continued, with new vehicles and troops arriving in the border region and land and air operations continuing on Gabar mountain. Local sources said villages on Gabar and Mt. Cudi had been evacuated and that the civilians had fled either to Kumcati or northern Iraq. Addressing her ruling True Path Party (DYP) group meeting on Tuesday, Ciller implied that the Turkish campaign would gain momentum by this summer and defined the struggle against terrorism as "Turkey's most important problem." She denied separatist claims that Turkey mistreated those who surrendered and said: "Come and surrender before it's too late. Your end should not come in sorrow. Come and let us enjoy the resources of this country together." Her statement came a day after a senior PKK leader claimed that Turkey aimed at creating a permanent security zone within Iraq and official sources in Ankara said that the Turkish presence in the region would last throughout the summer. In an interview he gave to the PKK-affiliated Kurd-A news agency on Monday, Military Council commander Cemil Bayik (Cuma) claimed that Turkey wanted to occupy part of the region. He alleged that troops would be advancing southwards in the coming days and suggested troops might even reach Zakho and Dahuk. Bayil also described the operation as more important than Turkey's incursion into Iraq in 1992 and said that this time Turkey intended to stay put. Local sources claimed on Monday that Turkish tanks moving out of the Zap region of Turkey's Hakkari Province had moved into Iraq and had reached Kani Masi via a mountain road. Turkish commandos, supported by warplanes and military helicopters, entered the region last week and local sources have put the total number of troops currently in northern Iraq at around 5,000. Witnesses said hundreds of paramilitary village guards were assisting the troops. As part of the operation on Gabar Mountain, troops have seized nine mortars, seven anti-aircraft guns, three rocket launchers, 61 assault rifles, 70 anti-personnel mines, 98 grenades and approximately 170,000 rounds of ammunition, in one week. Turkey recently deployed around 100,000 fresh troops to the Southeast and has a total of approximately 400,000 security personnel, including soldiers, policemen, intelligence officers and village guards, to fight the separatists in the region. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan said earlier that this was "the final conflict" between his organization and Turkey, warning all militants to be prepared for a massive crackdown.
