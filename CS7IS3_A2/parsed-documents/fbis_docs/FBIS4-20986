Quan Xiaoyong, a member of the railway police force and son of the former chief of police in the northern province of Gansu, was sentenced to death and executed after a suspended death sentence handed down two years ago by an intermediate court was overturned. Quan was a leading member of a 17-strong drug trafficking ring brought to trial in 1992 in the provincial capital of Lanzhou, the China Prosecution Daily said. While four leaders of the gang were sentenced to death and executed, Quan received a suspended death sentence, sparking public accusations of favouritism because of his family and professional connections, the newspaper said. The provincial authorities ordered an investigation into the case, which took 18 months and resulted in the recent decision by the province's Superior People's Court to overturn the original judgement and sentence Quan to death. The same court also overturned a not-guilty verdict handed down to Li Jian, the son of a senior Gansu party official, who had been accused of acting as an accomplice to the gang's activities. The superior court sentenced Li to six months imprisonment.
