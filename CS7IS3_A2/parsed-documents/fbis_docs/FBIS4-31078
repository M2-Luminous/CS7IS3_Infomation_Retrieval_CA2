"The politicians have been told clearly that the state's fiscal deficit will no longer be made up from the central bank coffers. Let them take out loans on the capital market," says Dragoslav Avramovic, central bank governor and architect of the national economic stabilisation programme. Measures which the federal government began implementing on January 24 have helped avert an economic and monetary collapse in conditions of a tight international blockade of Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). Avramovic explains that the programme began with consolidating the national currency and should end with balancing the budgetary revenues and outlays. Serbia's deficit is down to 45 percent of the plan, and the federal deficit, to 75 percent. Late last week, the Serbian Government said it had taken measures to ensure the financing of the total public expenditures from real sources, without incurring a budget deficit. Similar measures are being planned by the Montenegrin Government, according to competent authorities. The ball is now in the court of the Federal Government, which should balance its books by July 24, after which date all budgetary outlays will have to be covered from real earnings. In case of need, the state will be able to take out credits but only on the market, through issuing debentures, central bank experts explain. Avramovic said on Saturday he would resign as governor of the central bank the moment he had to print money without gold and hard currency backing. The new dinar, which has full gold and hard currency backing, was circulated on January 24 to replace the old dinar which had been devalued out of existence by an annual inflation of 116 billion percent in 1993. Analysts say that, if he manages to implement his plan and put an end to the practice of 50 years of financing the budget deficit by printing money, Avramovic will create conditions for a lasting elimination of the chief generator of inflation.
