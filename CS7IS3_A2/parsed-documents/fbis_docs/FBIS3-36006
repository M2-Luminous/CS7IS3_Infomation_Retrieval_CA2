The president made this statement during his visit to the Ukrainian Stock Exchange in response to a question from KIEVSKIYE NOVOSTI's economic reporter. The president's interest in stock exchange structures is understandable: One may discern a prototype of our economy's key unifying element in their development. Although with great difficulty, the economy is reforming itself on a competitive basis. Another reason for the visit was the fact that having passed through the "evolutionary" process of emergence over a record short period of time, the Ukrainian Stock Exchange today fully meets international standards in organizing bids. This has become possible due to the introduction of electronic circulation of securities. Assistance came from French specialists and the government, which allocated funds for software purchases. The distinguishing feature of the electronic system is that it allows the very expensive "paper" chain to be abandoned. [passage omitted] Valentin Oskolskiy, chairman of the Ukrainian Stock Exchange's management, reported that the first biddings were held in March of 1992, while the electronic system was installed in late 1993. The latter fact was defined as extremely significant for the development of a florid market of securities since it creates conditions for the regulation of difficult relations among sellers, dealers, and investors. Currently, only stocks of the shipping company "Ukrrechflot" and the "Ukraine" stock bank are sold through this system. The system is expected to reach its full potential with the beginning of the mass privatization of state property. Having acquainted himself with the system, the staff, and the results of the bids conducted on this "occasion" (the stock exchange sold securities worth 25 million karbovantsy), the president answered journalists' questions. Since the stock exchange system is a contrast to the so-called system of centralized planning, we asked L. Kravchuk to explain his general attitude toward the beginnings of planning in the economy. "You see that one cannot reject planning," said the president. "It is applied everywhere. Even a small family plans its future, income, and expenditures -- what it has and what it can buy. For example, Japan achieved its market through the fulfillment of plans. One should not reject planning as such. The problem is that speaking about planning as a principle, we have before us the image of the great state plan with its extremely centralized system, administrative methods of regulation, and pressures on the producer. A plan scares us. However, we have actually submitted our plans of social and economic development rather than the budget alone to the Supreme Soviet. They must be coordinated and interrelated. I believe that one must have a plan for the development of any economic entity, concern, corporation, or syndicate. This is the case throughout the world." [passage omitted]
