The convention will take up changes that were not agreed on at Olivos. The governing party must win by a wide margin at the ballot box in order to avoid surprises in connection with constitutional reform. Regardless of the lead that the polls are giving it, the Justicialist Party (PJ) needs to win the 10 April elections by a very wide margin in order to avoid surprises at the future Constituent Assembly. Contrary to what people believe, the changes in the new constitution do not stop with the reelection of the president or even the so-called core agreement, the "closed package" containing the measures that Menem and Alfonsin agreed on in the Olivos pact. Up to this point the assumption is that Peronists and Radicals will vote together. It will be interesting to see, however, when the convention delegates gather in Santa Fe or Parana, what wording they will use to describe the powers of the cabinet chief, the election of the third senator, or the autonomy of the Federal Capital. Each period, each comma will be examined under a microscope because they may subtly confirm or distort the spirit of the agreement. But the changes in the constitution do not stop there. There is another vast sphere, the 15 issues that Congress has authorized for discussion by the Constituent Convention, on which there is no agreement. The assumption is that the PJ will be able to do as it pleases on these varied issues, inasmuch as not many people are daring enough, not even in the UCR [Radical Civic Union] itself, to deny that the ruling party is going to win. This certainty will not give way to complete calm until we know whether the PJ has an absolute majority in the legislature that will take a scalpel to the Constitution of 1853. "Yes, we will get 50 percent," the president of the bloc of deputies, Jorge Matzkin, told LA NACION. If this happens, the ruling party will have nothing to fear when a vote is taken on the "uncontrolled," open issues. But there are several people who are still losing sleep over this. One is Minister Cavallo, who feels that in this regard the Constituent Assembly could pose a threat to his economic program. The Federal Issue The section "Authorized Issues" is made up of the following items: 1) Federalism; 2) Municipal autonomy; 3) Mechanisms of semidirect democracy; 4) Senate approval of officials in oversight agencies and the Central Bank; 5) Powers of Congress and the Executive; 6) Ombudsman; 7) The nation's attorney general; 8) Investigative powers of Congress; 9) International treaties; 10) Political parties and electoral system; 11) Environment; 12) Economic and social council; 13) Protection of customers and consumers; 14) Habeas corpus and amparo; and 15) Consolidation of terms of office. There are disagreements between the two major parties on all of them, but the most striking differences concern various aspects of item 1. The UCR insists that the amounts of federal revenue sharing be indicated expressly in the constitution, in other words, what percentage of the taxes collected by the federal government ought to be sent to each province. It also wants to empower the provinces to conduct international negotiations aimed at taking out loans or bringing in investment. Led by Cavallo, the ruling party wants to block such moves and any under point two (there is a proposal under which cities would be able to collect and administer their own taxes), because they could "impair stability." The provincial parties could play a decisive role in the vote on the federal issue if the PJ does not command an absolute majority and they back the UCR's stand. Further Doubts The doubts about what the constitution might look like are branching out, as the summary below shows. - Two mechanisms of "semidirect democracy" will be introduced, but it is not known what their scope is. The UCR is an especially strong backer of the "initiative" (a bill backed by a certain number of signatures of citizens must be taken up as soon as possible by Congress). The PJ wants the "binding referendum." Knowing that they have not done well at the polls lately, the people in the largest minority party are afraid that the administration will call referendums to impose its programs. "What would happen if there were two or three terrible murders, and the idea of bringing back the death penalty through a referendum were raised?" they ask, citing an extreme case. - Senate confirmation will be needed for officials in oversight agencies, but the Radicals do not want this requirement applied to the auditor general, who henceforth will be a Radical whom they do not want subject to confirmation by a PJ-controlled legislature. - What powers will the ombudsman have? As far as the UCR is concerned, he will be able to file suit in the event of improprieties. The Peronists, as potential targets of complaints since they are in power, do not go as far. - According to the Radicals, the nation's attorney general (a post that will be provided for in the next constitution) may be removed only by impeachment. The PJ wants to leave the door open so that the president can tell him to leave, as has already happened. - The status of international treaties may be open to many changes. If they are accorded constitutional rank (that is to say, higher than a regular law), then various issues related to human rights could be incorporated into the constitution. - The election system also raises question marks. According to the Radicals, the current law may be amended only by a two-thirds majority of Congress. The ruling party accepted this in principle, and it was written into the "closed package." But qualifying the issue for unrestricted debate seems linked to the PJ's desire to eliminate or water down the D'Hont system (which is proportional) and to assure more generous representation for electoral majorities. - An economic and social council, made up of businessmen, workers, and representatives of various social sectors, will be formed. The PJ is pushing this strongly and wants to give it broad powers, whereas the UCR wants to assign it only advisory functions. - What will be done to consolidate terms of office? In light of their election winning streak, the Peronists are proposing that all terms (of the president, the deputies, and the governors) begin on the same day. In this way the party that wins an election will have clear political sailing. The Radicals, who have been losing, want a more gradual approach. Disagreements in the Constituent Assembly Federalism: This is what worries the administration, especially Minister Cavallo, the most. The Radicals, backed by the provincial parties, are insistent about setting the amount of revenue sharing in the constitution and about the provinces being able to negotiate foreign loans on their own. Referendum: This will be incorporated into the new constitution, but the UCR fears that the administration will use it for purposes of "political manipulation." Municipal autonomy: The disagreement has to do with whether cities should be able to set and collect their own taxes and spend the revenues. Checks and balances: The PJ wants the auditor general of the nation (who will be from the opposition) to be confirmed by the Senate, in which it has a wide majority. Election system: The UCR is calling for a two-thirds majority in Congress to amend the election law. The ruling party's desire to eliminate or pare back the D'Hont system is hovering over the issue. Economic and social council: As far as the PJ is concerned, this council representing social sectors ought to play a prominent role. To the Radicals this smacks of "corporativism," and they want to "pare back its scope appropriately."
