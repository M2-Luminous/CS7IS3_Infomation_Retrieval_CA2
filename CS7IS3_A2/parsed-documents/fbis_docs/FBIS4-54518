In his statement Bulgarian President Zhelev pointed out the quiet road without excesses of the performance of the reforms in our country. He also stressed that Albania plays a key role in peace, stability, and security in the Balkans. To defend his idea, he brought up two arguments: first, the fact that ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosova, and the presence of the Albanians who live in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Nevertheless, President Zhelev said, these two acute problems and sore points are handled with a sound logic, prudence, and political maturity by the Albanian state and its chairman, Mr. Berisha. Zhelev said that while in 1991 Albanians came to take our experience, now in 1994, on the contrary, we are the ones who should go and see how the economic and political reforms are carried out in Albania. Concerning the refusal of the Bulgarian party to participate in a trilateral meeting proposed by Greece, President Zhelev stressed that peace and stability in the Balkans are reached and preserved with the contribution of all Balkan countries. However, Zhelev stressed, it is not good for two or three sides to meet and talk behind others' backs. The time has gone when discussions were held and decisions were made by isolating the third parties. At present the dialogue is open to any country interested in the stability of the region. The chairman of the Albanian state later took the floor. [Begin Berisha recording] First, I want to thank President Zhelev from my heart for the warm and friendly reception and express my greatest pleasure for the level of relations between Albania and Bulgaria. Our two countries have old friendly and historic ties. However, I wanted to say that their determination to develop and strengthen their ties, cooperation, and friendship at the present time is the most important. In this respect, both countries, who suffered the communist dictatorship together and which were engaged in the course of the reform, are undoubtedly more sensitive to pain and sufferings, due both to their past and the course of the reforms; they have a broader meaning for each other. These are the reasons that in two years, Albania and Bulgaria have signed dozens of agreements and have established very good political and economic cooperation. What is the most important is the fact that the two countries are fighting and actively trying to achieve peace and stability in the Balkans. I think that our two countries have played an important role in reducing tension and preserving peace in the south of the Balkans. Once again, I avail myself of the opportunity in front of you to confirm the great importance of President Zhelev's refusal to participate in the trilateral summit proposed by the Greek former prime minister for the Balkans. The Greek prime minister aimed at placing the Balkans before a religious dangerous alliance. I think that the friendly relations between Albania and Bulgaria will show how states with various beliefs but with the same principles can cooperate to the benefit of each other and the region. During these two days, in the course of my discussions with President Zhelev, the chairman of the parliament, and Prime Minister Berov, we discovered with pleasure that there exists a great desire to develop economic cooperation. We are asking for help from the European Union so that this cooperation becomes more fruitful. Thus, our two countries -- and I hope other countries in the Balkans -- are waiting to profit by the ideas of the white paper of President Delors. The extension of these principles of this white paper into the Balkans, which means an implementation of the East-West corridor and other branches, not only brings these countries closer to each other but brings our whole peninsula closer to Europe. We are very worried about the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Zhelev and I think that only strong action by NATO and a coordination of the cooperation of the United States, the European Union, and Russia will be able to bring an end to the crisis. We also consider very important the stability of the Republic of Macedonia. Both our countries have recognized and offered with pleasure that modest resource they have in the cooperation. However, we think that the Republic of Macedonia should expand and guarantee the freedoms and human and national rights of Albanians as a condition for its stability. The situation in Kosova is very grave. Ladies and gentlemen, today, when apartheid has disappeared from the world corners, it is in power in the cradle of the present Western civilization. I mean here the territories of the Balkans -- it is in Kosova. I can say that without the solution of this problem, there does not exist and cannot be a solution to the Balkan crisis. As long as the Albanians do not demand the change of borders through force, i.e., they respect one of the two most fundamental principles of the Helsinki Charter, the other one included as well, I think that this problem should be assessed as soon as possible. On the contrary, Milosevic will implement in Kosova the application of the memorandum of the Academy of Sciences of Serbia which, as you know, implies the creation of Greater Serbia through force by exterminating and cleansing 40 percent of the non-Serbian population that lives in these areas. We discussed with President Zhelev a series of agreements in the future. Albania and Bulgaria think that not separate alliances, but bilateral and multilateral cooperation, is what will be able to take our region out of the crisis and favor the integration processes over those of confrontation. At the same time, I want to clarify the presence of Turkish troops in Bosnia. Turkey gave a real and concrete contribution in the understanding between Croats and Muslims. I have considered and still consider very important the agreement that both sides who fought against each other signed to interrupt the war. I am convinced that if the Serbs sign this agreement, this will be the road of establishing peace and stability there. Mr. President, in closing I want to convey to all Bulgarians my best wishes on the Easter holiday. [end recording] After the news conference, the ceremony for the departure of President Berisha, his wife, and the delegation accompanying him was held in front of the presidential seat, where the welcoming ceremony was also held. President Zhelev, his wife, and the Bulgarian delegation attended the ceremony. The Albanian delegation then returned home.
