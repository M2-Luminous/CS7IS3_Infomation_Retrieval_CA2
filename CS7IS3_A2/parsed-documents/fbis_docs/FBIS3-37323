There are enough of these problems: the split within the ruling party which is gradually coming to a head plus the opposition's attacks on the government's domestic economic positions. Nevertheless, John Major is not downcast and he has arrived in Russia full, as always, of self-confidence and with a radiant smile. The official visit by the head of the British government is both symbolic and completely practical in nature. Problems of bilateral relations between Russia and Great Britain were discussed during the meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister John Major in the Kremlin on the morning of 15 February and also during talks with an enlarged delegation in attendance. Other items also figured on the agenda: the general situation in Europe, the CIS, and the other states of the former Soviet Union; joint efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and so forth. As was to be expexcted, special attention was paid to the Yugoslav crisis during these top-level talks. Our countries' concern over the situation in former Yugoslavia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular, is understandable. Common historical interests, traditional links, and influence in the Balkans draw Russia to this region gripped by civil war. However, Great Britain too has just as much interest in peace in former Yugoslavia. The 1st Motorized Infantry Battalion of the Cheshire Infantry Regiment and other subunits, numbering around 1,500 men, form part of the Blue Beret contingent in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, since last month the command of the UN Forces in Bosnia has been in the hands of a British general. A very great deal regarding the current situation in both Sarajevo and the republic as a whole depends on the way that Lieutenant General Michael Rose sees the situation and ways of overcoming the conflict. The Russian and British leaders acknowledge that we have a common main goal: the earliest possible end to bloodshed, the achievement of a just peace, and a politoical settlement of the crisis. However, there are also differences in the sides' approaches to the means of achieving that earliest possible end to bloodshed. Russia does not regard the NATO decision on the possibility of air strikes against Serbian ground positions as ideal. Nevertheless, despite all the reservations, there is in general a recognition of a lack of will or ability on the part of the United Nations to achieve success in the Yugoslav settlement, although it is premature to put this down to impotence. It is important that our dialogue -- equal, mutually respectful dialogue between partners -- continue, and not just with the United States but also with traditional European states friendly toward Russia, in whose ranks Great Britain rightly belongs.
