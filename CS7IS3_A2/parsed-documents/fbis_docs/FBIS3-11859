[Begin Roosen recording] Given the principles that regulate us, we believe the Special Powers Law is inappropriate. We urge Congress to delegate duties and to work as it did with special laws when it came to aiding the banking sector. Why can't this be done for tax laws? [end recording] Likewise, Consecomercio's representative has announced from 13 to 16 April this organization's annual Valencia Forum will be held. At this forum, during which more than 500 participants are expected, the reestablishment of suspended economic guarantees will be discussed. In conclusion, Roosen has said he agrees with lowering interest rates, because Venezuela will go from being a bondholder economy to a productive economy.
