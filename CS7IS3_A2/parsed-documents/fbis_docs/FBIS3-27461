The reform, begun in 1988, involves millions of citizens in the capital, including people in government departments and army units here. The reform includes housing funds collection both by the government and work units, setting up accumulation funds by employees, raising house rents, putting houses on sale, and building houses with cooperative funds. Its main aim is to step up commercialization of housing. By the end of 1993, this capital city had sold 150,000 apartments with floor space of 9 million square [sq] meters. Some 100,000 of these were sold last year -- four times more than the total of the previous four years. The city has received 1.7 billion yuan (about 200 million U.S. dollars) in all from the sales. It has also reaped 400 million yuan (about 47 million U.S. dollars) from raising house rents, some 120 million yuan (over 14 million U.S. dollars) of this increases being received in 1993. The rent of houses is usually raised by over 0.4 yuan per square meter per month, or 0.55 yuan per sq m. in suburbs and one yuan per sq m. for new houses. In addition, 1.5 million people in Beijing have joined a housing accumulation fund which has collected 80 million yuan (nearly 10 million U.S. dollars). The city plans to further expand the housing reform in the fields of establishment of housing accumulation funds, house sales and rent raising in line with the cost of house building and increases of people's incomes.
