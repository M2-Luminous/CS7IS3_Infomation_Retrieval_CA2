His plea, the second in three days, was made during a televised speech marking international working women's day when he declared that he will devote himself to these issues. Shortly after his disagreement with the State Duma over its amnesty for political rebels, Yeltsin proposed at a cabinet meeting held last Friday [4 March] to adopt a memorandum on domestic harmony. He said that this was particularly necessary in the present situation where the danger of confrontation is looming, referring to the release of former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov. Observers here noted that a mood of reconciliation and cooperation, not seen over the past two years, has been gaining ground amongst powerful political forces of the vast Russian Federation. In a report to the government, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin echoed the president's comments made in his state of the nation address on February 24. Sergey Glaziyev, chairman of the committee of the economic policy of the State Duma, said that the theme of the president's address on the state of the nation is consistent with the economic policies of the State Duma, or the lower house of parliament.
