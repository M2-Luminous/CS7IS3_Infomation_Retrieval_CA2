In an article headlined "We Are All Hostages of the Military- Industrial Complex", the newspaper describes it as a war-time budget. Comparing last year's and this year's state expenditure, the writer of the article arrives at a conclusion that no military reform is underway in the country and, as a consequence, there is no reduction in military expenditure. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, in another article, reports that an attempt by high-speed Japanese schooners to intrude into Russian territorial waters en masse was stopped in the area of south Kurils. The chief committee of Russia's frontier forces views the attempt as a test of vigilance of the forces involved in the Putina (Fishing Season)-94 anti-poaching operation. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army stationed in Tiraspol. "In the Dniester region, one should not act by strongarm tactics. It is necessary to democratise the situation. Historical experience indicates that all wars end with peace. Wise is the one who prevents a war and, if it still breaks out, brings it to an end as soon as possible and keeps peace for as long as possible," Lebed said. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Viktor Davydkin, deputy chairman of Russia's Choice movement, who said: "The democratic movement is heterogeneous and it is possible to unite it only on the basis of flexible, even loose blocs, movements, etc. We are in for a difficult struggle against nascent fascism in Russia. But this struggle can be effective only if we act in alliance with all anti-fascist forces." ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that Russia's first food quality control laboratory, financed by the European Union, has opened in the city of Pushchino near Moscow on the basis of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Bio-Chemistry and Physiology of Microorganisms and the Pushchino Agrocollege. The job of the laboratory is to analyse food passing through the customs and supplied to private shops from individually-operated farms. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comments on rumours about the possibility of an increase in the prices of bread in Russia: "Elementary economic calculations show that one tonne of Canadian grain in St. Petersburg will be under any circumstances 100,000 roubles cheaper than Krasnodar-produced one. "If the situation concerning the prime cost of nationally produced grain does not change and transportation tariffs continue to grow rapidly, loafs of imported bread will soon be on sale in commercial kiosks at prices that will be much more acceptable than those in a nearby bakery shop". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI interviewed Crimean Vice-Premier Yevgeniy Saburov who set out his vision of the Crimea's future. Saburov visualises the Crimea "first of all, as part of Ukraine, with transparent borders and dual citizenship, after European standards, well-established social and cultural contacts with Russia. Private international capital. Recreation, an elite agriculture, transport arteries, airports, seaports. The Crimea as a bridge of friendship between East and West". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Yuriy Tompakov, departmental chief at the Moscow prosecutor's office directorate for the supervision of investigation. His opinion is that "it is increasingly probable that criminal outfits may take the path of terrorist acts against prominent businessmen, bankers, representatives of political parties and public organisations, civil servants, and deputies. Attempts on the life of members of personnel of law enforcement agencies cannot be ruled out either". TRUD carries an interview with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev who said: "We have to change the structure of the armed forces, their manning system, withdraw troops from abroad and accommodate them at home, constantly maintain their fighting efficiency at proper level and at the same time tackle a lot of legislative and social issues. "We have brought back to Russia about 140 units at an aggregate strength of 280,000. All that is being done with more than modest funding. The shortage of funds results in lack of housing, poor accommodation, grievances and disappointments." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) reports that criminal groups in southern Russia try to counteract the Russian Interior Ministry Putina-94 anti-poaching operation in the Caspian. "This is why we have to use firearms when detaining poachers," Police Colonel Aleksandr Frolov, chief of the operation headquarters, told the newspaper. Several tens of firearms, including submachine-guns, were withdrawn from criminal groups during the operation in the Caspian. Ammunition for bear hunting was also confiscated at poachers' bases that had been discovered. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA runs an interview with Major-General Nikolay Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma committee on defence, who dwelt on Russo-Azerbaijani relations. "The language of ultimata is not the best one, still less in a most complex situation. It is high time the ministers of defence and foreign affairs gave explanations to the deputies about a number of problems that have piled up".
