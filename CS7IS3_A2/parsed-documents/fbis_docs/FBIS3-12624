Addressing the session, Khoshru said that the last Friday massacre of Palestinian worshipers in al-Khalil by the Zionists would not be the last if the approach of the international community towards the question of Palestine continues to be the same. He further noted that the circumstances surrounding the tragic incident clearly proved the fact that the attack was premeditated and led by the elements from Zionist army. "That the Israeli soldiers guarding the mosque not only did nothing to stop the massacre but as the Zionists confessed later, opened fire on the worshipers who were fleeing the scene, clearly indicates that the full responsibility over the massacre lies with the Zionist regime," he added. The ambassador also remarked that it was astonishing, while Zionists coming from a land thousands miles away were allowed to carry automatic guns, attack indigenous civilians in their mosque, but Palestinians were not allowed to live in their homeland and were subjected to continuous Zionist brutality. Khoshru voiced solidarity of both the Iranian people and government with the Palestinians and support for their struggles and expressed their deepest condolences to the bereaved families and Palestinian people on the occasion of the horrible massacre.
