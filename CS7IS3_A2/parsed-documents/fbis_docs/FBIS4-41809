Moroz Does Not Change His Views"] [Text] At a news conference in Kiev, chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council O. Moroz stated that his trip to several oblasts and to the Crimean Republic was a working one and that its aim was "to get the peoples' approval or disapproval of the trends in the work of the new parliament and government." In Moroz's opinion, he received such an approval, because people were in favor of "strengthening order and discipline in the state and harmony in all spheres of life, irrespective of where a person works." Consequently, according to the chairman, the parliament and the government will continue their efforts to overcome the crisis in a concerted and responsible manner, and it may take between one and a half and two years ultimately to curb the crisis phenomena, as the deputies agreed. Commenting on the situation in the country regarding presidential elections, Moroz stated that the talk on the absence of a clear-cut idea of what kind of president we need to elect is inappropriate, because there is a Constitution, which reads that the president is the head of both the state and executive power and, in order to change this norm, it is necessary to change the Main Law. Regarding rumors on the possibility of withdrawing from the presidential contest, Moroz joked: "It is a "canard," and the people who launched it suffer from "incontinence" of the "canard" ["utka" can mean both "canard" and "bed-pan"]. He added that he would not cede his votes to anyone, all the more so since, when he met with people, he "felt their genial support." Regarding the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Moroz was quite specific: The fleet cannot be divided, it must be used jointly, under joint command, and with double responsibility for its fate on the part of Ukraine and Russia. Moroz believes that, in resolving problems of the Black Sea Fleet, one must proceed from the fact that the Black Sea Fleet is a zone of specific interests of our two countries and that a military entity cannot be efficient if some officers in it are paid better than others. Moroz also said that Ukraine must develop its own naval forces. As for a possible creation of joint armed forces of the CIS, the chairman of the parliament pointed out that he never voiced such an idea, and since 1992, he has been advocating the concept of creating collective security forces. "The broader the international structures for security provision, the more reliable the security will be," Moroz concluded. As for the proposals by the speaker [Ivan Rybkin] of the Russian State Duma on the creation of a confederation of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, Moroz said: "Those who do not regret the disintegration of the Union are heartless. Those who want to restore the Union today are brainless." In the Ukrainian-Russian relations, the chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council, according to him, is in favor of resolving, first of all, economic problems and advocates Ukraine's coming out with the initiative of signing a multilateral document on economic cooperation, a document in which the main principle would be stated -- on the inviolability of the borders of the participant states. Nor did Moroz change his attitude toward the problem of nuclear disarmament, which, in his view, cannot be tackled contrary to Ukraine's interests. Commenting on the accusations against President Kravchuk voiced by the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN] to the effect that he had betrayed Ukraine by transferring tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, Moroz said that KUN is entitled to voicing its opinion in any form, but the president's actions "by their content, conform to such assessments." Moroz spoke in favor of Ukraine's pursuing such active external policy as would not allow anybody to ignore the interests of our state. The chairman of the parliament also answered other questions asked by journalists, and it became clear from his replies that, as a leader, he does not change his views from day to day depending upon the prevailing situation.
