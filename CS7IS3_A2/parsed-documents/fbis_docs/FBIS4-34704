"We must be realistic and postpone the implementation of Mercosur by four years, in order to be able to complete this stage of transition and then begin a stage of preparation," Sanguinetti said during a campaign speech. According to the former head of state, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, the four Mercosur member countries, "are not ready to close an agreement establishing a Common External Tariff (AEC)," which is an "essential" prerequisite for a common customs union in the region. Macroeconomic differences and the diverging objectives of the partner nations' productive mechanisms makes it necessary "to seek accommodation and a balance in all situations" before materializing a common market in America's Southern Cone, Sanguinetti warned. "We must compete among ourselves, but we must do it on an equal footing, and not before," Sanguinetti added. The remarks made by Sanguinetti, one of integration's staunchest supporter during his administration (1985-1990), provoked a commotion in Uruguay's political and entrepreneurial circles. Uruguay's Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu disagreed with Sanguinetti, confirming that "Mercosur is maintaining its deadlines." "We are committed to implementing the free trade treaty by 1 January 1995. We are working on it," Abreu said. Chamber of Industries spokesmen expressed support for the former president's initiative, and issued a communique stressing "the urgent need" to postpone the beginning of Mercosur in order to complete the retooling of existing plants and be able to successfully compete in a more demanding market. The deadlines get closer, but the disagreements among member countries on establishing a common AEC continue, as is shown by the poor results obtained in Buenos Aires by the four member countries' economic vice ministers on 17 June. Spokesmen for the meeting said that the representatives "made a lot of progress," but admitted there are still some hurdles to clear before agreement can be reached on an AEC that will satisfy the four Mercosur member countries' governments. Economic analysts consulted by AFP estimated that a free trade zone could be installed in the region by 1 January 1995, but ruled out the possibility of having a customs union consolidating the greatly heralded common market by that date. Four years ago Argentine President Carlos Menem, Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle, then Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello, and then Paraguayan President Andres Rodriguez signed a treaty in Asuncion committing their countries to creating a common market in the region by 1995. "We fervently support our countries' integration," Sanguinetti said. He demanded, however, "prudence" in the handling of the deadlines for installing it.
