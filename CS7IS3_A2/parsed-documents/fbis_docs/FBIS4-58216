FBIS4-58216 "drnes085yy_94005" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Sha'th Interviewed on PLO-Israel Agreement Sha'th Interviewed on PLO-Israel Agreement JN0205194094 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1727 GMT 2 May 94 JN0205194094 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, chief PLO negotiator at the Israeli-Palestinian Cairo talks, by Faridah al-Shubashi in Cairo on 2 May -- recorded] [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Two days separate us from the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What is the status of the negotiations and what have the two sides accomplished so far? [Sha'th] We are about to reach a full agreement that will cover all aspects of life in Gaza and Jericho and will be ready for the signature of President 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin Wednesday morning, 4 May. This agreement now is in its final stages. Of course some issues require final decisions [words indistinct] issues related to stationing a Palestinian officer on the Allenby bridge and crossings, [words indistinct] on the Gaza coast. Other issues will be completed before reaching this agreement, God willing. This agreement will also include the agreements reached by the Palestinian and Israeli delegations in the Paris economic talks. The entire economic agreement will become one of the elements of this agreement, which we will sign here. The agreement will also cover all the civilian and security issues and all the powers the Palestinian authority will exercise. All security issues related to the Israeli withdrawal and the [word indistinct] and deployment of the Palestinian police, as well as the agreement on releasing the detainees. What remains is the drafting of certain articles related to the preamble of the agreement and some agreements that were agreed on in principle between President 'Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres here in Cairo; that is, the Palestinian passport, its form and details; the international presence agreed on in Gaza and Jericho and its details; the Palestinian postage stamp and the Palestinians' right to international postal union; and certain issues related to special Palestinian powers at the Rafah crossing. We agreed that the Rafah crossing will be open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and will be open not only for people but for trucks, goods, and private vehicles. The special crossing between Gaza and Jericho was agreed to be open 365 days a year for people, goods, and vehicles. The final touches will be put on all these issues today and tomorrow. [Al-Shubashi] In the news conference held when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Peres were present in Cairo--held jointly with President Mubarak--'Arafat said that he hoped for tangible progress so that he could present it to his people. Does this mean that the Palestinian president is still unable to say that he has anything to present to his people? [Sha'th] Until this moment we are still negotiating. We have not implemented [word indistinct] to put what we negotiated into practice. Will this really happen the morning after the agreement, that is, Thursday or Friday after the signing ceremony on Wednesday? The Palestinians [word indistinct] thousands of detainees will be let out of prisons; hundreds of deportees will return to their children; 6,000 Palestinian soldiers and officers will return to the homeland with their families. The doors will be open and the Israeli withdrawal will take a speedy form and there will be daily hand-overs of camps occupied by the Israeli Army to the Palestinian people and police. The Palestinian authority will enter led by brother Yasir 'Arafat. This authority will take over all the powers the Israelis have been exercising. The Palestinian citizen will feel the great difference, and the long hours of suffering as a result of searches and interrogation, more searching and interrogations, will end. The economic assistance will begin pouring in and the Palestinian economic institutions will be established to provide a decent living for our people gradually. Many things will happened. The Gaza airport will be opened after a short time from the entry of ... [pauses] and [word indistinct] in Gaza and Jericho, travel between Gaza and Jericho and then travel between Gaza and Cairo. Preparations will begin to establish an international airport as soon as possible. Ships will start arriving at Gaza in preparation for the opening of the Gaza international harbor. The fishermen will suddenly have the right to fish up to 20 miles without restrictions. The shores will open and the major part of the security restrictions that prevented the people of Gaza even from eating fish will end. They will find that the shore is theirs. The Israeli presence, which is sitting on their chests in the camps and streets, will end and they will find their children wearing the Palestinian uniform, Palestinian flags, and the Palestinian insignia offering protection for them instead of pursuing and repressing them everywhere. All of this and much more will be what brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] sees as the tangible results on the ground. [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil, last question: What was the U.S. stand that the U.S. secretary of state brought him? Has the United States begun to realize that the Palestinian problem should be solved with at least a minimum of justice? [Sha'th] No doubt there is a feeling that the lost time is over and there can be no possibility for any more delay. The implementation of the Declaration of Principles should go ahead and implementation of other steps in the Palestinian arena should continue in terms of an early transfer of power in the West Bank and Israeli's withdrawal from the West Bank cities and villages, and then the final solution for the Palestinian problem should begin in a complete manner. We have heard from Peres that Israel will shorten the transitional period from five to three years. This means that we must begin negotiating on the West Bank immediately. This is for the Palestinian arena... [Al-Shubashi, interrupting] Including the removal of the settlements? [Sha'th] No doubt, the issue of the settlements will immediately enter the final negotiations. There is no solution without a full removal of these settlements. Moreover, Jerusalem is at the heart of our actions. Measures related to Jerusalem must begin immediately and negotiations on Jerusalem must begin immediately. In principles, all restriction on the city of Jerusalem and the other West Bank cities must end. By the way, there will be no barriers between Gaza, Jericho, and the West Bank. There will be no measurers relating to entry and departure from these territories. We are applying the measures pertaining to the fact that, even at the first stage, the West Bank and Gaza are an integrated whole, inseparable, and whole territorial entity. But I say that the United States clearly is interested in beginning the solution in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Therefore, Christopher's travel to Damascus, then to Israel, and then to Damascus is to emphasize the idea of a comprehensive solution and the need for implementation to begin on the Syrian front and on the Jordanian and Lebanese front and not only on the Palestinian front. [Al-Shubashi] Why has Israel criticized Egypt's recent role and protested against it? [Sha'th] I do not know. All I can imagine is that Egypt has never denied that it has been working to support Palestinian rights and has never said it was a neutral state. It is true that it is tied to Israel by a treaty -- which Egypt has respected fully and proven that through peace, rights and security for all will be realized -- but Egypt never said that it was a neutral state between the Palestinians and Israel and has worked throughout the negotiations to back Palestinian rights. If this sometimes angers the Israelis then let it be. [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Dr. Nabil Sha'th.
