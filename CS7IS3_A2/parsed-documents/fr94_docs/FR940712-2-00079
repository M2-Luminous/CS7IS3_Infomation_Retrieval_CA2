FR940712-2-00079 FR940712-2-00057 Federal Employees Retirement System; Alternative Forms of Annuity Factors AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is providing notice of adjusted present value factors applicable to employees who elect the alternative form of annuity under section 8343a of title 5, United States Code. This notice is necessary to conform the present value factors to changes in economic assumptions approved by the Board of Actuaries. EFFECTIVE DATE: Revised present value factors will apply to anyone whose annuity commences October 1, 1994, or later. ADDRESSES: Send requests for actuarial assumptions and data to the Office of the Actuary, Room 4307 STOP, Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Harold L. Siegelman, (202) 606&hyph;0299. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 842.706(a) of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, prescribes the method for computing the reduction in the beginning rate of annuity payable to a retiree who elects an alternative form of annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8420a. That reduction is required in order to produce an annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the annuity of a retiree who does not elect an alternative form of annuity. The present value factors currently used to compute the reduction were published by OPM (56 FR 8223) on February 27, 1991. On September 20, 1993, OPM published (at 58 FR 49066) a notice in the Federal Register to revise the normal cost percentage under the FERS Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99&hyph;335, based on changed economic assumptions approved by the Board of Actuaries. Those changed economic assumptions require corresponding changes in the present value factors used to compute an alternative form of annuity. OPM is, therefore, revising the tables of present value factors to read as follows: Table I._FERS Present Value Factors Applicable to all Retirees Except Those Described in Table II 1Age at retirement 1Present value of a monthly annuity 1Age at retirement 1Present value of a monthly annuity 40 169.2 66 143.6 41 168.8 67 139.1 42 168.4 68 134.6 43 168.1 69 130.1 44 167.7 70 125.4 45 166.9 71 120.7 46 166.1 72 116.0 47 165.4 73 111.4 48 164.7 74 106.8 49 163.7 75 102.2 50 162.4 76 97.8 51 161.9 77 93.5 52 161.6 78 89.2 53 161.2 79 85.0 54 160.6 80 80.9 55 160.0 81 77.0 56 160.0 82 73.1 57 160.2 83 69.4 58 160.4 84 65.8 59 161.2 85 62.4 60 162.7 86 59.1 61 163.5 87 56.0 62 161.3 88 53.0 63 157.1 89 50.2 64 152.5 90 47.5 65 148.0 Table II._FERS Present Value Factors Applicable to Individuals Retiring Before Age 62 Who are Eligible for COLA's1 1Age at retirement 1Present value of a monthly annuity 40 245.2 41 241.9 42 238.5 43 235.0 44 231.5 45 227.9 46 224.2 47 220.3 48 216.5 49 212.6 50 208.6 51 204.5 52 200.3 53 196.1 54 191.8 55 187.4 56 183.1 57 178.6 58 174.2 59 169.7 60 165.1 61 160.4 1In Accordance with 5 U.S.C. 8462( c )(3)( B )( ii ); i.e., Military Reserve Technicians Who Retire Under 5 U.S.C. 8414( c ) by Reason of Disability, Law Enforcement Officers, Firefighters, And Air Traffic Controllers.
