Although the inappropriate attitude of the Western nations towards our peaceful nuclear program is given as the reason for this principled decision, however, we believe that our policy-makers should continue to build the nuclear power plant on our own despite the support offered by other countries. The few nations that have attained nuclear capability cannot be trusted. The moral perversion these countries have demonstrated in order to deprive the third world of cheap modern technology need not be mentioned here. Their treatment of Muslim countries is openly prejudiced. Therefore, we should not trust these countries in any situation. The irreparable loss we have suffered in the area of peaceful use of nuclear technology was caused mainly by the unfair attitude of the Western nations, however, our governments' ambiguous policies also played a role in it. Had our policy-makers started to attain nuclear technology when France and Canada had refused to cooperate with us, we would not be facing this energy crisis now. This energy shortage has all but stopped our developmental projects.
