It is a strategic program aimed at bringing about prosperity for our multiethnic people as well as building and developing the country. With the implementation of this line over the past five to six years, our country has ushered in an era of switching to the state-regulated market economy mechanism. With this mechanism, we have advanced toward the achievement of an economic and cultural structure intended to produce a large quantity of goods in order to create conditions for an accumulation of funds to develop the country. The existing line and the law on the management of foreign investment have created favorable conditions to attract and encourage more and more foreigners to invest in Laos. Over the past five to six years, domestic and foreign businessmen have been allowed to invest in more than 350 projects in our country. During the first part of this year alone, the Planning and Cooperation Committee has given permission for foreign businessmen to invest in a total of 43 projects in our country worth $116 million. Of these, 27 projects have a total cost of less than $1 million, 13 projects have a total cost of $1-5 million, and three projects have a total cost of more than $5 million. Total investment has doubled compared to last year; last year it was $50 million. It has increased almost four times over the first year in which foreign businessmen were allowed to invest in our country. Investments by foreign businessmen in our country are mainly in the agricultural, forestry, industrial, and handicrafts fields. They have also invested in the services, such as in tourism, hotels, and banks. Most investors in our country come from Thailand, followed by China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. To make foreign management and investment efficient and to provide legal guarantees for the just interests of each side, in early March the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] National Assembly endorsed a law on the promotion and management of foreign investment in Laos. It was an amendment of the old law on foreign investment, making it more suitable and in conformity with the current new conditions regarding economic relations and cooperation with foreign countries. In addition, to increase investor confidence, the general provisions in Article Three, Chapter One of the new law on the promotion and management of foreign investment stipulate that foreign assets and investment in Laos be fully protected by the laws and regulations of the LPDR. They may not be requisitioned, confiscated, or nationalized by the state unless it is necessary to use them in the public's interest. In that case, foreign investors will be compensated promptly in a rational and honest manner. All of this shows that our party and state are pleased to cooperate with all countries that have the good intentions to achieve mutual benefit and respect each other's laws. Although the law on promotion and management of foreign investment has been amended in recent years as more foreigners have invested in our country and the total value of investment has increased, we still have many shortcomings that should be settled attentively. An example of such a weak point is that approval for foreign investors to invest in our country has been authorized in a hasty manner, without a careful examination or study of the concrete details. As a result, brokers have taken advantage of the situation to make contacts for foreign companies to gain such rights. But when they gain the rights, instead of giving them to the companies they work for, they sell them to companies in other countries. This has cost foreign companies many years before they could begin making investments. Worse still, when the brokers fail to sell the rights, they do not report the delay or cancellation of the investment rights to the authorities. As a result, those who really want to invest in these projects miss their chance. It has also created difficulty and confusion in the work sectors concerned. Approval of various foreign investment projects should be clearly fixed on the basis of what levels are authorized by the central level or the provincial level. Another weak point is the confusion in the management process. There are too many steps to take and too many authorities that must sign papers. Moreover, there is a shortage of cadres working in this branch. The cadres also have limited knowledge and capability, thus inconveniencing investors. There is an indication that foreign investment in Laos will expand in the future. In view of this, in order to cooperate with foreign countries appropriately and more effectively, it is necessary to implement the law on promotion and management of foreign investment even more strictly. The shortcomings must be quickly settled. Appropriate methods must be studied and put into actual practice in order to create conveniences for foreign investors and make them confident that they will obtain reasonable income that will gain by investing in Laos in accordance with state laws. In addition, direct investment in various forms of cooperation by foreign countries must be promoted. Emphasis must be placed on investment in the agricultural, forestry, and hydroelectric fields as well as in the construction of the economic and cultural infrastructure in order to produce goods for export. Investment in the services field must also be promoted. This will create the conditions for an accumulation of assets for the construction and development of our country to make it stronger with each passing day.
