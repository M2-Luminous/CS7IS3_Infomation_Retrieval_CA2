The most prevalent has been the proposition concerning the revival of great-power ambitions. It is maintained that Moscow's "imperial policy" is not some new phenomenon, it is inherent, it is said, in the very nature of the Russian state. The democratic focus of Russia's foreign policy is being called in question on these grounds. Some Western politicians are even outlining the standards of behavior in international affairs which Russia does not have the right to transgress. For disobedience, such punishments as an end to the organization of the strategic partnership with Moscow, the accelerated admittance of the Central and East European countries to NATO, a revision of the plans for rendering Russia economic assistance, and much else are threatened. Our opponents are particularly irritated by the fact that Russia is today organizing its foreign policy in accordance with its national priorities, giving relations with the states of the CIS and the Baltic pride of place. This has afforded a pretext for Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Lithuanian opposition, to talk about realization of a "Kozyrev-Zhirinovskiy doctrine for the purpose of restoration of the Union." Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski is constantly talking about the imperialist trends in Russia's foreign policy. Individual participants in a recent international security conference in Munich displayed their inordinate concern at the way in which Russia is defending its national interests. Quite sharply worded anti-Russian statements were heard at an international seminar on Central Asia and the Caucasus in Tehran. They boil down to Russia being fingered as the principal source of danger for the independence and sovereignty of the CIS countries. Inventions concerning recompense for those same imperial ambitions of Moscow and its involvement in the incitement of regional conflicts are being whipped up. People in the near abroad are also, to our great distress, being pulled into this unseemly campaign at times. Lennart Meri, president of Estonia, and Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine Foreign Affairs Committee, like to expatiate apropos Moscow's "imperial subterfuges." Russia, like any important power, has its own geopolitical reference points. Moscow cannot formulate its foreign policy on assurances of like-mindedness and solidarity. Together with a concurrence of interests it has also specific zones of priority attention. This, it would seem, is an attribute of international relations. The United States, for example, has repeatedly declared Latin America and the Near East regions of its direct interests. According to American press information, Washington has ranked far-off Lithuania here also. Vilnius deems relations with countries of Central and North Europe a priority. In Warsaw Hanna Suchocka, former prime minister, constructed four main areas of Poland's foreign policy activity. The Russian area is mentioned only in the context of the Republic of Poland's membership of NATO. American observers, incidentally, do not reject the concept recognizing the right to exist of regional spheres of influence of the leading world powers, Russia included. Its essence is that in their zones they are in that case required to act in accordance with the rules of international law and under the scrutiny of the world community in the shape of regional associations. It is symptomatic that British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd considers the fact of Russia's interests in the Baltic region perfectly normal. Attributing neoimperial postulates to Moscow in this context is not only unethical but inappropriate. It is not pursuing tactics of intimidation or domination in any regions of the world and is not undermining the independence of other states. Russia does not have territorial claims on anyone, and its new military doctrine is geared exclusively to defensive purposes. Which cannot be said about that same Estonia, which is making territorial claims on a number of areas of Pskov Oblast. One wonders how far these claims are compatible with the aspiration to become a full member of NATO, not to mention the Helsinki accords and the Paris Charter for a New Europe. Russia is oriented toward the European system of general security which is being formed. It treats respectfully the forms of international interaction which are being tested. But the West sometimes thinks differently. Attempts are made at times to impose its viewpoint on Russia at the time of the discussion of problems of the former Yugoslavia and the Libya and Iraq situation. Such a policy without Moscow is doomed to fail. It would inevitably lead to a new spiraling of opposition in Europe. Russia's expansion is discerned also in its peace-making efforts at "flash points" of the former USSR. The epithets with which Moscow is being rewarded for its mediating mission in the disengagement of the belligerents are innumerable. It is being recalled constantly that the CSCE has the key role in a settlement of the conflicts on the territory of the CIS. But Russia has never disputed the significance of such missions of this organization, as, equally, CSCE circles recognize Russia's efforts for a settlement of the conflict situations in certain former Soviet republics. But the CSCE alone is not in a position to extinguish the interethnic clashes in the former USSR. Local national leaders have been forced into this conclusion also, although there is not complete unanimity between them, of course. In a joint message to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, Eduard Shevardnadze and Boris Yeltsin proposed consideration as soon as possible in the UN Security Council of the issue of a peacekeeping operation performed by the United Nations or with its approval in Abkhazia based, if need be, on a Russian military contingent. There has been no adequate response in the West as yet to Russia's sincere desire to establish peace at operational points of the CIS. There is, I believe, just one reason: fear of Russian hegemony on the territory of the post-Soviet space. Russia's endeavor to protect the elementary rights of the Russian-speaking population in Estonia, Latvia, and other republics of the former USSR has been christened "great-power approach" in certain overseas circles. Moscow's efforts in this direction, of a diplomatic nature, as a rule, are seen as nothing other than "political pressure, economic blackmail, and aggressive intentions," and Estonia unabashedly employs the term "intervention" even. And this despite the fact that only 42,300 Russians have Estonian citizenship, whereas the total number of Russians in the Republic of Estonia constitutes approximately half a million. And it is very odd that such discrimination is proving no hindrance to the process of enlisting the Baltic in Western security structures which has begun. The concerted actions of the West in defense of the suffrage and civil rights of the nonindigenous population in the Baltic would undoubtedly weaken the anti-Russian campaign there and would be a serious test of the viability of the policy of partnership. The findings of international civil rights organizations are going in one ear and out the other in Tallinn and Riga, meanwhile. And more pressure is being put on Russia in respect to withdrawal of the troops. It is not that far off, but Russian people will remain here. And if the discrimination against them continues, will this not threaten a repetition. Other countries have repeatedly demonstrated to the world far from legal means and methods for defense of the interests of their citizens. And public protests were barely audible. Russia's position on this issue, however, is for some reason or other invariably equated with "imperial policy." It is hardly expedient to prompt Moscow to come to believe in its "hegemonism."
