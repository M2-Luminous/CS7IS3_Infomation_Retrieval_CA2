"We have a duty to isolate religion from and keep it safe against political upheavals, whims and changes so that the people will not lose confidence in their faith or suspect religious teachings," said Nasir-al-Din al-Asad, president of the Royal Academy for Islamic Civilisation Research (Al al-Bayt Foundation). Deputising for His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the Regent, at the opening of the three-day meeting, Dr. al-Asad said Muslim scholars and the heads of the Christian faith have contributed towards bringing closer together the views of the two sides and achieving better understanding between them. It is hoped that these dialogues in which many senior personalities from the two faiths and their societies participate would help scrutinise those issues that have remained outstanding and unclear and open the way for a better comprehension of the principles on which the two religions are based, said Dr. al-Asad. Commenting on Jordan's endeavours to protect the holy places in Jerusalem under the Hashemite rule, Dr. al-Asad referred in particular to the recent royal decree for the formation of a commission to handle the affairs of the holy city, grouping Christian and Muslim individuals. He noted that the present dialogue is dedicated to discussing religions' stand vis-a-vis nationalities, adding that religions do not conflict with nationalistic feelings, but rather advocate ending extremism, ethnic differences and other forms of conflicts. Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican Council on Promoting Relations with other faiths, who is attending the meetings, told the first session that Christianity does not oppose positive nationalities which do not oppose the law of God. Christianity, he said, rather opposes those feelings of superiority over other ethnic groups because such feelings transform nationality into oppressive movements that work against man and God. A total of 65 scholars are participating in the discussions held at the King 'Abdallah Mosque in Amman. They are all scholars from Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Bosnia, Turkey, Senegal, Sudan, Morocco, Syria, Lebanon, the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, Spain, Nigeria and France.
