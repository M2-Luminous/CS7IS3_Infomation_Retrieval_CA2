Dhlakama said the Renamo soldiers are already in assembly points awaiting to enter the venues corresponding to the second stage. Dhlakama was speaking at a news conference granted to Mozambican and foreign journalists, and said that his troops are facing a situation of misery. He spoke once again about the alleged mismanagement by the UN Operations in Mozambique -- for carrying water in helicopters from the city of Beira to the Chiramba assembly point, for the blue helmets stationed in the area. Dhlakama said he has spoken with UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello, and added that the issue has already been reported in New York. In another development, Afonso Dhlakama said the issue of the Malawi Young Pioneers is Mozambique Liberation Front propaganda to denigrate Renamo.
