FBIS3-59249 "drweu019__a94005" FBIS-WEU-94-019-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 January 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs Ministerial Sessions To Meet on EC Accession BR2801101094 Brussels EUROPE in English 27 Jan 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR2801101094 Brussels EUROPE Language: English Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "EC/Enlargement: Conclusion of Negotiations in a Marathon From 25 to 28 February (With Possible Prolongation to Beginning-March -- The Commission Intends Completing the Draft `Joint Positions' This Week"; as released by Brussels TEXTLINE database)] [Text] In order to respect the beginning-March deadline, set by the heads of government for concluding accession negotiations, the Council's Greek Presidency has decided to convene two extra ministerial sessions in February, after the one already planned for 7 February. These will take place on 21-22 February and from 25 to 28 February (thus including Saturday and Sunday), with the possibility of a prolongation to beginning-March "by stopping the clock." Each session will comprise separate meetings with each of the four candidate countries: Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. In principle, negotiations should end with the four candidates at the same time. For its part, the European Commission said that it proposed completing drawing up the draft "joint positions" under its competency this week (including the supplements relating to agriculture), so that the Council is in possession of all the texts. The budgetary aspects (participation by the candidate countries in common expenses) will, however, not be included in this package. It is, moreover, worth mentioning that: - Greek Secretary General for European Affairs Yannos Kranidiotis confirmed that Greece had asked that the future financing of the Arctic regions under regional policy be the subject of an ad hoc fund. This request is said to be supported by the so-called cohesion countries (Spain, Portugal, Ireland). According to the current rules, only those regions where per capita income is less than 75 percent of the Community average can benefit from funding under objective n.1 of regional policy; however, this is not the case for the Arctic regions in the candidate countries, whence the need for an ad hoc fund; - Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, having met European Commissioner Hans van den Broek, reaffirmed that his country regarded as essential keeping subsidies for its farmers throughout the territory. Regarding this, Finland rejects the Commission's proposal (which is not yet a "joint position" by the Twelve): According to Mr. Aho (who then went on to France and Spain) his position is finding increasing understanding among member states and he had "reason to believe" that the Commission itself would revise its position; - Mr. Kranidiotis and Mr. Van den Broek confirmed that the state of negotiations was not uniform: Norway in particular is behind. Whatever, Mr. Van den Broek told MEPs [members of European Parliament], it is up to the candidate countries themselves to decide on breaking the parallelism for closing negotiations. The text of the agreements will not be available in March, and Van den Broek urges MEPs to consider the possibility of beginning the examination procedures on the basis of a comprehensive report. Speaking to the European Parliament's Committee on External Economic Relations, Commissioner Van den Broek declared that, whatever happened, the texts of the agreements would not be available at the beginning of March. It involves around 10,000 pages to be drawn up in 9 languages; even if negotiations end on 28 February, we shall need to wait for early May before having all the texts at our disposal. He then urged the MEPs to consider the possibility of starting the procedures (with a view to an "assent" in the EP) as soon as negotiations ended, on the basis of a comprehensive report from the Commission and Council, it being understood that the assent would only come in May, when all the texts were available. There is therefore no question of asking Parliament to decide on the principle of accession as suggested by some jurists; whatever the interpretation of Article O of the Maastricht Treaty, it would be politically unthinkable that the compulsory assent should not be based on the complete and definitive results of negotiations.
