In talks with NATO Secretary General Woerner, European Union [EU] Commission President Delors, and members of the European Parliament, Scharping promised continuity in foreign policy if the SPD takes over the government after the Bundestag elections in October. The SPD candidate for the chancellor's office particularly mentioned the special relationship with France in European policy, Germany's integration in NATO, and the special relations with the United States, as well as striving for reliable cooperation with the states in Central and East Europe. The Atlantic Alliance is more than just a defense alliance -- it is a decisive element of European security policy, Scharping said. In addition to a "substantial presence" of the United States and Canada in Europe, Russia, too, must play a "special role," Scharping stated. Asked in which respect the foreign policy concepts of the Federal Government and the SPD opposition are different, the politician said that concurrence in the basic orientation is "not bad." However, Scharping criticized the Federal Government's negative attitude toward certain ideas of the EU Commission to stimulate economic growth as well as the inappropriate "style and tone" of Foreign Minister Kinkel's negotiations in the internal EU quarrel over future voting in the Council of Ministers. In addition, he complained that Chancellor Kohl is increasingly alone in the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union with his dedication to European policy because there "the trend toward nationalism has clearly" become "stronger." Previously, speaking to members of the Social Democratic group of the European Parliament, Scharping clearly advocated the enlargement of the EU by Austria, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. A few days before the vote in Strasbourg, he called on the still hesitating deputies -- mainly from France, Belgium, and Italy -- to approve the membership treaties. Criticism of the insufficient "deepening" of the EU and the politically and juridically dubious compromise on the future blocking minority in the Council of Ministers is not reason enough to postpone the vote next Wednesday [4 May]. "Deepening" and "enlarging" the EU are, furthermore, not a contradiction. The Central and East European reform states, too, must not be left alone by the EU; they must be given a clear prospect for membership soon, even if they will probably not be mature enough for full membership in the next 10 years. One must not be discouraged by problems in everyday politics in the West and stick to the "great vision and opportunity" to bring together the peoples and states in the West and East. The parliament must be involved in the EU reforms planned for 1996; its rights in the legislative process must be strengthened. Mr. Haensch, the top candidate of the Social Democrats for the European election on 12 June, said that in the future the European deputies must be able to make decisions, on an equal footing with the Council of Ministers, in those fields where the governments make majority decisions. The requirement that all 12 governments have to agree unanimously is to be limited to amendments to the EU Treaty as well as to certain decisions that affect finances.
