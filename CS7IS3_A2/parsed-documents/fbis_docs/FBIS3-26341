Born in 1939 in Chongqing, Sichuan, Wu was the son of a driver. He moved to Nanjing with the family. His mother was a housewife all her life, raising all of her eight children with her own hands. After graduating from Nanjing No. 2 secondary school in 1955, Wu enrolled in the French Department of the Beijing Institute of Foreign Languages, and was sent to Budapest by the Communist Youth League Central Committee in 1961 as a French interpreter for China's resident delegates at the World Youth Federation of Democracy. He returned to the country in 1965. Wu Jianmin spent one third of his more than 30-year diplomatic career at the UN Headquarters in New York. Twice he worked with China's permanent UN delegation, first in the early seventies as the official in charge of the Middle East and southern Africa affairs. During this period he was promoted from 3d secretary to 2d secretary. When the UN Assembly was in session, Wu would represent China in various political panel discussions. The second time was in the mid eighties, when he worked as a political affairs attache. In 1979, Wu Jianmin was transferred to the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to take charge of its European affairs. His main duty, however, was in protocol work. Four years later he returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work at its political studies section. His first "exposure" to the world occurred on 21 March 1991 at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs' routine weekly press conference at the Beijing International Club. In the ensuing two and a half years, until 21 October 1993, he presided over 122 press conferences. Wu said being a spokesman was a "most challenging job." "Each time he felt the enormous weight of responsibility," "for sitting there on the podium represents the interests of our country and countrymen." That is why each time he was "very careful and serious, as if walking on thin ice..." People close to Wu from the diplomatic circles described him as being able to conduct himself very well at live press conferences, quick in mind, and fast in reaction. Many foreign reporters give him a thumbs-up for his brilliant performance. But Wu said: "I have never been totally satisfied with any of my press conferences. I always feel there is something to improve on." Shi Yanhua, Wu Jianmin's wife, is now head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry Translation Department. She graduated from the English Department of the Beijing Institute of Foreign Languages and was assigned to work at the Foreign Affairs Ministry Education Office. In her 15-year career as a translator, Shi participated in many party and state leaders' meetings with foreign guests, and attended many important international conferences as a member of the entourages of Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian, and others during their visits. From the late seventies and early eighties, Shi was the translator for Deng Xiaoping in all his meetings with U.S. officials and political leaders. Wu Jianmin and Shi Yanhua have a daughter, who graduated from the Beijing Economics and Trade University and is working.
