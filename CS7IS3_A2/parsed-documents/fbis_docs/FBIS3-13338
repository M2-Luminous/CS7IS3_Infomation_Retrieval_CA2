Does it mean that a major defect is still there? [Muhammad] First, I would like to briefly explain that the conflict in Yemen has not ended. It is common knowledge that this conflict is taking place between two major orientations. The first is leading a drive for modernization, building the institutions and the state of law and order, and creating a system of domestic and foreign relations. The basis of this orientation is the emerging democracy and its ideas. Democracy has become one of the phenomena of the age. The first orientation aspires for change, leaving the 20th century and entering the next century, and creating new circumstances for the coming generations. The second orientation is the conservative orientation, represented by the General People's Congress, the Reform Grouping, and their allies. Those supporting this orientation are ready to do anything to maintain the current situation and the existing system. In sum, they want to return Yemen to the situation which existed in the former Yemeni Arab Republic. Hence, this orientation views changes and evolution with fear and caution. They fear that they might lose certain interests, which they grabbed after they controlled the existing institutions, especially the tribal and military institutions. Therefore, they do not want to permit the emergence of civilian institutions in accordance with a modern democratic system. [Reporter] What has made matters often escalate to a military confrontation, and sometimes to security disorder? [Muhammad] There has been systematic and premeditated terrorism. Terrorist operations have been pre-arranged. Assassinations, explosions, highway robberies, lootings, rapes, and other forms of terrorism occurred. Moreover, these operations took a serious turn and began to include domestic and foreign investments. Besides, foreign experts have been kidnapped and companies, especially oil companies, have been threatened. Tourists and foreign embassies have been threatened. The main objective is to destroy the unity process, abort democracy, and hinder any attempt for change. This is in order to maintain their control of the country and to bring everybody under their authority. [Reporter] Do you believe that a final solution has been provided by the signing of the document, or is the country and its unity still in danger? [Muhammad] Let us be frank, certain parties inside the General People's Congress and the Reform Grouping are not satisfied with the document. Their signing of it does not mean that everything will proceed well. Some influential parties reject the contents of the document. This explains the continued military confrontations and military incidents. Those parties will continue their attempts to exacerbate the security situation and create problems in order to keep people preoccupied, evade implementation of the document, and, at the same time, put the blame on us. This is evidenced by the fact that the other party has no desire or intention to take to justice those pepole involved in cases of assassinations and explosions, they have no intention of making reforms, and they continue military provocations. [Reporter] Some say that al-Bid's failure to come to Sanaa gives the other side a justification for not implementing the document? [Muhammad] I want to ask: Who guarantees al-Bid's life if he goes to Sanaa? Who can go to Sanaa when he feels that his head is wanted? We say that they must implement all items of the document before al-Bid goes to Sanaa. The guarantee is implementation of all clauses of the document, especially since we are still witnessing assassinations, houses and offices being blown up, and other practices which cannot be approved by any norms or laws whatsoever. [Reporter] Do you deem the signed agreement an absolute guarantee for maintaining unity and removing the threat of separation? What are the external effects on the situation in Yemen? [Muhammad] The agreement is not a medical prescription. Having it signed does not mean that it has become the only guarantee for maintaining unity. The threat of separation is still there. Although the agreement has been signed, nothing has changed yet. This agreement provides guidelines and programs which need political will to be implemented. They also require balanced internal and external support. This is what we are trying to do through our recent and current tours. We want a presence by our brothers in Arab Gulf states. This covers, for example, neighboring states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, as well as the Gulf Cooperation Council states. Eritrea, Egypt, Syria, and then the Arab League and the world, such as the United States, some European countries, and even Russia are also needed. These countries can help Yemen's peaceful unity process. This is because we have common interests. Besides, we must reassure our neighbors that our unity does not threaten them if it is based on reason, good-neighborliness, good relations, and cooperation. Why should our relations with our neighbors not be excellent? It is not in our interest to be anyone's enemy. This is what we believe in and work to see happen. Hence our tours.
