During an inspection of the 6th Army Corps of the Odessa Military District he granted an exclusive interview to our correspondent Marat Pohorelov. [Begin Radetskiy recording] In the first instance we handed a presentation document Partnership for Peace which clearly stipulates our stand at the current stage. This presentation document, if one has a close look at it [pauses], and this testifies to the fact that we will still be revising it and, along with the improvement of the economic situation in the state, our views of our participation in the Partnership for Peace will be changing. I met the acting secretary [as heard], and we had an approximately 30-minute talk with him. He listened to me very attentively, and questioned me about the situation in the state as a whole and about the state of affairs in the armed forces. He paid special attention to the current situation in Crimea and shared our views, our thoughts, and our concern over this issue. I met Secretary of Defense Perry. I had meetings with 12 defense ministers. We were discussing issues of military cooperation, all of them being directly related to the state of affairs in our country as a whole, its economic and political state. Information supplied about Crimea seems to be one-sided. It mostly comes from the Russian Federation, and the Russian Federation is expressing thoughts which are useful to them, which are of interest to them today, which are to their advantage. As far as the real state of affairs is concerned, what is being done, who is providing Crimea economically, what is the situation there, what kind of troops are there. By the way, nobody was dispatching any troops there, we did not send even a single extra soldier there, not a single armored vehicle, not a single tank, not a single submachinegun was dispatched there [sentence as heard]. And I would express a wish that Ukraine should supply more comprehensive information: Television, radio, the Ukrainian press should supply more clear-cut information about what is being done in our state and pay special attention to the Crimean issue.
