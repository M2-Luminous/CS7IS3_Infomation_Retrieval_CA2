FR940128-1-00004 FR940128-1-00001 District # 7_The State of Arizona, the remainder of the State of California, including San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino counties, and the State of New Mexico. The Board has recommended that the new districts become effective for the three-year term of office which begins on January 1, 1995. If adopted, this proposal would affect the eligibility of three current Board members and could necessitate Board member nomination meetings for Districts 4, 5, 6, and 7 in spring 1994. In the normal cycle of nominating approximately one-third of the Board members each year, spring 1994 nomination meetings were already planned for Districts 2 and 3. In addition, if this proposal is adopted, it will be necessary to make a conforming change to §1210.401. Section 1210.401 currently states that the districts are defined in §1210.320 of the Plan. Since, this rule would define new district boundaries in a new §1210.501, this rule would also change §1210.401(b) to reflect this new section number.
