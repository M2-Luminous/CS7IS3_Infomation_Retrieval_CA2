The studies were performed on free bronze consisting of copper plus 13 weight percent tin and 0.2 weight percent titanium after homogenization at 700�C for 20 hours and on multifilament composites consisting of Nb/Cu plus 13 weight percent Sn and 0.2 weight percent titanium (each composite contained 7,225 1-mm-diameter filaments) after diffusion annealing at 700�C for 72 hours. The fine structure of the composites and bronze were studied under a JEM-200 CX electron microscope, and the distribution of their elements was studied on a JCXA-733 scanning microscope/microanalyzer. The studies established that during the annealing process, the titanium diffuses from the bronze matrix through the Nb[.sub]3[/]Sn layer into the niobium filaments. During the course of this process, the growth rate of the diffusion layer increased along with its thickness, and the anisotropy of the grains' shape decreased. No reduction in grain size was observed, however. The thermodynamics and kinetics of this redistribution of titanium in the composite were explained in terms of previously published mathematical studies of the partial free energy of titanium in solid solutions, the change in free energy during the face-centered crystal lattice body-centered crystal lattice transition, and the condition of local equilibrium on the interface between solid solutions. The mechanism of the diffusion of titanium from the bronze into the filaments was shown to be more complicated but was also explained. Figures 7; references 14: 5 Russian, 9 Western.
