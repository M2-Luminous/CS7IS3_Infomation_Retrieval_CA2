French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the most pressing task at hand was to reopen the airport in the northeast Bosnian city of Tuzla for use as a delivery point for UN humanitarian aid. "Today we have decided to go there despite the refusal of the Serbs," Juppe told reporters here at the close of a two-day North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) summit. "It's not a question of launching preventive or offensive air strikes, but we are setting up at the Tuzla airport so that it will function and we warn that...if obstacles appear there will be a riposte," Juppe said. The French minister's remarks were the strongest interpretation among Western officials of the summit's call to UN troop commanders urgently to draft contingency plans for NATO action at Tuzla and the eastern city of Srbrenica. The decision, contained in the summit's final communique, also aimed to ensure that some 300 Canadian UN troops in Srbrenica for the past six months currently being blocked by Serb forces from leaving were immediately permitted to do so. French President Francois Mitterrand stressed NATO's "determination to eliminate obstacles" preventing the UN Protection Force from accomplishing its mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. "We can no longer count on the goodwill of the three warring parties and the first duty of the United Nations forces is to ensure the safety of their comrades engaged in peacekeeping activities," Mitterrand said. "That will be the case in Srebrenica and at Tuzla airport," he added. The proposal for action at Tuzla and Srebrenica was put forward jointly by Britain and France, but Paris has in recent weeks taken the lead -- despite U.S. misgivings -- for NATO to prepare for tougher military action in Bosnia to support UN troops. Mitterrand said the wording of the passage on Bosnia included in the final communique had been drawn up by British Prime Minister John Major and Juppe and was checked by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. A French official, who asked not to be named, said earlier that Christopher had telephoned Juppe on the eve of the summit and had urged Paris not to press the Tuzla-Srebrenica plan at the summit. Mitterrand refused to specify what kind of action was envisaged, saying that it was "not usual" to make such information available for security reasons. Last August NATO announced it would resort to air strikes to protect UN troops on the ground and in Moslem safe areas if the United Nations formally requested it.
