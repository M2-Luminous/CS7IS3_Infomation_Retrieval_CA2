FR940930-0-00255 FR940930-0-00031 The payment of $500 consideration for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to a good-faith participant in the PFS procedure whose participation does not conclude with a pre-foreclosure sale is being retained. Since the commencement of the Demonstration in 1991, HUD has raised the limit for cash consideration payable for any deed-in-lieu from $200 to $500. This was done to motivate mortgagors, and to encourage mortgagees to process deeds-in-lieu in as many appropriate cases as possible, because of the saving HUD experiences in most instances. For mortgagors who have made efforts to market their homes, payment of the maximum amount otherwise authorized will underscore HUD's interest in seeing as many appropriate deeds-in-lieu processed as possible instead of normally costlier foreclosures. The assignment to the mortgagee of all refunds due the mortgagor (for example from hazard insurance refunds) is being incorporated into the application form for participation in the PFS procedure. The provision will apply to mortgagors in the event their participation concludes with either a pre-foreclosure sale or a deed-in-lieu. The mortgagee will deduct any such refunds received from the mortgagor from their claim for FHA insurance benefits submitted to HUD. 6. There was considerable support for payment of one sort or another to the mortgagee/servicer for the inconvenience of administering the case to facilitate participation by the mortgagor in the PFS program. The method of payment varied from calculating the claim using note rate interest, as though there were a formal forbearance in effect, to following the FNMA $500-to-$1000 payment in each case resulting in a closed PFS. [three mortgagees, one real estate services company, one quasi-governmental organization] Response: With the commencement of the nationwide PFS procedure, HUD will pay an administrative fee to the mortgagees of $1000, via the Single Family Claims process, for each pre-foreclosure sale that goes to settlement (``closes''). This should provide the mortgagees ample motivation to utilize this servicing tool whenever it is appropriate to do so. It will also defray mortgagee expenses related to the duties that must be performed with regard to all participants in the PFS procedure, not just the successful ones. Payment of this administrative fee, and the amount paid, are subject to change in the future, in the sole discretion of the Department. 7. One commenter suggested that HUD consider making it possible for original homeowners to benefit from the program by allowing them to have their mortgages modified to reflect the current, lower value of the property, which would result in a more bearable financial obligation for them. [one individual] Two others suggested that we engineer the program to permit assumptions of the existing loans, after HUD has ``bought down'' the value of the obligation (involving partial payoff of the mortgagee). [one national association of real estate sales professionals, one mortgagee] Response: ``Retention of ownership'' and assumption provisions are not being considered as part of the Department's pre-foreclosure sale procedure. The PFS procedure is designed to result in an outright sale at the property's current value, and in cancellation of the original mortgage instrument. If HUD were to implement the ``buy down'' recommendation, it would in effect be insuring the purchase values of the properties and not the mortgages. Properties depreciate in value for various reasons and it is not practicable for HUD to compensate homeowners for losses in that way. The Department is exploring various other servicing activities designed to assist homeowners to avoid foreclosure, retain their properties, and also to mitigate HUD's losses. 8. Another idea that received considerable support was the performance of a title search early on in the participant's exposure to the program, to eliminate many candidates from the program who would not be approved for either a PFS or a deed-in-lieu. [three mortgagees] Response: The desirability of an early title search is stressed in the latest instructions being issued to mortgagees regarding the PFS procedure. This is especially true in cases where suspicions are aroused that significant secondary liens or encumbrances exist. 9. Several commenters supported the idea of relying on Brokers' Price Opinions (BPOs) either singly, severally, or in combination with appraisals conducted under program auspices.
