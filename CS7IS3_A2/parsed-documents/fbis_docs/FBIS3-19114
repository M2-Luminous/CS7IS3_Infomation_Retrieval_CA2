[Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi's candidate for prime minister sought to explain this to the City of London, to dozens of financiers who handle multibillion lire deals and who want to know whether Italy can be a "fertile ground" for investments and, in particular, be politically stable. Maroni, accompanied by Senator Giancarlo Pagliarini and Lombard League Secretary Luigi Negri, did his best. He met people from Morgan Grenfell, Mercury, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and Japanese Nomura, the world's largest investment company. Bossi's lieutenant left the answers to the more technical questions to Pagliarini, reserving for himself the description of the political framework and stressing, on a couple of occasions that "it is we who will be winning these elections." The style of the League's visit to the city was purposely one of "understatement," low-keyed compared with [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto's visit on 25 February: short, direct meetings at the offices of the financial groups, a "cut and thrust" in English, in the first person, by either Maroni or Pagliarini, very pragmatic. With a pinch of venom at the end of the speech at Barclays, Maroni commented: "We are not here for the elections. We were invited and therefore we came to talk to investors and to financiers, not to London School of Economics students." But Roberto Maroni's interventions all started from the same point: "We are the political force which in these years has come into the limelight with an increase in votes which would impress anybody." Someone in the know, as if living in Milan, asked him about his relationships with ally [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, about Fininvest's financial difficulties, and whether the League intended to bring in a law on television news. Maroni took the question head-on. "I believe that after 28 March a leadership problem will present itself inside the electoral coalition which we are a part of. The electors will decide: We have the North, let us see what position Berlusconi will take in the South." In substance, sharing Umberto Bossi's line, Maroni gives the impression of distancing himself more politely from Berlusconi: It is the League which should be at the rudder of the change, it is the League's men who can ensure political change in Italy. On the issue of TV news, Maroni gave no joy to anyone hoping for new polemics: "We have already spoken, also with Berlusconi, on this topic. We are against monopolies, both private and public, and will therefore be proposing a broadcasting act, also an antitrust law covering other sectors such as newspapers. In this way Berlusconi will be able to prove that he is a great entrepreneur and not, as people say, a favorite of [former Prime Minister] Craxi." However, Bossi's lieutenant wanted to insist on the political stability which the "pole of freedoms" was offering. "We and Forza Italia have a free trade program which is 95 percent similar. Hence, if we win, Italy can make a fresh start. If the `pole of the left' wins, on the other hand, the problems will start all over again. They agree on almost nothing between themselves." And what about the government? Could there be switches in alliances? To which Maroni curtly replies: "If we govern, we will do so only with our ally." Pagliarini, on the other hand, spoke about the Italian public debt and the INPS' [National Agency for Social Security] "black hole." It is the problem of getting the economy running: "Even if we were to cut public employees' salaries by 10 percent, we would not achieve major results. The problem is one of increasing the domestic product and promoting investment. Nor does raising taxes serve anything, Italian companies are already under oppressive fiscal pressure." For Pagliarini, the solution is to be found in fiscal decentralization, in the reorganization of the state, in a cultural jump toward free trade, and "direct responsibility for expenditure and receipts," also in the South.
