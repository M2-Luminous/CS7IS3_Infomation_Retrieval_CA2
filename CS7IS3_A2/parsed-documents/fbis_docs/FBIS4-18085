Jervolino will address a press conference at 1800 local (1600 GMT). From initial reports, it appears that the party -- the bulk of the once-dominant Christian Democrats -- will be led by a collegial body coordinated by Jervolino. Earlier this year, Martinazzoli's moderate line and perceived over-cautious approach to overhauling the party was contested by the party's right wing, a small number of whom split to form the neo-conservative Democratic Christian Centre (CCD), a Berlusconi ally in the Freedom Front that is shortly expected to form a government. But the relatively poor showing of the People's Party and the success claimed by the CCD in garnering 44 seats in the general elections was believed to have little to do with Martinazzoli's decision. He did not stand in the election, and had for some time intimated that after completing the party's transition he would return full-time to his lawyer's practice in the northern town of Brescia.
