Moreover, the Ministry of Atomic Energy pledged to return this money as soon as it was paid by consumers for electricity produced by atomic power stations. The amendment was backed by the State Duma's power-engineering and ecology committees and was included in the draft budget passed at a second reading. However, the amendment is not in the final version of the budget that is due to be approved on 22 June. Atomic energy industry workers are sounding the alarm, claiming that to shut down all atomic power stations would require significantly more funds to ensure minimum safety standards.
