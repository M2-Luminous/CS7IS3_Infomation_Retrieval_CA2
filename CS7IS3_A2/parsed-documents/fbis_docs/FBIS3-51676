Carlos Upegui Zapata has lived the worst five months of his life in these hills. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] guerrillas had kept him moving constantly, always in the mountains between the Cundinamarca Municipalities of Viani and Chaguani. The operation that freed him began at 0550. [Begin recording] [Fajardo] How were you able to rescue the doctor alive, considering that he was in, practically speaking, a guerrilla hideout? [Unidentified speaker] Due to the way the operation was organized and due to the energy and aggressiveness the soldiers exhibited. [end recording] One of the guerrillas died in the house in which Upegui was hidden; the others fled when they noticed the soldiers' presence. The people of the area say this is an area of working peasants and that they did not know anything about the presence of guerrillas or kidnapped individuals. [passage omitted]
