ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this document the Bureau of Prisons is making editorial amendments to its regulations in order to update statutory references, terminology, and to correct typographical errors. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, HOLC room 754, 320 First Street NW., Washington, DC 20534. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy Nanovic, Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 514&hyph;6655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Prisons is amending for editorial purposes its regulations on the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program, Non-discrimination Toward Inmates, and Civil Contempt of Court Commitments. A final rule on the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (28 CFR 545.10 to 545.11) was published in the Federal Register May 21, 1991 (56 FR 23477). This publication contained a typographical error (``Court-Ordered restriction'' rather than ``Court-ordered restitution'') in §545.11(a)(2). This document accordingly correctly revises that paragraph. A final rule on Non-Discrimination Toward Inmates (28 CFR 551.90) was published in the Federal Register on April 4, 1980 (45 FR 23366). This document amends §551.90 to use the term ``disability'' instead of the term ``handicap''. This amendment is intended to conform to terminology used in current statutes. A final rule on Civil Contempt of Court Commitments (28 CFR 522.10 to 522.11) was published in the Federal Register June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38244). This document amends §522.11(g) to include reference to subsequent statutory citations. This document also revises the authority citation for the part for the sake of editorial consistency. Because these amendments are editorial in nature and impose no new restrictions on inmates, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive no response in the Federal Register . The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866, and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. List of Subjects in 28 CFR Parts 522, 545, and 551 Prisoners. Kathleen M. Hawk, Director, Bureau of Prisons.
