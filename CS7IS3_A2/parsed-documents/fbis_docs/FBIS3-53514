In its editorial today, the paper says that establishing a firm, durable peace in the Middle East does not depend on Syria alone. Israel must also show a response, after the United States has pledged to make tireless efforts to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict in line with the resolutions of international legitimacy. The paper asks Israel to make the "difficult decisions" that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has often spoken about. It also urges Israel to end aggression and occupation because they contradict all principles and values of civilized humanity and because peace and occupation can never coexist. AL-BA'TH says that the Geneva summit has proven beyond doubt that President al-Asad cares for Arab rights and truly seeks a just and comprehensive peace in this region. In its editorial today, the paper adds that this truly embodies the constants of an approach and way of thinking that has never considered relinquishing any rights. The paper questions Israel's intransigent position at a time when the Geneva summit has emphasized the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace, which is now a pressing international demand for our region. AL-BA'TH concludes: Now that the Geneva summit is over, eyes will turn toward what the U.S. Administration will do to fulfill its commitments, namely, working to achieve genuine peace in the region based on international resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. In its commentary today, AL-THAWRAH says that the Geneva summit has resuscitated the peace process on the foundations on which it was originally launched, supported by an across-the-board Arab and international acknowledgment of Syria's central, decisive role in the region and in the peace process. The paper thinks that the positive, honorable results of the Geneva summit have revived hopes for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in line with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. AL-THAWRAH asserts that Israel's response to a just and comprehensive peace and its requirements will herald a new era in the region. The paper concludes: It is the moment of truth. Peace and occupation can not coexist. This is an important result of the Geneva summit that will turn into concrete reality if Israel responds to the voice of peace that has again rung out loud from Geneva.
