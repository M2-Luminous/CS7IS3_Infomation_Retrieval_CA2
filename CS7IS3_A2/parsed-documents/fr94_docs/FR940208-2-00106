FR940208-2-00106 FR940208-2-00074 By incorporating the foregoing standards in proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5), OCC and ICC intend for the present time to limit their acceptance of U.S. dollar-denominated mutual fund shares to those which qualify as money market funds under Rule 2a&hyph;7. OCC and ICC believe that the foregoing standards are well-founded in that they are based on the Commission's rule governing money market funds and thereby create reasonable and prudent safeguards for OCC's and ICC's protection. A fund whose shares are denominated in a designated foreign currency will be required to maintain its portfolio investments in accordance with proposed OCC Rule 604(b)(2)(A)(2) and ICC Rule 502(a)(5)(A)(2), which have been adapted from Commission Rule 2a&hyph;7. 7 Consistent with the valuation method imposed on U.S. dollar-denominated funds, a non-U.S. dollar-denominated fund will be required to maintain a stable net asset value. The average portfolio maturity of such fund will be no more than thirty days. Accordingly, the fund's portfolio should be invested in frequently maturing assets for the purposes of, among other things, funding redemptions. 7 Rule 2a&hyph;7(c)(3) of the 1940 Act restricts money market fund portfolio investments to U.S. dollar-denominated instruments. Therefore, OCC and ICC will impose substantially similar requirements upon foreign currency-denominated mutual fund investments as OCC and ICC impose on U.S. dollar-denominated funds. In addition, the portfolio investments of a non-U.S. dollar-denominated fund will be limited to the following assets: (1) Short-term government securities that are denominated in the designated foreign currency, provided that such government securities are issued or guaranteed by a sovereign government whose standard unit of official medium of exchange is the designated foreign currency; (2) debt securities of supranational organizations; 8 (3) fully-collateralized repurchase agreements; 9 or (4) instruments in the form of bankers' acceptances, certificates of deposit, or demand or other deposits that are denominated in the designated foreign currency. 10 Any issuer of such instruments must have shareholders' equity in excess of $200,000,000. 11 8 Such securities must be denominated in the designated foreign currency and must be rated in one of the two highest rating categories by the requisite NRSROs. 9 Under Rule 2a&hyph;7(a)(3) (17 CFR 270.2a&hyph;7(a)(3) (1992)) collateralized fully, in the case of a repurchase agreement, generally means that: the value of the securities collateralizing the agreement are at least equal to the resale price provided for in the agreement, the fund or its custodian has possession of the collateral or the collateral is registered by book-entry in the name of the fund or its custodian, the fund has retained the unqualified right to possess and sell the collateral in the event of a default, and the collateral consists entirely of Government securities or securities rated in the highest rating category by the requisite NRSROs. To adapt this definition to mutual funds that are denominated in a designated foreign currency, the proposed rules require that repurchase agreements may only be secured by government securities that are denominated in the designated foreign currency, provided that such government securities are issued or guaranteed by a sovereign government whose standard unit of official medium of exchange is the designated foreign security and provided further that such government securities have no more than two years remaining to maturity. 10 Such instruments must have a remaining maturity of no more than sixty days from the date of their acquisition by the fund and must be rated or issued by an issuer who is rated in one of the two highest rating categories by the requisite NRSROs. 11 As the issuers of such instruments will be banking institutions, OCC and ICC have incorporated their shareholder equity standards applicable to non-U.S. issuers of letters of credit. Refer to section .01(b) of the Interpretations and Policies to OCC Rule 604. The types of assets in which a foreign currency denominated mutual fund may invest under ICC's proposed Rule 502(a)(5) are broader than those currently permitted under an order dated October 2, 1992, issued by the CFTC that approved rule amendments proposed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
