The Independence Party lost its empire in Reykjavik, where the party has more or less reigned supreme for 64 years. The winners are the joint list of left-wing parties which won 53 percent of the vote and had eight representatives elected. The Independence Party won 47 percent of the vote and had seven representatives elected. Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir (Women's Alliance), who won a great personal victory and is now Reykjavik's new mayor, said the result shows that the voters in the capital have grown tired of the one-party rule by the Independence Party and want changes that place the individual in center stage.
