In an interview with BERLINER ZEITUNG North Rhine-Westphalian Minister-President Johannes Rau, Social Democratic Party [SPD], discussed the internal climate in united Germany. Johannes Rau said that eastern Germany not only needs an investment offensive; equally important is the exchange of people. Rau recalled the tears of joy on 9 November 1990 and drew up a sober balance sheet: In many places to the western German call: "Now pay us a visit!" there has been added: "But not all the time." The Germans must live with the intellectual and material differences much longer than they expected. The politician spoke of the "long way" Germany has to go "until people again meet and understand each other without any problems." At the same time he warned against "blurring all regional and historical peculiarities." Johannes Rau cited the example of the United States, where, under rather similar economic conditions, the different characteristics of northerners and southerners can still be clearly felt. Rau wants to intensify the exchange of teachers, pupils, and athletes between eastern and western Germany. He calls on young people in the west to study in Leipzig, Dresden, or Frankfurt/Oder. In particular for western Germans it is important to go to Weimar and Erfurt to learn that "one might perhaps have a few marks less in one's pocketbook" there, but one would not be poorer but richer -- for instance in cultural terms. The candidate appeals: "We must never and will never resign ourselves to the wall in the minds and the isolation in the hearts in Germany." Their Own Lives Johannes Rau, who since the 1950's regularly visited friends in the GDR, wants "much more understanding" for the people "who now suddenly feel that they have not lived their own lives, and this at an age when they no longer have any chance of a `western' career simply because they will not find work." Johannes Rau thinks it is quite natural that, four-and-a-half years after unification, the Germans feel internal insecurity and are "not sufficiently sure of themselves." Rau recalls that other industrial states, such as Japan, France, and Britain, are also going through crises of orientation at the moment. He finds it very encouraging "that our democracy has been so stable over the past four-and-a-half years." Do Not Forget Nevertheless, by pointing to the neighbors, Rau does not want to relativize German problems: "In our country xenophobia and racism are of worse significance than in the other countries, because this has happened before to us." The SPD politician is worried about the trend toward saying: "Let us be normal." And he retorts: "We, with our special German history, cannot afford this self-imposed normalcy. Because of our deficit in democracy in the Weimar Republic we brought misery to the world. This was unique. Denying it would be fateful. In my view, Gustav Heinemann's words apply: `The only chance that the others will forget is that we do not forget.'" Rau wants to bring the debate about the past to the present: "I think that the discussion about the normalcy of our present is more important than a controversy among historians about the alleged normalcy of German history."
