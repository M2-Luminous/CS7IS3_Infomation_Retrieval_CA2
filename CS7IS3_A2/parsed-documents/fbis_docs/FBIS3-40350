Antinoise systems that have been tested by Fokker and the TNO [Netherlands Central Institute for Applied Research] Institute of Applied Physics (TPD) seem unable to muffle the sound from four independent turbines. Worse still, if conditions are unfavorable, the noise actually increases. Passengers in the F-100 are not bothered by the jet engines as they sound on the ground, but by the moving parts of the engine. In contrast to the engines of the Boeings which dominate the fleet in the Netherlands, the engines of the F-100 are mounted at the rear of the fuselage. Each engine contains a high-pressure and a low-pressure spool, in turn consisting of a compressor and a turbine. These spools rotate independently of one another and each produces its own sound. This imbalance means that the passengers seated at the rear of the cabin are subjected to a roar of 85 decibels -- a good 10 decibels louder than the noise experienced by their fellow passengers at the front of the cabin. Low Frequencies All Fokker's attempts to eliminate the engine imbalance and to make the engine suspension more flexible using insulators have not had the desired effect. Since the problem is caused by low frequencies, conventional, passive silencers have also failed to reduce the roar. Antinoise is a highly promising technology, particularly for suppressing low frequencies. In brief, antinoise systems consist of a microphone which absorbs noise, a control unit which records and analyzes this noise, and then via a loudspeaker emits a sound into the room which is of the same amplitude but the opposite phase, so that ideally it should generate silence. Headphones with antinoise are already commercially available, and next year will see the launch of the first propeller aircraft with an antinoise system. However, its first commercial application in jet engines will not be for some time, principally because there are four frequencies to be suppressed, rather than just one as in a propeller airplane. Eliminate Fokker's antinoise efforts started about three years ago, with the Asanca European technology program. The aim of this project was to determine how many loudspeakers and microphones were required, and where they should be located, to eliminate a single frequency. By continually relocating one loudspeaker, a mathematical model could be developed. From this model it could be deduced that a reduction of six decibels could be achieved using four loudspeakers. Using 30 loudspeakers, this figure increased to 16 decibels. "That may not be much to people used to industrial noise, but in an airplane we are happy with just one decibel," said E. Waterman of Fokker Aircraft, speaking last week at a symposium about antinoise systems. The results of another project in collaboration with the TPD were less encouraging. Four loudspeakers and microphones were placed on the rear four rows of seats. The measurements showed that this small system was not enough to muffle the noise in a restricted area. On the contrary, at the edges of the rows of seats, the motor roar was actually eight decibels louder. A larger system would be needed to achieve adequate noise muffling, even over a small surface area. The results of the test using two frequencies were even more dramatic. According to Waterman, it did not work at all. The closer the frequencies were to each other, the less successful the system was in muffling the sound. Here, too, the noise actually increased when the frequencies were virtually synchronous. The problem is that the speed of the engine is not known in advance. Purely Comfort The antinoise system as envisaged by Fokker and the TPD is not set to be a success just yet. Waterman dismisses ideas for making passengers wear (working) headsets or clamping them into a headrest with little microphones right beside the ear. She says that noise silencing is purely a question of comfort, and that passengers will not suffer hearing damage. She is also against any system which would prevent passengers from talking normally to one another or force them to wear headphones. Whatever the case, Fokker is about to begin follow-up research which will look at whether it might be more effective to suppress the vibrations.
