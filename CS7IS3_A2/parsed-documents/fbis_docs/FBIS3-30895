At a plenary session presided over by peace mediators Owen and Stoltenberg, the Bosnian Serbs demanded that an international commission for establishing the crime at the Sarajevo marketplace should include both Serb and Muslim representatives. The Muslims refused, saying that the perpetrators, who they are convinced are the Serbs, could not take part in the investigation of the crime. Owen and Stoltenberg are trying to salvage the negotiations. The mandate of the Geneva conference are peace negotiations, not individual cases. This is a task for UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], Lord Owen says. The basis for the Geneva negotiations on the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina is a European Union plan. Croatia accepts this plan, Croatian Foreign Affairs Minister Mate Granic clearly said. Croatia, as well as a Croat delegation from Bosnia-Herzegovina, led by Mile Akmadzic, proposes international supervision of borders between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats also propose inspection of military formations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, through which Muslim allegations that the regular Army of the Republic of Croatia is fighting within the ranks of the Bosnian Croats would be denied. The Croat delegation urges that an international commission should investigate last week's crime at the Sarajevo marketplace, but negotiations ought to be continued. The Croats also agree with the establishment of hot lines as a trust-building measure and the exchange of representatives of the three nations, as proposed by Owen and Stoltenberg. While I am reporting, there is a break in the plenary session, the resumption of which is expected soon.
