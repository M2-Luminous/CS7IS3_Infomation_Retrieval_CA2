National Police (PN) Director Oswaldo Fernandez declared that the incident in which U.S. Sergeant Maurice Neal was wounded in the shoulder by a Panamanian policeman does not have "any effect on U.S. relations." In this regard, Fernandez added U.S. Southern Command authorities and Panamanian PN exchanged reports on the case, adding it is "indeed true" Neal evaded and ran through a Panamanian police checkpoint. Regarding whether the reaction of the police to fire on Neal is justified, Fernandez said that "it is too early to tell, because we must first verify the situation and hear the account of events from the PN Office of Professional Responsibility," which is investigating the case. The Panama-based U.S. Southern Command maintains approximately 10,000 soldiers in installations along the length of the 80-km interoceanic Canal. U.S. troops must abandon these installations totally by 31 December 1999, as stipulated by the Canal Treaties signed by the two countries in 1977.
