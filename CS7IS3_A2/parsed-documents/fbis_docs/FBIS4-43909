This became clear on Tuesday [21 June], following the coalition meeting chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The second and third reading of a reform package to amend the Basic Law was scheduled for next Thursday in the Berlin Reichstag. As has been learned, there are disagreements between the Christian Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and the Free Democratic Party [FDP] in particular about the expansion of powers for the laender. There is also disagreement about the acceptance of minority protection and equal rights for married and unmarried couples as well as the current form of animal protection. On the other hand, there is no dispute about including the protection for handicapped people in the constitution. According to CDU/CSU circles, the FDP is calling for an entire package of measures and opposes adopting those individual points that are not disputed between the coalition parties. This makes the situation difficult, the CDU/CSU group leaders said. From the CSU, it was heard that under these circumstances it might become difficult to achieve a decision at the Berlin Bundestag session next week. The strengthening of the laenders' rights, which they want, might be postponed to the next legislative period.
