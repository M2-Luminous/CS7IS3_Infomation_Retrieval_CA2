A federation [lien pang] or confederation [pang lien] should be considered as a way. However, he believed that, under the condition that Communist China still takes an ossified policy toward Taiwan and disregards the fact that we are a political entity, Communist China will not be ready to leap one hundred steps and instantly discuss the system of a federation or confederation. Legislator Chao Shao-kang expressed his view during an interpellation at the Legislative Yuan yesterday that, under the situation of close economic and trade relations between the two sides of the strait, with the amount of bilateral trade exceeding the amount of trade with the United States and Japan, it is extremely unwise for the two sides to contend with each other in diplomatic and military affairs. He asked the government to change the current conservative, shrinking, and defensive policy toward the mainland and to readjust our strategy and adopt a positive and active mainland policy so our side can take an offensive as well as a defensive position in dealing with Communist China. Therefore, he advocated establishing the Republic of the Chinese Federation [chung hua lien pang kung ho kuo] through cross-strait talks. Although Communist China may object, we can at least shift the problem to Communist China. Premier Lien Chan said the relationship between the two sides of the strait is a crucial political issue for the country at present and in the future. Judging from the view of our country and nation, the present vicious contention between the two sides of the strait in the political, economic, military and other fields and the situation of a life-and-death struggle [ni su wo huo ti chu mien] are merely squandering away the resources of the country and is very unsatisfactory. Therefore, he held that taking the initiative to design a political structure, planning national development in the future, and thinking about the future path of the Republic of China are all good ideas. He also affirmed Chao Shao-kang's suggestion on forming a federation. He held that it is quite creative. In addition, in answering an interpellation, Premier Lien Chan also said that the so-called summit meeting is merely for stressing each other's stand and cannot solve practical problems. Therefore the problems between the two sides of the strait should still be handled in a rational and good-will manner, and in this way we can naturally have a bright future. Meanwhile, he held that the idea of a federation or confederation is not the direction for reunification in the future. In answering an interpellation by Chao Shao-kang, Premier Lien said: [Begin recording] [Lien] The future reunification of China may take many forms. However, a confederation [pang lien] or federation [lien pang] may be accepted after all as a way for consideration. The Soviet Union was an example of the unification of states in modern times. In past decades, we have seen many such examples in the United Nations. [end recording] In fact, the policy toward the mainland became the legislators' focal point of concern in the general interpellation of government administration on 25 February. Earlier, Legislator Ting Shou-chung had a wonderful dialogue with Premier Lien Chan on the possibility of holding a summit between the two sides of the strait. [Begin recording] [Ting] I solemly suggest that the president should immediately hold a cross-strait summit with Deng Xiaoping. To go out to the world, Taiwan's leader must first have the courage to face Communist China. We have seen that President Li can avoid sensitive questions, disregard status and formalities, and go abroad to hold talks with leaders of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand and exchange experiences on national construction. Why can he not hold dialogs with leaders on the mainland with the same sentiment and tolerance and in the same informal way? [Li] I personally always think that summit meetings cannot solve problems. The government leaders only express their stands and stress their own particular viewpoints in summit meetings. They cannot possibly solve any practical thing. [end recording] Generally speaking, Premier Lien's view on a policy for cross-strait relations is still consistently the same, that is, the relations between the two sides of the strait should be two-sided. Our side has already shown enough sincerity, but so far the government still has not felt any goodwill from Communist China in response. Therefore, the current policy toward the mainland still should not be changed rashly.
