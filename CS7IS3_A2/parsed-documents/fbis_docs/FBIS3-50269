"The issue of who should fill the post of a voivode should not be determined by party membership," believe almost three-fourths of respondents. The replacement of voivodship heads of the state administration, announced by the peasant-social democratic government, is rather moderately supported by the public. So far the Pawlak government has recalled ten voivodes (the eleventh voivode is supposed to be recalled toward the end of January, when he returns from sick leave); eight new voivodes have been appointed. The vacant posts are in Lublin and Rzeszow. Representatives of the governing coalition said more than once that only the future of ten, or maybe a little over a dozen voivodes, could be classified as safe. The main criterion for the central authorities was supposed to be the fact whether a given voivode had good or bad relations with the local structures of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. Any protests by activists of these parties is the first step to dismiss the head of the local governmental administration. There appear statements that the issue of filling this post should be decided by the party that won the parliamentary elections in the particular voivodship. It is worth recalling that SLD won in 25 voivodships, PSL in 21, Democratic Union [UD] in 2, and the German minority in one. In a radio statement, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said jokingly that for him the unparalleled model is Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who had replaced all the voivodes. His opponents point out that the situation is incomparable, because in 1989 and 1990 a most fundamental change in the political system was under way. On New Year's Eve, the present government recalled five voivodes; this is half as many as the Suchocka government did during its entire time in office. It is still unclear of what nature the post of a voivode should be: whether it should be an apolitical representative of the "civil service" [preceding two words in English], or a representative of the governing coalition who is at its full political disposal. The law on the state civil service, which many people hope will finally settle this issue, has still not even reached a session of the Council of Ministers. Most of the representatives of all the groups questioned by PBS are convinced that the issue of filling a voivode post should not be determined by party membership (74 percent of the answers, whereas 18 percent of the respondents are of the opposite opinion). Acceptance of the idea of making the voivode post party-related is most often expressed by supporters of SLD and the Union for Real Politics. The recalls that have been made so far -- recalls of voivodes who belong to parties other than the governing ones -- are approved by 26 percent of respondents; they are disapproved of by 55 percent, and 18 percent refrain from expressing an opinion either way. Support for such changes are most often declared by supporters of SLD, PSL, as well as the Union of Labor and the Confederation for an Independent Poland; however, even in these groups they are in the minority. The greatest doubts are expressed by supporters of the parties that not long ago were still in power: UD, Liberal-Democratic Congress, as well as the groupings comprising the former "Fatherland" coalition. The opinion poll was conducted on 15 and 16 January with a representative sample of 1,064 adult Poles. [Box, p 1] Should the issue of the filling the post of a voivode be determined by party membership? 42 percent -- definitely not 32 percent -- probably not 13 percent -- probably yes 5 percent -- definitely yes 8 percent -- hard to say
