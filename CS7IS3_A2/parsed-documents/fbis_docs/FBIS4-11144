Today, its Brazilian clients pay about 50 percent of the price they paid four years ago. On some products, the cut has been 70 percent. This is the concrete and most tangible result, for consumers, of the broad managerial restructuring process the enterprise has undergone since 1990, and which is now entering its second phase. The CBC was founded in 1926 by the Matarazzo family and is today controlled by the Arbi group of Rio de Janeiro (with 30 percent of the shares in the hands of the War Materiel Industry, Imbel). During 1994 it will invest $8 million in Belgian and Italian equipment and machines that will allow the enterprise to double the production of some types of ammunition. The enterprise has also begun a process in which part of the work will be contracted out to third parties. CBC suppliers will produce the parts and components that are not specifically built by CBC. For example, negotiations have already begun with suppliers of wood (imbuia and ivantiji [types of Brazilian wood]). The wood is used for gun stocks. Considering the production of ammunition and arms involves productive processes of metallurgical and chemical nature, it is wiser to order wooden pieces from specialists. The plan to order parts from third parties is, however, more comprehensive, as CBC president Antonio Marcos Moraes Barros put it. CBC intends to buy from third parties most of the 105 items that it uses to manufacture rifles. At its factory in Ribeirao Pires, in the Sao Paulo industrial belt, CBC will continue to master essential technology for arms production, like rifle chambers and barrels, and the assembly and testing phases, for which the company has special equipment and laboratories. A third major point in this plan is an advertising campaign that the enterprise has set in motion, at an estimated cost of $2.8 million, through the Enio Minardi agency. Some six months ago, the enterprise ordered a survey to identify who buys arms and ammunition in Brazil. The main conclusion is that buyers are generally frightened people, who are upset and who make the decision to buy arms as a reaction to violence. They frequently buy a gun that is not suitable for their objective, or the incorrect ammunition. Based on that information, ads were published in magazines -- beginning with EXAME VIP -- describing the arms that can be bought in Brazil and how they can be bought. This first ad specifically referred to the 12-caliber pump-action shotgun. The ad emphasized security for the consumer's home or business. The decision to publish the adds was delayed, Barros said, because the enterprise knows this is a sensitive matter that can hurt people's feelings. With this advertising campaign, CBC is trying to diversify its consumer market. The enterprise is looking for consumers because it decided that increasing its production capacity and its production itself are the basic goals of its restructuring plan -- the first stage of which is based on a quality program that introduced radical changes into the productive processes. The company's production capacity is increasing very much: In 1991, the company manufactured 12 million rounds of ammunition and 1.6 million guns (shotguns and rifles); this year, it will produce 22 million rounds of ammunition and 7 million guns. This represents an increase of 83 percent and 337 percent, respectively. But is there market for all the CBC production? Is the demand for weapons increasing in the same proportion? Barros promptly says no. He adds that, at best, international demand for arms and ammunitions is stagnant. The fundamental difference for the company, however, is that it has noticeably increased its exports. Over four years, the CBC sales abroad increased from $11.5 million to $24.5 million. Currently, 60 percent of the ammunition and 80 percent of the guns produced by CBC are exported. Basically, what made the company gain a bigger market share in the United States, all European countries except Italy, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Australia was its prices, which are nearly 5 percent lower than those of its main international rivals. Exports Director Gilberto Salm said the company is also selling, although indirectly, to some East Europe countries. Companies headquartered in West European countries purchase CBC arms and ammunition and reexport them to other countries, including countries of the former Communist bloc. The Brazilian Government supervises these sorts of exports. As a result of the recent emphasis given to exports, the Armed Forces are no longer the CBC main customer. Some years ago, as much as 35 percent of the CBC production was purchased by the Brazilian Armed Forces. This has dropped to 10 percent. The CBC reorganization process began in 1990 when the Arbi group bought the company in 1979 [date as published] from the two partners who had been controlling the company since 1936 (the U.S. Remington Arms Co. and the British ICI complex). Barros was appointed president of the company by the Arbi group after having worked at the Eluma company for 18 years. During the time Roberto Gusmao headed the Industry and Commerce Ministry, he was the ministry's secretary general. The reorganization began by the adoption of new production procedures. Without funds to invest in large projects or expensive machinery, the best alternative to modernize the company was to adopt quality control measures and redesign its assembly line. A good example of the changes implemented has been given by CBC Operations Director Marco Aurelio Salvany: Previously, as a result of the location of the assembly lines, the product sometimes had to "cover" nearly 1.5 km from one section of the plant to another. The new assembly line design places all the machinery required for the manufacture of a certain product in a much smaller area, so there is less loss of time and materials. The company also implemented a system that allows workers to suspend manufacture of a specific product when its stock reaches preestablished levels. Barros explained: "Before the reorganization started, the company had as much as $12 million worth of completed products in stock. Currently, it only has $4 million worth in stock. Reduced financial costs resulting from the drop in the value of products in stock has, so far, paid for the reorganization process." To pay for the equipment that the company plans to purchase this year, the CBC consulted the National Bank for Economic and Social Development about the possibility of obtaining financing. So far, the CBC reorganization program has not increased the company's profits. On the contrary, the company has been registering losses since 1991 and last year made a "symbolic" profit of a little more than $200,000. This was contemplated in the initial project but, as a result of the expected exports hike, prospects for this year are more favorable. Barros preferred not to reveal the profit expected for 1994. He said the results depend very much on factors that are very difficult to forecast, such as exchange rate behavior. The company's reorganization program has significantly affected the routine of its employees. First because the number of employees was cut from 1,584 employees in November 1991 to the current 1,334. This number, however, is not expected to change dramatically in the next few months, not even after more modern equipment is purchased and parts are ordered from third parties. The projected increase in production will require the company to retrain employees that would have to be dismissed and to keep them on the payroll. As frequently occurs in programs that seek to improve the quality of a company's products, the workers have become much more involved in the productive process. Often, the workers themselves suggest ways to improve the products. Naturally, the implementation of quality control measures is not new to the company. As it produces arms and ammunition, the company has always been forced to adopt special precautions. The CBC must be particularly careful about these precautions because it not only manufactures arms and ammunition, it produces practically all the necessary components too. The CBC is one of only two companies in the world that produces powder and ammunition at the same time. Normally, ammunition manufacturers purchase powder from other companies. To keep the powder and the starting mixture (a chemical mixture that makes powder explode when the trigger is pulled) production process safe and under control, the CBC has built the units that manufacture these two products far from the other buildings. The products are manufactured with a minimum number of employees. Most of the process is controlled from a distance through automated systems.
