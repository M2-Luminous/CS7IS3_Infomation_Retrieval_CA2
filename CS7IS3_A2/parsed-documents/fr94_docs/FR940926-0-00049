Each CNG fuel container shall meet the applicable requirements of S7 through S7.4. S7.1␣ Pressure cycling test at ambient temperature. Each CNG fuel container shall not leak when tested in accordance with S8.1. S7.2␣ Hydrostatic burst test. S7.2.1␣Each Type 1 CNG fuel container shall not leak when subjected to burst pressure and tested in accordance with S8.2. Burst pressure shall be not less than 2.25 times the service pressure for non-welded containers when analyzed in accordance with the stress ratio requirements of S5.4.1, and shall not be less than 3.5 times the service pressure for welded containers. S7.2.2␣Each Type 2, Type 3, or Type 4 CNG fuel container shall not leak when subjected to burst pressure and tested in accordance with S8.2. Burst pressure shall be no less than the value necessary to meet the stress ratio requirements of Table 3, when analyzed in accordance with the requirements of S5.5.1. Burst pressure is calculated by multiplying the service pressure by the applicable stress ratio set forth in Table Three.
