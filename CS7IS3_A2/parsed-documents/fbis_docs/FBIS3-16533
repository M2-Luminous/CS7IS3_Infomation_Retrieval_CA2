The present "generals" of executive power -- two deputy governors, three heads of rural rayon administrations, and other officials -- have gotten through in single formation. The level of Kostroma voters' activeness was as a whole relatively high: According to preliminary figures at least 38 percent of voters took part in voting. It is true that the city inhabitants demonstrated no particular eagerness to make use of their legal right. That is why there was no referendum in Kostroma to approve the statute on local self-management. Incidentally, this statute, submitted by the mayor of Kostroma, Federation Council Deputy Boris korobov, markedly expanded the rights of the representative municipal organ compared with what was determined by the Russian president's edicts. To determine the fate of this document, at least half of the voters should have gone to the polling stations.
