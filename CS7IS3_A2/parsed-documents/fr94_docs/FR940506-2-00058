FR940506-2-00058 FR940506-2-00039 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM BankAmerica Corporation, San Francisco, California; Application To Engage in Nonbanking Activities BankAmerica Corporation, San Francisco, California (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and 225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage de novo through BA Futures, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (Company), a futures commission merchant registered under the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq. ), in executing and clearing, and clearing without executing the following contracts on the following exchanges: Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, Options on Light Sweet Crude Oil Futures, No. 2 Heating Oil Futures and Options on No. 2 Heating Oil Futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange; Corn Futures, Options on Corn Futures, Wheat Futures, Options on Wheat Futures, Soybean Futures and Options on Soybean Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade; and Live Cattle Futures, Options on Live Cattle Futures, Feeder Cattle Futures, Options on Feeder Cattle Futures, Live Hog Futures and Options on Live Hog Futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Applicant proposes to conduct these activities throughout the world. Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. A particular activity may be found to meet the closely related to banking test if it is demonstrated that banks have generally provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity, or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form. National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806, January 5, (1984). The Board previously has approved acting as a futures commission merchant in executing and clearing the proposed commodity contracts. See Bank of Montreal, 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1049 (1993); J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated , 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 151 (1994)( J.P. Morgan ). The Board also previously has approved providing a combination of advisory services regarding nonfinancial commodity derivatives and acting as a futures commission merchant in the execution and clearance of these derivatives. J.P. Morgan . Applicant proposes to conduct the proposed activities in a manner that differs slightly from what previously has been approved by the Board. Specifically, in J.P. Morgan the Board conditioned approval of the application on J.P. Morgan's commitment that it would not perform execution, clearance or investment advisory services for commodity funds (or commodity pools) owned, sponsored by, or otherwise affiliated with, J.P. Morgan. In contrast, Applicant proposes that Company's customers would include a managed commodity fund formed outside of the United States, sponsored by an affiliate of Applicant. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than May 23, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by 262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 2, 1994. Jennifer J. Johnson, Associate Secretary of the Board. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10921 Filed 5&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6210&hyph;01&hyph;F
