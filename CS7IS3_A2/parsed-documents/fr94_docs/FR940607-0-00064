FR940607-0-00064 FR940607-0-00017 (2) The ``Abundance of Caution'' Exemption The agencies are amending their regulations to clarify and expand the scope of the exemption for real estate liens taken in an ``abundance of caution.'' Under the amended rule, regulated institutions will be able to apply the abundance of caution exemption to a broader range of transactions in which real estate is taken as additional collateral for an extension of credit that is well supported by income or other collateral of the borrower. Prior to adoption of this amendment, the abundance of caution exemption was available only for transactions in which a lien on real estate had been taken as collateral solely through an abundance of caution and where the terms of the transaction as a consequence had not been made more favorable than they would have been in the absence of a lien. In the agencies' experience, however, this standard was being interpreted too narrowly. As a result, regulated institutions obtained appraisals even though they were unnecessary to protect federal financial and public policy interests in the transaction or bank and thrift safety and soundness. Further, a transaction would not qualify for the exemption if the regulated institution made the terms more favorable to the borrower because of the real estate collateral. Therefore, bankers believed they were unable to use this exemption when common business practices would call for a lower interest rate on a secured loan than an unsecured loan. To qualify for the amended exemption, the regulated institution's decision to enter into the transaction must be well supported by the borrower's income or collateral other than real estate. The following examples from the proposed rule help to explain how this standard is applied. Example 1: A business with an established cash flow seeks a loan from a regulated institution to purchase an adjacent property for expansion. As a common business practice, the institution takes a lien against real estate whenever available for greater comfort. However, the institution's analysis determines that the current income from the business and personal property available as collateral support the decision to extend credit without knowing the real estate's market value. During loan negotiations, the institution offers to make the loan on slightly better terms for the borrower if it receives a lien on real estate. The borrower accepts the offer and provides the real estate as additional collateral. The regulated institution may reasonably conclude that the lien on the real estate was taken in an abundance of caution because the current income from the business and personal property taken as collateral support the decision to extend credit. Therefore, no appraisal would be required. Example 2: The owner of a shop seeks a term loan from a regulated institution for modernization of its facilities. The institution determines that other sources of repayment and collateral do not sufficiently support the decision to extend credit without taking a lien on the real estate and knowing the real estate's market value. Therefore, in order to extend credit to the borrower prudently, the institution needs an appraisal. The regulated institution should conclude that the real estate lien has not been taken in an abundance of caution because the other sources of repayment and collateral do not support the decision to extend credit without knowing the real estate's market value. This transaction would not qualify for the abundance of caution exemption. Regulated institutions generally supported the proposed amendment. Some commenters representing appraisers agreed that the abundance of caution exemption had been too narrowly interpreted and supported the proposal to extend the scope of the exemption. Other appraisers commented that the agencies should require an appraisal, limited scope appraisal, or evaluation any time a regulated institution takes real estate as collateral. Some regulated institutions noted that the prior rule caused them to forgo liens on real estate collateral in order to avoid the expense of an appraisal, thus potentially increasing their exposure unnecessarily. The agencies are not requiring appraisals for these transactions because an estimate of the real estate collateral's value generally would not assist the regulated institution to make its lending decision. Therefore, an appraisal generally would not further the purposes of Title XI of FIRREA nor significantly improve the safety and soundness of financial institutions. (3) Loans Not Secured by Real Estate The agencies are adopting a uniform exemption for transactions that are not secured by real estate. The exemption makes clear that a regulated institution is not required to obtain a Title XI real estate appraisal in connection with a loan used to acquire or invest in real estate if the institution does not take a security interest in real estate. The prior appraisal regulations of the OCC, FDIC and OTS exempted these transactions, and the amendment does not result in any substantive change in regulatory requirements for these agencies. The amendment eliminates minor differences between the text of the rules adopted by the OCC and OTS and the text of the FDIC's rule. Prior to adoption of the amendment, the Board's appraisal regulation did not specifically exempt these transactions. Although a few appraisers stated that Title XI appraisals should be obtained for these transactions, other commenters, including appraisers, supported this exemption. Several commenters stated that Title XI was never intended to reach transactions that were not secured by real estate. In transactions covered by this exemption, the value of the real estate has no direct effect on the regulated institution's decision to extend credit because the institution has no security interest in the real estate. The agencies conclude that federal financial and public policy interests would not be served by requiring lenders and borrowers to incur the cost of obtaining Title XI appraisals in connection with these transactions. (4) Liens for Purposes Other Than the Real Estate's Value The agencies are adopting a new exemption for transactions in which a regulated institution takes a lien on real estate for a purpose other than the value of the real estate. This amendment will permit regulated institutions to take liens against real estate to protect rights to, or control over, collateral other than the real estate without obtaining an appraisal. Regulated institutions frequently take real estate liens to protect legal rights to other collateral and not because of the value of the real estate as an individual asset. For example, in lending associated with logging operations, a regulated institution typically takes a lien against the real estate upon which the timber stands to ensure its access to the timber in the event of default. Similarly, where the collateral for a loan is a business or manufacturing facility, a regulated institution may take a lien against the land and improvements in order to be able to sell the entire business or facility as a going concern if the borrower defaults. A Title XI appraisal contains an opinion of the market value of real estate. When the market value of the real estate as an individual asset is not needed to support the regulated institution's decision to lend, no purpose is served by requiring the institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal.
