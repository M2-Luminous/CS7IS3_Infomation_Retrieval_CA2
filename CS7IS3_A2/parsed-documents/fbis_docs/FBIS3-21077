High-performance polymers constitute a very promising class of materials and have already entered areas of application heretofore assigned to metals, glass, or ceramic only. They will become increasingly important in the future, despite a few problems relating to economics. "High-temperature thermoplastics can today already withstand temperatures about 350�C for short durations, temperatures above 250�C continuously causing no problem any more." Dr. Eckard Koch predicts above average growth rates for these materials in the coming years. The plastics expert in the Application Engineering Department for Thermoplastics at the BASF (Baden Aniline and Soda Works) in Ludwigshafen believes that these materials will play a more significant role especially in the electrical and electronic industry, where now the principal demand for them exists. One of the reasons for the further increasing demand is that "exactly in this industry the fire resistance requirements are becoming more stringent" says Doctor Koch. "Because of new specifications regarding precautions and commercial use, fire proofing by conventional means will in the future be done to a limited extent only." The automotive industry, too, promises a growing demand for these materials. According to Doctor Koch, work is now being done on parts located near the engine block. Here pressure-cast aluminum is eventually to be replaced with high-performance thermoplastics. Also Grad. Eng. Gerhard Kloetgen also recognizes the greatest economic potential for highly heat-resistant polymers in the automotive industry as well as in the electrical and electronic sector. The sales manager for engineering materials at the DuPont Nemours Deutschland (Germany) Ltd in Bad Homburg sees future applications generally where the requirements exceed the capability limits of conventional materials. He finds it almost impossible, however, to quantify their innovation potential in terms of worth. This is especially so because of a specific problem peculiar to all high-performance polymers: They do in many cases fail the economics test. "The development costs are very high, owing to the small ratio of quantities eventually sold to the potential production yield" says Kloetgen. The prevailing enormous downward pressure on prices makes it, moreover, very difficult to cover these costs with the proceeds from sales a product stored in the warehouse. This was a sufficient reason for the Bayer Corporation to discontinue producting of several high-performance polymers such as liquid-crystal polymers (LCP), polyphenylene sulfides (PPS), and composite materials. Meanwhile the Leverkusen people are concentrating more on engineering thermoplastics. Polyether ketones (PEK) are the best among heat-resistant thermoplastics. They can withstand temperatures above 250�C and remain rigid under heat. Their excellent mechanical properties are reflected in their Young's modulus: 4000 N/mm[.sup]2[/] without reinforcement, still 3000 N/mm[.sup]2[/] even at 150�C. When reinforced with carbon fibers, their Young's modulus rises to 20,000 N/mm[.sup]2[/] and higher. Its high flexural fatigue strength even at elevated temperatures makes the "Ultrapek" polyether ketone an ideal material for gears when light weight as well as sufficient overload capacity and adequate chemical resistance are demanded all at the same time. Polyether imides (PEI), according to Peter Stahl, feature an outstanding combination of thermal stability, flame repellence, electrical properties, and high mechanical durability. The technical director at the Plastics subsidiary of the German General Electric Company in Ruesselsheim includes them among the few thermoplastics approved for the interior furnishing of aircraft, because of their high oxygen index along with the thin smoke and the low toxity in case of fire among other favorable properties. "The great application potential of polyether imides should also lead to an economic winner" adds Peter Stahl. Their growth proceeds at double-digit rates, even though at this time there is an oversupply of high-temperature thermoplastics on the European market. The development potential of polyether imides has, however, by far not yet been realized. One of the most important goals for Peter Stahl is improving processability. The range of applications can thus be broadened by new kinds of blends, i.e., mixtures of plastics. Research is being done not only on blends but also on copolymers which promise entirely new properties and applications. Semicrystalline polyphenylene sulfides have a properties profile very similar to that of polyether ketones. They not only can withstand high service temperatures and are inherently very flame-repellent but also have a high chemical and oxidation resistance along with adequate hardness and stiffness. Also liquid-crystal polymers can withstand service at temperatures significantly above 200�C. They surpass steel in tensile strength and yet are much lighter. They have a high chemical resistance, also against polar and nonpolar solvents or acids. Peter Gleisberg, product manager at "Vectra" (trade name of liquid-crystal polymers made by Hoechst), is convinced that these engineering materials still have a great development potential. "They will find their market wherever an extremely high fluidity, narrow tolerances, and stability during soldering are demanded." In order to impart high mechanical strength to a part made of a crystalline polymer and to optimize the layout of its structural unit for minimum weight, it would be necessary to orient the molecular chains in the entire part with their principal axis in the direction of the acting load. This should make such a layout much more difficult to achieve, as experience at the Institute of Plastics Engineering in Aachen has confirmed. Without the aid of simulation programs, for one, it is hardly possible to predict the orientations of molecular chains in individual layers and the thicknesses of those layers in the the finished part. Furthermore, most engineers who design injection molding equipment are not used to take into account the anisotropic behavior of a material inside the mold.
