Those concerns have arisen at a time when, after a threat by NATO to carry out aerial attacks against Serbian positions, the Serb paramilitaries said that they would defend themselves against any aerial attack and they might take action against the 12,000 UN soldiers in Bosnia. Parallel with those threats, the U.S. and British Governments recommended that their representatives in the Serb-Montenegro alliance should leave because of the growing unrest that has been created as a result of the NATO threat. It seems that the U.S. and British response -- which has resulted in their recalling their representatives from Belgrade -- will end the American pretense of saying that the policy regarding the Bosnian crisis has been thought out. Also, this issue faces NATO's role in the current crisis with ambiguity. Nevertheless, political experts believe that military intervention in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has only a deterrent meaning and is taken to mean psychological pressure on the warring sides; especially since there is neither any oil in the area nor has the area much geopolitical significance for Western Europe and America. Nevertheless, it is predicted that if NATO embarks on an aerial attack against the Serbs it will undoubtedly be taken as a measure to enhance the West's global image and to legitimize its action. In fact the West's irresponsible rationalizing and the lack of serious support for the Muslims against the events in Bosnia have resulted in the true face of the Western forums and their evil objectives to become more evident than ever. It is clear for all that America assesses Bosnia, just like other world issues, from the angle of its own national interests. In the case of the Bosnia- Herzegovina conflict, the United States has adopted three different positions. At the beginning, Washington was playing the role of a neutral observer, thinking that the Yugoslav crisis was simply a European problem. With the passage of time and the spread of war in the Balkans, Washington then showed an inclination to play a political role in the crisis. However, now we can see a change in the United States' point of view. The American Government intends to increase its role in the Bosnia peace negotiations to force the Muslims of that country to accept the disintegration of Bosnia and lose control of Sarajevo. Now, under the guise of NATO, the U.S. Government is not showing the slightest inclination toward a fair resolution to the differences, and, if NATO implements its threats on air strikes, the region will enter a period of protracted and useless ground conflict. Therefore, the surest way to stop the time killing policy of the West in the Bosnian crisis is to give the responsibility of defending Bosnian civilians to the rightful owners of that country, namely the Bosnian Government; so that under those conditions, the Muslims can manage to take effective steps in defending their obvious and usurped rights and in the final condemnation of the Serb aggressors.
