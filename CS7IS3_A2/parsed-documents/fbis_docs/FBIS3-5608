KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported Monday that the U.S. has proposed using "numerical indicators" that would give the cellular system developed and built by Motorola Inc. an additional 240,000 subscribers after one year in the Tokyo and Nagoya areas. "That report is erroneous," Kantor said. Kantor, responding to a reporter's question, said the U.S. has not sought more Motorola cellular subscribers by the business trend line the U.S. firm has established elsewhere in Japan. The Motorola system, which signed up 12,900 cellular subscribers in the Tokyo and Nagoya areas after two years in service, has 438,000 subscribers elsewhere in the country, mostly in the Kansai area, after four years in operation. Kantor has accused Tokyo of violating a 1989 trade accord that promises "comparable access" to Motorola in the Japanese market and has vowed to impose sanctions against Japan if no settlement is reached through negotiations. While denying the U.S. has sought trend line sales targets, Kantor declined to discuss whether other types of numerical targets are in the U.S. proposal on grounds that negotiations are currently continuing between Motorola and its Japanese business partner Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. Nippon Idou offers both Motorola and a rival Japanese cellular phone system for its cellular service in the lucrative Tokyo and Nagoya areas, home to 60 million Japanese consumers. The U.S. Government is set to announce by Thursday next week a target list of Japanese products that will be subject to U.S. sanctions if no settlement is reached over the cellular telephone dispute.
