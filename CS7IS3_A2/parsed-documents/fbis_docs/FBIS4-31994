FBIS4-31994 "dreeu117__a94015" FBIS-EEU-94-117-A Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Minister Defends Health Insurance System Minister Defends Health Insurance System AU1606195794 Prague CTK in English 1849 GMT 16 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1606195794 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, June 16 (CTK) -- Czech Health Minister Ludek Rubas today rejected as false the claims by Jiri Nemec, director of the General Health Insurance Company (VZP), about the VZP's bad financial situation and stressed that "the health insurance system is facing no collapse." In the parliamentary health committee yesterday, Nemec said that the VZP, which covers health care for three-quarters of the population, might enter the next year with a deficit of 5.5 billion crowns (about $183 million). Nemec said that this is due to the tension between the limited revenues of the health insurance system and the growing expenditures on health care. "Health care costs are not rising according to how much people are ill, but according to how often the doctors are inviting them for examinations so that they gather as many points as possible for which they get money," Nemec said. Unless the Health Ministry and the parliament adopt regulatory measures to stop the doctors' hunt for points, the health insurance system may collapse, Nemec warned yesterday. He said that this would necessitate either higher health insurance payments which now constitute 13.5 percent of an employee's pre-tax pay or patients would have to start paying extra money in doctors' surgeries. A third variant is to decrease the point's value, according to the number of which doctors are paid. But experts believe that this method would paralyze health care, Nemec said. The VZP and the parliamentary committee have agreed that the system based on the number of points only had to be regulated. Health insurance companies should be free not to pay for the examinations which prove unnecessary, restrict prescription of costly foreign medicaments, or introduce patients' higher financial contribution to some types of treatment. Nemec said yesterday that health care was sufficiently funded. "With the seven percent from gross national product we have secured for us a leading position among poorer countries. But unfortunately we are not capable of appropriately managing the money." A statement from the Health Ministry given to CTK today said that the ministry was attentively following the financing of medical care, analyzing the present state, and studying regulatory mechanisms. Rubas has submitted to the parliament and government several proposals of late. It plans to amend the Health Code and legislation on insurance, insurance companies, including a list of medical performance categories and categories of medicaments, and to restrict patients' uncontrollable access to specialists. The amendments are to be discussed in the autumn, the statement says. It adds that Rubas has not found any reason to raise the health insurance rates because he believes that the insurance companies had the possibility to turn to revision doctors to examine whether particular treatment was necessary. The law not only renders this possible, but even orders the companies to do so, the statement says. Rubas and Nemec will meet tomorrow to discuss the above problems.
