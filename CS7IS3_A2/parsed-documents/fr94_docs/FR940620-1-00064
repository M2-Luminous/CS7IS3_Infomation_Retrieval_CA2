FR940620-1-00064 FR940620-1-00009 (2) The clause at 252.227&hyph;7013 does not permit a contractor to incorporate a third party's copyrighted software into a deliverable software item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the Government's behalf, or has obtained the contracting officer's written approval to do so. Grant approval to use third party copyrighted software in which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied without the third party material or when the use of the third party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh the lack of a copyright license. (b) Copyright considerations_special works. See 227.505 for copyright considerations when acquiring special works. 227.503&hyph;10 Contractor identification and marking of computer software or computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictive markings. (a) Identification requirements. (1) The solicitation provision at 252.227&hyph;7017, ``Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions'', requires offerors to identify prior to contract award, any computer software or computer software documentation that an offeror asserts should be provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure. This requirement does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. The notification and identification must be submitted as an attachment to the offer. If an offeror fails to submit the Attachment or fails to complete the Attachment in accordance with the requirements of the solicitation provision, such failure shall constitute a minor informality. Provide offerors an opportunity to remedy a minor informality in accordance with the procedures at FAR 14.405 or 15.607. An offeror's failure to correct an informality within the time prescribed by the contracting officer shall render the offer ineligible for award. (2) The procedures for correcting minor informalities shall not be used to obtain information regarding asserted restrictions or an offeror's suggested asserted rights category. Questions regarding the justification for an asserted restriction or asserted rights category must be pursued in accordance with the procedures at 227.503&hyph;13. (3) The restrictions asserted by a successful offeror shall be attached to its contract unless, in accordance with the procedures at 227.503&hyph;13, the parties have agreed that an asserted restriction is not justified. The contract Attachment shall provide the same information regarding identification of the computer software or computer software documentation, the asserted rights category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions as required by paragraph (d) of the solicitation provision. Subsequent to the contract award, the clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation'', permits a contractor to make additional assertions under certain conditions. The additional assertions must be made in accordance with the procedures and in the format prescribed by that clause. (4) Neither the pre- or post-award assertions made by the contractor nor the fact that certain assertions are identified in the Attachment to the contract, determine the respective rights of the parties. As provided at 227.503&hyph;13, the Government has the right to review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings. (5) Information provided by offerors in response to the solicitation provision may be used in the source selection process to evaluate the impact on evaluation factors that may be created by restrictions on the Government's ability to use computer software or computer software documentation. (b) Contractor marking requirements. The clause at 252.227&hyph;7014, ``Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation'' requires_ (1) A contractor who desires to restrict the Government's rights in computer software or computer software documentation to place restrictive markings on the software or documentation, provides instructions for the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorizes the use of certain restrictive markings. When it is anticipated that the software will or may be used in combat or situations which simulate combat conditions, do not permit contractors to insert instructions into computer programs that interfere with or delay operation of the software to display a restrictive rights legend or other license notice.
