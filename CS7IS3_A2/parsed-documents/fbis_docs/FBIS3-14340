The accord could be signed when the two sides reconvene on Tuesday morning in Cairo if the final details are ironed out in time, said the PLO's chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th. "As soon as this accord is signed, the negotiations on launching autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will resume immediately," after a month-long suspension because of the Hebron massacre, he told AFP. Sha'th said the agreement would cover the deployment of Palestinian police and Norwegian observers in the West Bank town where a Jewish settler killed 30 Moslem worshippers on February 25. The Israeli government will "commit itself to adopt measures to prevent friction" between the 450 settlers and 120,000 Palestinians of Hebron, he added. Sha'th confirmed earlier reports from Israel that the key outstanding issue was the number of police and observers to be posted in the town. The police will be posted at fixed points around Hebron to guard schools, hospitals and the university, he said. Joint Israeli-Palestinian units would patrol the town. He implicitly acknowledged that the Israeli army would have the final word on security, saying "the situation in Hebron will be different from Gaza and Jericho," where autonomy is to be launched. As for the autonomy negotiations, a final accord on the launch will be signed by April 13, the original date on which the Israeli army was to have pulled out of Gaza and Jericho, said Sha'th. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said earlier that he hoped the autonomy talks would resume on Tuesday along with a final session on the security arrangements for Hebron.
