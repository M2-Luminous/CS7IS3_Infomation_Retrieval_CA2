Saying that this suppression fully reveals the shamelessness of the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors and its fascist nature more truculent than the preceding military fascist groups, an analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: This time, the South Korean farmers and public figures held a peasants' rally and a daring demonstration. They were an entirely just struggle to defend the sovereignty of the nation and the vital interests of the South Korean farmers. They could not be a target of suppression at all. If there is one blamable, he is none other than the traitor Kim Yong-sam who threw away his "promise" to "defend" the rice market by staking his "presidency" and sold off the South Korean rice market to the U.S. masters for "an international cooperation system" intended to do harm to the fellow countrymen in the North. However, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, the very criminal, is brandishing the sword, incriminating the demonstrators who are out to defend the interests of the nation. It is a group of traitors without parallel in history and a gang of ignorant fascist hooligans. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must step down, discontinuing the foolish gamble to bridge over the "government" crisis and prolong its remaining days at the point of the fascist bayonet.
