An official in charge of the program said that the aim is to enhance family education and improve the quality of the education. The program will reach its climax on May 15 to mark the "International Family Day" which has been set by the United Nations. Beijing has about 2.35 million children aged under 14 years. Experts said that it is an important task to undertake family education among them. The program will help parents to learn the physiological and psychological characteristics of children under the age of 14, and to master scientific education methods to answer children's questions in their growing-up process. The program will also promote the idea of families improving their structure and becoming a favorable environment for the sake of children's healthy growth. The program will run training schools for parents in communities, get special articles and programs put out in the media, publish books and open consultancy services to improve family education. Beijing has now set up thousands of "schools for parents," and also has two special newspapers on family education. In 1980, Beijing Family Education Society was set up and in 1984, the city set up a Family Education Consultancy Center which has received 15,500 visits and 4,000 phone calls from parents.
