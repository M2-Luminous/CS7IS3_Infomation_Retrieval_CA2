Following a meeting that lasted all weekend, the party national board yesterday released three documents attacking the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which had been a desirable ally in the past. The three documents are: A strongly worded note that excludes Cardoso's ticket from the PT policy of alliances; an open letter to PSDB grassroots and voters asking for support for Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's candidacy; and a note criticizing the economic plan. The note that excludes the PSDB from the list of possible allies, which was approved by a 35-to-9 vote, charges the PSDB leadership with "opposing PSDB democratic demands, becoming a group allied with conservative sectors, and becoming a political alternative to sponsor an anti-Lula candidate." The open letter addressed to PSDB grassroots follows the same line. It states: "Despite our efforts, the main PSDB leaders have approached the perpetual partners of power, who cluster around the PFL [Liberal Front Party] of Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. The continuity of this alternative give a neatly conservative touch to the party." It adds: "Fernando Henrique Cardoso's name is being put at the service of conservative elites as the only alternative to face the reform movement represented by Lula's candidacy." The letter calls on PSDB members to prevent the party from "heading a conservative coalition" and calls on them to join Lula's campaign. In the third document, which opposes the economic plan, the PT assures that the plan is "an ongoing electoral fraud led by the same Cruzado plan team." The document also attacks Cardoso, saying: "That is the context within which he obtained his only victory through a vote." The Radical Democracy, led by Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino, was the only PT movement that disagreed with excluding the PSDB from the policy of alliances. "Narrowing the scope of the policy of alliances will reduce the conditions of governability of the future Lula government," he criticized. At another meeting, the state PT board yesterday decided to rule out the possibility of forming a coalition with the PSDB for the election in Sao Paulo. The board also debated on Deputy Jose Dirceu's campaign for governor, and nominated former Prefects Luiza Erundina and Telma de Souza as candidates for the Senate. On Saturday evening, the national PT board allowed PT lawmakers to participate in the constitutional reform. The victory of the party bloc, which disagreed with the prohibition imposed by party leaders, was by 33 votes against 19, and marked the defeat of party radicals. Lula, the virtual PT presidential candidate, yesterday criticized PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and Finance Minister Cardoso. Lula said Jereissati was "relapsing on conservatism, neoliberalism, and backwardness," because his party approached the PFL. Lula said he laments that Cardoso "is not interested in debating a progressive solution for Brazil." Lula claims that the PSDB is abandoning social democracy. "It is deeply lamentable that Jereissati, who began his political career by breaking the rule of bosses who dominated the northeast, should now have this conservative syndrome, seeking an alliance with the retrograde PFL, the party of Jorge Bornhausen, Ricardo Fiuza, Marco Maciel, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, and Joaquim Francisco," Lula said before comparing Jereissati's behavior with a sickness. "It is a dangerous relapse. It is necessary to find a vaccine because the epidemics is serious." Lula admitted that the PT is concerned about Cardoso's possible candidacy: "At a time when we can decide whether to put the destiny of the country in conservative or progressive hands, they chose the former." He said PSDB members will not agree to a coalition with Bornhausen's party. "The grassroots, who in 1990 prevented the party from falling into Collor's hands, will now prevent it from falling into PFL hands."
