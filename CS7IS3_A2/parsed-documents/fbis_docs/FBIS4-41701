A meeting of leaders and experts from oil companies in Istanbul was devoted to the development of oil and gas deposits on the Caspian shelf. Azerbaijan intends to sign it in the next few weeks [sentence as published]. However, within the flow of news anticipating the upcoming ceremonies, notes of alarm and bitterness have appeared in the local press in the past few days, going as far as the stunning news that the deal might not take place at all. Attention is focused on commentary concerning the Russian Federation's official position in respect of the legal base of the agreements being concluded with foreign companies in states around the Caspian in the absence of a status for the Caspian itself. The matter boils down to questions which Russia raised both a year ago and two years ago: It is necessary to determine the status of the Caspian -- legal, economic, environmental, and other norms for the joint use of this unique body of water and the rights and responsibility of all the Caspian states and each of them individually. The problem is undoubtedly debatable, extremely complex, and historically unclear. It appears that the most reasonable thing to do is to convene an international conference on the Caspian under the aegis of the United Nations, which would in fact settle all the controversial questions, including the most burning one -- whether to consider the Caspian to be a sea or a lake. It is quite lawful that, following the first contract of the century -- the "Tengiz" deal -- Russia deemed it necessary to express its stance on the second one, work on which is now being conducted in Istanbul. In principle, this concerns all agreements on the Caspian which have been concluded or are in the preparation stage, because the worsening environmental crisis, the high concentration of harmful substances, and likewise the uncontrolled fishing, equally concern Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Azerbaijan. Russia is not making an exception for itself: It has temporarily closed down the already developed oil deposits in the waters of Dagestan until the status of the Caspian is determined and a principle for dividing its wealth is elaborated. That is roughly how the Russian Federation embassy in Baku explained the situation, expressing regret that the normal notification through diplomatic channels of one state's stance to another -- a major company of which, British Petroleum, will conduct the development of deposits on the Azerbaijani section of the Caspian shelf -- was greeted with excessive suspicion. Furthermore, the opposition press was bursting with indignation, trying to accuse Russia of putting pressure on Azerbaijan and wanting to confirm its diktat over the Caspian. And, as usual, this question is being seen in the context of a Russian plan to settle the Karabakh conflict. The point of the reaction is clear: Pressure is being applied from the left and from the right. The official point of view, which leaves no room for doubt, is: It is more obvious to us with whom we should conduct talks, and what contracts should be concluded and on what terms. The British Petroleum office in Baku also did its bit, explaining that before the talks began the company studied all the visible and invisible legal aspects connected with the preparation of the contract. Observers, however, are unanimous in their opinion: Russia's position should not be ignored -- it concerns the fate of the Caspian as a whole, which is incomparable with the advantage of any one of the contracts. It is no secret that the closed ecosystem is gradually turning into a scrap heap and settling tank. During the latest storm everything is getting muddled up. Just try to distinguish where the most dangerous substances have been discharged -- in Sumgait or on the Turkmen coast. Not one Caspian state wants to bear the responsibility for the damage done. That is precisely what has dictated Russia's entirely reasonable concern about how the new developments, which notably rule out environmental control, will affect the state of the Caspian. Iran and Turkmenistan, remember, are also conducting work to develop the oil deposits on its parts of the Caspian shelf. Yes, the temptation of competing with Kuwait in terms of wealth, obtaining fantastic profits, and reviving the national economy is great. All this, however, should not rule out responsibility for the fate of the Caspian. Russia, as one of the Caspian states, (for the sake of the common good) does not want the sea shores to turn into a settling tank. However, the champions of national interests, who have been carried away by discussions on geopolitical themes, have not paid due attention to this. What are the interests of future generations to them: After all, all their time, it appears, is being spent in conjecture about renewed Russian expansion. Obviously, this is a shame.
