FR941130-0-00082 FR941130-0-00015 Substantive Changes to the NPRM The following discussion describes the significant changes since publication of the NPRM and the manner in which certain critical provisions will be initially implemented. They are discussed in the order in which they appear in the text of the regulations. The changes that apply to more than one program are described first followed by descriptions of changes that pertain to only a specific program. Student Assistance General Provisions Section 668.57␣Acceptable Documentation In the June 22, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary proposed to amend §668.57(c) to require the signature of one parent instead of both parents when verifying the number of family household members enrolled in postsecondary institutions for a dependent applicant. If only one parent's income is considered in the title IV, HEA aid awarding process, that is the parent who must sign. Otherwise, either parent may sign. This burden reduction provision will be addressed in the Student Assistance General Provisions final regulations governing verification of all title IV programs which will provide that either parent may sign, regardless of which parent's income is reported. Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, and FSEOG Programs Sections 674.10, 675.10, and 676.10␣Selection of Students In the June 22, 1994 NPRM the Secretary proposed to amend §§674.10, 675.10, and 676.10 to state that if an institution's FSEOG allocation, FWS grant, or Federal Perkins Loan FCC is directly or indirectly based in part on the financial need of less-than-full-time or independent students and if the need of all of these students exceeds 5 percent of the total need of all students at an institution, then at least 5 percent of that allotment for FSEOG, 5 percent of that grant for FWS, or 5 percent of the dollar amount of the loans made under the Federal Perkins Loan program must be made available to these students. The Department previously had stated in various documents that ``make available'' meant that an institution was required to actually ``expend'' the dollars for these students. In response to the public comments and as part of his efforts to reduce regulatory burden, the Secretary is revising the final regulations to provide that the institution must ``offer'' the funds to less-than-full-time and independent students. The institution is not required to have actually disbursed the title IV funds to less-than-full-time and independent students. Sections 674.14, 675.14, and 676.14␣Overaward A financial aid administrator may not award or disburse aid from a campus-based program if that aid, when combined with all other resources, would exceed the student's need. If the student receives additional resources at any time during the award year that were not considered in determining the student's eligibility for aid, and these resources combined with the expected financial aid will exceed the student's need, the amount in excess of the student's need is considered an overaward. Statutory provisions under the Amendments provided for a $300 overaward threshold for FWS. In the June 22, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary proposed that, if a student has FWS, a $300 overaward threshold for the three campus-based programs would be in effect; however, if a student only has an FSEOG or Federal Perkins Loan, the current $200 overaward threshold would be the limit. In response to the public comments and as part of his efforts to reduce regulatory burden, the Secretary is providing a uniform $300 overaward threshold for all the campus-based programs regardless of whether the student has been awarded FWS funds. Federal Perkins Loan Program Section 674.33␣Repayment Section 674.34␣Deferment of Repayment In the June 22, 1994 NPRM, the Secretary made proposals for the implementation of the statutory provisions governing forbearance of a borrower's repayment of a Federal Perkins loan and the deferment of repayment due to economic hardship reasons. The provisions contained in the NPRM paralleled the same provisions in the FFEL Program, as detailed in the FFEL Program NPRM, published on March 24, 1994. In response to the comments received on the FFEL Program NPRM, the Secretary made significant changes to the forbearance and economic hardship provisions in the final FFEL Program regulation, published on June 29, 1994. Those same changes have been made to the forbearance and economic hardship provisions in the Federal Perkins Loan program, as part of the Secretary's ongoing effort to reduce the institutional burden of administering the title IV student aid programs. These changes include the revisions to the definition of ``full-time employment'' for purposes of granting an economic hardship deferment. In accordance with amendments to the HEA made by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;382), the Secretary is revising the final regulations to include a new criterion under which a borrower may qualify for deferment of repayment due to economic hardship reasons.
