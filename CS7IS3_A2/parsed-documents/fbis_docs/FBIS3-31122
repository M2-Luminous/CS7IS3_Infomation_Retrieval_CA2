Towpik added that the conversation was devoted primarily to the Partnership for Peace concept. The status of the Polish presentation document, which is to be submitted before Poland joins the Partnership for Peace programme, was discussed. Towpik emphasized that the partnership concept is a very broad program that requires constant discussion. In his opinion the Polish side is trying to understand the idea of partnership, and NATO representatives will learn in the course of this discussion that certain elements of the [Partnership for Peace] concept require more precise definition and explanation.
