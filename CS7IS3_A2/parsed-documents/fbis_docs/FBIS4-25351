The plenary session listened to Governor He Zhiqiang's report on the Yunnan provincial delegation's visit to Cambodia, Thailand, and Burma. In his report, after briefing the current session on the visit, the governor said: A rare opportunity has emerged for Yunnan to conduct economic cooperation with Cambodia, Thailand, Burma, and the rest of Southeast Asia. With its geographical conditions and existing influence, the province has relative strong points for expanding cooperation with these countries and the region. He said: To seize the opportunity, to bring the strong points into play, expand cooperation, and accelerate development in the days to come, we should further unify our thinking and steps. In light of the development of the situation and their own conditions, all localities and units should earnestly study and make plans for work with foreign countries, genuinely focus work on Southeast Asia and South Asia, and make great efforts to create conditions to develop trade in a larger-scale sense, turn border trade into part and parcel of the province's trade with other countries, and enter the large-scale, higher-grade markets of the vast areas of the province's neighboring countries and third countries with their products. In terms of the province's economic and trade relations with its neighboring countries and the Southeast Asian and South Asian regions, while developing trade with them, we should gradually develop the export-oriented processing industries with stress on expanding economic and technological cooperation, speed up the pace of establishing an export-oriented economy and take measures and create conditions to help enterprises and companies whose conditions are ripe to go abroad for greater access to the Southeast and South Asian markets in extensive cooperation with enterprises run by the state, collectives, and individuals. We should change small-scale, fragmental, and scattered primary modes of operation and initially foster a number of effective and financially strong group companies, set up enterprises and do more business in the surrounding countries, bring the strong points into play for the long term, carry out contracting business with some countries in specific items of cooperation, bring Kunming's role as a central city into full play so that it will become a newly rising city which has extensive economic ties, a certain position, and some strength in Southeast Asia. He Zhiqiang said: We should put construction of an international thoroughfare to Southeast Asia in the forefront and actively carry out cooperation with neighboring countries, with the focus on the cooperative exploitation of natural resources, and at the same time, accelerate the reform of the foreign trade, foreign economic cooperation, and financial structures, and create conditions for expanding cooperation with foreign countries. After hearing He Zhiqiang's report, Yin Jun said: The He Zhiqiang-led delegation's visit to three Southeast Asian countries was a success. It will play an important role in further consolidating and developing the province's friendship with the three countries and accelerating exchange and cooperation with them. The visit has enabled us to have a correct understanding of our province's strong points and a greater sense of urgency, to better seize the opportunity, open wider to the outside world, and promote our province's economic development. He said: According to the plan of the provincial party committee, people's congresses at all levels should speed up the pace of legislation, exercise effective supervision, and create a better environment and conditions for our province's opening up to the outside world, and particularly, for promoting exchanges and cooperation with neighboring countries.
