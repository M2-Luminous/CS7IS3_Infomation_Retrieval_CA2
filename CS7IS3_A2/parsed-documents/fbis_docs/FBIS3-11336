The announcement was made today by Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in New York. [Begin recording] [Reporter Paulo Henrique Amorim] Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today received from the Brazilian representative at the World Bank, Marcos Caramuru, information on the decision just made by the creditor banks. Cardoso then talked with reporters. [Cardoso] We are, therefore, in a condition to say that by 15 April, which is the deadline, the foreign debt issue will definitely be a closed issue. [Amorim] In other words, after 11 years Brazil finally has a final agreement with the creditor banks. [Cardoso] That is right, after 11 years. I believe the banks committee decision conveys to the financial community that Brazil is now solvent, that it is even with its foreign debt. [Amorim] Now that this problem has been solved, does your candidacy for the presidency become more or less feasible? [Cardoso] No, that makes Brazilian growth more feasible, the economic program more feasible; I believe in a short time it will allow the so-called risk interest rate to fall because there will be no reasons for that, because we will no longer have any problems with the international financial community. Any candidacy based on an economic program of the type we proposed, but not necessarily mine, will be stronger. [Amorim] Nothing resembles the program of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso more than Fernando Henrique Cardoso. [Cardoso] Certainly, the program is really close if not identical to my beliefs. I say it is not perhaps identical because the program is not mine alone; it is also the country's. But I believe this program is an important program. I believe the acceptance made in the foreign debt negotiations is a vote of confidence. Even when we did not yet have the final and necessary guarantees for an agreement, we already had obtained from the international financial community a very clear signal that Brazil has all the necessary conditions for growth. And I believe anyone who bets on that will bet on Brazil, and betting on Brazil means he will have a chance to win for the benefit of Brazil. I repeat, it is not necessary that I be the one, but someone like me. [end recording] The Banks Committee has suggested that the Brazilian creditor banks grant a waiver [preceding word in English], that is, a pardon for the Brazilian Government, to close the foreign debt negotiations even without an agreement with the IMF. The banks have until 24 March to reply. The pardon will only be possible if it is approved by two-thirds of the creditors.
