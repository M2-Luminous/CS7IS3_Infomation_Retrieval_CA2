Hosokawa made the remarks at a meeting of the House of Councillors Special Committee on Political Reform. Responding to a question from Liberal Democratic Party member Minao Hattori about 77 million yen of the 100 million yen from Sagawa Kyubin, Hosokawa said the money "was not directly for election," but that he "had to secure my own assets to prepare for the gubernatorial election." On the use of the 77 million yen, Hosokawa had said he used the money to purchase a condominium in central Tokyo. As for the remaining 23 million yen, the premier has said he used the money to repair the front gate and wall of his residence in Kumamoto, western Japan. Hosokawa has said he repaid the loan by January 31, 1991, using part of his retirement allowance, after stepping down as governor of Kumamoto, in addition to using the proceeds from the sale of a plot of land in Tokyo. Hosokawa served as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture for two consecutive terms from 1983 until February 1991. Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, one of the Sagawa Kyubin Group firms, was the central firm in the 1992 money-and-mob scandal. Former kingpin Shin Kanemaru was forced to resign from politics after admitting he had received 500 million yen in undeclared donations from the firm.
