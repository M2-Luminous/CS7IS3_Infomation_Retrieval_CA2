Entrusted by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, I have come to the meeting and, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, to deeply cherish the memory of Comrade Jiao Yulu, to extend heartfelt regards to relatives of Comrade Jiao Yulu, and to express high consideration for fine Communist Party members, fine cadres, and other advanced individuals who have emerged in the great practice of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization and who have carried forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu. Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good member of the CPC, a good public servant of the people, and a good example for county secretaries and the broad masses of cadres. This is acknowledged by all party comrades and the people of all nationalities throughout the country. He dedicated all his life to the cause of the party and the interests of the people. In the early 1960's, Comrade Jiao Yulu was secretary of the Lankao County CPC Committee. In order to change the poverty-stricken situation in areas afflicted by natural disasters in Lankao, despite illness, he led the people of the whole county in fighting stubbornly against serious natural disasters. He went deep into the reality and the grass-roots level to seriously conduct investigation, to listen to the demands of the people, to concern himself with their plight, to earnestly help them overcome difficulties, and to bring the warmth of the party to tens of thousands of households. He devoted himself to his work, worked diligently, performed official duties honestly, carried out arduous struggle, always linked his heart with those of the people, and maintained the fine quality of a Communist. At the last moment of his life, he was still thinking of how to help the people live a happy and prosperous life and how to make the country grow and flourish. Comrade Jiao Yulu consciously linked the lofty ideal of the realization of communism with the arduous struggle carried out in a down-to-earth manner in the present stage, made selfless contributions, did his utmost to explore, served the people wholeheartedly, and depended entirely on the people. Through his own actions, he portrayed the shining image of an outstanding member and cadre of the Communist Party and erected a towering monument in the hearts of the people. For the past 30 years, his moving deeds have educated and inspired thousands upon thousands of party members, cadres, and ordinary people to constantly move forward. His great spirit will always shine with dazzling splendor in the progress of historical development. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, China has made spectacular achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization which have attracted worldwide attention and the face of the whole country has undergone profound change. The tasks we are shouldering today are different from those when Comrade Jiao Yulu was alive. The social environment, working conditions, and people's ideology and concepts have also changed greatly. While taking economic construction as the center, building socialist material and spiritual civilization, and promoting another leap in society and history, all party comrades and all the people of the country are constantly making progress themselves. The spirit of the time, which includes emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, energetically making exploration, boldly blazing new trails, carrying out arduous struggle, advancing despite difficulties, learning from foreign countries, making unremitting efforts to improve oneself, being modest and prudent, guarding against arrogance and rashness, being of one heart and one mind, taking the overall situation into consideration, practicing economy, being honest, rousing oneself to make the country prosperous, and making selfless contribution, have all been further developed. At the same time, we must also be aware that ideas and styles of money worship which "puts money above everything else," hedonism which advocates seeking ease and comfort, and blatant egotism which places individual interests in first place, have also grown and spread among some of the people. Under these circumstances, no matter whether or not we are trying to carry forward the spirit of the times or to resist the influence of various negative and decadent ideas, it is all the more necessary for us to adhere to the party's purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, to inherit and carry forward the fine style of establishing close ties with the masses of people and of doing arduous pioneering work, and to advocate through great efforts the spirit of Jiao Yulu. It can be said that today, seriously learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu remains as the demand of our great era, the call by the people of all nationalities throughout the whole country, and the need in strengthening party building and developing socialist modernization. The goal of our present stage is to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. The general task for the whole party and the whole country at present is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability. In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu in the new period, we should have our feet firmly planted in the present, have our eyes on the future, and integrate the lofty ideal of realizing communism with carrying out socialist modernization in a down-to-earth manner. The fundamental objective of carrying out reform and opening up, and of establishing the socialist market economy structure, is to liberate and develop the social productive forces, to strengthen the comprehensive national strength of our socialist country, to improve the living standards of the people, and eventually to realize common prosperity. As a genuine Communist Party member, one should firmly establish the correct ideal, faith, and outlook on life, unswervingly carry out the party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," increase one's sense of responsibility and mission in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and give expression to one's value of life in the course of endeavoring to make greater contributions to reform, opening up, and modernization. In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu in the new period, we should, as did Jiao Yulu, serve the people wholeheartedly, establish close ties with the people, do everything for the people, and trust and rely on the people in all matters. Comrade Jiao Yulu "had everyone on his mind except himself." What he thought or did was precisely what the broad masses of people needed most and what he criticized and opposed, was precisely what the broad masses of people detested and hated. He always "appeared in front of the people when they were in difficulty and showed concern for and helped the people when they needed help most." This is the fundamental reason why Jiao Yulu enjoys such a high prestige in the minds of the people. The reform, opening up, and socialist modernization we are engaged in at present are a brand-new cause in human history and are also the people 's own cause. In the course of advance, we will inevitably encounter many new situations and new problems and only by relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses of people can the problems be solved. In particular, in the current process of deepening reform, some deep contradictions will gradually become conspicuous and some people will meet with some new difficulties in production and daily life. Therefore, we should study these problems and find solutions to them together with the masses of people in a serious and responsible manner. Leading cadres at all levels must further strengthen their mass viewpoint, adhere to the mass line, safeguard the fundamental interests of the people, go among the people to find out their weal and woe, listen to their demands, strive to solve problems and overcome difficulties about which the people are concerned, and properly handle various contradictions among the people. The masses of people are the source of our party's strength and the basis of the victory of our cause. All party comrades should firmly strike roots among the people and serve the people well. With the trust and support of the people, the victory of our cause is guaranteed. In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu in the new period we should, as did Jiao Yulu, adhere to the party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts, proceed from reality in everything we do, speak the truth, do solid work, explore boldly, and work creatively. Comrade Jiao Yulu went deep into reality, carried out investigations and studies, respected the practice of the people, proceeded from the reality of Lankao, made and implemented the correct policy decision on putting the "three disasters" under control, and made important contributions to changing the face of Lankao. He seriously implemented the decisions made at higher levels and paid attention to implementing them in light of local reality. He was fond of reading and studying but he did not blindly follow what the books said. He paid attention to studying other people's experiences but he never used such experience mechanically. This is also an important reason why Jiao Yulu was able to work with so well and why he enjoyed popular support. Today, if we want to seize the opportunity to develop ourselves and to push forward the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must pay greater attention to grasping the essence of Marxism in emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, study hard, master a scientific world outlook and methodology, uphold the principle of putting practice first, respect the objective laws of the development of things, comprehensively understand and implement the party's line, policies, principles, and various reform measures, correctly understand and handle contradictions and problems with which we are faced, guard against one-sidedness and avoid thinking in terms of absolutes, and reduce subjectivism and blindness. Regarding new problems we face, it is all the more necessary for us to study them with utmost care, energetically solve them, boldly explore them, creatively work on them, and to constantly raise our leadership level and develop our work ability. In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu in the new period we should, like Jiao Yulu, fear no hardships and dangers, fight with fortitude, and do arduous pioneering work. Waging arduous struggle and making unremitting efforts to improve oneself are fine traditions of our party and the Chinese nation. These fine traditions were fully manifested by Jiao Yulu. When Lankao was hard hit by serious natural disasters, Jiao Yulu, in the dauntless and heroic spirit of a Communist, pressed forward in the face of difficulties, dared to "pose as hero before difficulties," and aroused the determination and fighting will of the people to triumph over difficulties through his own deeds. Ours is a great cause which is full of hope and also strewn with hardship. A great cause needs a great spirit. Waging arduous struggle is a kind of noble moral integrity and also provides a tremendous strength for cutting through brambles and thorns, blazing new trails, and for forging ahead. In the course of reform and construction, especially when we encounter difficulties, it is even more necessary for us to carry forward the spirit of waging arduous struggle. As Communist Party members, we should not fear hardships or dangers and should never recoil with fear and accomplish nothing. We should make unremitting efforts to improve ourselves, do pioneering work, and forge ahead, and should never stick to old ways and cease to make progress. We should practice economy and treasure the wealth created by the people and we should never indulge in ostentation or competition in spending, extravagance, and waste. In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu, we should perform official duties honestly and work diligently for the people. Jiao Yulu did not go to Lankao to become an official. He went there to work for the people's interests. To date, the people still talk extensively about how he performed his official duties honestly and exercised self-discipline. "The history of the country and of all the great men in the past shows that diligence and thrift lead to success but extravagance leads to failure." We should remember this old saying. Party and government cadres, leading cadres in particular, at all levels must follow the example of Jiao Yulu, consciously temper themselves to strengthen their party characteristics, always put the party's cause in an important position, and set high demands on themselves. They should correctly use the power given them by the people, work hard, strive to do solid work to benefit the people, resolutely fight against phenomena of corruption, and live up to the hopes of the broad masses of people. Comrade Jiao Yulu is a brilliant example for our broad masses of party members, leading cadres at all levels in particular. Party committees at all levels should regard learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu as an important measure to strengthen the building of the ideology and work styles of party and state power organs, to strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual civilization, and to promote reform, opening up, and socialist modernization in China. They should: Continue to do a good job and make achievements in this respect; further enhance the formation of a public opinion environment for developing healthy trends, suppressing unhealthy trends, and encouraging people to make progress; and should promote the more extensive and thorough development of activities to learn from Jiao Yulu. They should link learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu with the implementation of the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, with the study of the Volume 3 of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and with safeguarding and promoting the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. In the course of doing so, they should strive to train and nurture thousands upon thousands of good party members and good cadres like Jiao Yulu. In activities to learn from Jiao Yulu, leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in setting examples through their own actions, comprehensively improve their own quality, lead the broad masses of cadres and people in plunging themselves into the practice of seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, maintain stability, and make new achievements in and greater contributions to the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics!
