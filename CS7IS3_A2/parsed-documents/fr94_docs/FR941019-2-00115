The Guidelines, when adopted in final form by the Department and the Commission, will state the antitrust enforcement policy of the Department and the Commission with respect to the international aspects of business operations. The Department's 1988 Antitrust Guidelines for International Operations will be withdrawn when these draft Guidelines are adopted in final form. Portions of the 1988 guidelines will also be superseded by the Department's proposed Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing and Acquisition of Intellectual Property, which recently have been published for public comment in the Federal Register . See 59 FR 41,339 (Aug. 11, 1994). [Comments on these draft Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations should be submitted in writing within 60 days of their publication.] for further information: Persons wishing to comment on the proposed Guidelines must submit their views to both Ms. Diane P. Wood, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, Tenth and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20530, 202&hyph;514&hyph;2404; and Mr. Walter T. Winslow, Associate Director, Bureau of Competition, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580, 202&hyph;326&hyph;2560. supplementary information: These proposed Guidelines were drafted to state the current views of the Department and the Commission on antitrust enforcement policy with respect to international business operations. The Guidelines are not intended to create or recognize any legally enforceable right in any person. They are not intended to affect the admissibility of evidence or in any other way necessarily to affect the course or conduct of any present or future litigation. Moreover, changes in the relevant statutory framework, legal precedent, and methods of internal Department and Commission analysis may occur over time, and these changes will not always be simultaneously reflected in amendments to the Guidelines. Parties seeking to know the Department's or the Commission's specific enforcement intentions should consider using the Department's Business Review Procedure, see 28 CFR 50.6 (1993), or the Commission's Advisory Opinion procedure. See 16 C.F.R. §§1.1&hyph;1.4 (1993). Dated: October 13, 1994. Diane P. Wood, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice.
