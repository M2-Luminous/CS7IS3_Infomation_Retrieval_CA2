The correspondent says since mid-May, government forces have been involved in an offensive against positions of UNITA and the Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] in the northern part of the territory. The offensive has already claimed many innocent lives. In a counteroffensive launched on 1 June, the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] overran a People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] convoy moving from (Nicuma) to Buco Zau. At the end a four-hour fierce clash, FAPLA troops fled, leaving seven dead behind. Large quantities of war materiel, including four RPG-7's and three PKM machine guns were captured. In a separate incident, FALA destroyed a FAPLA motorized column moving from (Choa) in support of government forces in northern Cabinda. Nine FAPLA soldiers were killed and six vehicles burned. The survivors fled in disarray. Meanwhile, latest reports from the city of Bie [Cuito] say artillery fire was exchanged last night. Light weapons were heard near government positions this morning. No changes had been reported yesterday. MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] fighter aircraft continued to bomb civilian targets, while FAPLA infantry units shelled wards controlled by UNITA in a failed attempt to break through UNITA defensive lines. Our correspondent reports that decomposed corpses of government soldiers are scattered on the roads of Bie. MPLA-PT troops are using UN relief food earmarked for civilians.
