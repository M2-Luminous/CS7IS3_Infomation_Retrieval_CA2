FR940325-2-00038 FR940325-2-00015 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Chicago Field Office, Dallas Support Office Grant and Cooperative Agreement Awards: Oklahoma State University AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Field Office, through the Dallas Support Office, announces that it intends to award a grant to Oklahoma State University (OSU)/International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA). The proposed award meets the criteria in 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) in addition to the type of factors listed in 10 CFR 600.14(d). The financial assistance is for support of the Geothermal Heating and Cooling Teleconference '94 and '95. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Geothermal Heating and Cooling Teleconference '94 and '95 are the most significant national teleconferences concentrating on the use of ground source heat pumps as an energy efficient method of heating and cooling buildings. The primary target audiences for these teleconferences are school buildings, residences and government buildings. These buildings have unique needs for heating, cooling and water heating. Advances in ground source heat pump efficiency and installation techniques, as well as reductions in installation costs, make the cost of this technology comparable with those of competitive heating and cooling technologies, while operating costs and energy usage are demonstrably lower. This is especially important for institutional and government facilities faced with budget constraints and increasing utility expenditures. These teleconferences, which will include successful case studies and interviews with designers, technical experts and representatives of the various targeted audiences, will provide information on a economical, energy efficient and environmentally beneficial method for heating and cooling facilities. DOE's mission of increasing energy efficiency in the institutional, residential and governmental sectors will be advanced through participation in the teleconference. The DOE anticipates providing funds in the amount of $30,000 for each of the two teleconferences over a project period of 24 months. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda K.
