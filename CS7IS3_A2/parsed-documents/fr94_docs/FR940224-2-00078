FR940224-2-00078 FR940224-2-00041 Technology issues. Banks as well as other financial and non-financial institutions are installing or planning to install advanced technology to support their critical business functions. For example, many major banking organizations employ real-time control procedures to manage their own and customer payments over major large-value electronic payment systems. Many financial organizations are also continuing to automate major dealing functions and integrate these with their clearing and payment systems. In turn, in order to provide the banking and financial system with advanced tools with which to design payment and settlement arrangements using central bank money, the Federal Reserve is installing advanced computing and communications systems. These systems will support all of the Federal Reserve's national payment services and accounting functions. Among other things, this new technology will enable the Federal Reserve to provide real-time gross settlement services in central bank money virtually around-the-clock. Other benefits of this technology are expected to include greater payments processing efficiency, improvements in the reliability and availability of critical payment systems, and enhanced contingency processing capabilities. Most existing accounting and other back office systems require that banks, including Federal Reserve Banks, accumulate a wide range of transactions throughout the day in order to calculate and balance customer account positions. Traditionally, this ``end-of-day'' processing has been treated as a batch operation for which large quantities of information are accumulated from a variety of sources and then processed overnight. For example, information received from large commercial banks that provide corporate payment services and U.S. dollar clearing services reveals that their current systems have been designed to perform end-of-day processing within an approximate six- to eight-hour window. Most large commercial banks are either currently changing, or have plans to change, their systems to move to a two- to four-hour end-of-day processing window, an evolution which should be completed within about five years. Contingency processing requirements also need to be considered in connection with proposals to expand Fedwire funds transfer operating hours, or bank payment system operations more generally. Specifically, for large commercial banks, an 18-hour operating day compresses the current end-of-day processing period, including a ``cushion'' of time to deal with the failure of regular systems or other unexpected operational disruptions that must be resolved before opening for the next day's business. The Board believes that current efforts by banks and other financial institutions to use technology to improve the efficiency of end-of-day processing will, over the next several years, reduce the time necessary to perform these activities. Thus, with a 3-year lead time, an 18-hour Fedwire day should provide an adequate cushion of time for end-of-day processing under normal and most contingency conditions. Operational costs. The Reserve Bank's incremental costs to expand operating hours can be estimated fairly accurately. The estimated incremental costs to the Federal Reserve of lengthening the current 10-hour funds transfer operating day to 18 hours are relatively small compared to the total cost of providing the service. Specifically, the Board estimates that an 18-hour day beginning at 12:30 a.m. e.t. will add roughly $2.5 to $4.0 million to annual Fedwire funds transfer operating costs, or about 3 to 5 percent of 1993 total service costs. 4 (The Board recently asked staff to study issues related to Federal Reserve pricing methodology, which is underway.) 4 The Federal Reserve's estimated incremental costs associated with providing a near 24-hour operation are significantly higher than for an 18-hour operation. The incremental costs that would be incurred by banks in using the Fedwire funds transfer service during expanded hours are difficult to estimate. In any event, the incremental operational costs to banks of participating in expanded hours would be incurred entirely voluntarily. Banks would make individual business decisions whether to use the Fedwire funds transfer service during expanded hours. Monetary control and reserve management issues. The Board believes that an expansion of Fedwire funds transfer operating hours, involving a 6:30 p.m. e.t. closing time, does not complicate reserve maintenance for banks. Also, provided that there is a sufficient break in time during the operating day for purposes of measuring reserve holdings, monetary measurement and control problems do not arise for the Federal Reserve. In the event of full 24-hour operations, both monetary measurement and control issues would need careful attention.
