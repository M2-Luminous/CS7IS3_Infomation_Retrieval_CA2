FBIS4-5359 "dreas069_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 South Korea General Accounting Office Reports on DPRK General Accounting Office Reports on DPRK SK1104055994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0524 GMT 11 Apr 94 SK1104055994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN ["Hawks in U.S. Take Upperhand Touting Military Option in Korea" -- YONHAP headline] [Text] Washington, April 10 (YONHAP) -- As U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry prepares to visit South Korea, attention is being focused on stepped-up efforts by "the hawks" to picture the North Korean nuclear issue as a military crisis on the peninsula. One sign underscoring the move is a special report to be submitted Monday to Congress by its research arm, the General Accounting Office [GAO], on military options available to Washington and Seoul in the nuclear dispute with Pyongyang. Another indication is an unconfirmed report that the Pentagon was trying to secure military manpower that could be deployed to the Korean peninsula in case of another war. In addition, rumor had it that a U.S. intelligence support team might be formed in South Korea, as hinted earlier by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director James Woolsey, and that a state-of-the-art ground facility capable of analyzing intelligence collected by satellite could be set up here soon. Against this backdrop, American analysts specializing in Korean affairs say there are two main aspects to the situation. The hard-liners (the hawks) in Washington want to prepare for a military solution to the Korean nuclear row if the UN Security Council fails to break the impasse. At the same time, they wish to sway American public opinion in favor of the military option, according to the analysts. The GAO report carries the caveat that it was only spotlighting possible solution of the nuclear issue through options that could be exercised by Washington and Seoul -- and by Pyongyang. The report offers options that include the use of nuclear weapons. There is the shocking possibility, it says, that North Korea could explode one or two nuclear bombs hidden in tunnels near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and allow radioactive particles to drift Southward. This horrifying possibility does not end there. As a result of the nuclear explosions in the DMZ, South Korean and U.S. troops would be dealt a crippling blow as the blasts knocked out ultra-modern military equipment. Taking advantage of this initial blow, North Korea would send its powerful conventional forces sweeping down into the South. The accuracy of the GAO report's military logistics remains unclear, but it has nevertheless drawn keen interest because the GAO is recognized throughout the country as authoritative, independent and trustworthy. Informed sources also note that the GAO report was issued as Perry, who is regarded as one of the hawks, was preparing to visit Seoul. The report may have been meant not only for domestic consumption but also for leaders in South Korea and Japan, they say. Further raising eyebrows in Washington was a proposal on the possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. Quoting the Center for Defense Intelligence (CDI), a private analysis organization, the GAO report pointed to a plan that calls for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea if the North abandons its nuclear program. The possibility of a U.S. troop withdrawal is obviously being raised in light of concern for the safety of American soldiers in Korea. It also indicates that if war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. military could concentrate on air and naval support. In other words, America is considering changing the role of its troops in South Korea in a new security arrangement between Washington and Seoul, analysts say. In any event, a recent series of moves by American hard-liners is aimed at strenthening and sharpening U.S. public opinion on the North Korean nuclear issue. Various opinion polls indicate that a majority of Americans oppose U.S. intervention in Korea if another war breaks out on the peninsula. The hawks obviously feel they must change this attitude -- and soon -- because North Korea is not listening to the White House, they said.
