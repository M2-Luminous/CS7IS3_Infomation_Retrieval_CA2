He was born in the Zhitomir region. He graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk rail transport institute with a diploma in railway process management. His career choice was not an accident, but followed a family tradition. After graduating from the institute, he was sent to work as a dispatcher-on-duty at the Darnitsa station. The young specialist's professional skills and initiative did not go unnoticed. He rose to become a station chief, the head of the Kiev branch of the South-Western Railroad, deputy railway director and, when the State Rail Transport Administration was established, he became its first vice-president. There is probably no other sector which reflects the economic crisis more quickly or fully than transport, especially rail transport. It is a barometer which very precisely measures the level of well-being and economic welfare in society. Ukrainian Railway Director General Leonid Zheleznyak took part in a press conference held by Ukraine Transport Minister Orest Klymnush. He called the existing situation in rail transport catastrophic. A HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent asked Ukrainian Railways Director General Leonid Zheleznyak to explain how and why a sector once considered very stable found itself in a catastrophic situation, and, most important, what we are to expect in the near term as well as in a more distant future. [Pysanska] Leonid Leonidovych, without idealizing the work of rail transport under socialism, it will probably be correct to say that initially there were none of the current problems. What is their cause? [Zheleznyak] The transport system of the former Soviet Union functioned well because the economy did. I do not want to call it nostalgia, but as a specialist in railway management I never had to worry where I would get hard currency to purchase imported engines, spare parts and equipment, all of which was distributed centrally. It may have been a bad thing. But regardless of whether it was good or bad, Ukraine received each year heat-powered and electric engines, locomotives and railroad cars worth 75 million hard currency rubles. My job was to distribute them properly in order to prevent breakdowns in the transport system. Remember the kind of trains that used to run to Moscow, Simferopol, Odessa and Lvov? Of course, none of it happened by itself: there were difficulties and 17-hour work days, but all that work produced tangible results. Today we work no less, but we are facing a catastrophic reduction in transport volumes. They have fallen by half from last year because there has been a decline in industry. Here are some examples. At the Lvov transit terminal, which functions as a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe, we used to handle up to 1,000 cars of imported goods per day. Today, there are barely 200 cars of such goods. We had to close transit yards and cut experienced personnel. Having left the Union and divided property--justly or not--the state made a fatal error: it broke up economic links which had been built over several decades. It was the beginning of a breakdown of a well-functioning transport system. [Pysanska] But everything that belonged to us--six railroads and all the factories--remained our property. [Zheleznyak] We quit the ruble zone without signing an inter-state banking agreement. This is why we have been unable to settle accounts with other countries. We have the factories, but demand for their output has gone down; output levels are declining by as much as 25 percent per year, and nobody buys freight cars any more (with the exception of tanker cars). Demand is falling even for the once-desirable output of the giant heat-powered engine builder, the Lugansk plant, because neither we nor other railroads have much to transport. Production has effectively been suspended. Yet, 30,000 highly skilled professionals used to work there. This is why tens of thousands of freight cars run empty--and not only here in Ukraine: there is nothing to transport in them. The number of cars which need repairs is growing. But this is only the beginning. The tragedy will come later, when industry finally begins to recover while transport will continue to decline, for this is a special feature of this sector. As a result, output will not get where it is needed. This is why we are currently trying to explain to the government of Ukraine, and our colleagues in other CIS states are trying to explain to their own governments, that if efforts are not made to stabilize rail transports now, then later, to remedy the situation, hundreds of billions of dollars will be required. [Pysanska] What funds are being invested in rail transport today? [Zheleznyak] You may not believe it: none. This has been the case for the past three years. We have not been maintaining equipment and this tactic is leading to disaster. We no longer properly repair tracks while stock constantly moves over them. One out of every six kilometers of track is in an unacceptable condition. Last year alone, we repaired 700 kilometers of track less than we had planned. Today, 35 million wooden ties should be replaced, but even one tenth cannot be done, since there is a shortage of timber. Nor can we purchase them, since ties cost $17 each. [Pysanska] But could this situation not have been foreseen? As a specialist, we could have warned them, used arguments, persuaded, etc. [Zheleznyak] But did anybody ask, did anybody listen? In our country, politicians manage the economy, and results turn out accordingly. Ukrainian Railway and transport ministry managers constantly inform the Cabinet of Ministers, the Supreme Council and the president, explaining that this kind of management will result in a breakdown of rail transport, which is already starting to happen. Today, no one can say that specialists did not report this fully. We are convinced that regardless of political changes economic links must not be destroyed. We carried out the decision by heads of states who had signed an agreement to divide freight cars. Accordingly, we won our 18.4 percent share of the total, but as I have already said tens of thousands of them stand idle. [Pysanska] How will it turn out? [Zheleznyak] If we continue to work with current prices and tariffs, as well as under the existing system for setting them, which we have not yet been able to master, we are headed for an economic famine and will not be able to provide for our needs for oil products and electric power. The economy will effectively come to a halt. Even though we do not support the policy of constant tariff increases, the other path, that of direct subsidies from the budget, has already been tried. We have proposed many times to set a profitability level for rail transport, which is how it is done elsewhere in the civilized world. This is where we see a solution. Because raising prices for freight transport quickly translates into higher costs of goods. Today, railways are losing K30 billion a day from their commercial activities. [Pysanska] One often hears proposals to charge near-abroad countries when they transport their freight on Ukrainian railways. [Zheleznyak] This is amateurish talk. No one and nowhere ever transports freight free of charge. We charge them in accordance with international rules and agreements. [Pysanska] What is your opinion about customs controls on long-distance trains? [Zheleznyak] I have no opinion about this shameful practice. Not even taking into account the humiliations which poor passengers are subjected to, it has also caused a worsening of service. It used to take 11 hours 50 minutes to get to Moscow, but now it takes 15 hours 30 minutes. What gauge to use to measure lost time, and who is to compensate passengers for it? If our state has set up borders, let them be. But let us look at the civilized world. When traveling from one European country to another by train, the passenger gives his passport to the conductor at the start of the trip and gets it back at the end. Nobody unceremoniously breaks into his compartment in the middle of the night armed with a submachine gun, wakes up his kids and shakes out bags to make sure that an enemy would not get through. There, among capitalists, if you buy something and want to transport it out of the country, at the border you can be reimbursed 12 percent of the purchase price for shipping it at your own expense, and they will thank you for it. We, on the other hand, are afraid that something would be exported. The government is trying to compensate for its inability to develop a pricing policy and manage the economy by humiliating passengers. Every once in a while I get an order from a presidential representative demanding to stop a train for three hours to allow for a thorough search of passengers. As a character in a popular film says, I am embarrassed for the state and ashamed for the nation. [Pysanska] What would you propose to do? [Zheleznyak] Are you talking about the sector? It cannot be analyzed apart from the economy. We have submitted to the state a program to prevent a catastrophe that is awaiting us. We have a program, but no money. What am I doing to change the situation? Everything in my power. I raise issues and do not fear to talk about unpleasant or unacceptable things. I am not even afraid to work in a sector which is moving full-speed toward an abyss--because I doubt that anyone could do more. [Pysanska] You and other people who have worked--and worked well--on the railroad all your lives; are you not ashamed to feel helpless? [Zheleznyak] I am ashamed that having destroyed a finely tuned transport system, one that used to function reliably, we not only did not create a better one but created nothing at all.
