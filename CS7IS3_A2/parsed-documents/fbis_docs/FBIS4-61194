Unlike ordinary duty-free zones, this zone will be a border territory, where imports can be brought in and stockpiled without payment of duty. Profit from the deal between buyer and seller will go to the local administration budget and to the Customs Administration account. It is also planned to organize processing facilities within the duty-free zone. It is proposed that the customs zone be located on the site of a loss-making enterprise in Ussuriysk city. The zone will make it possible for Maritime Kray to become a major staging post for foreign capital on Russia's Pacific seaboard.
