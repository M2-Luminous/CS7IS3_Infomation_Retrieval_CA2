The anti-Hungarian and anti-Jewish statements by the new chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) Jan Slota, his talk about the superiority of the state-forming Slovak nation, but primarily the effort to "base the politics on the army" are dangerous signals that the country "has tremendous problems with democracy," Duray, a former dissident and chief leader of ethnic Hungarians, said. Duray accused the two strongest opposition parties -- the Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) -- that they had lost interest in passing a no-confidence vote in Meciar's government since they do not want to assume the burden of the unpopular measures which must be taken in the nearest future. "The reluctance of the SDL and KDH and their maneuvering create space for politicians of Slota's sort," Duray warned. Duray voiced discontent with statements by KDH Deputy Chairman Frantisek Miklosko on the "suicidal claims" on which Hungarian ethnic parties make their parliamentary support of the Slovak opposition conditional. Duray did not specify the claims.
