Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 26 March reports that Guantanamo Province has been one of the most outstanding provinces in harvest emulation during the period between 11 and 20 March. Guantanamo has been cited in 7 of the 14 aspects rated in the harvest emulation, and it also intends to increase sugar production and fulfill its plan. In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports that approximately 13,000 low-cost houses will be built in Sancti Spiritus Province by 1996 using local resources. This will help triple the number of houses built per year in this province, which is experiencing a tremendous shortage of energy, cement, and steel. Approximately 2,000 houses are under construction, most in 40 high-priority zones. Rebelde adds in the same newscast that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has donated 7 tons of medicines worth $2.5 million to Cuba. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 28 March report that Camaguey canecutters are engaged in a campaign to increase production and efficiency. In 80 days they cut 2 million arrobas of cane and are talking about cutting another million, if necessary. In the same newscast, Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision report that as the water shortage continues, farmers are resorting to old techniques to provide water to their cattle. One said he is using a mule to draw water from a deep well for his milk cows because bringing in water tanks costs an arm and a leg. Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 28 March reports that a new system for selling medicines has been implemented with positive results in Holguin Province pharmacies. The pharmacies "have been linked" to polyclinics and assistance centers, and "pharmaceutical products that used to disappear off the shelves in a single day now last up to a month....Doctors at polyclinics and assistance centers now know daily what products are available." In the same newscast, the radio reports that only 326 of the 6,751 pieces of medical equipment at Matanzas Province assistance centers are currently out of service because they are broken. This constitutes a praiseworthy achievement by the workers of the provincial electromedical technical services center. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 March reports that specialists and technicians from the Rayonitro enterprise in Matanzas are satisfactorily carrying out tests to obtain ammonium dicyanate,"a reagent that is of interest in producing meningitis vaccine." Rayonitro engineer Damaso Lopez said there is currently a plant that "facilitates production of carbon bisulphide, which is raw material for processing the reagent in question." Rayonitro can currently make, industrially, some 60 tons per year of carbon bisulphide, considerably reducing the amount Cuba has to import. "Carbon bisulphide is a dense, transparent, very volatile liquid. Its cost on the world market is between $2,000 and 2,500 per ton, while by employing the Matanzas technology, its use is facilitated at a cost of just 500 pesos the ton." Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 28 March reports that the oilworkers of Ciego de Avila Province met 105 percent of their plan for the extraction of crude oil for the first quarter of 1994 by extracting 17,373 tons before the deadline. They also drilled 5,005 meters instead of the 2,520 established in their drilling program. In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports that over the past two years, 60 caballerias of cacao have been planted with hybrid seeds that have a high genetic potential and are resistant to environmental adversity. The seeds were produced by the cacao research station located in Baracoa Municipality, Guantanamo Province, the municipality that produces the greatest number of seeds from plants resistant to pests, disease, and bad weather. Guantanamo Province produces close to 80 percent of the national cacao crop of between 35,000 and 45,000 quintals yearly. Cuba Vision at 2320 GMT on 28 March reports that tobacco enterprises in Pinar del Rio are picking the capa dura leaves which are normally discarded during the harvest. They plan to use these leaves in domestic cigarettes and cigars. Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 29 March reports that up to 26 March, the sugar agroindustry had planted 2,740 caballerias of sugarcane, 80 percent of the amount scheduled for planting by the end of this month. The provinces of Camaguey, Havana, Matanzas, Cienfuegos, and Guantanamo are outstanding in this activity. Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 29 March reports that the (Juan Jose Berdesi) and Jose Maria Perez brigades have cut 2 million arrobas of sugarcane, becoming the first to reach this amount during the current harvest in Santiago de Cuba Province. Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 29 March reports that 1 million quintals of potatoes have been harvested in Havana Province. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 29 March reports that a fish farm in Los Palacios Municipality has successfully bred a Chinese variety known as the (fenca china). In the first tests in 10 ponds, 6 million eggs were obtained, of which 4.2 million hatched. Radio Rebelde also reports that 46 quintals of sunflower seeds have been harvested in Cienfuegos to produce cooking oil.
