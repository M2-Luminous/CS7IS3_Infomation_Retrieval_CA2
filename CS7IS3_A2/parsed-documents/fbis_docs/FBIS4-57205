According to remarks by mission members, they left the country in high spirits because the current situation in Guatemala is quite encouraging. Leonardo Franco, head of the UN delegation, commented on their work in Guatemala: [Franco] "Through meetings held over the past two weeks [as heard], we have reached a very significant consensus within Guatemalan society concerning human rights. ``First, there is consensus on the importance of the General Human Rights Agreement signed on 29 March which, in everyone's opinion, marks a very encouraging phase in the Guatemalan peace process. ``Second, there is also consensus on the international verification mission, which was requested on the one hand by the government and on the other by the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] command in the general agreement and which the broadest sectors of society view as a very positive factor for the observance of human rights in the country. ``Finally, on the issue of consensus, the mission's government and nongovernment interlocutors also unanimously agreed that the verification mission should arrive in the country as soon as possible. We will recommend this to the UN secretary general. ``"Third, this consensus will undoubtedly prompt an adequate response from the international community concerning the Guatemalan people's efforts to achieve human rights and peace.'' Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez commented on the remarks made by the UN preliminary mission members regarding the immediate installation of the Human Rights Verification Commission in Guatemala. [Enriquez] "They have, of course, a general impression of the country, which will serve as the foundation for their recommendations to the UN secretary general concerning verification, which I hope will take place as soon as possible. I believe the Guatemalan community, in general, agrees that the Verification Commission should come to Guatemala as soon as possible." The defense minister also commented on the invitation extended to him by the Permanent Refugee Commissions [CPR] and said he is willing to talk with the URNG commanders. [Enriquez] "They have invited me to visit them and I will certainly go. I would like to tell you that certain reports have been published which, perhaps, are the result of a misinterpretation by the person who wrote them because I, as defense minister, will not go looking for the subversives and the terrorist criminals in Ixcan. No. If they were to invite me to a meeting supervised by the United Nations, I would go because I have nothing to fear. I have spoken with the URNG leadership and I believe that for the sake of peace we should reach an agreement." Enriquez also reiterated a desire for a cease-fire in the area of the Ixcan and Xalbal Rivers, about which the Guatemalan Episcopal Conference has issued a statement. [Enriquez] "The Defense Ministry accepts that statement 100 percent because, I believe, the person who has done the most to promote it has been the president, of course, but through me. I advocate a definitive cease-fire between the Xalbal and Ixcan Rivers and also that the refugees, repatriates, and CPR's allow themselves to receive full aid without influence and looking only to the future, a better future for our new generations and so they themselves can live in peace and tranquility in that area."
