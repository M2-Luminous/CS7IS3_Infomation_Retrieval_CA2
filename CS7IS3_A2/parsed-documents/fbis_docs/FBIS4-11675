It carries a militant voice that we have missed very much, especially these days when we are almost suffocated by the dust of [the Arab-Israeli] talks, whose only objective is to destroy our cause and terminate our existence. This radio conveys to us the daily heroic actions of our kinsfolk in Palestine, always accompanied by songs of revolution and jihad. It is unlike the other Arab radios filling the airwaves. It has been distinctly successful in attracting listeners of other radios inside and outside the occupied territories. Having won keen and regular listeners, the radio dedicated all its resources to reporting on and following Palestinian events anywhere at anytime. When I arrived in Damascus, I immediately began to look for the radio building. Few people were familiar with the place. Therefore, it took me some time before I managed to arrive at the radio building. It was not a big surprise to me when I found nothing but a small, old four-story building, the first story of which is occupied by the radio station. This building is surrounded by shops and other residential buildings. The only thing that distinguishes it from other buildings is an armed guard standing at its gate. I was not surprised because I knew that the radio officials wanted to keep its location secret so that it would not become an easy target for attacks or acts of sabotage. Since its establishment, this radio has continued its role of invigorating our Palestinian people and their struggle against their enemies, both overt and covert, including those who hide their treachery and treason under guises of political wisdom. Al-Quds Radio has managed to worry and annoy Israel, which was prompted jam it despite the high costs, which has amounted to millions of dollars. For this purpose, Israel used jamming devices at the building of the Ramallah radio, something Israel has not done against any other Arab radio. Abu-Shadi [Fadl Shururu], director general of the al-Quds Radio, says: Al-Quds Radio began its experimental transmission in 1987, and officially announced its name on 1 January 1988, when it began to identify itself as: "Al-Quds, the Palestinian Arab Radio on the Road to Liberation of Land and Man." Only 20 days after the beginning of its official transmission, the Zionists began to jam the radio on the recommendation of terrorist Mike Gurdus, [Israeli radio's] specialist in monitoring Arab radios in the Middle East. Not long after the blessed intifadah broke out, Al-Quds Radio began broadcasting to become one of the continuous factors of incitement for our kinsfolk to continue struggle and steadfastness in face of the Zionist enemy. The radio broadcasts statements issued by Palestinian resistance factions, which call for strikes and demonstrations. It also transmits patriotic songs and follows Palestinian developments and broadcasts these developments as soon as the necessary information is available. All this explain the enemy's costly attempt to jam the radio. In one occasion, Al-Quds Radio was forced to make 56 frequency changes to evade the Zionist jamming. The continuation of these jamming attempts by the enemy gave the workers of the radio lots of experience in changing frequencies quickly -- in less than two minutes. It is noteworthy that the radio broadcasts on three waves: the medium, short, and FM waves. The radio's transmission begins at 0900 and lasts until 2000. Hence, the question is raised: If the radio shoulders the responsibility of this important media role to serve our people and their cause, are the limited transmission hours enough to realize this objective? Abu-Shadi says: We wish that we could continue transmitting 24 hours a day because we need to maintain contacts with our people, but this requires huge material capabilities that are not available at present. In fact, some large quarters are prepared to buy our radio on the condition they would turn it into one of their media horns that markets their ideas and policies. The small size of the place is another obstacle to the development and growth of the radio. As I said before, the radio is in one floor of a building in which all radio departments, including the studios, are present. In the editorial room, which is no more than 3 by 4 square meters, nearly eight people sit at a rectangular table to edit news and write reports. You can see the editor of the Russian newscast beside the editor of the Hebrew newscast, and beside them sits the editor of the Arabic newscast. The constraints of the place may cause some problems here or there, but of course does not prevent the continuation of work in constant force and enthusiasm. [passage omitted] The radio also seeks to effect communication with non-Arab communities. For, it airs programs targeting Jewish immigrants in Palestine. The radio airs its programs in seven languages, in addition to Arabic. These languages are the following: Hebrew, Russian, French, Italian, English, Spanish, and Romanian. As a matter of fact, the radio has not thus far received any real feedback from target listeners on these programs. But, the radio director is almost certain that the radio programs are also listened to by Jews in Palestine. The very reasons that prompt the Palestinians of the occupied territories to listen to this radio's programs are bound to prompt Jews to do so, the radio director argues. Having debated with Abu-Shadi the media role being played by Palestinian factions, I wanted to ask him about the clearly stepped-up Islamic sentiments enshrined in the programs aired by this radio, particularly since the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], which is managing this radio station, has not been known as a front that promotes Islamic sensibilities. When I asked him this question, he was disturbed. He retorted, saying: The fact that the radio was launched by the PFLP-GC does not mean that it belongs to the PFLP-GC. Al-Quds Radio is the radio of the Palestinian masses inside and outside the occupied territories. It is the radio of those denied the chance to make their voices heard. It is not affiliated with any Palestinian resistance faction. At any rate, I hope that we will someday become Muslims in deed, and not only in word, Abu-Shadi added. Fast reporting is an equally important factor that has contributed to the radio's wide popularity. The radio is quick to report on news stories. By the way, the radio has listeners in various parts of the Arab homeland, as well as Europe. Abu-Shadi adds: Fast reporting, and accuracy in broadcasting developments in the occupied territories have enhanced the radio's reputation, and allowed it to increase the number of its listeners. These factors have also given rise to myths about the radio. When the radio first began transmission, there were numerous guesses as to where it was transmitting from. The radio was reported to have been transmitting from a secret place in Jerusalem. In an opinion poll conducted in London last year, Al-Quds Radio came ahead of both the BBC Arabic Service and Monte Carlo Radio in terms of preference by listeners. To obtain its news stories, the radio depends on a network of correspondents inside the occupied territories. Abu-Shadi believes that it is enough for a Palestinian to be a true patriot enjoying a high sense of responsibility toward his cause and people to qualify as a correspondent for the Al-Quds Radio. Zionist troops once apprehended several correspondents of the radio in Gaza, Rafah, and Nabulus. But, these correspondents had already trained others to do their job and accomplish news assignments. Correspondents use fax machines to send their news reports to the radio in Damascus. The radio also has subscriptions with several international news agencies; and this enables the radio to cover Arab and international developments. Nonetheless, the radio airs news agency-datelined Palestinian news stories only after it receives a confirmation of these stories from its correspondents in the occupied territories. [passage omitted] [Fu'ad] Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, and even before that, the Al-Quds Radio has been opposed to the peace process. What will happen to your radio if Syria concludes a peace treaty with Israel? [Shururu] We at Al-Quds Radio still believe that what is being done is capitulation, rather than peace. We mean what we say. How can we expect the achievement of peace at a time when our people are still displaced, and when their objectives are yet to be achieved? If the Israelis give the Arabs back the Golan and southern Lebanon, and deny me the right to regain my land and national soil, there will be no peace. As long as there is a good reason for Palestinian children to continue to carry stones, there is no room for any talk of peace. If and when the Syrian leadership signs a peace agreement with Israel, providing for a recognition of Israel, something which I cannot believe even if I were to see it with my own eyes, then we can discuss this development. In this regard, I would like to emphasize that Al-Quds Radio is not the only weapon in the hands of our people. It is an instigator. Our people's struggle will not come to a halt with any cessation in the radio's transmission. [Fu'ad] Then, is it possible that Al-Quds Radio will halt its transmission? [Shururu, smiling] If this were to be forced on us, there is nothing we can do to ward off such a development. [Fu'ad] This is Al-Quds Radio, the Palestinian Arab radio along the path of liberating land and man. It has continued to exemplify a mature media perspective. We hope that many of our Arab radio stations will emulate Al-Quds Radio. We acknowledge that the example this radio has provided is not flawless, for there is always room for improvement in the radio's performance. We salute Al-Quds Radio and its employees.
