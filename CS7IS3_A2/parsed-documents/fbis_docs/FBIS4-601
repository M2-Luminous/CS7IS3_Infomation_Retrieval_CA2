Doonan] [Text] Durban April 12 SAPA -- There are divergent views on whether free and fair elections can be held under the state of emergency in Natal/kwaZulu. On Tuesday [12 April], Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke told students at the University of Natal, Durban "it is still possible to have free and fair elections under the state of emergency which is directed at curbing violence". But, in a recent memorandum to the Transitional Executive Council [TEC], a host of community organisations called for a review of the emergency, claiming it had failed to control violence or bring stability to the region. After convening last week at a summit organised by the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for SA, the organisations said: "Far from stabilising the volatile situation in our province, feedback from communities indicates the state of emergency has served to heighten resistance to the election and political polarisation." They asked the TEC to review the purpose of the emergency to ensure it was not geared to creating conditions in which the people of kwaZulu/Natal could go to voting stations, but could not go to their homes. "There is no way this forthcoming election can be free, fair, safe or in any way a celebration of the advent of democracy, if people can only go to the polls under armed guard." The memo added that the SA Defence Force's role had to be defined more clearly. In his address on Tuesday, Mr Moseneke said he had just returned from a security meeting where he had been told the number of deaths in Natal in the past 48 hours had decreased in comparison to the previous two-day period. The lower the levels of violence, the easier it would be for people to choose to vote, he said, adding that a national security plan was in place to ensure voters could go to the polls safely in just over two weeks. Although there would be "difficulties" in Natal, "we should be able to secure each (polling) station". "The IEC will run elections in Natal as near perfect as it could be in any other part of the country," he said. Mr Moseneke said South Africans should not allow fear to stand in their way of voting, adding that people convinced they should vote could encourage others to do so.
