I believe it must be preserved and indeed enhanced in the future. To foster an open Hong Kong, the future regulations on permanent residency should be moderate and inclusive rather than harsh and exclusive. The Basic Law was written in this spirit. As an illustration, it states quite clearly that anyone living in Hong Kong who has no right of abode elsewhere can become a permanent resident of the Special Administrative Region (SAR). In theory, if any Hong Kong resident -- regardless of race or former nationality -- wants to become a permanent resident, all he has to do is give up his right of abode elsewhere before 1997. He will not even need to pledge allegiance or go through a ceremony or any such rigmarole, which is customary in most, if not all, countries. As a member of the panel on security and welfare of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), I am working on various recommendations regarding the granting of permanent residency to returning former residents with new foreign passports, foreign nationals who are currently living and working in Hong Kong and future newcomers. Some of the tentative thinking of the panel is outlined below and more consultation is required before these recommendations are formalised and submitted to the 1996 Preparatory Committee. For returning former Hong Kong residents with foreign passports, their residency in the territory before acquiring their new passports can be used to fulfil the seven-year residency requirement in the Basic Law. Foreign residents having completed the seven-year residency requirement need only fill in a form (no supporting material required) and meet some objective conditions to support their claim that they intend to stay in Hong Kong. These conditions relate to ownership of property, job or business investments, the presence of family in Hong Kong and time spent in the territory. No proof that these conditions have been met is required. This welcoming attitude is in stark contrast to the British 1981 Nationality Act, which stripped Hong Kong people of the right of abode in the United Kingdom. The British Government is advising China that it is in China's interest to keep Hong Kong open to all. Although China is likely to go down this line, I would certainly question the sincerity of the British advice. There has been some grumbling that China's nationality criteria are racially based or biased. This is an emotive oversimplification. While China confers citizenship on its people -- who may be Han, Xi Yuan, Korean, Manchu, Tibetan Mongolian or other ethnic stock -- it is not acting in any way out of the ordinary. For example, the German constitution accords instant residency and citizenship to anyone of German descent, whether or not that individual speaks the language and even if his family has been living abroad for generations. A Turk born in Germany is not so privileged. The United Kingdom has granted citizenship to white South Africans with tenuous blood links to Britain, but its attitude towards the Hong Kong Chinese, however, is quite different. Japan also welcomes home its prodigals, including those of its nationals born or left behind in China after World War 11, but it is rather meaner towards ethnic Koreans, some of whom have been harshly treated for generations. I believe that Hong Kong should be open and truly international. Only then can we attract experts and investors -- be they American, Japanese, Singaporean, German, French or British -- to live, work and compete, and who will complement the ethnic Chinese on terms of equality not quite possible while Hong Kong is a colony of the United Kingdom. I am sure the British would welcome the new competition in the spirit of"openness" and "fairness". Whatever wrongs have been inflicted on China by foreign powers, and even though Hong Kong is a reminder of its past humiliations, China has nevertheless accepted the special circumstances of this diverse city and the qualities that make it unique. The PWC is entrusted with giving thorough advice to the Chinese Government to preserve the extraordinary qualities of Hong Kong. I personally invite people, whatever their nationality and race, to take heart and to take part in the SAR. That the Basic Law allows for 20 per cent of the future legislature to be open to foreign nationals is remarkably generous. I cannot think of a legislature anywhere -- not the British House of Commons and not the American Senate -- quite like it. Experts predict that Hong Kong will be the financial mecca of the next century, surpassing Tokyo. If that comes to pass, some of the credit should go to the policy, which the PWC advocates, of opening Hong Kong to even more international trade, commerce and investment, partly through the welcoming of other nationals to reside here.
