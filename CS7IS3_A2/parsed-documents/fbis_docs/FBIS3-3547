To this end, Lin noted, we should bear in mind that successfully conducting the CPPCC work under the socialist market economy is an objective demand of the development of socialist democracy, a glorious mission for the CPPCC organizations in the new period, and a realistic demand of CPPCC work that is being enriched and expanded, 2. It is necessary to emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and make CPPCC work commensurate with the socialist market economy, 3. It is necessary to improve CPPCC work, heighten the standard of CPPCC work, and make CPPCC work more conducive to the socialist market economy, 4. It is necessary to conscientiously study all the relevant materials, improve work skills, and create favorable conditions for CPPCC work under the socialist market economy. Chairman Lin Yinghai stated: The CPPCC work under the socialist market economy is a completely new topic. We should constantly carry out experiments, make painstaking efforts, and be fully enthusiastic and ready to work in a down-to-earth manner. As long as we work hard, seek truth from facts, remain pragmatic, strive to make Henan prosperous, and unceasingly press ahead with the work, we will certainly be able to push Henan's CPPCC work onto a new stage under the socialist market economy.
