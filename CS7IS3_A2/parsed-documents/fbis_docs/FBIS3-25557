The demonstration took place while opponents to President Gnassingbe Eyadema yesterday claimed an overall victory in the elections and affirmed that they had won the absolute majority of seats in the National Assembly. The Interior Ministry later denounced irregularities in five of the 81 constituencies concerned -- including Lome -- by implicitly suggesting the cancellation of the vote in those constituencies where the opposition won all the seats, according to unofficial sources. The demonstrators were not wearing any distinctive signs to show their political affiliation. After crossing Adewui district, in the north of the administrative and commercial center of the city, they commandeered five vehicles and began roaming the streets chanting: "We Demand Justice. There Is Too Much Fraud. Cancel The Elections Right Now. If They Are Not Canceled, We Will Break Everything." About 20 policemen and gendarmes arrived on the scene shortly after 1100, an hour after the demonstration started. They negotiated with the young people, seized the vehicle keys, and rounded them up without any brutality near the market. At 1130, a man, who seemed to be leading the demonstration, tried in vain to calm down his comrades who continued to chant their slogans. He was dressed in a blue overall and the blade of a hatchet was sticking out of his pocket. Questioned by AFP, a police commissioner present at the scene said the young people should not be arrested because "it could to a degeneration in the situation. We should try to reason with them," he said. By midday, the young people were still demonstrating and the Adewui district inhabitants slowly came out of their homes to join in the demonstration. In neighboring districts, streets were empty and shops were closed. Two jeeps with a dozen French and Burkinabe observers on board kept their distance from the demonstration.
