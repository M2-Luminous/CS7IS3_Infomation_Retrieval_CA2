FR940712-0-00026 FR940712-0-00010 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 940687&hyph;4187; I.D. 062194A] RIN 0648&hyph;AG72 Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Emergency interim rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS has determined that an emergency exists in the groundfish fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). An unusually large number of salmon other than chinook (``other'' salmon) were caught incidentally by trawl catcher vessels operating in the catcher vessel operational area (CVOA) during the 1993 pollock non-roe season. In 1993, the number of ``other'' salmon caught incidentally in the BSAI groundfish fisheries was 245,000 fish_approximately six times the bycatch level estimated for each of the previous 2 years and triple the previous highest bycatch amount. Approximately 95 percent of this catch is chum salmon. If not controlled, a large number of chum salmon could be incidentally caught again during the 1994 pollock non-roe season, potentially causing serious conservation and management problems. NMFS is implementing by emergency rule, certain management measures necessary to address this problem. These measures are intended to accomplish the goals and objectives of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) with respect to fisheries management in the BSAI. DATES: Effective August 15, 1994 through November 12, 1994. Comments must be received by July 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802, Attention: Lori Gravel. Copies of the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared for the emergency rule may be obtained from the same address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kaja Brix, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228.
