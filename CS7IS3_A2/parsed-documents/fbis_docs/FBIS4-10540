Jose Raul Mulino sent a four-page letter noting that the U.S. statements are general and subjective. He added that the Panamanian Government has taken many actions to fight those crimes. In the document, Mulino says that Panama is not an economic power and on many occasions it has had to establish it priorities. Regarding the struggle against drug trafficking, our cooperation has been expeditious and in good faith. Mulino asked for a meeting at the highest level, with the participation of the financial sector, to discuss this problem. The letter clearly states that the national government has not eluded its responsibility.
