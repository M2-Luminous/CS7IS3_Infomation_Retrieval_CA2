Replying in question time he said it was not the government's intention to send combat troops or support personnel to the Central African nation. It was however committed to supporting all mediation and other efforts by the international community to ensure a peaceful and lasting solution there. It would donate emergency supplies specified by the United Nations, was negotiating with the UN on the possible lease of troop carriers for use by UN personnel, and was considering airlifting material collected in South Africa by the Rhema church. Asked by Senator E K Moorcroft (DP) [Democratic Party] whether he would be prepared to reconsider the issue if the genocide continued in Rwanda, Mr Modise said South Africa should concentrate on its own problems at home. "We think the Rwandan situation is taken care of by forces coming from the United Nations and at present there are French forces there....We have to address the problems at home first."
