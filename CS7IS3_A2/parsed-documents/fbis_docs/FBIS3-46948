Workers of the Hungnam fertilizer complex, the Chenam coal mine of the Pukchang District coal mining complex, the Sinuiju shoemaking factory and the Tongdaewon garment factory in Pyongyang express their determination to thoroughly implement the tasks set forth by the great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address and challenged the factories and enterprises of the same trades across the country to a socialist emulation. This challenge has evoked response nationwide. The workers of the Hungnam fertilizer complex vowed to increase the production of nitrogenous fertilizer 1.4 times and phosphate fertilizer 2.5 times compared with last year and are maintaining the full-capacity operation of modern equipment including the high-pressure compounding tanks and the compressors, keeping production on a high level. The employees of the Chenam coal mine resolved to produce 1.5 times as much coal as last year by actively introducing effective cutting methods, while giving priority to tunnelling and pit concreting. The workers of factories and enterprises all over the country including the Sinuiju shoemaking factory upheld the slogan "Let Us Accelerate Vigorously the General March of Socialism in the Revolutionary Spirit of Self-Reliance and Fortitude" and those of the Tongdaewon garment factory are resolved to fulfil ahead of schedule the export plan for this year which is 24 percent above last year.
