Zyuganov, a State Duma member, held many meetings with workers in Sytykvar, Vorkuta, and Ukhta. Everywhere he went, he said, he was met with warmth and attention. Zyuganov said that he had noticed "a shift to the left" in the Komi republic and Russia as a whole, which is attributable to the harsh realities of life today. He said he had expected a cold reception by the miners in Vorkuta, who have been famous for their support for Boris Yeltsin. However, his apprehensions proved to be unfounded, and he was also met "kindly" there. Answering an ITAR-TASS question, the communist leader said he felt that his party had good potential for growth in the polar town, which has so far given rise to only 100 members of the Communist Party. There are about 1100 official communists in the whole republic of Komi. Zyuganov considered the most important reason for the shift in the attitude of the Vorkuta workers to be their current living conditions, which he said determine one's consciousness. "The miners understood that they had been deceived and deceived badly. In every respect, miners today are in a worse position than they were earlier. Zyuganov mentioned noticing a shift to the left in the attitude of Vorkuta residents as well. At all his meetings, Zyuganov appealed for a wide coalition of "state-patriotic forces" and for accord in the name of Russia. After the union of all the patriotic forces, the opposition "can and should change the power and the state system in the country in a constitutional way", he said. Possibilities for such action are appearing, since society in general is being "enlightened, although, unfortunately, slower than the country is being destroyed", the communist leader declared.
