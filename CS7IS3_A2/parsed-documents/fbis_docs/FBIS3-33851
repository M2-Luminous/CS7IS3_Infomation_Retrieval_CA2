This moment is an historic and a very important occasion in our country's history. Our people do not forget those highly exciting days, when the nation was impatiently awaiting the return of the imam [Khomeyni] after years of exile and separation from the homeland. The enemies of our nation and agents of arrogance inside the country, who enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle, were concerned that with the imam's return their days of plundering and corruption would end. This moment coincides precsiely with the moment when the imam landed at the airport. The government of the day had concentrated all its efforts on preventing the imam's arrival. On the other hand all the combative forces inside the country had concentrated all their efforts on realizing their old aspiration. The moment was highly exciting when the people found out that the imam's plane had come through various dangers to land safely at Mehrabad Airport. I think our artists and those talented in poetry and culture should draw suitable pictures to mark the occasion. The arrival of the new year is usually an exciting moment for our nation. Certainly the effects of this moment in our history are greater than those moments before the new year, so we have created certain ceremonies. Let us look at the time before that moment and the period after it. If we look at the era before [Khomeyni's arrival], we see the rule of satan, the country's dependency, the presence of foreign advisers in Iran, abjectness, captivity, corruption, unrestrained behavior, the rule of aristocracy, and so on. Whereas on this side, we see the rule of God, rule by the people, the people's presence in the arena, independence, freedom, Islam, the Koran, improvement, piety and, in a word, the path of God. It seems that our new generation should be made more familiar with the facts relating to both chapters of the country's history -- much more than what we have explained to them so far. These two chapters are: the era before the Imam's arrival and the chapter after that moment. Our nation remembers that from the moment the imam stepped out of the plane, everything changed shape. Hopes gained much greater strength. The fear of the revolution's opponents intensified immensely, and the wheels of history rotated at a faster rate. The pages of history were turning so fast that no on could read the lines of history or even glance at them. After only a few days the foundations of monarchist tyranny collapsed and the foundations of the Islamic government, the popular government, were laid down. May this occasion be a blessed occasion to our nation and may these historic moments remain honored in our history for ever.
