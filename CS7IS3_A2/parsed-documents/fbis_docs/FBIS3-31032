Berisha also stressed that Albania reconfirms its offer of airport facilities that NATO may need to accomplish its missions within the UN framework. He also considered the U.S. Administration's decision to recognize the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as important for stability in the region and stressed that the resolution of the contradictions between our two neighbors, Greece and Macedonia, regarding the name and symbols, is in the interests not only of the bilateral relations of these countries but also of stability in the south of the Balkans.
