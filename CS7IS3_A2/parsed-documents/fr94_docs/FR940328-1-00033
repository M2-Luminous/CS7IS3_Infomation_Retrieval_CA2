FR940328-1-00033 FR940328-1-00015 48 CFR Parts 42 and 52 [FAR Case 91&hyph;103] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Final Indirect Cost Agreements AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to revise the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the clause, Allowable Cost and Payment_Facilities, to eliminate the requirements for contractors to execute a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data in conjunction with final indirect cost agreements on facilities contracts, and for auditors to obtain a certificate under auditor determination procedures for final indirect cost rates. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866 dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before May 27, 1994 to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;103 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeremy Olson at (202) 501&hyph;3221 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 91&hyph;103. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Negotiation of final indirect cost agreements do not represent contract modifications or changes, but rather the implementation of pre-existing contract terms. Accordingly, certification is not required by the provisions of the Truth in Negotiations Act, as amended (10 U.S.C. 2306a and 41 U.S.C. 254(d)). B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the requirements for certified cost or pricing data do not apply. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 91&hyph;103), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. Existing approvals of information collection requirements under OMB control numbers 9000&hyph;0013 and 9000&hyph;0069 correspond to this rule; however, this proposed rule has an insignificant impact on the requirements.
