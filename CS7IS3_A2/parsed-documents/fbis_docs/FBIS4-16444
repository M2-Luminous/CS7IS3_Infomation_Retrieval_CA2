The most active sections of the Officers' Union, the National Salvation Front, and of other small patriotic groupings were the initiators for creating the party. [Terekhov] We are beginning to work differently from the image of being extremists both in the streets and at meetings by which the people had known us. We are going to defend our stance in a serious way not by shouting in the streets but by our deeds. [Sladkov] According to Stanislav Terekhov, from now on the patriots will start nominating their candidates to all levels of state power as the continuation of the struggle to bring to power the people to whom the interests of the country are above everything else. Incidently, every leader always talks about his love for his motherland and if that leader is the supreme leader of the country he should be a professional.
