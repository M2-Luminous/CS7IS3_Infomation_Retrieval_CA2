The security regulations there prevent us from showing them to you, but I can tell you that there has been an emergency there. Paramilitary protection service personnel here have discovered a theft of nuclear fuel as used by nuclear submarines. Three uranium control rods have been stolen. A crime file has been opened. The theft is being investigated by a special interdepartmental group which includes representatives of the Fleet Military Prosecutor's Office, military counterintelligence organs, and the Internal Affairs Directorate. The theft, the specialists believe, was committed by people familiar with this kind of nuclear fuel. That is, the thieves knew in advance that the fuel rods represent a health hazard. [A. Zolotkov, engineer of the Murmansk Maritime Shipping Company radiation safety service, identified by caption] Nothing like this has ever happened in Murmansk before. However, I am convinced that but for our mismanagement and negligence this theft would not have taken place. All it needs is to commission the branch railroad built long ago for the Northern Fleet military base in Zapadnaya Litsa and the equivalent civilian nuclear fleet enterprise for this fuel transit center to be dispensed with.
