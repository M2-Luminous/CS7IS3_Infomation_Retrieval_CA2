FBIS4-24889 "drchi107_k_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social `Church Activists' Detained; CNN Banned Until 6 Jun `Church Activists' Detained; CNN Banned Until 6 Jun HK0306051194 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 3 Jun 94 pp 1, 9 HK0306051194 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] [Text] Chinese police have detained six underground church activists in the run-up to tomorrow's fifth anniversary of the June 4 crackdown. They have also ordered hotels in Beijing to turn off the international television network CNN at least until next Monday. Sources in the dissident community said yesterday that while they did not anticipate large-scale actions, protests by individual dissidents and workers could erupt this week. Beijing resident Hua Huiqi said yesterday he and five other Christians had been taken into custody while they were worshipping together. Mr Hua said he was held from Monday to Wednesday. He said police returned to his flat yesterday to detain him again, but he was not home. "This is a problem of belief, we haven't broken the law," he said in a telephone interview. Mr Hua said Wang Huamin, Gao Feng, Wu Rengang, Xu Honghai and Gou Qinghui were detained last weekend. All but Gao, thought to be a 26-year-old car worker, are known to have been released, he said. Mrs Gou is the wife of Xiao Biguang, a former Beijing University teacher and active Christian who was taken into custody on April 12. Mrs Gou was detained last Friday and interrogated for eight hours before being released after she started suffering heart problems, Mr Hua said. Mr Xiao, 32, is a friend of Yuan Hongbing, a Beijing University law professor who was arrested in March. Yuan was a founder of the outlawed Federation for the Protection of Workers' Rights. Police are believed to be hunting other affiliates of the federation, which organised a petition to the legislature calling for the freedom to form independent unions. Sources in the dissident community said the authorities were concerned about the "political activism" of one branch of the underground church, which they suspected of having links with the nascent labour union movement. It is understood that another group of Beijing-based church activists tried to start a demonstration earlier this year. "The rally was aimed at demanding not only religious freedom but general political and civil rights," a source said. "It was stopped by police in time, and the organisers have been put under surveillance since then." The dissident sources said that while police had banished Wang Dan and other big-name dissidents from the capital, individuals, including disgruntled workers, could stage protests in Beijing and other cities in the run-up to the anniversary. Security sources said that today and tomorrow parts of Tiananmen Square would be cordoned off from the public. They said police were on guard against individuals or small groups staging protest actions, such as distributing pro-democracy leaflets and other literature calling for a reversal of the official verdict on the 1989 student movement. Meanwhile hoteliers said major hotels in Beijing yesterday received a fax from the local Public Security Bureau asking them to switch off CNN, which is received by satellite. "We were told by relevant authorities the cut-off is due to repairs to a hitch in the signal -- the service will be interrupted for up to a week," one hotel technician said. CNN's suspension took effect just before the U.S.-based network aired a report on the growing potential for labour unrest in China. Analysts said the ban on CNN was probably to keep file shots of the 1989 crackdown from being beamed into China during the anniversary period.
