FR941019-2-00148 FR941019-2-00081 August 10, 1994. Ms. Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section, Room 9903, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001 Dear Ms. Kursh: These comments are given to the proposed Final Judgment set out in the Notice of the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, dated June 14, 1994, respecting United States v. Pikington plc and Pilkington Holdings, Inc., United States District Court for the District of Arizona, Civil Action No. 94&hyph;345, filed May 25, 1994 (the ``Civil Action''). Definitions Capitalized terms used in these comments without definition will have the meanings accorded to them by the proposed Final Judgment. The ``Competitive Impact Statement'' is the Competitive Impact Statement filed in the Civil Action pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (15 U.S.C. 15(b)). Introduction In Article I.A. of the Competitive Impact Statement, the Department of Justice (``DOJ'') summarizes the seven (7) categories of activity allegedly engaged in by the Defendants in violation of the antitrust laws and the three (3) categories of relief sought by the Complaint to eliminate such activities. At Article III of the Competitive Impact Statement, DOJ summarizes how the competition favorable elements of the Final Judgment will, in effect, stop the seven (7) categories of activity and thereby ``*␣*␣* eliminate any residual anticompetitive effects of the restrictive license agreements and other conduct challenged by the Complaint.'' The competition favorable elements are: Element Number 1: *␣*␣* [T]he Final Judgment would eliminate all territorial and use limitations [Defendants] imposed on [their] U.S. licensees and allow them to manufacture on their own or sublicense any third party to do so anywhere in the world *␣*␣*.'' Element Number 2: The Final Judgment will create ``*␣*␣* a similar `safe harbor' for any other American individual or firm who is not a Pilkington float glass licensee to use any float technology in its position without liability to [Defendants]. (Emphasis supplied). Element Number 3: The Final ``*␣*␣* Judgment would enjoin certain conduct having the purpose or effect of restricting exports of float glass to the United States *␣*␣*.'' Element Number 4: The Final ``*␣*␣* Judgment would enjoin the [D]efendants from making certain adverse representations *␣*␣* and would require [certain disclosures]. DOJ has wrongly concluded that the issuance of an order embodying these four (4) elements will achieve the goal of ``*␣*␣* eliminat[ing] any residual anticompetitive effects of the restrictive license agreements and other conduct challenged by the Complaint *␣*␣*.'' because its selection of the elements rests upon flawed premises, including at least the following: 1. The Pilkington License Agreements have terminated and no valuable rights other than ``know-how'' rights may be obtained under them by assignees or sublicensees. 2. The ``safe harbor'' as to Pilkington know-how created for U.S. Non-Licensees offers sufficient protection for prospective assignees and/or sublicensees of U.S. Licensees and their lenders to cause them to risk tens of millions of dollars in the construction of float glass plants. 3. The Defendants will take no retributive action after the ten (10) year term of the Final Judgment. 4. The Pilkington float technology that is in the public domain (expired Patents and proprietary know-how), if known to prospective competitors, is sufficient to enable prospective competitors to construct and/or operate competitive float plants. See Article II.A.2. of the Competitive Impact Statement which states ``*␣*␣* Pilkington has no intellectual property rights of substantial value *␣*␣*.''
