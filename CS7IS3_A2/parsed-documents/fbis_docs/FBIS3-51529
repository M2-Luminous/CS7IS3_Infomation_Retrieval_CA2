"Poverty has diminished by truly unheard-of proportions," President Menem told reporters at Jorge Newberry Metropolitan Airport shortly before departing for Mar del Plata. "Thus the possibility of any kind of social unrest can be dismissed." Turning to what critics have pegged as one cause of the riots in Santiago del Estero last month, when unpaid workers torched the provincial Government House, Menem denied that his administration's economic policies and cost cutting would lead to further rebellions. There is no austerity programme here," said Menem, "what there is is a process of change and transformation that has made possible this stability and this growth." The head of state also defended his convening of a sub-Cabinet one week ago Wednesday to address the need to monitor and prevent potential revolts. The public is asking for security," he said. "You yourselves are constantly saying through the media that it is necessary to implement measures that insure security, the defence of life, property and the freedom of the individual." Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf seconded Menem's attempt to end speculation over new measures the government may take to avert potential violence. The government is not "proposing a witch hunt, nor do we want to instill any policy of fear in the public," Ruckauf told Radio del Plata. Instead, he explained, the administration is seeking to boost co- ordination among federal and provincial police and the Border Guards. Ruckauf defended the government's plan to provide new equipment to police officers and criticized those who call for better protection but complain about the cost. The minister sought to downplay the likelihood that an occurrence similar to the New Year's Day uprising by the Zapatista National Liberation Army in Chiapas, Mexico could happen in Argentina. "In no way do we compare Chiapas with the episode in Santiago," said Ruckauf. "We never said in any words that pockets of guerrilla activity exist here." Regarding the situation in Santiago Ruckauf pointed out that local officials have been charged with corruption and the national government "is hoping too to find those responsible for the collective damage perpetrated upon residents" there. In addition, the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff denied that Army head Lieutenant General Martin Balza had requested a study of the legal framework under which the military may participate in subduing domestic disputes. "The Army does not condition its intervention but rather it is limited to the strict orders and directions that proceed from the constitutional authority to which it is subordinate," said Joint Chiefs-of-Staff spokesman Colonel Eduardo Alfonso in a press release. Earlier yesterday Foreign Minister Guido di Tella said told the daily EL CRONISTA that a Chiapas-style revolt was improbable in Argentina because this country lacks a network of guerrillas or drug traffickers. While Di Tella conceded that "it would be foolish to say we are certain that no senderista defeated in Peru is hiding in Argentina" he added that the government does not foresee any threat to stability. The foreign minister further rejected the possibility that the government's economic policies could prompt rebellion, claiming that in fact "poverty has diminished in Argentina thanks to the cutbacks."
