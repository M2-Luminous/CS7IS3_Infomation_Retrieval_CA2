Secretary of State Warren Christopher of the United States, which brokered the talks, said the agreement "shows that peace is possible." The agreement was signed at the U.S. State Department by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Croatian Republic's Foreign Minister Mate Granic and Bosnian Croat Leader Kresimir Zubak. Under the agreement, the federation would be made up of cantons where the majority of residents are either Muslim or Croat and both groups would have equal rights. The federation, which according to the U.S. initiative would eventually combine with a Serb republic, would have a central government taking care of foreign affairs, commerce and overall defense. And the cantons would be responsible for local police, education, culture, housing, public facilities and radio and television. The federation's legislature would include two chambers, and lawmakers would elect the president and vice president. The Croats and Muslims would alternate yearly in holding the two positions.
