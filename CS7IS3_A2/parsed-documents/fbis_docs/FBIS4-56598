I have dedicated my life to my fatherland. I have worked very hard in very important positions in the government and private sector to achieve the maximum development of Panama, with the purpose of improving as much as possible the living standards of all Panamanians. The current campaign has been very difficult. On the one hand, I had to act as a retaining wall against the aspirations of those who served militarism, and, on the other hand, against those who know that we will not permit corruption in our government. The struggle has been hard and many times I have been misunderstood. I know my image on television has not been the best. I have been what advertisers call a hard-to-sell product. [laughter, applause] Nevertheless, after touring the entire country, and with the experience of many years of dedication, I know that with your resolve and faith we can build a better Panama. Today I want to speak to Panamanian youths. I dedicated over 30 years of my life to university teaching. I know -- I was also young -- that in the classrooms I saw the illusions reflected in my students' faces, their thirst for knowledge, their hope in the future, their desire to excel, and their desire to work. Today I want to say that, as president, I will work fervently for their hopes, for their future. [applause] Panama must strive to have its children and youths not only educated but that the education imparted be top quality. Education must contribute to the overall development of individuals. A country's most important resource is its own people. As a teacher, and as an offspring of teachers, I also want to address the teachers. Education must be placed in the very best hands. Legal instruments must be adopted to guarantee the education sector the income, the job stability, and training of all those who have the dedication and aptitude to teach. Education is not a job, nor is it a profession. It simply is an apostolate. [applause] Just as one cannot learn with hunger, one cannot teach well if one is hungry. Now I want to address the Panamanian women -- that woman who is mother and father at home and the family's only means of support. I want to speak to the housewife, to the professional woman. I, Ruben Carles, profess infinite faith in the Panamanian woman. My love for my mother and my wife, and the distinction I have afforded women in the companies that I have administered and in the public posts I have held are my best credentials. Our government will see to it that women occupy the posts they deserve in our society. [applause] Today I also want to address the men in the countryside, many of who are here -- the farmers and cattlemen. The agricultural and livestock production in the country must not only be protected, it must be augmented and stimulated. As president, I tell the agriculture-livestock producer and agriculture-industrial producers that they will find in our government the most determined cooperation and protection, both for the domestic market as well as to promote and increase exports. [applause] I also want to speak to the doctors, dentists, and all of those professionals in the field of health. We need a healthy population. A sick population is a living accusation against the state and government. A country, in order to prosper, needs to have a healthy population, both physically and spiritually. That goal will be a priority concern in our government. [applause] Additionally, I have excellent running mates, individually and collectively better than those on any other slate. We have, and they are here, a team that understands all the peculiarities of the Panamanian situation, a team made up of workers, peasants, teachers, lawyers, engineers, architects, bankers, executives, businessmen, and clerks. I don't hide anybody in the closet. [applause] I ask all the Panamanian people to have faith in the future. The government that will result from the victory of 'Change 94 will be made up of men and women of this country, with the knowledge, capacity, honesty, experience, character, and vigor required from them by the current Panamanian situation. [applause] This team, which basically consists of yourselves, will be enriched by youngsters who are willing to participate and make contributions to the building of the country. [applause] The new government must immediately work to meet the most urgent needs of the population. It must promote the generation of new jobs, which will reduce the unemployment affecting so many families. To do this, we have concrete and realistic projects, with viable financing. Our programs do not include fantasies, poetry, novels, or songs. [applause] Our government must create conditions to improve real income, permitting Panamanians to achieve a better standard of living. To that end, we must create the atmosphere of confidence that invites and attracts private investments, be it domestic or foreign. Panama needs in the near future a government that is capable and honest, not one just honest in words but honest as certified by a clean public and private life. [applause] It must be a government determined to make decisions, with the wisdom to ensure those decisions are wise, with the experience to ensure they are practical, with the moral integrity to ensure they are honest, with the character to ensure they are implemented, with the vigor to implement them without delay, and with discipline to ensure they are executed well. [applause] And we are going to win. [applause] My conviction is supported by the fact the Panamanian people in these elections will not only elect the government that will govern their destiny over the next five years, but they will decide their future for the 21st century. We must enter the world of development, otherwise, it will take us many decades to achieve it and it will be the poverty-stricken people who will suffer the consequences of that failure. Panama can achieve that development because our country has diverse natural resources and institutional opportunities. We only need to develop and take advantage of them to turn them into facts that the country's entire population can fully enjoy. We must also provide public services efficiently. The existence of adequate electricity, telephone, water, garbage collection, and security services are indispensable for new investments. Deficient and costly public services hamper the overall development and well-being of Panamanians. We must effectively defeat crime and eradicate violence in our streets. We must protect the life and well-being of individuals and their properties. We must have zero tolerance for drug trafficking, distribution, and consumption. We must eliminate the impunity that prevails regarding these offenses. We must prevent and persecute money laundering. The country demands security at all levels, everywhere, and in all activities. All of this will be accomplished if we have as our objective the benefit and well-being of the people of Panama. Also necessary are other transportation and port facilities that must be efficient and competitive. After the country elects our government on 8 May, we will immediately take measures to receive the Panama Canal efficiently. We will, however, steer the inter-oceanic region toward the creation of an international maritime center, and this must be accomplished prior to 31 December 1999. Thus, the country will truly receive the economic benefits from its extraordinary geographic position. The Panamanian state was created to serve its population and not to serve itself. The authorities should only be an instrument through which the state fulfills its lofty goals and duties. Our government will fulfill this mission. This is why victory will be ours if the Panamanian people have faith in God and the future. [applause] Our government, which will also be the government of all of you, will be, as Lincoln defined it, a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Thank you very much. [applause]
