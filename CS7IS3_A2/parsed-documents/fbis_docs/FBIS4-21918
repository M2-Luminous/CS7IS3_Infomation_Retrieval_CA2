FBIS4-21918 "jptot015__l94083" JPRS-TOT-94-015-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 7 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA ISRAEL Hamas Carbomb in 'Afula Kills Eight, Wounds 50 Hamas Carbomb in 'Afula Kills Eight, Wounds 50 Carbomb of `Hizballah' Type TA0704084594 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 7 Apr 94 p A1 TA0704084594 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] [Text] Security sources said yesterday that the booby-trapped car that blew up in 'Afula was assembled by experts. They believe the terrorist who was killed in the blast did not assemble the car bomb but was merely a suicide driver. The sources added that this type of booby-trapped car is used by Hizballah. Therefore, it may very well be that the gang that assembled the bomb used the know-how acquired by the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists who were deported to Lebanon in December 1992 and who returned to the territories a few months ago. The sources pointed out that the deportees, who spent a year at the Marj al-Zuhur encampment, were trained in the preparation of bombs and booby-trapped cars by Hizballah experts and Iranian elements.
