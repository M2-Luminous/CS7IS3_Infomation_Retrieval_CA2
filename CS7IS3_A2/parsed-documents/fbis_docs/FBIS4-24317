Mr. (Descoyet) categorically stated that French operations in Rwanda are strictly humanitarian, and have nothing to do with military or political interference in Rwanda's affairs. He told the press that France's operations in Rwanda are a fulfillment of a United Nations Security Council resolution, passed on 22nd June, which warrants those operations. Mr. (Descoyet) reiterated his country's stand on Rwanda's affairs, that it is the rule of the United Nations and Africa to mediate between the warring parties, not France. He categorically refuted press reports that France has interests in Rwanda and is taking sides, emphasizing that theirs is purely to safeguard the innocent threatened civilians by war, which work it is doing very well. He also refuted allegations that his country trained the Rwandese Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, MRND, militia] who are accused of constant violation of human rights in Rwanda. He said France has a written cooperation with Rwanda like it is doing with other African countries, but when incidents of violation of human rights continued, this cooperation was reduced to nothing. He refuted allegations that his country has been aiding the Rwanda interim government.
