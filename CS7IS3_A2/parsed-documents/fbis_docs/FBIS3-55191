The commission, which is responsible for providing premises for the State Duma, is headed by the Federal Assembly's Chief of Staff Vladimir Podoprigora. The need for the meeting arose after the commission sent to the president its official conclusion that the building (36 Novy Arbat Street) and the adjacent Mir Hotel, set aside for the State Duma, are unfit for normal parliamentary activities. After hearing the arguments offered by the administration, the commission believed they were unconvincing and unanimously adopted its previous decision. In the summing-up document the commission took into consideration the assurances that the commercial structures, such as Mosbank, the International Monetary Fund and others would vacate the building of the former Mayor's Office by February 1. Also taken into consideration was the administration's promise to finish the repairs and fit the building by March 1. The commission said, though, that deputies would not have normal working conditions in the building. The above conclusion is to be considered today, at 19:00, at the meeting of the Organizing Committee headed by Sergey Filatov.
