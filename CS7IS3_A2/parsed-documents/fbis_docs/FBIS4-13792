It fails, however, to even mention the peace agreement or Israel. Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, what is this agreement all about? [Abu-Zayidah] First, this is an internal agreement in the Gaza Strip. It is not related to the peace process, but rather to the internal relations between the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. [Levi] It broaches issues which relate to your daily affairs, such as the issue of collaborators, does it not? [Abu-Zayidah] Precisely. The leaflet first of all calls for a propaganda lull between the two organizations, and this is a natural thing. It also calls for halting the assassination of people suspected of collaboration -- and this is the important thing. I have always struggled against Hamas and the rejectionist front organizations -- and within our organization as well -- with a view to stop the assassination of people suspected of... [Levi, interrupting] How many suspects are being assassinated monthly, in your estimation? [Abu-Zayidah] In the Gaza Strip at least 10-15 people are killed every month. [Levi] You just find a corpse lying around somewhere in the morning? [Abu-Zayidah] We find somebody who has been killed because he was suspected of being a collaborator. People are very concerned about this. [Levi] What about other issues, such as distribution of land? [Abu-Zayidah] Yes, this issue directly relates to Israeli rule. When the Israelis announced their intention to withdraw soon, people started worrying about what will happen to state-owned land. In the past people who took over state-owned land were fined. Now people have practically stormed these lots. [Levi] Is this leaflet part of Fatah's efforts to assume authority in the Gaza Strip in anticipation of the withdrawal? [Abu-Zayidah] We do not regard Fatah as being in authority, but rather the entire Palestinian people. [Levi] This is a nice slogan, but Fatah will be in control. [Abu-Zayidah] We want the entire Palestinian people to rule, not Fatah. [Levi] I read in the newspaper that the Palestinians believe this agreement is historic. Why is it so important? [Abu-Zayidah] It is important because we are in the midst of a critical period of transition. The entire world, including the Israelis, believe that once the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] pulls out there will be a massacre in the Gaza Strip and armed militia, Lebanese style, will roam the streets. Via this leaflet, as well as in meetings held over the last three days, we are trying to prove that this will not happen. The Palestinian nation is mature and will abide by the peace agreement. It will manage to sustain all the internal contrasts. [Levi] Are you aware of the fact that Israelis are concerned about a Fatah-Hamas agreement, because we regard Hamas as a murderous terror organization? [Abu-Zayidah] I am aware of this. You have a problem in this respect, because you think that every Hamas member wants to chase you with a knife. The truth is that Hamas represents 30 percent of the Palestinian people. It is in the interest of Fatah, the PLO, and the peace process, that Hamas be included rather than excluded from the Palestinian regime. [Levi] How is it, then, that you did not include even one clause of support in the peace process, if not in Israel itself? [Abu-Zayidah] We are constantly exerting great efforts to keep Hamas close to us. We have not succeeded in terms of what you call stopping the armed struggle, because at the present time they do not ask us before they carry out attacks. [Levi] This weekend the agreement may be signed, and in two or three weeks Gaza could be in your hands. Aside from the great joy, are you also afraid? [Abu-Zayidah] I am not afraid, but I hope we will succeed.
