LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori made the proposal at a meeting with SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo. Mori and Kubo agreed a new government should be established as soon as possible, they said. Hata and his cabinet resigned Saturday prior to impending defeat in a no-confidence vote against his two-month old cabinet tabled by the LDP. Hata is the sixth prime minister in Japan to have resigned in five years. Kubo told reporters after the meeting with Mori that the country's two largest parties in parliament, the LDP and the SDP, will discuss how to break the current political deadlock. The two parties however will not proceed to consultations on forming a new coalition government, Kubo said.
