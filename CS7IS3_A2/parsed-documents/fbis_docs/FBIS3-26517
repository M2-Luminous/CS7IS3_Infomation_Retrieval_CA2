Such food as sweet potato, boiled corn, boiled peanuts and roasted chestnut are very popular there with the price of baked sweet potato increasing to up to 2.5 yuan per jin from several fens for each jin while that of rice is mere 1 yuan per jin. The profits earned from roasted chestnuts has risen by as much as 60 percent, much higher than that earned from rice. An official from the Bureau of Agriculture in the region told this agency that in order to meet the needs in the market, the structure of grain production had changed there with the area for rice cultivation reducing while that for sugarcane growing increasing and totalling 1.45 million mu. The area under cultivation of soya bean, peanut and corn now exceeds 24 million mu with the total output increasing by more than 15 percent over last year.
