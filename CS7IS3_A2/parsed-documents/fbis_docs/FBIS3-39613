The Government request was seen by MP's as a suggestion that aid groups should pull out staff who could be vulnerable to retaliation if air strikes are ordered against heavy weapons around Sarajevo. The Foreign Office said: "The Overseas Development Administration have advised these aid organisations to review whether they should keep any British or international staff in Bosnia. "The advice points out that ODA personnel have been relocated in order to reduce the risks to them until the situation becomes clearer." The Foreign Office also said: "Since September 1991, all British nationals have been advised to leave Bosnia-Herzegovina. This advice remains in force. Those who, despite this advice, decide to stay do so at their own risk."
