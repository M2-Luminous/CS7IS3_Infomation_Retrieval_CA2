The percentages are 74 percent free and 26 percent reserve. These percentages help stabilize supplies and prices and counter the destabilizing effects of the burdensome oversupply situation facing the raisin industry. This rule was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is responsible for local administration of the marketing order. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 27, 1994.
