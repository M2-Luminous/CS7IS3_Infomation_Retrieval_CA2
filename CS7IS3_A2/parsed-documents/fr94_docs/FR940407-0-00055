FR940407-0-00055 FR940407-0-00011 C. Decision I conclude that North Dakota's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Dakota is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. North Dakota now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and previously approved authorities. North Dakota also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. The State of North Dakota will submit a draft application for Non-HSWA cluster 6 and HSWA cluster 2 by June 30, 1994. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Dakota's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
