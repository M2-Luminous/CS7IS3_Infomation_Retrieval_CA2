Kim, at the midpoint of his three-day visit to Japan, told Japanese business leaders at a luncheon, "though we are greatly concerned about the bilateral trade imbalance, we will endeavor to resolve it through the positive approach of expanding our exports, rather than through the passive approach of restricting imports." Kim is on a weeklong tour of Japan and China to encourage east Asian economic cooperation as well as a coordinated effort to persuade North Korea to desist with its nuclear brinkmanship. The South Korean president sees the hard-line communist government of Kim Il-song as not only a military and political threat but also "a major impediment to regional exchanges and cooperation." Kim sees Asia as "the most dynamic economic region of the world" which is "expected to emerge as the main axis for the global economy" in future. "We must strive to eliminate any obstacle to free trade and economic cooperation so as to promote coexistence, shared prosperity and balanced development throughout Asia," he said. Expanding upon his November summit with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Kim was optimistic about the two young administrations in Seoul and Tokyo. "We have been able to diminish differences between Seoul and Tokyo over how to redress our trade imbalance and how to promote technological cooperation," Kim said. With regard to the trade imbalance that reached 8.45 billion dollars in Japan's favor in 1993, Kim vowed, "we will work harder to improve product quality and reliability and meticulously fulfill delivery and other contract terms." Kim was also optimistic that the new initiative for an economic partnership, scheduled to hold its first meeting in Seoul next month, would serve as "a major vehicle for bilateral dialogue and cooperation. Calling his visit to Tokyo a "new catalyst for consolidating our forward looking bilateral ties and economic cooperation," Kim urged the Japanese business leaders to "actively take advantage of the improving investment climate in (South) Korea."
