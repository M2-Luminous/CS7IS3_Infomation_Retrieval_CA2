The recent round of talks was held in Geneva. In an interview with Interfax, Chikovani, who took part in the talks, said that the Abkhazian delegation occupied an "obstinate and unconstructive stand" and demanded the UN troops deployment along the confrontation line on the Inguri River. The Georgian troops, he said, are demanded by Abkhazia to be withdrawn eight kilometers away from the river. Such demands, said Chikovani, run counter to commonsense and cannot guarantee the safety of refugees. The Georgian side favors the deployment of peacekeepers along the entire territory of Abkhazia, including along the border with Russia which passes along the Psou River.
