A spokesman of the German Foreign Ministry said that the EU [European Union] was investigating whether Greece had broken the Union's laws or international law. "It is in our interest to have more stability in the region, not less," the spokesman said. The question will be discussed on Friday in Athens during a meeting of the EU troika, in which the Belgian, Greek, and German foreign ministers will take part. The blockade of Macedonia would be one of the most important subjects in the talks, an EU spokesman said.
