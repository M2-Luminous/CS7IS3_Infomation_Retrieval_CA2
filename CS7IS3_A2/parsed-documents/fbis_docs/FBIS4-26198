The State Council Information Office held a news conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing today. During the news conference, Ye Qing, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, briefed the reporters on these two documents and answered their questions. Ye Qing said: The "Outlines of the State's Industrial Policy for the Nineties" and the "Policy for the Automobile Industry," which serves as one of the special industrial policies in the outlines, are important measures to adapt to the new situation of China's socialist market economy; strengthen and improve macroeconomic control; readjust and maximize industrial structure; and promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development of national economy. Ye Qing said: In light of the objective rules of industrialization and modernization as well as national realities and structural changes in China, the outlines forward major subjects needed to be solved when China readjusts and maximizes its industrial structure in the nineties. The subjects are: First, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the farming sector's status as the foundation of the national economy and comprehensively develop the rural economy. Second, great efforts should be made to build basic industries and improve a situation in which basic industries and infrastructural facilities are backward. Third, it is necessary to accelerate the growth of pillar industries so as to invigorate the national economy. Fourth, it is imperative to reasonably readjust foreign trade system and strengthen the ability of China's industrial sectors in international competition. Meanwhile, massive efforts should be made to develop the tertiary industry and accelerate the development of high and new technological industry. It is necessary to maximize the industrial structure and promote industrial and technical standards so as to have an even better industrial distribution. The "Policy for the Automobile Industry," which was promulgated at the same time as the outlines, clearly defines China's goal for the development of the automobile industry; policies for industrial organization, industrial technology, and industrial distribution; as well as policies concerning foreign funds and foreign trade. This special industrial policy has been put into force. In accordance with the outlines' requirements, the State Council will also continue to examine and approve special industrial policies for transportation, telecommunications, construction, electronic, machine-building, and petrochemical industries; and policies related to foreign funds, foreign trade, technology, and readjustment of industrial organization. Ye Qing said: The "Outlines of the State's Industrial Policy for the Nineties" also clearly stipulate the procedures for formulating industrial policies and their implementing measures. The outlines stipulate the following rules: (1) The State Council will decide the state's industrial policies. State Planning Commission will be responsible for the overall work of studying, formulating, and coordinating the state's industrial policies. The State Planning Commission will initiate, with help from departments concerned, the work of formulating various industrial policies. (2) It is necessary to set up a reviewing system for the state's industrial policies. (3) It is necessary to set up a system that serves to guarantee the implementation of the state's industrial policies. (4) It is necessary to set up a system for the supervision, inspection, and appraisal of the state's industrial policies. (5) People's governments at provincial level should study and formulate, in accordance with the requirements of the outlines and local realities, specific rules for the implementation of these outlines and submit them to the State Planning Commission for the record. The outlines also put forewords "Some Regulations Concerning the Standards of Economic Scale for Fixed Asset Investment Projects (First Group)," which clearly stipulate the standards of economic scale for a group of fixed asset investment projects.
