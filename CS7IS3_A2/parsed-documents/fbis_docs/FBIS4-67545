In a bid to enhance the ministry's authority to control tap water for example the ministry recently absorbed three sections from the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the Construction Ministry. Now the Ministry of Environment is responsible for the maintenance of clean water from reservoirs to the tap of each household. The measure has been taken as the government has come to see more than ever before the importance of supplying clean water after the nationwide shock over contamination of the Naktong River and several other important sources of drinking water. But as purifying water for potable use is a very expensive business, the ministry has decided to transfer it to the private sector and industrial companies will gradually be directly responsible for treating their own waste. It means that the government will allow state-run corporations or private companies to participate in the operation of water purification plants, ministry official say. Sophisticated equipment will be installed at filtration plants at the lower streams of the Naktong and three other rivers to supply safer tap water, according to a ministry project. As Environment Minister Pak Yun-hun has put it, the measure to allow state-run corporations and private firms to participate in running water purification plants is intended to permit more experts to manage water quality. Presently, water filtration plants are under the control of the government. Most of the state-run water purification facilities are manned by about 15 government employees, of whom only two to three have the qualifications to be classified as professional technicians. "It is of utmost importance that qualified manpower be assigned to deal with water treatment processes and the only way that this can be financed is by transferring the business to the private sector," Minister Pak says. He hints, however, that this will likely increase the charges for tap water and that there's no other way to deal with the situation since the government is suffering from a huge deficit by carrying out the purification on its own. The delegation of the business to private sector will only be effectuated on condition that the management structure is completely overhauled so that no additional monitoring will be required to ensure the highest rate of potability. At the same time, the ministry is to map out plans to introduce environmental taxes, issue bonds and instant lottery tickets as a means of raising funds necessary to finance various environmental improvement projects. On the issue of waste treatment, industrial facilities across the nation will be told to equip themselves to deal with their own waste instead of relying on government-run treatment plants. At the same time, both individuals and enterprises failing to conform to regulation on the dissipation of garbage in public places will be subject to heavy fines on the spot, the ministry has decided. But the ministry is to relax various regulations on the installation of related facilities, including incinerators, so that the industrial companies can cope with their waste and reduce pollution at the point of its generation. On the private side, greater efforts will be made to encourage residents to actively participate in the separate waste disposal system for maximizing the rate of recycling. The initiation of garbage collection and treatment charges in accordance with the amount generated, which started in April, plays a powerful role in enhancing the awareness of the public in the role that they must play in protecting the environment, ministry officials note. Minister Pak has said his ministry will help government officials and civic groups to jointly monitor the quality of water. The ministry also plans to support campaigns sponsored by the environmental groups to protect clean water. "Also of substantial importance will be the launching of joint surveillance groups among the government and civic organization to maintain close watch on the quality of water," Pak says. He says his ministry plans to invest about 30 billion won this year to develop environmental technology, and will also work out steps for the Green Round of multilateral talks, which is expected to impose tougher environmental regulations on Korean businesses. He says the government seeks to sign agreements with advanced countries such as the United States, Japan and France to launch joint research into environmental technology. A ministry task force has visited the United States and other advanced countries in February to study recent trends in environmental protection in those countries. The ministry will also provide training programs on environmental technology to officials from Asian countries like China and Thailand.
