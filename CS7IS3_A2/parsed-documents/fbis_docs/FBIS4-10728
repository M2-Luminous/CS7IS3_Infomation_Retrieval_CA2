The first meeting was scheduled for today. The meeting between the defense minister and General Augusto Pinochet, Admiral Jorge Martinez Busch, and Air Force General Ramon Vega lasted two hours. With this invitation to the commanders in chief, Defense Minister Edmundo Perez reactivated an institution that had not met since Chile returned to democracy: the Junta of Commanders in Chief. The Junta is a Defense Ministry advisory organ created in 1960. It is by definition the highest military contact with the political power, although it was never convened during President Patricio Aylwin's administration. Minister Edmundo Perez decided to reactivate the organ because he thinks it is a mechanism that permits an easy civilian-military contact. The Junta only deals with strategic and defense affairs. During this meeting, the commanders and the defense minister analyzed the country's strategic situation. There were no comments at the end of the meeting, but all the participants looked pleased.
