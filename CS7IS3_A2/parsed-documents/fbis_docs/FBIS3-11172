[Magalhaes] No. The PFL has a natural candidate, a party candidate. I am that candidate. As I intend to resign on 30 March, I could tour Brazil, boost my image, and become a strong candidate. But this is not what I am going to do. I want to become senator for Bahia State. I believe the political forces must be able to find a common candidate to face the critical situation that the country is experiencing. If possible we will select a common candidate. It could be Fernando Henrique Cardoso, some other member of his party, or a candidate from another party. There are some very good names. [Lobo] Who? [Magalhaes] It may be someone from the PP [Popular Party] or the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]. Citing names is always unpleasant because no one likes to be excluded. Everyone believes that he is capable of resolving the country's problems. This is why I will not cite names. Some are known to the public, others will have to campaign to become known by the public... [Lobo] The PFL was initially critical following the launch of the economic plan. What has now changed: the plan or the PFL? [Magalhaes] The PFL did not change nor is the plan successful. One thing is certain: The PFL supported all the measures submitted by Itamar [Franco's] government to save Brazil. But, this has not happened. It is not the fault of the PFL that the plan will not succeed. Leaving the plan aside, the PFL believes Cardoso has aptitude. But he is not the only one who has the necessary aptitude to resolve Brazil's problems. Like Cardoso, there are others who can make Brazil grow again. Brazil needs an administrator. It is a question of observing who is administering his state appropriately in order to choose a good presidential candidate. [Lobo] Is the PFL making any demands over joining a coalition? [Magalhaes] The PFL could make demands, it even has the right to make them. But it's strength lies in the fact that it wants the basic points of its program to be studied by associates of an alliance. These points must be taken seriously because they are very important. We are convinced that no one can govern Brazil well without adopting the basic points of our program, because they are the hallmarks of a candidate that wants to save Brazil and get it out of the chaos. To have political interests is natural. Those who deny it are hypocrites. The PFL does not admit incongruous conduct. Over the years the party has helped in the functioning of the democratic system. We do not accept those who have no tradition of struggling for democracy, but who now talk about democracy and at the same time about social democracy. [passage omitted] [Lobo] How will the PFL channel talks with other parties? [Magalhaes] The PFL has competent people, and a competent, experienced, and serious man at the head of the party who has the ability to command. He is Jorge Bornhausen. He is currently leading very well with a democratic spirit and with a lot of aplomb. He has clearly demonstrated that the PFL wants to resolve Brazil's problems. [Lobo] Problems always appear over the vice presidential candidacy of your party when an alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and the PFL is discussed. [Magalhaes] We do not accept any type of problems. If there are problems, the respective party should resolve them internally. When the PFL has a problem it is always discussed internally. If you are referring to the PSDB, then it is up to the leaders that want to dispute the presidency to resolve the problem so they can talk with authority. [Lobo] Could this alliance include the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]? [Magalhaes] When I defend an alliance I believe no one should be excluded from the consultation. It is the situation, specially a party platform situation, that excludes a person. The way to react and to administrate, the way to perceive how the country's problems can be resolved are what separates one person from another. This why Lula [Workers Party, PT, leader Luis Inacio da Silva] isolates himself when he wants to create a totalitarian alliance instead of a democratic alliance. [Lobo] Does the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] have a place in that alliance? [Magalhaes] An alliance cannot exclude anyone on principle. [Rio de Janeiro State Governor Leonel] Brizola is better than [Orestes] Quercia. [Lobo] Will this alliance be a rehash of the 1985 Democratic Alliance? [Magalhaes] Each election is different and Brazil is now in a very different position than in 1984. It has something to do with justice: [Former President Tancredo] Neves was a compromiser, but he had the courage to make decisions when necessary. I was very close to him for a long time and despite what many people say, I observed how often he had to make decisions and how he rigorously complied with his commitments. He kept his word. On 12 August 1984, the day of the PMDB convention, I was the first minister to be named by Neves. He rigorously complied with his commitment, even though the media stated that I was not going to be a minister and that my fellow party members were concerned. [passage omitted]
