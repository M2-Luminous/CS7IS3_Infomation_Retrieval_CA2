Bekker: "Boris Fedorov Tortures Central Bank in the English Manner"] [Text] Central Bank Will Not Refuse To Keep an Eye on Commercial Banks The Duma Subcommittee on Policy and Activity of the Central Bank held a second round of hearings on the operation of the Central Bank. Their initiator, Boris Fedorov, as agreed with Viktor Gerashchenko, intends meeting with heads of various Central Bank departments during the summer in order to, in the words of the subcommittee chairman, "obtain as much information as possible" about the bank. Twice a week Room 838 in the State Duma will turn into "a torture chamber," when the dialogue between Russian deputies and the bankers will take place in the rigid fashion of the British parliament. No reports, only questions and answers. "We are not going into discussions," Mr. Fedorov observed, as if underscoring a strictly practical interest, free of confrontation. The final outcome of the meetings is seen by him to be the compilation of a full shorthand record and elaboration of practical recommendations on the development of the banking business in the country. At yesterday's hearings the principal respondents were Dmitriy Tulin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank, and Nadezhda Ivanova, deputy chairman of the Department of Banking Supervision. That department engages in the licensing of banking operations, analysis of bank reporting procedures, elaboration of standards, supervision of banks to prevent bankruptcy, preparation of clearing operations, and liquidation of commercial banks. The last function was defined by Mr. Tulin as "not peculiar to the Central Bank," explaining its necessity as being due to the transition period and the establishment of a new banking order. Work on perfection of the taxation system was also mentioned by the deputy chairman of the Central Bank as being outside the operational profile of the Central Bank. Issuance of licenses is considered to be the main task of the main bank. At the local level the main administrations of the Central Bank appear as their issuers. According to the assurances of Mrs. Ivanova, territorial administrations do not abuse their right, and refuse licenses for commercial banks only in rare cases, limited by law. As Mr. Tulin added, the laws of the Russian Federation do not allow rejection of a candidate for the post of chairman of a commercial bank. Even though there are Central Bank methodological instructions on the evaluation of professional qualities, neither they, nor the term of three months allowed for confirmation, permit the revelation of all there is to know about a manager, who, as Boris Fedorov said, could have a record of "two defunct banks and theft of customers' money." The Central Bank, of course, is not completely defenseless. In 1993 it used its right and canceled licenses of 19 commercial banks, while this year licenses were taken away from 21 commercial banks. In addition to its own criteria for steep measures, the Central Bank also responds to requests from customs and tax services. It is true that the Central Bank does not work logically in this case either and tries not to cancel a license until a decision is reached by an arbitration court regarding bankruptcy, while the court needs a license cancellation in order to recognize bankruptcy. The Central Bank does break this closed circle, but according to Mrs. Ivanova, "orders concerning the closing of banks are strictly individual." In order to avoid such an extreme outcome the Central Bank worked out a number of norms for the commercial banks. One of the risk limits is determined by the norm of capital sufficiency. Evaluative indices of current and long-term liquidity and maximum amount of risk per borrower are outdated and will probably be repealed. But as of last year the open currency position is being restricted, and a standard was introduced limiting the investment of their own capital by commercial banks in the charter funds of other commercial organizations--a limit of 10 percent exists for capital invested in one enterprise, and 50 percent "for the entire circle" of firms. In the opinion of Mr. Tulin, "Banking supervision earns no laurels for the Central Bank," inasmuch as it makes up 90 percent of the load. But "it is not yet time" to remove that burden. Despite the existing conflicts with commercial banks "we, like no one else, understand their problems and are helping to protect their interests," concluded the deputy chairman of the Central Bank. That debate developed in connection with proposals to withdraw the Department of Banking Supervision from the structure of the Central Bank. Similar discussions, by the way, are under way in the United States with respect to the Federal Reserve System. Konstantin Lubenchenko, director of the Legal Department, is convinced that in Russia such a "divorce" is at the very least premature inasmuch as "only the Central Bank has at its disposal all the information on operations being conducted by the commercial banks." He also cited the following fact to prove his point: According to the International Monetary Fund, banking supervision services "are included" within the structure of their national banks in 80 percent of the countries. Confirming the thesis of Mr. Tulin concerning protection of the interests of commercial banks by the Central Bank, Mrs. Ivanova said that "it is necessary to change the entire order of their taxation." According to her, banks are currently paying around 30 forms of taxes and the ratio of payments to net profit amounts to 58 percent, which is "excessively high." "Commercial banks lack the profits to create reserves for covering shaky credit, and that could lead to the collapse of the entire banking system", declared the deputy chairman of the department. She also said that proposals calling for a review of the commercial bank taxation system were forwarded to the Federation Council.
