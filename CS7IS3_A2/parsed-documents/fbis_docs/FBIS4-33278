Any government that refuses to follow Washington's instructions or fulfill its demands sets itself on the path to economic sanctions. Worst of all is that the United States has managed to introduce these methods in the OAS, and when a problem arises with any government, the first thing that is proposed and decided is to apply sanctions and twist the arm or squeeze the necks of those who are reluctant or rebellious. Washington's current target is North Korea because it has refused to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to conduct inspections to confirm whether or not the North Korean Government is on the verge of manufacturing nuclear weapons. The U.S. Government seems to have forgotten that North Korea is an independent and sovereign country with the full right to decide who does or does not enter its territory. As for the possible danger of the North Korean Government's having nuclear weapons, there is no doubt that the threat is much less than that represented by the United States' huge nuclear arsenal, which no one has questioned as one of the greatest threats to humanity. Washington has managed to make Russia, the Ukraine, and other former USSR countries agree to disarm themselves by eliminating their nuclear arsenals. The U.S. Government demands that everyone disarm, but it has not touched and does not seem as if it will touch a single one of its intercontinental missiles with their dreadful multiple-target nuclear warheads and its terrifying chemical and biological warfare labs, where catastrophic accidents could happen at any time, unleashing a carnival of death and destruction on the planet. No one, however, has even mentioned the possibility of the United States' agreeing to disarm, let alone that it be punished for this or any other reason. The United States has the same legal status as all other countries, and within the context of international law it has the same duties and rights. Why then, is the United States above any international authority? Why has no thought even been given to imposing sanctions on the United States for any of the misdeeds it has traditionally perpetrated against other countries? It is obvious that international law has nothing to do with that powerful state, which can request and implement sanctions, (?express its views), make demands, level charges, and summon or recriminate other governments, but does not allow anyone to even disagree with its plans. With what moral authority do U.S. leaders talk about democracy, law, [word indistinct] and justice when they are not capable of submitting to the views and rights of others? The DPRK has every right to work scientifically for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, as any other state should. The DPRK Government has proven that it is not a warmongering country and that it does not pose a threat to peace and stability in Asia, as is proclaimed by the Western propaganda media, which are dominated or influenced by the United States. The international community need not attack the DPRK because its government refuses to please Washington or submit to its demands through international institutions. If the United States had treated the DPRK respectfully, as the sovereign state that it is, if it had been fair and egalitarian in its international relations, it would have gotten a lot more and, especially, it would have earned respect it will never be able to claim by force.
