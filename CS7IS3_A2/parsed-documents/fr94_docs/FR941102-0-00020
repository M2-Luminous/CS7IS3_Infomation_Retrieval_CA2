FR941102-0-00020 FR941102-0-00004 §5.46 Changes in equity capital. * * * * * (f) *␣*␣* (4) Preferred stock. A bank need not submit a letter of intent and obtain preliminary approval prior to selling preferred stock for cash unless the Office has notified the bank that preliminary approval is necessary. Any bank selling preferred stock must submit a letter of notification pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section to obtain final approval and certification. The Office must review and may approve provisions in articles of association concerning preferred stock dividends, voting and conversion rights, retirement, and rights to exercise control over management. A bank may submit those provisions for review and approval with the letter of notification. * * * * * (g) Procedures. (1) A bank must submit to the appropriate District office by hand or by mail, return receipt requested, a letter of intent to change capital. The bank must receive preliminary approval for any change in capital except for a stock dividend, a cash sale of common stock, a cash sale of preferred stock where the bank has not been notified by the Office that preliminary approval is required, or a reduction in par value of common stock that does not change the sum of capital and capital surplus. Stock dividends, cash sales of common stock, cash sales of preferred stock where the bank has not been notified by the Office that preliminary approval is required, or reductions in par value of common stock that do not change the sum of capital and capital surplus are subject only to the notification process described in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section. For other changes in equity capital, the bank must submit a letter of intent describing the type and amount of the proposed change, and state if the bank is subject to a capital plan with the Office. If the bank is subject to a capital plan or if a capital plan is required in connection with the proposed change in equity capital, the bank must state how the proposed change conforms to the plan. The bank may consider its proposed change preliminarily approved 30 days after the day on which the Office receives the letter of intent, unless the bank is notified that preliminary approval is delayed, conditioned, or denied. The bank should submit the letter of intent and receive preliminary approval prior to seeking shareholder approval. The bank may proceed with an increase in capital after preliminary approval is received; however, it may not reduce its capital or make a distribution until it has received final Office approval as specified in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section. * * * * * 4.
