Our correspondent Zuzana Stukovska conveyed what Moravcik said by telephone. [Stukovska] I began this brief interview by reading the eight-point program for cooperation between the present government and the Hungarian coalition parties. [Begin recording] [Moravcik] This is a very simple business. We have agreed on the principle that would govern our cooperation. We told each other what things we could tackle from among the problems concerning national minorities. We expressed all of this in the government's policy statement. This means the content of our agreement has been reflected in the government policy statement. Apart from the government's policy statement there is nothing else that would bind us as far as this business is concerned. [Stukovska] Could one therefore say that the Hungarian coalition has always been a certain factor that could tip the scales and could it be said that this is also the case at present? A question thus arises whether some of the information published in REPUBLIKA is based on truth. One of the points of the agreement says, for example, and I quote -- it is necessary to halt the establishment of the so-called bilingual alternative schools on the territory inhabited by Hungarians. Another point says -- it envisaged that departments for minorities, specifically for the Hungarian minority, will be established at the ministries of education and culture. Minorities will be able to develop their activities within these departments. [Moravcik] Certain small organizational changes have been made, but this is on the whole in keeping with what we want to do in the field of education and culture and here I see no problem. This has involved a small organizational change designed to facilitate the work of both ministries. To impart other dimension to it would therefore appear to me to be very strange, almost ludicrous, I would say. [Stukovska] What do you think of the fact that the article has appeared precisely at this time? [Moravcik] I do not attach a great deal of importance to what is published in the daily REPUBLIKA. I am used to seeing published in this daily heaps of insults, unsubstantiated reports, and various claims which are far from the truth. [Stukovska] Moreover, in this instance too, the article has been reprinted from the Hungarian press and specifically from NEPSZABADSAG. [Moravcik] Regarding the specifics of the article, I have explained to you that at present there does not exist anything apart from the government policy statement, which forms the basic platform also for our relations with Hungarian political parties, that would be binding for us. [Stukovska] Have there been on the part of representatives of the Hungarian parties any demands for something different, that would go beyond the government's policy statement? [Moravcik] This applies in general. We have agreed we shall exert a maximum possible effort in order to implement what has been expressed in the policy statement. This will suffice for the current period. There has been enough of this. [Stukovska] Does this mean there have been no demands on the part of Hungarian parties? [Moravcik] No, no such demands have been presented and we do not expect them. [end recording]
