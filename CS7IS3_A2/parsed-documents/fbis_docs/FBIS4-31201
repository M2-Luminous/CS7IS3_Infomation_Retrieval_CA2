Incredible but True--the State Itself"] [Text] Martin, the slimmed-down ZTS [Heavy Engineering Works] TEES Martin state enterprise, employs more than 4,800 people today. After 1990, the company extended its civilian production program, in cooperation with the German Hanomag company, with bulldozers and belt loaders and introduced the production of Lombardini diesel engines under license. Nevertheless, the production of special technology still represents more than 50 percent of the engineering company's output. But let Engineer Jan Segla, the company's director, do the talking: "In drafting our entrepreneurial plan for this year, we reckoned with two key matters--that we succeed in obtaining a government guarantee for the `India' contract and that we obtain a credit of 200 million korunas [Sk] to set the production of tractors in motion. So far, the government has not extended to us the guarantee for the contract, which involves the delivery of VT-72B retriever tanks worth $28 million for the Indian Army, and we also have not obtained credit to purchase material for the production of tractors, although the marketing of these tractors has been secured. These are exceptionally serious matters, the solution of which would permit us to make profit this year and to start properly fulfilling our duties toward the banks and internal revenue authorities. We had a singular chance to get out of the red, and about 20 percent of the company's employees would not have to be at home and collecting only a part of their wages, according to the Labor Code, as has been the case over the past few months." Government's Sad Calling Card The contract for the delivery of 50 retriever tanks for India was signed in November 1993. Under the contract, the last tanks were to be delivered to India in January 1995. In keeping with the contract, by the end of January of this year, the Indian side deposited with Ceskoslovenska Obchodna Banka [Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank, CSOB] an advance payment of $5.6 million. Without a government guarantee, however, the bank cannot release the money for the ZTS TEES Martin state enterprise. After all, it is a state enterprise and not a private one. The Martin engineering company has Sk187 million deposited with the CSOB, which it badly needs to fulfill the contract. It is evident who benefits from this money. The previous government's promises about support for companies' export activities sound more or less grotesque in the face of this. Also, the new government is in no hurry to extend the guarantee. "If the government does not extend the guarantee soon, we are determined to stage protest actions," Frantisek Ladnak, chairman of the Kovo [metal workers] primary trade union organization in the ZTS TEES state enterprise, told us, and we could sense from his words that he meant it. The people from Martin are honoring the contract, at the price of considerable sacrifice, and intend to fulfill it by the end of this year. Its total value is more than $28 million, and, so far, the company has invested more than Sk500 million from its own resources in its realization. Logically, it is short of this money when it comes to purchasing materials for civilian production. Incidentally, the Indian side is considering a fourfold expansion of the contract. Invitation to Brno The specialized IDET exhibition [of defense industries] will be held in Brno this week. ZTS TEES Martin will display there the modernized version of the medium T-72 MI tank. It is equipped with a stronger engine, a reactive [reaktivna] protection of the turret, and installed aggregates [instalovane agregaty] that substantially improve its quality and combat specifications. Experts from NATO countries cooperated in the tank's modernization. Its selling price is $2-2.5 million. The production capacity enables the production of 120 of these tanks a year. Several armies of countries from so-called conflict-free regions have shown interest in purchasing the tank. The modernized tank will undoubtedly attract the interest of experts who will come to the Brno exhibition. "We reckon with the production of special technology also in the future. However, it will not exceed one-half of the company's output," says director Jan Segla. During the visit to ZTS TEES Martin, we also learned that a new heavy tank is being developed, as well as a rapid-deployment small-armored vehicle, the Aligator, for army and police needs. The development of civilian-production programs plays an equally important role in the company, however. The Martin company will continue expanding the production of diesel engines, road-building machinery, tractors, and other engineering products. Several foreign partners are contemplating establishing joint ventures with the Turec [region in north Slovakia, of which Martin is the center] engineering works. The company's privatization is becoming topical. Let us hope that the government will have a lucky hand in this case and, in view of the company's strategic importance, will not permit excessive fragmentation of its property. Foreign partners are following this with meticulous care. Only a smaller part of the factory's property should be privatized by means of coupons. The company should be gradually transformed into an employee-stockholding company and reorganized into the standard structure of a holding. The ZTS TEES Martin state enterprise is going through a difficult period of its existence. It is owed some Sk3 billion by its customers; the Czech Motokov company alone owes it Sk900 million. Following the federation's partition, some of the claims belong to the category of irrecoverable ones. One can identify with Engineer Jan Segla's view that, if the Slovak Government extended the aforementioned guarantee to the company, implemented the promised write-off of credit interest rates (Sk265 million), granted it a subsidy for conversion programs (Sk79 million), which had also been promised already, and allowed the company to sell off unnecessary property (Sk175 million) by granting it an exception from the law, and if the company succeeded in obtaining from the bank a one-year loan of Sk250 million, ZTS TEES Martin could, as of next year, again contribute vitally needed resources to the state budget. The company does not need words about the protection of the domestic market and proexport policy. It needs the realization of systemic measures, the state's wise subsidy policy aimed at developmental programs, the alleviation of restrictive measures in the sphere of provision of financial resources, and an acceleration of the privatization process. In other words, it needs action from a government that cannot be indifferent to the prosperity of an enterprise that still belongs to the state. And someone should also seriously ponder the warning from the company's trade unionists.
