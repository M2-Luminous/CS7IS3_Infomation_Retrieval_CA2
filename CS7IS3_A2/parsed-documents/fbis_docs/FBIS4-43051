The party leaders and chairmen of Bundestag groups have been slapping -- figuratively speaking -- each others backs and are pleased at the success they have been experiencing over the past few months. The CDU [Christian Democratic Union] bosses thanked their liberal colleagues for the "signal from Rostock," which confirms the will to cooperate following a success in the Bundestag elections in October. For their part, the FDP [Free Democratic Party] coalition partners congratulated CDU chairman and Chancellor Helmut Kohl for his successful appearances in the European election campaign in the new laender. In the federal chancellery, one is surprised, but naturally delighted, that Kohl has been so successful on town squares in the new laender. The squares were normally full and no tomatoes and eggs were thrown. The good mood in the CDU has received encouragement from the latest opinion polls, which place the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union], with 36.5 percent, before the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], with 35.5 percent. The prediction that the Republikaner would only receive 2.5 percent and would no longer have seats in the European Parliament was also considered pleasing. The FDP, however, is still nervous, despite a forecast of 6 percent of the vote, that it can no longer be sure of crossing the 5-percent hurdle in the European elections. In contrast to the good mood among the coalition parties, there is growing skepticism within the SPD. The certainty that it will become the strongest party in the FRG European elections has evaporated. The criticism is that the SPD has mobilization problems. That not only applies to the European election campaign, but also to the dispute over domestic political problems. There is a feeling that a perfectly organized election campaign, like the one that has been conducted about Europe, will not help the party. This has been all the more disappointing when one considers that the CDU/CSU was extremely thrifty with funds in the case of the European election campaign and evidently wants to retain money for the federal election campaign. The CDU has placed the person of Kohl, a great promoter of Europe, at the forefront of its election campaign. The SPD has not done that, although party leader Rudolf Scharping has been desperately fighting to catch up with Kohl by making special train journeys. SPD analysts have explained the disappointment by pointing out that the slow economic upturn is evidently linked with a change of mood among the population. In terms of foreign policy, the coalition has got better cards in its hands, because new crises have been avoided, and in terms of domestic policy, the SPD has created risks for itself. This last admission is directly linked to the party's party political strategy and to the person of Scharping. Now that the FDP has come out clearly in favor of a continuation of the coalition with the CDU/CSU, strong domestic policy forces within the SPD are calling for a rival strategy that could only be modeled on the red-green coalition of Lower Saxony's Minister President Gerhard Schroeder. Scharping, however, wants to keep all his options open and to avoid making a statement on a coalition at all costs. He is being accused of still being inclined toward forming an alliance with the FDP or, if necessary, an alliance with the FDP and the Greens. Following the fierce attacks from the FDP and the party conference decisions at Rostock, Scharping's election campaign strategists appear to be shocked. Such tough attacks were not expected from the FDP and are comparable to the attacks that the Liberals once launched against the CSU and its chairman Strauss in order to achieve an election campaign polarization that would get them over the 5-percent hurdle, and, as we know, they were very successful in that. The question of why the SPD party leader and candidate for chancellor is not as popular among citizens and evidently within the party itself as at one time has greatly irritated the election campaign strategists in the Erich Ollenhauer House in Bonn. His "gross-net" confusion in connection with the supplementary charge called for by the SPD was the start of the Scharping dilemma. This was evidently a mistake -- one that was rapidly corrected -- that employees have found it very difficult to forgive. There is confusion within the party about a policy toward the CDU. The fact that the person in question has remained silent has prompted conflicts within the SPD. However, at the upcoming party conference in Halle, Scharping also wants to avoid a statement on the coalition at all costs. The conference will see a secret and written vote on Scharping as a candidate for chancellor and that means that Scharping will face a difficult test within the party. In view of the disappointing mood, SPD politicians have become overactive and are continually presenting new specialist programs, which has already made the CDU indulge in scorn and derision. Speaking in Bonn yesterday, CDU Spokesman Rofl Kiefer said: "The SPD program panic shows that Scharping is helpless and does not know what to do."
