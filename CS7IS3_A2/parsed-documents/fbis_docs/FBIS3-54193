Over the past few decades, U.S. policy has dealt with us through Israel's viewpoint and backed aggression from which we are still suffering. Whenever we try to show our admiration for the U.S. Administration's interest in human rights and its rejection of violence and terrorism, we find out that it is still far from being fair in the way it takes an interest in these rights and in the way it defines violence and terrorism. Instead of being a source of inspiration for many peoples to promote the principles of freedom on which its first revolution was founded the United States has become, in the view of many peoples, as well as our Arab people in particular, an example of a dominating force supporting the killer against the victim. Today, as the United States calls for bringing about peace and stability in our region, it is expected to prove that it really wants such a fair, comprehensive, and lasting peace. However, we reaffirm that the current image is not impossible to change, particularly if the United States eliminates the reasons behind this image by getting Israel to change its negotiating position on peace, which will not succeed unless it is just and comprehensive, and by ending Jordan's suffering and the blockade, which is deeply affecting Jordan and its people and which is harming the fraternal Iraqi people following the Gulf crisis, as the U.S. Administration knows well. Jordan, severely harmed by the region's events since the establishment of Israel, expects the United States to turn over a new leaf and compensate Jordan for all its burdens and the damage caused to it over decades of crises and conflict, in which the United States was biased in violation of its declared principles of freedom, human rights, and the need for security and stability. We hope that this superpower will not remain a captive of its own power isolated from the human dimension, without which power means tyranny and cannot be beautified in the eyes of nations, regardless of its size.
