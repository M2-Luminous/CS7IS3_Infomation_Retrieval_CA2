The session continued to review the items on its agenda, addressing national developments, including the document of pledge and accord among the political parties to emerge from the political crisis and build the new Yemeni state. The discussions of the members of the Standing Committee focused on the means to implement the pledge and accord agreement and the GPC's future tasks. The brother secretary general delivered a speech at the end of the GPC's work in which he reviewed national developments and the GPC's relevant stands. He stressed the need to shoulder our national responsibilities at this crucial stage in the history of our people and country and overcome all the negativism and false steps witnessed by our Yemeni homeland during the transitional period and thereafter. He indicated that our people have suffered much from the crisis and that all concerned should measure up to their responsibilities and rise above minor issues and subordinate everthing else to the interest of the homeland. The Standing Committee adopted a number of internal decisions and measures. A press release was issued at the end of the extraordinary session of the GPC's Standing Committee. Following is its text: In a climate full of confidence and hope, the GPC's Standing Committee held an extraordinary session on 19-20 Sha'ban, 1413 hegira, corresponding to 30-31 January, 1994 under brother secretary general of the GPC, Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the chairman of the Presidential Council. The session was devoted to a discussion of the present general state of affairs in light of the document of pledge and accord drafted by the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue Committee on 18 January, 1994. As well as reviewing the contents of the document, the Standing Committee studied the reports related to the progress of the national dialogue and its ramifications on all fronts and the subsequent developments and intensive contacts to prepare for the final signing of the document. In this regard, the GPC's Standing Committee expressed its full support for the GPC's statement issued on 18 January, which announced the GPC's acceptance of the document reached by the parties to the dialogue of the political forces to build the new Yemeni state. At the same time, the Standing Committee appreciated the efforts of the committee of the political forces and the document it worked out -- the document which the Standing Committee believes to be a program for the next stage in the life of the Yemeni people, who entered the modern age when they restored their unity on 22 May, 1990 and chose the democratic road of its own free will, the crowning day of which was 27 April, 1993. In this context, the Standing Committee asserts that commitment to this document and eagerness to implement it truly embody the depth of commitment to the democratic option, which the GPC was the first to adopt. The accord document is a further contribution to the efforts to firmly establish democracy in the life of the state and society. This requires collective action by all forces and the mobilization of all energies to implement it creatively to ensure that it is transformed into practical steps on the ground. The exceptional importance of this document stems not only from the fact that it has put an end to the political crisis from which our homeland and people have suffered, but because it serves as a safety valve which will ensure that similar crises will not recur in the future, and will abort any sedition and plots aimed at harming the unity and democracy. Hence the need for and importance of the practical implementation of this document by all parties to the state's institutions as soon as the document signing ceremony is over. This is the true yardstick for measuring the high national responsibility and ability to transcend narrow interests and adopt the supreme interests of the homeland and people. Undoubtedly, implementing the accord document with maximum success requires that all efforts be united through full cohesion among all national, legislative, and executive departments and institutions of the state and that the implementation process be spared any acts of one-upmanship. Throughout the duration of the political crisis, such acts have gravely harmed the state and society, thus endangering the homeland's unity, security, and stability, and even the life and future of every Yemeni citizen. In this context, the Standing Committee emphasizes the importance of making available the appropriate atmosphere for the final signing of the accord document. Meanwhile, most regrettably, it has noticed the unjustified continuation of some ramifications of the crisis, especially the cessation of the general census of the population, houses, and installations while it is in its final stage, in addition to some media ramifications. The Standing Committee believes that if the course of dialogue, accord, and mutual concessions at the table of a national, responsible dialogue has resulted in this national document, which has won broad popular support, then the continuation of this course within the framework of commitment to constitutional legitimacy and its institutions and abidance by the tasks and powers as specified by the Constitution and law will provide sufficient protection for all stages of the actual implementation of this document. Besides, the existence of a broader popular participation in the programs of implementation will enhance the possibility of implementing the document and will prevent any attempt to shirk abidance by the document. In this regard, the Standing Committee believes that building the modern Yemeni state is a great historic process that cannot be achieved without the broadest possible popular participation, especially by political forces and national intellectuals who really believe that the state of law and order, the state of institutions, and the state of stable constitutional legitimacy that is based on the people's free will, is the main objective which has been sought since the homeland restored its unity on 22 May 1990. This objective was at the forefront of the national tasks of the 27 September and 14 October glorious revolutions. In light of this, everybody is called on today to renounce the methods followed during the transitional period and to resort to new methods that are in harmony with the historical nature of this lofty national mission which we should accomplish with one political will and with high national responsibility to rise to our greater national objectives sought by our masses to live a secure and stable life in a climate of justice, freedom, and equality. Given the large-scale Arab and international support for the document of pledge and accord, the Standing Committee expresses its satisfaction with this great national and international response and thanks all brothers and friends who expressed their concern over our country's unity and democratic experiment. Those brothers and friends spared no effort to reach a satisfactory end to the political crisis. They also blessed the document of pledge and accord reached by the dialogue among the Yemeni political forces. As the GPC Standing Committee ends this extraordinary session, it greets and appreciates our people who have suffered a great deal throughout the crisis which endangered the people's food, security, and future. Despite all this, our people showed great patience and readiness to make sacrifices to safeguard unity and democracy. Our valiant Armed Forces proved to be a shield that protects the homeland and its unity and that they will never become a tool to destroy the homeland and shed the blood of its sons. On this occasion, the Standing Committee renews the pledge that the GPC will always remain -- as it has always been -- loyal to the interests of the homeland and people, concerned about their unity, safety, and stability, and determined to proceed on the road toward prosperity and progress for all the sons of the people. Let us move together toward the future; let us converge efforts to triumph in the battle for construction. Let us work together to build the edifice of the modern Yemeni state. Let us always raise high the banners of unity and democracy. Our God will grant us success as He is our best supporter. Issued by the GPC Standing Committee at the conclusion of its extraordinary session in Sanaa on 31 January 1994.
