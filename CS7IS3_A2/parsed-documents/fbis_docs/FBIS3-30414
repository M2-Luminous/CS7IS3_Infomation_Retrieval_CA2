To win the Russian authorities' approval, the ministry advised Mr. Girenko, charge d'affaires at the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana, that V. Zhirinovskiy should leave Slovenia as quickly as possible because his group had flagrantly disturbed public order in Bled. The Russian ambassador is, of course, looking toward the future and wisely advised that this problem should be resolved by the Slovene juridical system. However, the hand of the Slovene Foreign Ministry obviously does not reach beyond the foyer of its own building. Who is going to take seriously a foreign ministry that the Croatian authorities can outmaneuver anytime they please and that is threatening to the Russian parliamentarian like a paper tiger. While Peterle has been granting diplomatic privileges all over the place, he treats the chief of the most powerful Russian party worse than a foreign hooligan. How many affluent foreign guests have broken a little something in hotels and had a bit of fun on the streets but were not expelled from the country because of it? Furthermore, a vehicle that Lord Carrington was racing through Styria a few years ago fatally ran over a Slovene citizen. The English gentleman was neither expelled from the state nor prosecuted. A grim image of independent Slovenia without a sovereign foreign policy. Appeasement of the West and hatred of the East have reached the outermost limits of insanity. There is no longer any mention of Slovene neutrality in the parliament, not even a shred of an idea about the possible benefits of a military alliance with the Russians. Slovene politicians, with the exception of bright Jelincic, take it for granted that the United States have a more favorable attitude toward Slovene independence than Russia. They are falling all over prima donna Albright, who comes empty-handed, but fear Zhirinovskiy like a devil fears the cross, even though he has signed a statement with Jelincic on Slovenia's independence, its position as an East-West bridge, and other related things. East Europeans are so very precious because they inspire some dignity in the Slovenes. Only next to the Ukranian Foreign Minister has President Kucan managed to regain the appearance of a serious statesman. Now if only he could get rid of a bothersome tic that automatically pulls his face into a smile at the sight of a western politician.
