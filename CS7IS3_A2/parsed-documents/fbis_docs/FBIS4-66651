Since the start of this campaign in mid-March, close to 400 terrorists have been killed and just as many arrested. Cities such as Blida, Chlef, Medea, Kseur-el-Boukhari, and, most recently, Tiaret, which were said to be "hard to reach," have been cleaned of their savage hordes. In the same spirit, the special courts (responsible for cases of terrorism and subversion) have been reactivated. Hundreds of Islamic fundamentalists arrested for having been part of armed groups and taking part in assassinations, hold-ups, acts of sabotage, etc. have started appearing in front of these agencies of the law. Close to 350 terrorists are supposed to appear this month in the Algiers special court alone. In Oran, several terrorists groups appear in court each day. Stiff sentences are handed down. They thus pay for the crimes they have committed. Knowledgeable observers are delighted with these new measures. "The armed arms of Islamic fundamentalism," they say, "have been pinned back; but that is not enough. These new measures should be accompanied by radical policy decisions and fundamentalism should be fought tooth and nail." Indeed this experience has shown that security measures alone are not enough. Policy action is even more important. As for the Islamic fundamentalists, they have understood this. They have divided up the tasks. Some kill, others talk. Among the latter, some harden the tone and others appear conciliatory. One single objective unites them. The establishment of an Islamic state. On this subject, chahid Boudiaf said: "Stopping the electoral process had become necessary. Using Islam for partisan and political means, demagoguery and lies for some time were able to achieve an impact on those in this system who were excluded, on marginalized people. To this should be added the complicity of certain areas of the government." "Today it becomes more and more evident that collusion exists between the party in power, fundamentalism, and, unfortunately, a certain partisan opposition..." Thus continuing to believe that it is possible to contain the fundamentalists through legal means is but an illusion. This could be fatal for the country. As for those who talk about respecting the constitution, it might be time for them to think of implementing it. Law No. 89-II dated 5 July 1989 pertaining to political associations says in its Article 4, final paragraph: "furthermore the political association cannot base its creation or actions on an exclusively religious, linguistic, regional, sexual, racial, or certain professional status basis." The law could not be clearer. This paragraph bans the former Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], Hamas [Islamic Society Movement], Ennahda, and all their satellites. As we have often emphasized, Islamic fundamentalism is ruthless towards the weak. The more you make concessions to it, the more it demands. It knows no bounds. It is not generous. Delays are not its problem. It wants everything and wants it now. To fail to understand this policy would be to play into their hands.
