He has just announced his entry into politics. He will stand for Forza Italia at the forthcoming elections because, he said, he no longer wants to live in a country governed by immature forces, and desires to fight on the side of freedom as an alternative to the left. Berlusconi sent a video recording to public and private sector news bulletins. Here is the passage concerning his candidacy: [Begin Berlusconi recording] I have decided to enter the fray and to concern myself with public affairs because I do not want to live in a country which is not liberal and is governed by immature forces and by men tied twice over to past political and economic failure. In order to live the new life I have chosen, today I tendered my resignation from all company positions in the group that I founded. I am therefore giving up my role as editor and businessman to put my experience and all my efforts at the disposal of a battle in which I believe with the utmost conviction and with the utmost strength.
