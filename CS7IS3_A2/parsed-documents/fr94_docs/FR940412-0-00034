FR940412-0-00034 FR940412-0-00007 Tuesday April 12, 1994 Part IV Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 91 Temporary Restriction of Instrument Approaches and Certain Visual Flight Rules Operations in High Barometric Weather Conditions; Final Rule Federal Register / Vol. 59, No. 70 / Tuesday, April 12, 1994 / Rules and Regulations Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. 26806; Amdt. 91&hyph;240] RIN 2120&hyph;AD75 Temporary Restriction of Instrument Approaches and Certain Visual Flight Rules Operations in High Barometric Weather Conditions AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule amends part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to provide for the issuance of temporary flight restrictions on certain operations when accurate altitude information is not available. The rule is warranted because barometric pressure higher than 31.00 inches of mercury (inHg) (1049.8 millibars) exceeds the capability of standard aircraft pressure altimeters and prevents the display of accurate altitude information. The rule provides restrictions on certain flight operations during periods of abnormal atmospheric pressure conditions and is necessary to promote flight safety during certain operations for which accurate altitude information is critical. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Larry Youngblut, Regulations Branch (AFS&hyph;240), Flight Standards Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, D.C. 20591, Telephone: (202) 267&hyph;3755. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background For several days in January 1989, weather observers in various locations in the State of Alaska recorded record-breaking barometric pressure higher than 31.00 inHg (1049.8 millibars). These extremely high barometric pressures exceeded the capability of standard aircraft pressure altimeters and prevented the display of accurate altitude information on aircraft pressure altimeters. This condition occasionally extends to northern portions of the contiguous United States. Aircraft altimeters indicate altitude based on a reading of the air pressure surrounding the aircraft. These altimeters incorporate an adjustment for environmental barometric pressure that permits pilots manually to set the correct pressure reading in the instrument. If the pressure setting is incorrect, the altitude readout also will be incorrect. Because barometric readings of 31.00 inHg, or higher, seldom occur, standard altimeters do not permit barometric pressures to be set above that level and are not calibrated to indicate accurate aircraft altitude when the surface pressure exceeds 31.00 inHg. As a result, many altimeters cannot be set to display accurate altitude readouts to pilots in conditions such as those that were experienced during the high pressure conditions in Alaska.
