The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, told a press conference in New Delhi today that India had a clear margin to defeat Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir if it had been put to vote. Mr. Khurshid, who returned from Geneva last night, said that there was overwhelming opinion that the bilateral issue should not be raised at Human Rights Commission forum. He denied entering into any tripartite deal with Iran and China to enable withdrawal of the Pakistan-sponsored resolution. Mr. Khurshid also ruled out any fact-finding commission of the Islamic conference Organization to Kashmir. He, however, disclosed that India has invited the permanent representatives of the ICO at Geneva to visit New Delhi for discussions.
