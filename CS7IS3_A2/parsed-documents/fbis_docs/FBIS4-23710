In the past week: -- It has had to disband its caucus in the Cape Town city council, it lost a key member to the ANC and will have to face a challenge from a new coalition being formed to fight the upcoming local authority elections. -- In Natal, five Durban city-councillors resigned from the DP's regional executive committee in protest against the nomination of Eastern Cape farmer Errol Moorcroft as senator for KwaZulu/Natal. -- And in Johannesburg, DP management committee chairman Ian Davidson was caught in a bruising fight with Premier Tokyo Sexwale over the destruction of squatter shacks on a cold winter day. The incident was enough for party stalwart Helen Suzman to criticise the DP-controlled city council harshly. These setbacks in three of the DP's strongest regions follow a bruising in the April election. The DP had hoped to hold the balance of power in the 42 member Western Cape provincial legislature but in the end only managed to get three seats. This led to the resignation of party leader Zach de Beer and the election of the controversial Tony Leon as interim leader. It now risks being obliterated in Cape town and Durban when municipal elections take place in a year's time. "Its white support base is eroding and they haven't even started making inroads into areas where most people live," notes one observer. In KwaZulu/Natal the unhappiness about the election of Moorcroft as the single DP senator for the province has led to rumours that the "old boys club" was in action again. It is suggested that Moorcroft has suffered financial losses through investments in the Lloyds insurance company and that he had the active help of DP federal chairman Ken Andrew -- who lost money in the same way -- to be elected into his position in order to bail him out. Andrew and Moorcroft are known to be close friends. Andrew denied he took part in any "concerted effort" to get Moorcroft elected. He insisted Moorcroft was chosen on merit, but admitted that it was he who had suggested to Moorcroft that he made himself available as Natal senator. He said though it was true that both Moorcroft and he had lost money in Lloyds -- and that there may be a "fair" overlap in the agencies handling their affairs -- neither was in financial trouble.
