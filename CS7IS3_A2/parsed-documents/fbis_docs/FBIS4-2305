Tse Kwong-wang, 45, suffered head and eye injuries after he was punched by two men, both in their mid-20s, on a footbridge in Fung Tak Estate at about 1.45 pm. Mr Tse said he did not know the attackers and had no idea why he was beaten. Robbery appears not to have been the motive because the men made no effort to take anything from him. Police could not say whether the attack was politically motivated, but it was the second incident over the past two months involving Mr Lau. Two months ago ink was thrown over the door of the office. Mr Tse, who is the United Democrats' Kowloon Central Branch head, mainly serves the Hunghom area, but has been helping Mr Lau in the afternoons for the past three months. Mr Tse and Mr Lau, both labour activists at the Christian Industrial Committee, have known each other for 20 years. Mr Tse was recommended by Mr Lau to join the United Democrats several years ago and has recently taken part in protests against increases in rates and bus fares. "I am really puzzled. I do not think it is related to my community work," said Mr Tse, a part-time taxi driver. "I keep quite a low profile and concentrate on improving people's livelihoods. I cannot think of any recent disputes at all. "The men did not say a word. They suddenly approached me and punched me. Then they went away, without saying anything." He said he would not be frightened off and would continue working for Mr Lau and the party. Mr Lau last night said he was sorry bout the attack. "I hope it is not something to do with his political background. People should voice their views peacefully," he said.
