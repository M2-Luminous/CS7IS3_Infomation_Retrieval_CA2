Pecanac: "Against the Originators of the Conflict"] [Text] The first convention of the Republican Party was held in the crowded Congress Hall of the Holiday Inn Hotel in Sarajevo. Explaining the main program aims of the newly-founded, civilian-oriented party, its founder Stjepan Kljuic remarked that the Republican Party would soon join all the patriotic forces in Bosnia- Herzegovina in mobilization and the preparations for the final liberation of the homeland. The engagement of the Republican Party should be viewed in this context; the party does not intend to oppose the current authorities, but it will oppose all those who are against Bosnia-Herzegovina and cooperate with all those who support Bosnia-Herzegovina. We hope that the West will go back to international law and that it will not allow Europe to be Balkanized and the ethnic occupation rewarded, said Kljuic. The conflict with the Croats, which was a mistake in Croatian policies toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, is also to blame for the tragic fate of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, according to Kljuic, the Republicans will strongly oppose the attempts to appoint some of the people who participated in the politics that led to the conflict and the victims of war in the new federal authorities. The Republican Party sees the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina in being oriented toward the West and its fundamental democratic values, as well as toward the Islamic countries. Remarking that the establishment of an independent, sovereign, and integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is the basis of the future activities of the party, Kljuic said that it is in such Bosnia- Herzegovina that the Republican Party will support the establishment of the economic system on the basis of private ownership, market economy, ethnic and religious freedom, civil freedom, human rights, independent judiciary, and all other democratic achievements contained in the UN Charter. Moreover, Kljuic said that the party would become involved in actualizing the return of the refugees and displaced persons in the country, without which there will be no peace on these territories. Welcoming the founding of another party in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mirsad Ceman, head secretary of the SDA [Party of Democratic Action] remarked that the success of the founding of this party would depend on the extent to which the ideas represented by the Republican Party will extend beyond the borders that are at present controlled by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Support for the forming of the Republican Party was expressed by Mirsad Ceman on behalf of the SDA, Nijaz Durakovic, president of the Social Democratic Party, Salih Foco of the LBO [expansion unknown], Ilija Simic on behalf of the HSS [Croatian Peasants' Party], Sejfudin Tokic of the Union of Social Democrats of Bosnia- Herzegovina, and Dragutin Cicak, president of the Croat Civil Party. Stjepan Kljuic was elected president of the Republican Party, and the members of the Directorate are: Dr. Adnan Dizdar, Dr. Boris Tihi, Zaim Zeljkovic, Dr. Slobodan Trninic, and Senka Nozica. In the following six months, the Republican Party will be working on bringing the organization to life, and soon they will promote their program in all the major towns in the Republic.
