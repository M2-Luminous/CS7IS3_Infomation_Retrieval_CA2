The meeting is that of the political affairs group of the preliminary working committee for the preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which operates under the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress. According to the group, the People's Republic of China, in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997; the British Government will also return Hong Kong to China on the same day. This means that British rule over Hong Kong is based on two constitutional documents as legal grounds until June 30, 1997, when the rule of the British Government over Hong Kong will be ended. That is to say, the British Government rules Hong Kong through a political structure composed of the Legislative Council, municipal councils and district boards, which embody British power. However, with the termination of British rule over Hong Kong in 1997, the two constitutional documents will become null and void, marking the end of the British Hong Kong political structure. British rule over Hong Kong can neither be extended beyond the date of June 30, 1997, nor can it be allowed to make any decisions to let the existing political structure do so. Otherwise, it will be considered to have overstepped its power, and the principle of sovereignty stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law will be meaningless. As a result, the term of the last three-tier political structure of the British Hong Kong Government has to be terminated on June 30, 1997. And the four-year term of the structure as set out in current British Government documents obviously contravenes the principles of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Therefore, it is invalid. This is an inevitable outcome of the British handover of Hong Kong to China and of China's resumption of the sovereignty of Hong Kong. The termination is also the duty of the British Government and the right of the Chinese Government as stipulated in the Joint Declaration. The group explained that the first legislative body and districts organizations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which will be established after July 1, 1997, will be different in nature from the political structure of the present Hong Kong Government. They will by no means be a "complete copy" of the old British Hong Kong political structure, but one that will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a regional administration under the Chinese Government. They will be organized in accordance with the Basic Law and relevant decisions of the National People's Congress, and be run by local Hong Kong residents. The Chinese Government had hoped to make an arrangement through Sino-British negotiations to extend the term of service of the British Hong Kong Legislative Council members, in a bid to achieve a smooth transition. Unfortunately, no agreement was reached during the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections in the territory, and the conditions for the council members to extend their service beyond June 30, 1997, no longer exist. It should be pointed out that the two legislative institutions different in nature cannot be lumped together, even if there had been agreement reached between the two sides. It is because of the different legal grounds that decide the different natures of the two legislative bodies. As the component parts of the political structure, the district boards and two municipal councils are closely connected to administrative power of the British Hong Kong Government. Therefore, they must also be abolished on June 30, 1997, just like the Legislative Council, the group concluded.
