Police tried to prevent the protesters from alighting from buses with their traditional weapons, although many had assembled on the field brandishing sticks and knobkerries in defiance of emergency regulations. Police spokesman Maj Margaret Kruger said organisers had attempted to obtain permission for marchers to carry the weapons, but this had been refused by police headquarters in Pretoria. "They don't have permission to carry weapons. We are trying to get the IFP leadership to get them together," she said, adding that police would request marchers to leave their weapons on the buses. She said police did not want to provoke the crowd. "We will see how the situation develops." There was a strong police and defence force presence along the march route and organisers said they expected thousands more supporters to arrive later. The atmosphere was cordial at 10.30AM in spite of a few protestations by marchers when police searched them as they alighted from buses.
