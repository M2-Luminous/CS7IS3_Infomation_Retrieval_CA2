FR940830-0-00046 FR940830-0-00009 Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866 The rule below would generally maintain the existing procedural and reporting requirements for the majority of obligated facilities, but significantly lessen them for certain private, nonprofit or public facilities. The Department has determined that the impact would not approach the annual $100 million threshold for major economic consequences as defined in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required. Consistent with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Secretary certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 This final rule contains information collections which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and assigned control # 0915&hyph;0171. The underlying purpose of this rule is to decrease recordkeeping, reporting, and notification burden for the charitable facilities. Facilities certified under the charitable facility compliance alternative will no longer be required to maintain extensive records on uncompensated services (124.510(a)), but instead will have to maintain only records which document its eligibility for the compliance alternative (124.510(b)). We believe this recordkeeping requirement imposes no additional burden because these documents are ordinarily retained by facilities. This change is expected to reduce the recordkeeping burden by 75 hours per facility per year. Similarly, reporting burden will be reduced. Charitable facilities will be required to apply once for the certification (124.516(c)), and thereafter will need only to certify their continued eligibility annually (124.509(b)). Currently, facilities in deficit status, which include most of the charitable facilities, must file a report each year which documents the amount of uncompensated care provided (124.509(a)). This change in reporting requirements is expected to reduce the reporting burden by 6 hours per facility in the first year, and by 13.5 hours per facility in subsequent years. Finally, notification/disclosure burden will be eliminated, because the facilities will no longer be required to: (1) Publish a notice each year of the availability of uncompensated services (124.504(a)); (2) provide individual written notices to each person seeking service in the facility (124.504(c)); or (3) provide a determination of eligibility to each person applying for uncompensated services (124.507). These changes are expected to reduce the notification burden by 380 hours per facility per year. All sections of the regulations that contain reporting, recordkeeping, or notification/disclosure requirements have been approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (OMB) # 0915&hyph;0077 and # 0915&hyph;0171. The title, description, and respondent description of the information collections are shown below with an estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The addition of the requirement for ``other documents'' in ยง124.516(c)(1) will not affect the burden because the other documents are expected to be readily available materials. The estimate of 150 applicants was based on a review, prior to development of the NPRM, of data on the kinds of facilities expected to qualify for the alternative. A recent re-review of the list of facilities indicated that 30 of the facilities have completed their obligations. With the addition of public facilities in the qualifying criteria, we expect approximately 30 additional facilities to apply for certification. Title: Charitable Facility Compliance Alternative (42 CFR part 124 subpart F). Description: Information will be collected from facilities requesting certification under the compliance alternative for the purpose of determining whether the required criteria for qualification have been met. Description of Respondents: Public and private non-profit institutions.
