White and green paint was sprayed on the walls of Nippon Motorola Ltd., the Japanese subsidiary of Motorola in central Tokyo, to create slogans such as "(We Are) Against America" and "(We'll) Crush the Hard-Selling Diplomacy of U.S. Imperialists." The graffiti covered an area of two meters by 1.4 meters. An unidentified man called the Tokyo media around 4 A.M., saying the Motorola building has been defaced. The United States said last week it would impose sanctions against Japan by raising tariffs in a dispute over Motorola's access to the cellular phone market in Japan. Washington accused Japan of breaching a 1989 trade accord meant to boost imports of U.S. cellular phones and said it will retaliate by raising tariffs on Japanese telecommunications products and possible other products.
