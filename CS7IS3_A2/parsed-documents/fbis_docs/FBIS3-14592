He made the remark at the opening of a fund-raising campaign at the Tel Aviv Museum. Our correspondent Eyal Eisenstein reports: [Begin recording] [Eisenstein] The stabbing in Petah Tiqva was nationalistic in nature. It is an inseparable part of the overall current situation, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said today. More people will be hurt and murdered, Peres said, if we do not bring about a basic change in the situation. [Peres] This is yet another terrible bloody incident, part of the current situation. I do not believe that the incidents, the stabbings, the killings, can be stopped without basically changing the situation. Courage is needed to see things as they are, to see their roots, and to reach the necessary conclusions. [Eisenstein] Regarding the impact of last night's incidents in Jabalyah on the political process, Peres said that the killing of the six members of the Fatah Hawks will make the talks very difficult, but they will open today and continue. Peres added that he is certain the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers who killed the Gazans had no malicious intentions and acted responsibly. We are only clever after the fact, the foreign minister said. [Peres] Primarily, I have every respect for the soldiers who serve under impossible conditions. I believe that we should offer the Army a political solution before we pass judgment on their military performance. [end recording]
