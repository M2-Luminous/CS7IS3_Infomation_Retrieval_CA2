During an interview with the TELAM news agency, the Chilean official also made it clear that Chile is not seeking to join NAFTA, an objective he considered "very difficult to achieve." Insulza, who is making a two-day official visit to Argentina, drew a distinction between integration and free trade. He stated that "integration is a much more complex concept; it entails trade, investments, strategic alliances between companies. We have assumed a commitment along these lines with our neighbors, and especially with Mercosur member countries." "With the United States, by contrast, we are seeking to sign a trade agreement that will secure us markets in that country, but we are not interested in furthering an integration process with NAFTA or with North American countries because it would be very difficult for us from a geographic standpoint." Insulza is participating in the quarterly follow-up meetings to the economic complementation agreements signed between Argentina and Chile in 1991. "We want to sign a free trade agreement with the United States, but this is within the sphere of trade and investment," he noted. The official said his country intends to sign free trade agreements "with countries in the farthest corners of the world, and not only the United States. If tomorrow the EC or Japan, one of our most important export markets, offer us an agreement, we will sign it enthusiastically." Chile has recently proposed a limited integration with Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), a regional project that will have its debut as a common market on 1 January 1995. That scheme was defined as "four plus one" by Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano. Chile is reluctant to join the initiative as a full member due to the different customs tariffs in effect. Insulza said: "There are two aspects or obstacles that appear today to be insurmountable." On the one hand we have "the tariff structure that is expected to enter into effect as of 1995, which is not compatible with Chile's tariff system. The other obstacle is related to a Mercosur principle to negotiate with others as a bloc, while Chile prefers to do its own business," Insulza concluded.
