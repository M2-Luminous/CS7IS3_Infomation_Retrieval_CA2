In my opinion, the concern of Imamali Rahkmanov, the head of state, which is described in his letter is clear to everyone, said Shukur Zuhurov, the minister of labor and employment, in his interview to a KHOVAR news agency correspondent. According to our available information more than 30,000 of our compatriots who have had to flee their places of residence are in the territories of neighboring Afghanistan. It should be said that the present situation in Afghanistan is very complicated. The armed clashes between the different political forces are continuing here. These clashes are taking place in those areas where the Tajik refugees live. That is why their situation is very difficult. In addition to this, the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border is not calm. Is it possible to return home in such a situation? That is why I think that Imamali Rakhmanov has sent the letter to the UN secretary general at the right time. The authority of the United Nations is high all over the world. And we hope that thanks to the active assistance of this organization the bloodshed will be stopped in Afghanistan and the return of the Tajik refugees will be possible.
