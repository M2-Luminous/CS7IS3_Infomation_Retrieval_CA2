The new Honduran president talked about his firm commitment in favor of a moral revolution, and he spoke about his determination to fight corruption and impunity. He also outlined the basic principles of the new Honduran Government, such as austerity, honesty, and integrity, and the decision to initiate a great crusade against poverty. The multitude that gathered at the stadium in Honduras -- the people of our sister nation -- showed their friendliness to the Guatemalan president with an enthusiastic ovation at his entrance and departure. This afternoon, President de Leon Carpio returned from Tegucigalpa very grateful for the expressions of affection and solidarity he received from the Honduran people and government. The changeover of presidents in a democratic manner in our region is one of the most important factors to gradually consolidating the process of integration in Central America. In Honduras, the president also had the opportunity to meet with several heads of state and government representatives from friendly nations who expressed their support for the efforts conducted by the Guatemalan people in favor of democracy. The U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs met this morning with President de Leon Carpio in Tegucigalpa, and he expressed the firm support from the government of President Bill Clinton for the aspirations of peace, development, and democracy in Guatemala. He received the same expressions of support from the prime minister of the Republic of China, Venezuelan officials, and from the Spanish justice minister. The entire international community is supporting the achievements made in Guatemala to consolidate the government within the framework of legality. Therefore, upon returning to Guatemala and learning about the unfortunate incidents, particularly about the cowardly actions carried out by terrorist groups trying to create unrest among the Guatemalan people, the president condemned these actions. He also noted that both our people and the people of the world condemn these actions, because they represent an attack against democracy. The Guatemalan president is a man who respects the laws and Constitution. Therefore, he immediately issued instructions to the state security agencies to fight terrorist groups according to the law. Nevertheless, President de Leon feels the best way to counter those who are acting against democracy is by working together -- the people and the government -- and report those who are planting the bombs. The sense of awareness and repudiation of terrorism is very high. Thanks to the cooperation of many people of goodwill, we have managed to deactivate several bombs. As a democratic president, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio is issuing a call to all of the people of Guatemala to defend the institutions and to reject provocations by those who, while hiding behind anonymity, are trying to make the country return to the sad disgraceful days of abuse against fundamental rights. The truth is that people no longer want to return to the past. Guatemalans want to live in peace, and therefore they reject violence. The president was very sad to learn about the victims of the terrorist actions. All of this must come to an end in Guatemala. The president has instructed the civilian forces, with the Army's support, to reinforce all measures to ensure every citizen's safety. The government will act firmly, yet within the Constitution's framework. The president of the Republic also wants to take this opportunity to congratulate the state workers for their profound common sense in ignoring the leaders' unauthorized call to declare a general strike in the public administration. The state workers did not comply with the agitators and kept on working as normal. This shows we are maturing. The Guatemalan people want peace. All Guatemalans reject the attempts to destabilize the country. Finally, the president of the Republic appeals to the people who are being used to plant terrorist bombs. The president wants to tell them they are causing great damage. They have left a trail of victims and damage. Power outages have irritated the population. Also, the damage caused on the electric infrastructure is considerable. The terrorists are hurting the people. This is why the people reject them. The president hereby asks the Guatemalan people to turn a deaf ear on reports of bridges being blown up and bombs being planted. He also asks bus and truck drivers to be sensible, to keep talking with the government delegates, and to forget the idea of striking next week. The possibility of reaching an agreement through talks should be explored to its fullest. He also asks the Guatemalan people to remain firm and move the country forward. The only way to rebuild a Guatemala with social justice is with the Constitution and democracy. Thank you.
