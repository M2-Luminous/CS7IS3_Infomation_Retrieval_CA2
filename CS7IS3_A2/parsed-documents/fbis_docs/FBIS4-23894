A report from Kigali, which is consistent on some points with the current state of the investigation being carried out in Belgium by the military prosecutor's office and which is consistent with other information in our possession, asserts that the plane carrying President Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, his Burundian counterpart, was shot down by two French soldiers from the DAMI [Military Training Assistance Detachment], serving the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic]. The CDR are the extremists of "Hutu power" accused of having spearheaded the subsequent massacres. It was French soldiers from the DAMI who remained in Kigali until last December, before being replaced by the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] Blue Helmets which include 450 Belgian paratroopers. However, some DAMI members were seen in Kigali again in February. The report states that these two French soldiers put on Belgian uniforms to leave the area and were seen by two soldiers of the National Guard. Hence the official accusation, reiterated by the Rwandans, against the UNAMIR Belgians who were present at the airport. Only four CDR officials were informed of this plot against President Habyarimana's plane. This report is consistent with other information, gathered in Rwanda during the withdrawal of expatriates and in Brussels where the investigation of the military prosecutor's office, opened after the death of 10 Belgian paratroopers, is being continued. It now seems almost certain that the plane was shot down by a portable missile, probably a Soviet-made SAM of the Strela series. Such weapons are not rare in Africa, they are found in Uganda, but also in Angola, and others, from Eastern Europe, have been sold on the private market. However, all the Belgian and foreign aid workers and observers think there is no question that the two rockets which downed the plane could have been the work of Rwandan soldiers: They have never been trained in that kind of exercise. The hypothesis most frequently cited so far was that of unidentified "mercenaries." It also seems, and we were confirmed this on the spot, that the fire came from a place called "Massaka," which is situated behind the Kanombe military camp, where the Presidential Guard was posted. In the three days which followed the attack, all possible witnesses were liquidated. More than 3,000 people were thus eliminated in the area around Massaka by the Rwandan paratroopers from Kanombe camp. How could the perpetrators of the missile fire have procured Belgian paratrooper uniforms? As easily as anything, apparently: The Belgian Blue Helmets were in the habit of giving their laundry to the Hotel Meridien and they were often surprised to find that pieces of their uniform were disappearing. Other indications seem worrying to the investigators, for instance the fact that when the plane from Dar es Salaam was approaching Kigali, the control tower several times asked who was on board the plane, notably finding out about the presence of the Burundian president. However, it must be pointed out that the airplane crew was French and that Major Jacky Heraud, Colonel Jean-Pierre Minaberry, and Chief Warrant Officer Jean-Marie Perrinne, the mechanic on board, perished alongside the two heads of state and their fellow passengers. This possible involvement by two French soldiers in the attack on [former] President Habyarimana's plane raises essential questions: In what framework did they act? Did they operate as mercenaries? What was the motive for such an act, which launched the killings, plunging Rwanda into an unprecedented tragedy? Given the present information, it is virtually certain that the Rwandan president, who was under strong pressure to accept the Arusha agreements, had finally given way during the meeting held in Dar es Salaam by President Mwinyi, Tanzanian "mediator," and was preparing to deliver a speech on radio on his return to Kigali, announcing the formation of a broadly based transitional government, including five Patriotic Front ministers. This implementation of the Arusha agreements, making provision for power sharing, annoyed the regime's "hardliners" who had long planned [former] President Habyarimana's elimination if he showed weakness. There have also been questions about the extent to which the president's family, and more especially his in-laws, were informed of these plans by the extremists. The report we have received from Kigali states that the president's family was not informed.
