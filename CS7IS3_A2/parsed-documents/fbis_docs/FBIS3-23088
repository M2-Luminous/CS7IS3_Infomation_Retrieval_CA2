They were charged with forming a secret organization with the objective of toppling the government by using the position of the mayor supported by a number of other members of the council who belong to the Labor Party to conduct secret activities and to use the summer resort of Ra's al-Barr [name as published, presumably Ra's al-Bahr], which is now empty, for their organization's training, lectures, and other instruction. The security men noticed some suspect activities by some youths known for their extremist tendencies. By observing them, it became evident that they were forming a secret organization and that the mayor was abusing his office to support the organization. [passage omitted]
