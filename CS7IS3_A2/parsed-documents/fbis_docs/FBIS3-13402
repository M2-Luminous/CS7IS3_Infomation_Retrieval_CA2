And it seems that what the enemy has broadcast about the killing of two PFLP-GC elements and capturing two others is part of the same series of lies and deception. We, the PFLP-GC, are interested in exposing the Zionist enemy's lies. We have not lost a single martyr in the aforementioned operation and none of our strugglers has been captured. [Signed] The PFLP-GC
