FBIS4-35670 "drnes106_s_94010" FBIS-NES-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 Iran Information Minister on Arrests in Tehran Bombing Information Minister on Arrests in Tehran Bombing LD0106220094 Tehran IRNA in English 1323 GMT 1 Jun 94 LD0106220094 Tehran IRNA English BFN [Text] Tehran, June 1, IRNA -- Minister of Information Hojjat-ol-Eslam 'Ali Fallahiyan said here today that security forces had identified and arrested the elements behind the recent bombing in Tehran. Speaking at a press conference, he said Iraqi intelligence agents were directly involved in the bombing and two Iraqi officers, Abdul-Amir 'Ali and Raad Mostafa Fattah have been arrested who have admitted their terrorist actions. He said the Iraqi regime has directly assigned its intelligence officers to plant bombs in Iranian large cities since last February after being disappointed with its internal agents in Iran. Hojjat-ol-Eslam Fallahiyan said that Iraqi intelligence officers had carried 22 bombs, mostly magnetic into Iran, adding that 14 bombs had been seized by police. He said the terrorists exploded 4 bombs in the streets and investigations are underway to detect the others. Evidences indicate that the terrorists may have destroyed the other four bombs, he said. Six internal elements nammed Shakour Rostami, Havas Azizi, Ali Behruzi, Ahmad Asghari, Davoud Jaafar and Nejad Faissal who were in contact with the Iraqi intelligence officers are now under arrest and have confessed to their charges. The information minister showed a video-tape to reporters showing the confessions of the Iraqi intelligence officers and their internal elements in Iran. On Iraq's objectives behind the terrorist actions, Fallahiyan said the Iraqi regime and the counterrevolutionary grouplets were trying to carry out explosions in Iran and attribute them to internal issues and pretend that the people were against the ruling system. Asked about the Iranians living abroad, he said, "We welcome the return of our fellow-countrymen, but there is no compulsion in this regard." The majority of those who live abroad have no special problem and travel freely, but, he said, those who have legal problems should refer to the judiciary. About Saeedi Sirjani (a writer), he said he had been arrested for addiction and drug smuggling, but further inve stigations showed that he had cooperation with Savak (former regime's secret police). He has been a drug addict for a long time, so it is natural that the addiction would lead him to some ethical weaknesses. Saeedi Sirjani has had links with the western intelligence services as well and the matter will be disclosed after completion of the investigations, he said. About the bugging of the Iranian embassy in London by the intelligence service of the United Kingdom, he said the information ministry had already received reports on the issue which was announced after official confirmation. He said all the dimensions of the bugging of the Iranian embassy in London had not been disclosed yet due to security reasons. He regretted that the UK government regarded the blatant violation of the international law in the embassy case as a matter of normalcy. Asked about Iran-Turkey security relations, and the propaganda campaign of Turkish media on the alleged Iranian interference in internal affairs of that country, he said contacts between the officials of the two countries showed that Iran has not intervened in their domestice affairs and will not do so.
