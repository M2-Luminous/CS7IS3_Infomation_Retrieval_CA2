FR940810-0-00285 FR940810-0-00021 Class III asbestos work means repair and maintenance operations, where ``ACM'', including thermal system insulation and surfacing material, is likely to be disturbed. Class IV asbestos work means maintenance and custodial activities during which employees contact ACM and PACM and activities to clean up waste and debris containing ACM and PACM. Clean room means an uncontaminated room having facilities for the storage of employees' street clothing and uncontaminated materials and equipment. Closely resemble means that the major workplace conditions which have contributed to the levels of historic asbestos exposure, are no more protective than conditions of the current workplace. Competent person means, in addition to the definition in 29 CFR 1926.32 (f), one who is capable of identifying existing asbestos hazards in the workplace and selecting the appropriate control strategy for asbestos exposure, who has the authority to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate them, as specified in 29 CFR 1926.32(f): in addition, for Class I and Class II work who is specially trained in a training course which meet the criteria of EPA's Model Accreditation Plan (40 CFR 763) for project designer or supervisor, or its equivalent and, for Class II and Class IV work, who is trained in an operations and maintenance (O&M) course developed by EPA [40 CFR 763.92 (a)(2)]. Critical barrier means one or more layers of plastic sealed over all openings into a work area or any other similarly placed physical barrier sufficient to prevent airborne asbestos in a work area from migrating to an adjacent area. Decontamination area means an enclosed area adjacent and connected to the regulated area and consisting of an equipment room, shower area, and clean room, which is used for the decontamination of workers, materials, and equipment that are contaminated with asbestos. Demolition means the wrecking or taking out of any load-supporting structural member and any related razing, removing, or stripping of asbestos products. Director means the Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or designee. Disturbance means contact which releases fibers from ACM or PACM or debris containing ACM or PACM. This term includes activities that disrupt the matrix of ACM or PACM, render ACM or PACM friable, or generate visible debris. Disturbance includes cutting away small amounts of ACM and PACM, no greater than the amount which can be contained in one standard sized glove bag or waste bag in order to access a building component. In no event shall the amount of ACM or PACM so disturbed exceed that which can be contained in one glove bag or waste bag which shall not exceed 60 inches in length and width. Employee exposure means that exposure to airborne asbestos that would occur if the employee were not using respiratory protective equipment. Equipment room ( change room ) means a contaminated room located within the decontamination area that is supplied with impermeable bags or containers for the disposal of contaminated protective clothing and equipment. Fiber means a particulate form of asbestos, 5 micrometers or longer, with a length-to-diameter ratio of at least 3 to 1. Glovebag means an impervious plastic bag-like enclosure affixed around an asbestos-containing material, with glove-like appendages through which material and tools may be handled. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter means a filter capable of trapping and retaining at least 99.97 percent of all mono-dispersed particles of 0.3 micrometers in diameter. Homogeneous area means an area of surfacing material or thermal system insulation that is uniform in color and texture. Industrial hygienist means a professional qualified by education, training, and experience to anticipate, recognize, evaluate and develop controls for occupational health hazards. Intact means that the ACM has not crumbled, been pulverized, or otherwise deteriorated so that it is no longer likely to be bound with its matrix. Modification for purposes of paragraph (g)(6)(ii), means a changed or altered procedure, material or component of a control system, which replaces a procedure, material or component of a required system. Omitting a procedure or component, or reducing or diminishing the stringency or strength of a material or component of the control system is not a ``modification'' for purposes of paragraph (g)(6)(ii) of this section. Negative Initial Exposure Assessment means a demonstration by the employer, which complies with the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, that employee exposure during an operation is expected to be consistently below the PELs. PACM means ``presumed asbestos containing material''. Presumed Asbestos Containing Material means thermal system insulation and surfacing material found in buildings constructed no later than 1980. The designation of a material as ``PACM'' may be rebutted pursuant to paragraph (k)(4) of this section. Project Designer means a person who has successfully completed the training requirements for an abatement project designer established by 40 U.S.C. ยง763.90(g). Regulated area means: an area established by the employer to demarcate areas where Class I, II, and III asbestos work is conducted, and any adjoining area where debris and waste from such asbestos work accumulate; and a work area within which airborne concentrations of asbestos, exceed or there is a reasonable possibility they may exceed the permissible exposure limit. Requirements for regulated areas are set out in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. Removal means all operations where ACM and/or PACM is taken out or stripped from structures or substrates, and includes demolition operations.
