Until yesterday, he was preparing the ammunition for Umberto Bossi to fire. Today Miglio prepared another round of ammunition, but this time it was aimed at the leader of the Northern League and what powerful ammunition it was. Miglio said Bossi was a liar when he told judges the 200 million lire which the Northern League had received from Montedison was subsequently stolen. Miglio said this version of events was not true; instead, the money had ended up in the coffers of the party. Miglio added that the money was only an advance, and that the League's bosses believed that they would get more money. Miglio maintains that the League received money from a number of sources. The League's Francesco Speroni said that the allegations were inferences, and Roberto Maroni added that the allegations were the product of bitterness. However, Miglio had plenty more revelations. He said that Bossi was preparing to form a secessionist movement and that he would try and get Silvio Berlusconi in trouble. Miglio said he did not like the Freedom Alliance government, but he said he would vote for the confidence motion.

He said that Miglio was a poor man who was bitter because he had not been made a minister, but that nevertheless he would go to see him soon. [end Tolfa recording]
