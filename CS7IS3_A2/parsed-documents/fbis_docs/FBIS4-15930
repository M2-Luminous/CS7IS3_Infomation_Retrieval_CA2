In turn the International Airline Passengers Association [IAPA], whose headquarters is in Washington, warned of the risk to life to which citizens from Western countries are exposing themselves by flying on our aircraft over Russia. It also called the territory of the former Soviet Union one of the two most dangerous areas in the world for air passengers. I would also point out that many French firms are confidentially banning their staff from flying Aeroflot on business from Paris to Moscow, never mind using our domestic routes. The Swiss newspaper LE NOUVEAU QUOTIDIEN recently published a report eloquently headlined: "Aeroflot Passenger Plays `Russian Roulette.'" Russian aircraft are in a disastrous state, the author writes. Airports are like hostile jungles. No one is responsible for them any more -- or for passengers. The journalist sees the "crazy privatization" of the air sector as the main reason for the prevailing unimaginable chaos. At the same time as Bart Bakker's visit to Moscow, IAPA published a new report painting a gloomy picture of the situation in CIS countries' civil aviation. "We are extremely concerned by the state of affairs in Russia," IAPA Director David Stempler said in an interview with THE EUROPEAN. "Our report cites specific examples and gives advice to travelers. Russian airline safety is rapidly deteriorating. It will not come as a surprise to anyone if Russia shortly descends to China's level in this respect."
