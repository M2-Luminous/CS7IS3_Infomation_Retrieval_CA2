These transactions involved the purchase of $2.8 billion in securities to be used as collateral for the agreement with creditor banks. According to Cardoso, the absolute secrecy with which the transactions were made was due to the need to "protect the country from speculators." Malan, who suggested the securities' purchase to Cardoso, explained to senators that the government deemed it advisable to hedge against a possible U.S. Treasury refusal to place a special issue of securities for Brazil on the market -- which was what indeed occurred. The Senate -- which is co-responsible for negotiating the rescheduling of Brazil's external debt -- was not notified of the transactions made by the BC on the secondary international markets. According to Cardoso, only himself, Malan, and BC Foreign Area Director Gustavo Franco knew about the "hedge" [preceding word in English] (protection) strategy. The minister neither said nor was asked whether President Itamar Franco was informed about the collateral's secret purchase. Cardoso authorized the BC to purchase collateral last October or November on the condition that the securities constituted a good deal regardless of their possible use in the debt-rescheduling agreement. A source close to the BC reported that the 30-year-maturity U.S. T-bills that were purchased had been on the market for some time. Senators voiced distrust about this event until 23 March. Senator Espiridiano Amin (PPR-SC) [Progressive Renewal Party-Santa Catarina] went as far as accusing Cardoso of using the debt-rescheduling agreement for electoral purposes. On 24 March, however, the atmosphere was calm again and all the members of Congress questioned endorsed Cardoso's decision not to disclose details about the transactions -- cost and interest rate -- before reaching an agreement with creditor banks on 15 April. According to Senator Jose Focaga (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], rapporteur of Resolution No. 96 that ratified the agreement's terms, the T-bills' secret purchase does not harm the Senate's guidance. Malan believes the agreement approved by senators did not entail the U.S. Treasury's special issue. Malan termed "pure speculation" estimates to the effect that the BC had to pay between $60 million and $80 million more for the collateral as a result of purchasing it directly on the market. According to Malan, speculators were not able to detect the BC action in time. In any case, Malan considered it much more important that the BC strategy enabled working out an agreement with creditor banks. Malan made it clear that the U.S. Treasury will not issue T-bills especially for Brazil unless the latter reaches an agreement with the IMF.
