He added that no more than 10 percent of the required resources are available to the security forces. Despite all this, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- before his departure from Tunis, returning to his work in Gaza, after submitting a comprehensive report to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat about the security situation in the self-rule areas -- that the security situation is good so far and that the continuation of this situation depends on good performance, the presence of institutions, and laying foundations for democracy and political pluralism. He stressed that democracy constitutes "the most important factor for security, political, and economic stability." Maj. Gen. Yusuf pointed out that the "more marked problems facing the Palestinian police are basically the result of the spread of starvation in the Gaza Strip. This has led to the spread of the phenomenon of gangs specializing in illegal trade like hashish, heroin, cocain, and arms." Asked about the presence of large numbers of Palestinians in Palestinian jails, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that there are attempts by some quarters to exaggerate the number of Palestinian prisoners. He stressed that the real figure does not exceed 20. It "is not a large number," and most of the charges raised against them are associated with drugs, arms trading, and collaboration with Israel. Maj. Gen. Yusuf categorically denied some quarters' rumors that these prisoners are subjected to torture and repression. He said that "all that has been said in this connection is untrue." He invited observers and those interested in human rights to visit Hamas member Hani al-'Abid, who was released recently, to ascertain whether or not he was tortured. He stressed that al-'Abid "was exposed to nothing that harms his dignity or humanity." On the extent of Hamas followers' cooperation with the Palestinian police, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said that "so far we can say that it is possible to have cooperation between us and Hamas in the future." Asked about the truth of the accusations leveled at the Palestinian police regarding its violation of mosques' sanctity and harassment of worshipers, Maj. Yusuf said: "We have not closed mosques nor prevented any worshiper from performing his religious duty. Mosques are open day and night, and we have not issued any instructions to do anything at any mosque. There is a campaign against us from forces that do not want stability for our people and are working to instigate Palestinian infighting and thwart the self-rule experiment." With regard to the issue of collecting the arms from people and the Palestinian factions rejecting self-rule, he said: "We have not requested the collection of arms, but, rather, the control, licensing, and organization of the possession of arms. So all citizens are required to seek a license for their arms, because we, like any society in the world, can possess arms, but within an organized framework lest the arms are used in an unsound manner. So we are not talking about collecting arms, but controlling them. As for the factions' arms, we have not requested them to hand over their arms. We have requested that [the possession of] these arms be organized." On Israel's position on the Palestinians' and factions' possession of arms, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said: "It is an internal affair, because it concerns the organization of arms possession, and Israeli society is full of arms."
