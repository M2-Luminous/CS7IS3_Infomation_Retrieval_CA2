The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List.
