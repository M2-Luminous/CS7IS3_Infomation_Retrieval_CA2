The regulations noted that foreign people who enter China can bring with them religious printed matters, religious recordings and video tapes and other religious matters for their own uses. Materials which are more than for their own uses should be handled by Chinese customs offices according to relevant regulations. Entry of religious materials which have contents harmful to China's social public interests is banned.
