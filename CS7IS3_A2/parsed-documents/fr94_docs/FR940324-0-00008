FR940324-0-00008 FR940324-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service 8 CFR Part 212 [INS No. 1344&hyph;91; AG Order No. 1856&hyph;94] RIN 1115&hyph;AC90 Mariel Cuban Parole Determinations AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule clarifies and expands the discretionary authority of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the Service), under the Cuban Review Plan, to withdraw parole approval for excludable Mariel Cubans where circumstances make it impossible to execute the parole decision, and release of the detainee is contrary to the public interest. It further provides for flexibility in the scheduling of parole reviews in the case of a new or returning Mariel Cuban detainee whose previous immigration parole has been revoked. These changes are necessary to reduce administrative costs and to clarify the status of the detainee whose parole decision cannot be implemented. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 24, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joan Lieberman, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., room 6100, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;2895. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 7, 1991, a proposed rule to amend 8 CFR 212.12(e) and 212.12(g)(1), with request for public comments, was published in the Federal Register, at 56 FR 21100. The comment period expired on June 6, 1991. The Service received four comments, representing the views of an alien advocacy organization, a Federal Government agency, and private attorneys. The Service greatly appreciates these comments. Each comment has been considered and some aspects of the comments have been taken into account in this rule. This rule will revise and expand the discretionary authority of the Service under 8 CFR part 212 to withdraw parole approval previously authorized for excludable Mariel Cubans where circumstances warrant a reversal of the parole approval decision. The proposed changes amend the current regulation, which does not provide the cases where sponsorship is declined or appropriate sponsorship is unavailable. The amendments clarify the authority of the Associate Commissioner for Enforcement to withdraw parole of a detainee prior to release for any appropriate reason, not merely because of the detainee's conduct. Finally, the proposed changes will provide for greater flexibility in the parole review process for Mariel Cubans who are subject to repatriation.
