[These are not toll-free numbers.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 204(g) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1710(g)) empowers the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to delegate his or her authority to convey and to execute deeds of conveyance, deeds of release, assignments and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real or personal property or any interest therein acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the National Housing Act. These responsibilities were delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, with authority to redelegate, on June 18, 1976 at 41 FR 24755. In the past, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner has exercised his authority to redelegate these responsibilities. However, the most recent redelegation designates five individuals who are no longer available to carry out these duties. Therefore, it is necessary to supersede that redelegation, and to redelegate authority to new positions and individuals. In this redelegation and designation, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner lists the positions and individuals authorized to convey and execute certain deeds and other documents relating to real or personal property or any interest therein acquired pursuant to the National Housing Act. Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates as follows: Section A.

Swartzbaugh, each of whom is an attorney in the Office of the General Counsel. Section B.
