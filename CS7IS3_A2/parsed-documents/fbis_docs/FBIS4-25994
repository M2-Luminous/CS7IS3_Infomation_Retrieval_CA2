"China in principle doesn't subscribe to the involvement of the Security Council in the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula or resorting to sanctions to solving it," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told journalists when asked for China's view of the draft. "China believes that the only way to a proper solution is direct dialogue held between the parties concerned," Shen told a weekly news briefing, urging all sides to make every effort to ensure a return to talks rather than resorting to action that could lead to confrontation. "We believe there is still room and the possiblity for a proper solution to this issue," Shen said. The United States presented UN Security Council members Wednesday with the draft of a resolution calling for phased sanctions against North Korea after it this week pulled out of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). China, which has veto powers as a permanent member of the Security Council, has consistently opposed calls for sanctions against its communist ally. Despite reiterating this stance, Shen avoided questions on whether China would vote against the UN resolution or simply abstain. China has abstained, rather than use its veto power in past admonishments of Pyongyang's failure to live up to its commitment under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which it signed in 1985. Last week, China abstained from an IAEA vote to suspend technical assistance to North Korea in response to its refusal to allow inspectors access to its nuclear facilities. The spokesman said that, "we regret the action the IAEA took on June 10 and the consequences that action has already caused," warning of the dangers of further heightening tensions. "At the present time, none of the parties involved has evidence showing that North Korea has developed nuclear arms," the spokesman said. "Before this is clarified, it would not be advisable to take action that might lead to the intensification of the confrontation and even to the outbreak of war. It would be ridiculous that, before an atomic bomb is completed, a war has broken out. That would not be good for any of the sides," he said. Shen acknowledged that a 1961 agreement of friendship and mutual assistance between China and North Korea remained in force, but would not be drawn on whether the treaty obliged Beijing to give military assistance to its ally in case of war. "It is our hope that the parties concerned will chose not to talk about war but talk about ways of solving the nuclear issue," he said.
