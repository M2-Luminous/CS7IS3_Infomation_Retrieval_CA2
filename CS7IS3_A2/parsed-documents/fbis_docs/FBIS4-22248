What is his political program? [Dzhanashiya] Practically speaking, it is not realistic to talk about Ingushetia without touching upon the question of Prigorodnyy Rayon... [Aushev] We have stated in our constitution that the returning of land that was illegally seized from Ingushetia is state policy. And we intend to resolve this problem only by political means. Yes, today that part of Prigorodnyy Rayon where the Ingush used to live and from which they were deported is under the legal jurisdiction of North Ossetia. But I believe that, in the final analysis, we shall convince even the residents of North Ossetia themselves that it is impossible to live by taking what is needed. And when people say that the Ingush have territorial claims, that is untrue. The Ingush do not have any territorial claims against anyone. The Ingush say, "Return to us what was taken away in 1944." I feel that the Constitutional Court must say its weighty word about who is right and who is guilty. At least it can say whether the Ingush are right or are not right, whether their demands are just or unjust, and whether the question is being raised correctly or incorrectly. It is not just a matter of territory, but also of human rights. [Dzhanashiya] But let's be realists: the people in the Russian Ministry of Defense are mostly interested in allowing North Ossetia to keep Prigorodnyy Rayon. The strategic Military Georgian Road runs through part of Prigorodnyy Rayon. [Aushev] Then let them declare that the Military Georgian Road, by virtue of its strategic importance, is federal property. We do not reject that! [Dzhanashiya] Refugees are a serious destabilizing factor. With increasing frequency we hear voices saying that the republic leadership is incapable of resolving the problems of the Ingush nation... [Aushev] The reason why the conflict arose was to drag out the resolution of the territorial problem. And to "hang onto" it the problems of the refugees, the restoration of housing, the people who have vanished without a trace, etc., etc. The tasks were clearly formulated when the provocation was being prepared. [Dzhanashiya] You mentioned provocation... Who had an interest in that? [Aushev] (Laughter.) As they say in political language, "definite political forces."... In Moscow the opinion has developed that Prigorodnyy Rayon must be given back to the Ingush. In Vladikavkaz, people understood that this must somehow be disrupted. Two circumstances came together: Ossetia has to understand the Ingush, and the center has to understand Chechnya. It was hoped in the center that Chechnya would go to the assistance of the Ingush. And, consequently, the Chechen side could be accused of aggression and the "Chechen question" could be resolved by military means. However, Dzhokhar Dudayev make an official declaration of neutrality. [Dzhanashiya] The economic situation in the republic is catastrophic. Unemployment is fantastic... [Aushev] Yes, 56 percent of the able-bodied population are unemployed. Ingushetia has been fighting for survival during its entire history. So people have learned how to feed their family without governmental assistance. A year and a half after the formation of the Chechen Republic, everyone has forgotten about Ingushetia -- but we have survived. Currently the question of creating an economically favorable zone is being decided. Reform of agriculture has been begun. The land is rich and has high harvest yields. We have our own petroleum, and it is sufficient for us. It is necessary to engage in the development of the petroleum complex. To create small and medium-sized enterprises on the basis of the latest technologies. Small repair and processing shops, etc. Does anyone think that we will not feed 300,000 people? Of course we'll feed them! And we must keep on learning and learning. And use force to make anyone learn if he does not want to. We must send our young people absolutely everywhere -- to whatever countries, republics, regions -- just so that they can learn. To turn the republic into a republic. [Dzhanashiya] The traditional teyp (kinship clan) structure of society is preserved in Ingushetia. How do you view the reformation of that structure? [Aushev] I feel that in the teyps there is much that is good. Many people are disciplined by the fact that it is necessary to answer to their own and other teyps. Life itself will change the teyp system of Ingush society. Today many traditions are being broken. When a person becomes a private property owner, he will not need either a teyp or anything else. [Dzhanashiya] The Aushev teyp is a respected one, but not one of the traditionally first ones. Doesn't there arise a disbalance between your present position and the vanities of certain leaders of the traditionally strong teyps? [Aushev] Absolutely not. I have taken a stand above all teyps, above all my relatives: the president must be neutral. They themselves say, "You're not an Aushev. You're the president of Ingushetia." And I agree with that. [Dzhanashiya] The Ingush used to have one seat in the State Duma. In the election you supported Aleksandra Momdzhyan, an outsider and the wife of your friend General Ochirov... [Aushev] We based our decision on the fact that the Duma is elected for a two-year period. In this kind of situation there is no time to wait for someone to learn how to operate, to wait until a candidate becomes a deputy. Work of creating legislation is difficult and requires certain skills. Aleksandra is a well-known specialist and a doctor of sciences. As for her nationality, what difference does it make? I am happy that the Ingush have once again demonstrated their internationalism.
