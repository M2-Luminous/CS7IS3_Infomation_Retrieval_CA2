FR940318-0-00191 FR940318-0-00023 Because it represents one of the few available substitutes in specific end-uses, EPA is finding use of HBFC&hyph;22B1 acceptable as a streaming agent except for residential uses. However, it can only be considered a transitional agent, because it will be phased out as a class I substance beginning January 1, 1996, in accordance with the Clean Air Act and with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol. This agent was submitted to the Agency in a Premanufacture Notice (PMN) and is presently subject to requirements contained in a Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) section 5(e) Consent Order and associated Significant New Use Rule (40 CFR 721.1296). Under the terms of the Consent Order, it may be used only for outdoor automotive and marine applications. In addition, to ensure safe use, the sale of this product is restricted to a size discouraging residential use, with a minimum UL rating of 5BC. The unit must be properly labeled. The label must ban residential use, indicate space volume restrictions that would limit exposure to 1 percent, and describe proper evacuation and reentry requirements. In addition, the agent may only be sold in rechargeable units to encourage reuse and recycling and to minimize the potential for the agent to escape to the atmosphere through improper disposal. (b) (CFC Blend). (CFC Blend) is acceptable as a Halon 1211 substitute in non-residential applications. While this agent was listed in the SNAP NPRM as proposed acceptable, the sale and distribution of CFCs in pressurized dispensers (in this sector, portable fire extinguishers) are controlled under section 610 of the CAA. The section 610 final rulemaking (58 FR 4768, January 15, 1993) bans the use of CFCs in portable fire extinguishers. Therefore, in the upcoming proposed SNAP rulemaking, EPA will list this agent as proposed unacceptable due to section 610 prohibitions. This agent is unacceptable for use in residential applications since other viable alternatives exist. (CFC-Blend) contains CFCs with ODPs of 1.0. The predominant constituent has a 100-year GWP of 3400, with an atmospheric lifetime of 55 years. The CFC constituent in this blend will be phased out of production on December 31, 1995. This agent is the most effective of all other halon substitutes except for HBFC&hyph;22B1 and HCFC&hyph;123, and does not pose the exposure risk of HBFC&hyph;22B1 in certain scenarios. (CFC Blend) is generally considered non-toxic and could serve as a transitional substitute in many streaming applications. However, in light of its high ODP relative to other substitute agents and the large potential market for consumer/residential extinguishers, alternative agents such as water and dry chemical are considered sufficient for residential uses. (c) C 6 F 14 . C 6 F 14 is acceptable as a streaming agent in non-residential applications: Where other alternatives are not technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements: (a) Due to the physical or chemical properties of the agent, or (b) where human exposure to the extinguishing agent may approach cardiosensitization levels or result in other unacceptable health effects under normal operating conditions. This agent is unacceptable for use in residential applications and for uses beyond the limits and conditions stipulated in this action. The extinguishment concentration of C 6 F 14 is 4.4 percent, and a cardiotoxicity NOAEL of 40 percent. Its weight equivalence is 2.8 and its storage volume equivalence is 3.1. While C 6 F 14 has no ODP, its atmospheric lifetime is 3,000 years, and may potentially contribute to global climate change. EPA intends that users select C 6 F 14 out of need and that this agent be used as the agent of last resort. Thus, a user must determine that the characteristics of the end-use preclude use of other available alternatives. In most streaming applications, the Agency believes that alternatives to C 6 F 14 exist. These include the halocarbon replacements identified above as well as alternative agents such as water, CO 2 , foam, and dry chemicals. Users should attempt to use these other agents before deciding on an C 6 F 14 system. At the time of publication of this rulemaking, EPA is unaware of any data which necessitates the use of any PFC as a streaming agent based on toxicological concerns. Users must observe the limitations on C 6 F 14 acceptability by undertaking the following measures: (i) Conduct an evaluation of foreseeable conditions of end use; (ii) determine that human exposure to the other alternative extinguishing agents may pose a risk of cardiosensitization or other unacceptable toxicity effects under normal operating conditions; and (iii) determine that the physical or chemical properties or technical constraints of the other available agents preclude their use. Users must maintain documentation on measures taken to justify use of this agent. Some examples of potential end-uses where toxicity or physical characteristics may possibly be of concern are: i. Confined spaces which are difficult to egress, such as civilian and military transportation applications, including armored vehicles, marine engines, power boats, aircraft cabins, and race cars; ii. Applications where public safety or national security necessity may preclude personnel from evacuating, in event of emergency, such as nuclear power plants or guard/security facilities; iii. Emergency response applications such as crash rescue vehicles and aircraft flightlines; iv. Military applications involving mission critical applications which are vital to national security; v. Other applications where, due to physical or chemical properties, there are no technically feasible alternatives. EPA recommends that users minimize unnecessary emissions by limiting testing only to that which is essential to meet safety or performance requirements; recovering C 6 F 14 from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing; and destroying C 6 F 14 or recycling it for later use. EPA encourages manufacturers to develop aggressive product stewardship programs to help users avoid such unnecessary emissions.
