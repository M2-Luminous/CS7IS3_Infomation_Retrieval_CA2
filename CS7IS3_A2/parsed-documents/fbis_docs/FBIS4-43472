Nielsen, chairman of the Socialist People's Party (SF), has issued a companion volume to Liberal Anders Fogh Rasmussen's topical book. The two are more in agreement than one might have thought. SF chairman Nielsen declares that he is still a Marxist. Nevertheless he agrees with Rasmussen about many things and the respect is mutual. Allow me to present the new Christiansborg [parliament building] partners: Holger K. Nielsen of the Socialist People's Party and superliberal Anders Fogh Rasmussen. They disagree enormously politically, and their styles are unusually different. But at the same time they share so many attitudes and viewpoints that one ventures to make the assertion anyway: Nielsen and Rasmussen are joined in a strange alliance. In the next few months Danes will be able to see for themselves. The two will travel around the country on a joint lecture tour, and while the obligatory disagreements will undoubtedly be aired once again, the two politicians will also stress their favorite common themes to an equally large extent: - The political debate has become mushy. - Too few people today have the courage to take a clear ideological stand. - The Social Democrats are the worst offenders. Before the tour of Denmark begins, BERLINGSKE TIDENDE made an appointment to meet the two politicians. To talk about visions, but also about their topical books: Rasmussen's highly ideological book, Fra Socialstat til minimalstat [From Welfare State to Minimal State] came out last fall. And Nielsen's book of the same cast and appearance, but with a somewhat different final result, Frihed i faellesskab [Freedom in Fellowship], will be available in bookstores on Tuesday [26 April]. And you have to look closely at what is written on the book jackets because the two books are almost indistinguishable. The two have the same publisher -- Samleren -- and the dust jackets are practically identical. And as if that were not enough, there is actually an advertisement for Rasmussen's very liberal book on the back of Nielsen's book. Both authors now hope the books can be sold together as a kind of package solution. Future purchasers of this odd book package can read about Rasmussen's frontal assault on the welfare state. And if the same readers then open the second publication in the package they can become acquainted with Nielsen's total repudiation of Rasmussen's social views. Actually, Nielsen himself says he has written a Marxist book. However that is not the point, both authors agree. For if all the external trappings are peeled away, one thing remains: Both Nielsen and Rasmussen are full of praise for each other's work. "Actually, you have written a pretty good book, Holger," Rasmussen says and continues: "I notice that you bury the class struggle. Perhaps somewhat guardedly, but you do." Marxism Normally this kind of praise -- especially when it comes from a Liberal -- would be somewhat doubtful for an SF man. And lest Rasmussen think a miracle has occurred, Nielsen makes sure to point out: "I am a Marxist. Socialism may have a low status in many quarters, but it still exists in my mind." But after that has been established Nielsen does not want to lag behind Rasmussen. The SF chairman also has praise for his political opponent: "I like Anders' book because it is clear. I tried to prove that ideology is not dead. And Anders does the same. I like him for that," Nielsen says. The easiest thing, of course, would have been to dismiss each other's book. Rasmussen could have zeroed in on Nielsen's continued profession of Marxism. Similarly, Nielsen could have focused exclusively on the Liberal ideologist's praise of private initiative. Instead they have chosen to do almost the opposite. Of course they have to taunt each other, but each will also get the praise he deserves. Rasmussen: "I make it a point to emphasize my agreement with Holger. I think people are tired of the brick wall that many political books run into. Surely we can afford to agree with each other even if we are political opponents. The most important thing is that political thinking occurs at all. So we should not go around sniping at each other's book." The State Rasmussen likes the very title of Nielsen's book: "Freedom in Fellowship brings back a lot of memories of my days in VU [Liberal Youth]. Our slogan was exactly the same back then. So that is definitely a good beginning." Nielsen promptly repays the compliment: "I would also like to praise you, Anders. In you and your book we see for once a politician who goes into depth about something ideological. That is also the reason why the book is so much fun to rebut." And so he does -- the SF chairman. With the characteristic half-affectionate, half-teasing undertone that conceals great respect as a rule, Nielsen tackles Rasmussen's most central assertions: First and foremost the one about the excellence of the free market mechanism. "There is a difference between a market economy and democracy. Your view is just too primitive, Anders." Rasmussen: "I attack the socialists because they believe that political management is faultless. I call for some humility there. The market economy is the only system that gives people a free rein to strive for the good life." So much for the market economy, but there are plenty of points on which the liberal and the socialist speak the same language and understand each other. Such as the question of the state, for example. In his book, Nielsen maintains that there are limits, after all, to growth in the public sector. Rasmussen: "That is a very important realization, Holger. You should spell this out for your support troops. It is interesting and very encouraging that you come to grips with the concept of the state. You want to shift tasks from the state to `civil society.' That is what I call private initiative. But the words should not keep us apart." Freedom The concept of freedom is another example of what they have in common: Nielsen: "It is very important that SF not lose the concept of freedom to the nonsocialists. It must not be said that the Liberal Party has a monopoly on freedom, while we are left behind, representing everything authoritative." Rasmussen: "The very fact that you found it necessary to use the word `freedom' in your title confirms that the socialists find it necessary to argue on liberal terms." But probably the most important similarity is their strong shared belief in the value of always expressing standpoints clearly. Both politicians loathe colleagues who shrink from ideological and long-range discussions in favor of the familiar Christiansborg pragmatism. Both Rasmussen and Nielsen fear that Danish politics will become a little boring with no one underlining clear standpoints. "The kind of discussion where it is hard to tell if a Social Democrat or a Conservative is speaking is deadly. The whole thing becomes a confrontation between mush and mush." Nielsen and Rasmussen agree that the Social Democrats are the worst -- the mushiest. Nielsen: "With the exception of Ritt Bjerregaard there are no real thinkers in the Social Democratic Party. For them it has become a question of power for power's sake -- and otherwise they are indifferent to substance. There, in my opinion, they differ sharply from their fellow parties in Sweden, France, and Germany." Rasmussen: "On this point I agree 100 percent. It is striking how all the political mush is found in the opposition -- among us and the SF people. The Social Democrats managed to create a welfare state in the course of a few decades and then came to a complete standstill in other respects. Today they regard defending what they once created as their sole and highly distinguished task." The covers of both books display pictures of trees on green fields against a background of blue sky. But -- despite the similarity -- there are differences: Nielsen's field appears to be more ecological than Rasmussen's, which primarily gives the impression of being very well watered. And there is only one tree -- though a very lovely one -- on Rasmussen's book. Nielsen's book is decorated with several -- though they are hardly as resplendent. What should we infer from that? First Nielsen: "Anders probably chose the single tree to show the possibilities of the individual. I would rather stress that the individual is connected with the community." Rasmussen: "I must first note that Holger's group of trees looks somewhat bedraggled. That must say something about the fact that when trees -- or people -- shade each other they become small and somewhat stunted." And they can continue in this way in the months ahead -- Danish politics' new fast friends, Holger K. Nielsen and Anders Fogh Rasmussen.
