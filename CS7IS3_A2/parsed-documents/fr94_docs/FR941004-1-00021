ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: At the request of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LDOTD), the Coast Guard is considering a change to the regulation governing the operation of the State Route 82 swing span drawbridge across the Mermentau River, mile 7.1 at Grand Chenier, Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The proposed regulation would require that the bridge open on signal from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and open on 4-hours notice from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Presently, the bridge opens on signal from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. and from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. the bridge opens on 4-hours notice. This action would provide relief to the bridge owner and still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation. DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Commander (ob), Eighth Coast Guard District, 501 Magazine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70130&hyph;3396, or may be delivered to room 1313 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (504) 589&hyph;2965. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. John Wachter, Bridge Administration Branch, at the address given above, telephone (504) 589&hyph;2965. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments Interested parties are invited to participate in the proposed rulemaking by submitting written views, comments, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify the bridge and give reasons for concurrence with or any recommended change in this proposal. Persons desiring acknowledgment that their comments have been received should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Eighth Coast Guard District at the address under ADDRESSES. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial.
