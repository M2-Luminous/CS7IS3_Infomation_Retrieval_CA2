Residents from the three areas will need valid permits from early this year. Labour Ministry spokesman Liu Guanxue said the move was aimed at controlling the number of foreign workers. The growth of foreign workers threatened opportunities for local people he said. Exact quotas had not been fixed, but Mr Liu said the application fee for permits would be "minimal". New regulations make employers responsible for applying for permits for their staff from labour bureaus. Applications then go to the Labour Ministry for approval. Failure to comply with the procedures would result in the disqualification of employees from working in China. Applicants for permits should hold travel documents and would be required to provide evidence of their qualifications to prove their calibre and experience. The regulations also stipulate all employment contracts should follow Chinese law. The Labour Ministry would resolve contractual disputes by reference to the local legislation.
