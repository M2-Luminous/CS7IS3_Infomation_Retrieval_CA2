With irresistible force, the private sector of the economy, which started in the course of reform, is surging ahead rapidly, presenting gratifying results. According to data provided by the department of industry and commerce, by the end of 1993 the number of individual businesses had risen from 489, employing 501 people, in 1980 to 41,830, employing 65,579 people, at present. Their registered capital exceeded 170 million yuan. Total sales volume at rural markets throughout the region topped 900 million yuan. What do these impressive figures show? There is only one answer: The ancient and quiet plateau is opening its doors to the outside world; the people there are emancipating their long confined minds and changing their concepts. The establishment of a market economy has injected new vitality into Tibet's long-standing unitary economic mode. The rapid development of individual enterprises on the plateau can be attributed to the reform and opening up policies and the relentless efforts of the regional party committee, government, and departments of industry and commerce at various levels. In recent years, in line with the reality of different situations in different localities in Tibet, careful preparations were made before any decision to concentrate on cultivating markets, and this played a role in promoting the development of individual businesses. By the end of 1993, Tibet had established 99 markets of various types with a combined floor space of more than 100,000 square meters. In 1993 alone, the region invested 11.60 million yuan in building 23 markets, improving on the previous situation in which stalls were set up in roads, streets, and open areas. Emancipating their minds and continually breaking new ground in their march forward, administrative departments of industry and commerce have simplified procedures for granting licenses to individual business applicants, completely changing the old situation in which friends had to be asked for favors when people applied for business permits. This has greatly helped individual businesses. In Lhasa alone, 5,300 new, individually run enterprises were added last year, an increase of 56 percent on 1992. As a result, the number of employed people in the private sector rose by 102 percent while the sector's annual turnover increased by 126 percent. Individually run enterprises have flourished in Tibet since the procedure for applying for a business permit was simplified, making it unnecessary to ask favors of friends. On 12 January the regional people's government officially promulgated "Some Provisions on Accelerating the Development of Individual Economic Undertakings." Even before the promulgation of the provisions, though, individual businesses had been in operation in Tibet for a year. But the provisions have helped speed up the development of individually run businesses in the region. As far as figures are concerned, a characteristic of the development of the private sector of the economy in Tibet in 1993 was that although the total number of individual businesses was about the same as that of 1992, the number of workers they employed rose sharply by 20,000; the net volume of registered capital increased by over 70 million yuan; and the total volume of trading at rural and urban markets throughout the region went up by 21.6 percent, accounting for 47.36 percent of the region's total retail sales. This shows that the scale of the private sector of the economy is expanding and advancing in the direction of intensive and large- scale operation. What is worth mentioning is that Chongsaikang market in Lhasa, which accommodates 1,400 individual businesses, handled a business volume of 340 million yuan last year. It has become a large, comprehensive market dealing in both wholesale and retail sales and handling more than 15,000 types of commodities, which are distributed to most prefectures and counties in the autonomous region. The rapidly developing individual sector of the economy contrasts sharply with state-run enterprises, which are struggling. Some people feel individual businesses have edged out state-run enterprises and taken over the market. The view of one entrepreneur was to the point when he said: "Individual businesses are using their own money to create tax income for the state, and the state does not have to bear any risk or burden." Data show that in 1993 individually run industrial and commercial enterprises paid more than 26 million yuan in taxes to the state, accounting for 40 percent of the region's total industrial and commercial taxes. In fact, in Tibet, a region where the economy is backward, transportation and information services are lacking, and which relies on other provinces for the majority of its daily necessities, the role played by the private sector of the economy should not be doubted. In urban areas, rural areas, and pastoral areas, individual businesses, like the light cavalry, are playing an undeniable role in enlivening Tibet's rural and urban economy, improving the circulation of commodities, and providing convenience in the daily life of the masses. Taking a look at the development of the region's individually run businesses, we can see that their prospects are bright. However, Tibet's growth rate and scale of development are insufficient compared to other provinces and regions. The reasons are: People's awareness of commodities is still rather weak; the market system has yet to be cultivated and improved; industrial and commercial administrative departments, although charged with administering markets, have themselves applied for land to be used for the construction of markets -- this continues to be a problem; and some other departments have collected all types of fees and so "killed the chicken to get the eggs," thus affecting the development of individual businesses. Relevant departments have proposed that to boost the development of individual businesses, we must thoroughly implement all regulations that help the development of individual businesses and at the same to strengthen propaganda, improve management and services, crack down on illegal economic activities, and encourage fair and rational competition. Only this way can there be a new breakthrough in the development of private sector economic undertakings. It is expected that the private sector of the economy in Tibet will continue to develop in 1994.
