The Russian Foreign Ministry has been informed of this decision but has not yet received NATO's proposals which would, on the one hand, augment the Partnership for Peace program, which has already been signed by 18 European states not belonging to the bloc, and on the other would take into account Russia's special significance and role in European and international affairs. To judge from paragraph nine of the NATO Council decision, which gives a quite extravagant account of Russia's significance and talks of the need for the alliance to develop ties with it, Brussels is aware that there can be no hope of the further strengthening of stability and security in Europe without it. Furthermore, the principle on which the new relations will be based -- the "deepening of partnership without reciprocal vetoes and surprises" -- causes no objections either in Moscow or in Brussels. In other words, Brussels need not fear that Moscow is going to interfere in NATO's affairs and Russia can expect to be consulted when pan-European affairs are being decided. Moscow has set out its vision of Russia's ties with NATO twice -- the first time in Brussels during Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's visit there, and again last week in Istanbul, where they were developed by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Outwardly at least NATO reacted quite coolly to the Russian proposals, fearing criticism from the East Europeans for compliance toward "Moscow's expansionism" and hoping that the active campaign for Europe's affiliation to the Partnership for Peace program will force Russia to make major concessions. When asked what compromise Moscow might make, one well-informed Russian policy expert replied that Russia will not be opposed to formulating additional measures in relations with NATO in a separate protocol and will undoubtedly insist on creating some kind of consultative mechanism, which would make it possible to conduct a broad dialogue on the whole range of policy and security questions. Brussels is expecting the Russian Foreign Minister for talks as early as next week. At the Russian Foreign Ministry IZVESTIYA was told that Kozyrev did indeed intend to visit Brussels and launch large-scale cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance.
