FBIS3-59738 "jpjst003__l94031" JPRS-JST-94-003L Document Type:JPRS Document Title:Science & Technology Japan 18 January 1994 Microelectronics Hitachi Develops Four Items 93FE0638B Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Apr 93 p 6--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 93FE0638B Tokyo DEMPA SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] Hitachi Central Manufacturing Laboratories has developed four product types of the ``H8/3877'', which is in the 8-bit, single chip microcomputer ``H8/300L Series'', and which has such peripheral functions as a 26 column LCD display controller/driver and a multi-tone generator built in. Shipping of each kind of sample will begin in succession from May. In particular, it will be marketed for wireless devices, multi-function cordless phones and portable audio. The new products will be based on the low voltage, low power consumption characteristics of the H8/300L Series. They will be the largest 8-bit microcomputers in the industry that have a built in LCD controller/driver for a 26 column display, and it will be the first time in the industry that a multi-tone generator, which conventionally is external, is built into one chip. By doing this, it becomes possible to have a maximum 208 segment display in 52 segments by four common. Furthermore, by adding an independent DTMF oscillator, a multi-tone generator circuit that can form optional wave form patterns in optional frequencies between 40 Hz-4 kHz is built in, and all of the kinds of tone generation functions which are used in wireless devices and phones can be easily configured. Also, the ROM capacity built in is 60 KB with the ZTAT board, or 60 KB, 48 KB, or 40 KB with the mask ROM boards. They are offering a large RAM capacity of 2 KB. In addition, the processing speed can also be finely program controlled by providing a high speed active mode at a minimum command execution time of 0.4 microseconds when operating at 10 MHz, a middle speed mode (1 MHz) as a low power consumption active mode, and sub-active mode, sub-sleep mode, and standby mode which rely on an independent sub-clock (32 kHz). The power source voltage is 2.7 to 5.5 V. The package is a 100 pin QFP (pin pitch 0.5mm). The price of samples of the ZTAT board will be ¥2,900. The prices for the mask ROM boards will be from ¥970 to ¥1,120 (when purchasing 50,000 units). Hitachi plans to have a monthly production of 10,000 units in April 1994, and a monthly production of 100,000 units in October.
