Introducing the interview, the announcer notes that a Russian government decision to set up NTV on the 4th channel has been in effect since the beginning of the year. Zverev says: "NTV will start to go out on the 4th TV channel round about mid-January, from 1800," adding that on weekdays services will run until about midnight, and maybe later on Friday and Saturday. On programming, Zverev says: "To start with, there will be a cartoon for the children--various cartoons, both home-produced and foreign. At 1830, a documentary TV serial will be shown. That will begin with the TV series `The Most Notorious Crimes,' which are documentary films about the most notorious courtroom trials of the 20th Century. After that, at 1900 and at 2200, there will be the daily editions of the `Today' news program, after which there will be a feature film." Zverev goes on to mention some of the feature films to be shown - all detective stories. Asked why he is going into television, Zverev replies: "From a certain point onward, it's quite a profitable investment of money, a profitable business. Admittedly, that time doesn't come until about 10 years after work has started. But it's also quite a profitable investment of money from the point of view of our slight contribution to the stabilization of our society." He adds: "After all, we're all tired of the joyless TV screen that awaits us every evening at home. There is no happy program that one could watch every evening. And when people came along, saying that they knew how to do it, they had the ability to do it, the banks that are taking part in the financing simply took their word for it and dealt only with the finance. All the ideology and the content aspect of the channel is a matter for the professionals who are dealing with it today." Asked to expand on the financing, Zverev said: "We have an agreement on the financing of NTV. There is the National Credit Bank and the MOST group in the capital. All these financial groups are the founders of NTV. I would like to stress once again that we conduct all discussions, all decisions and the financing of all projects on a completely equal basis."
