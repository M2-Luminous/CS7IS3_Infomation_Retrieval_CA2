Yants and Major P. Dulnev: "From Direct Contact"] [Text] It is important for a commander who is organizing an offensive against a defending enemy from direct contact with him to skillfully select the staging area, conduct the required redeployment, create the combat formation and precisely plan the battle. That is what is discussed in the following article. Quantitative and qualitative changes in weapons, and also views on the nature of a modern combined arms battle, require a more rational selection of the methods to transition to the offensive. An offensive under conditions of direct contact with the enemy from the position of the defense will be most typical for subunits at the beginning of a war. Redeployment of the battalion is conducted to concentrate the main personnel and equipment on the axis of the offensive and the occupation by subunits of a staging area in the designated areas. It must be simple in concept and be carried out in short periods of time with accomplishment of measures to deceive the enemy, as a rule, at night with strict observance of the mode of activity of the defending subunits. In this case, the battalion occupies a staging area [iskhodnyy rayon] and the company -- a jumping-off position [iskhodnaya pozitsiya]. Furthermore, a tank battalion can occupy an assembly area [vyzhidatelnaya pozitsiya]. First echelon motorized-rifle platoons and companies are located in the first trench and their armored personnel vehicles [BMP's] (armored transport vehicles [BTR's]) at fire positions alongside their subunits or 50 meters behind them. When it is impossible for armored personnel vehicles (armored transport vehicles) to reach the leading edge without being detected, they can be located jointly with the coordinating tank subunit at its attack or assembly area. The company's command-observation post is prepared at a distance of 200 meters from the attack position and the battalion's command-observation post -- at a distance of up to 300 meters behind the first echelon companies. The grenade launcher platoon occupies fire positions at that same depth and the antitank subunit -- at a distance of up to 100 meters. A staging area is assigned to the battalion with the calculation of ensuring the concealed disposition of subunits, their least possible vulnerability from all types of weapons, and favorable conditions to transition to the offensive. A staging area is assigned to a first echelon motorized-rifle battalion in the axis of its impending offensive within the first position and, to a second echelon battalion -- normally within the second position. A motorized-rifle company's attack position consists of a trench, the connecting trenches adjacent to it, and the fire positions of BMP's (BTR's) and other weapons that are attached to the company. In the process, a first echelon motorized-rifle company is normally located in the first trench and the battalion's second echelon company (reserve) occupies an attack position in the second and third trenches. It is advisable to leave in place the subunits that were in the battalion's second echelon within the assigned action area from which they advance to the final coordination line. Tank subunits' attack positions can be designated at a distance of 2-4 km from the leading edge of the enemy defense under conditions that ensure their concealment from visual surveillance and communications intercept. Otherwise, they are located at the assembly area (5-7 km). That distance (with the skillful utilization of terrain) caused the least vulnerability of tanks from all types of enemy weapons. The mortar (artillery) battery's fire position is usually selected at that distance in order to ensure maximum utilization of its fire capabilities. It can be up to 500 meters from the first echelon companies' rear boundary. A battalion that is occupying the defense in direct contact with the enemy conducts a concealed redeployment. The battalion commander defines its sequence and time periods in his orders. A battalion commander issued the following order for occupying a staging area for an offensive at a Northwestern Group of Forces exercise (see the diagram). "The mortar battery and the grenade launcher platoon should occupy the fire positions indicated from 21:00 to 23:00 on 15.03. At the same time, the antitank platoon should deploy at the line of fire positions behind the second trench in the gap between 7th and 8th motorized-rifle companies. "7th and 8th motorized-rifle companies occupy the staging area at 23:00 on 15.03. Armored personnel vehicles occupy fire positions behind their subunits. Driver-mechanics, gunners and deputy platoon commanders remain in their BMP's. The remaining personnel complete the engineering works of the staging area. "Until the initiation of the attack, 9th motorized-rifle company remains in the previous defensive position and advances on its axis after 7th motorized-rifle company seizes the defensive position at hill 97.3. "During the redeployment, the tank battalion (less a tank company) is concentrated at the assembly area northwest of Serovo. Advance to the final coordination line during the period from "Ch" -- 0.22 to "Ch" --0.04. "The 1st tank platoon remains at the positions occupied and accomplishes fire missions through direct fire during the period of preparation fire for the assault. With the 2nd motorized rifle battalion's transition to the attack, the platoon occupies its place in the 7th motorized-rifle company's combat formation. Conclude occupying the staging area by 04:00 on 15.04." On the night prior to the offensive, the motorized-rifle companies arrive at the attack positions. Guns and other weapons that have been assigned to conduct direct fire, occupy prepared fire positions. They are located in prepared shelters and advance to conduct fire against assigned targets with the initiation of preparatory fire for the assault. At the attack position, subunits are at readiness to repel a possible enemy offensive and observe the prescribed conduct regime both on the forward edge and in the depth. The battalion commander's work procedures to organize the offensive will depend on the content of the mission received, the nature of the probable enemy's operations, the availability of time and other factors. With the occupation of the attack position, the battalion commander organizes surveillance and security, assigns the missions of repelling a possible enemy attack and also strikes of enemy aviation and airmobile teams to the companies and weapons, issues orders for additional engineer preparation of positions and lines, while devoting special attention to painstaking camouflage and accomplishment of measures for protection of subunits from precision-guided weapons. During an offensive from a position of direct contact with the enemy, the battalion commander conducts a large portion of the work for the organization of the battle in the field (making decisions, the commander's reconnaissance, assignment of combat missions, organization of coordination, and effective engagement of the enemy). In the process, special attention is devoted to the commander's reconnaissance -- a distinctive type of reconnaissance of the enemy and terrain at the attack position. At the previously mentioned exercise, the battalion commander began it from a topographical and tactical orientation after which he reported the latest data on the enemy to those assembled. In the process, while utilizing terrain features (orientation points), he precisely defined the trace of the forward edge of the enemy defense, the disposition of enemy defensive positions and weapons, especially antitank weapons -- ATGM's, guns, dug-in tanks, and BMP's, and indicated which targets are being destroyed by the senior commander. The terrain and enemy defense were most painstakingly studied in the depth of the immediate objective. The battalion commander directed the attention of his subordinates to the presence and nature of obstructions and obstacles, hidden accesses, open flanks and gaps that must be exploited during the transition to the attack. At the commander's reconnaissance, he indicated on which front the battalion is advancing, the first echelon companies, their attack positions and combat missions and the axis of concentration of the primary efforts. Officers inscribed on working maps the revealed weapons, surveillance posts and other enemy targets that were subjected to destruction by artillery fire and also guns and tanks assigned for direct fire, ATGM's and grenade launchers. In the field, the battalion commander indicated the positions of organic and attached weapons, the locations of passages in obstacles, locations for tanks to pass through, the procedures for marking them, time for breaching obstacles and their installation. The leader of the exercise who was present at the commander's reconnaissance on the whole approved this procedure of its conduct. Precise assignment of combat missions to subunits is an important task in the commander's work for organizing the battle. They are disseminated to commanders in oral form through the field order or field instruction, as a rule, immediately after the commander's reconnaissance. Only that information is disseminated that subordinates really need to clarify the mission, assess the situation, make decisions, organize coordination and prepare subunits for battle. Under current conditions, especially high demands are made on the organization of coordination while preparing an offensive. The task of the commander and staff consists of precisely coordinating the combat efforts of a large number of personnel and equipment. It is important that the orders for coordination did not duplicate the field order but developed the issued instructions and made them more specific. The experience of the examined exercise attests that the most effective method of organizing coordination is when the commander not only issues the required orders but also listens to the reports of commanders of subordinate and attached subunits on operating procedures with a subsequent run-through of the most probable events of the impending battle. After issuing the field order, the battalion commander reported the goal and work procedures to the officers and determined which questions there were on the organization of coordination and how he should resolve them. Then, the operations of subunits during the redeployment were coordinated in detail: Procedures were established for companies (platoons) to occupy attack positions for the offensive (2nd motorized-rifle battalion commander's orders were cited above). By running-through the tactical events, the officer persistently strived for everyone to precisely master the procedures for destruction of enemy weapons and personnel at defensive positions during the period of preparation fire for the assault. He played out urgent situations in the event the enemy conducted counter preparation. The operations of tank crewmen with artillery and combat helicopters on the procedures for conducting fire during the transition to the attack and with motorized-riflemen when tanks were passing through the attack position were especially painstakingly coordinated. The following were attained as a result of the battalion commander's orders, a run-through of the tactical events, and the reports of subordinates: A common understanding of the missions and the techniques to accomplish them; painstaking coordination of effective engagement of the enemy (by aviation, artillery, our own weapons and neighbors' weapons) against targets, facilities, axes, lines and time. The appropriate adjustments were made to the operations of the antiaircraft subunit for the cover of the battalion from enemy air strikes and issues of flight safety of friendly aircraft during flyovers in the fire zone, and measures were clarified for the comprehensive support of the battle of battalion subunits and communications between them. After the dissemination of missions, planning of the offensive battle and organization of coordination, the primary goal of the battalion commander, his deputies and the battalion staff -- is practical work in subordinate subunits. It is carried out by verifying locally the precise accomplishment of the issued field order, company commanders' knowledge of the opposing enemy, and also their understanding of their missions. Assistance was rendered in supplying them with everything necessary, detected discrepancies were eliminated on the spot and questions that arose were resolved as a result of monitoring the timeliness and quality of the accomplishment of measures to prepare for battle. Great significance was assigned to the preparation of the staging area. It was equipped in an engineering sense while considering the redisposition of the battalion's combat formation after redeployment and also ensuring reliable protection of subunits from enemy precision-guided weapons. An instructive example of the conduct of such measures -- is the engineer preparation of the staging area for an offensive of 54th Rifle Division subunits in the East Prussian Operation (January 1945). The position they occupied was prepared with three trenches that were connected by a thick network of passageways. One more trench, which was 120-150 meters from the first, was dug to close with the enemy. Work to remove friendly minefields was carried out during the five days prior to the offensive. Preparation of passageways in enemy obstacles and minefields was conducted during the night prior to the offensive through the efforts of combat engineer squads and 4-5 automatic riflemen were assigned to cover each of them. With the initiation of preparation fire for the assault, subunits that are in direct contact with the enemy use their weapons to destroy and suppress enemy weapons and personnel in defensive positions in the first position. While observing the results of the fire, the battalion commander assigns missions to the weapons to destroy the survivors and newly detected enemy targets and monitors the timeliness of the preparation of passageways in minefields. During the course of preparation fire for the assault, tank subunits advance and deploy in combat formation for the transition to the attack. Armored personnel vehicles advance behind them. During the attack, when tanks approach, motorized-rifle subunit soldiers on foot prepare for it, based upon the commanders' order, and dart out of their trenches (foxholes) and, following the tanks, attack the enemy after the tanks have passed the attack positions. During an attack in armored personnel vehicles (armored transport vehicles), motorized-rifle subunits disembark personnel in armored personnel vehicles (armored transport vehicles) during the preparation fire for the assault. The seizure of enemy defensive positions in the first position and exploitation of the offensive into the depth is conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Field Manual and depending on the developing situation. In conclusion, let us stress that the redeployment of subunits during an offensive from a position of direct contact with the enemy is a multi-stage, strictly regulated task and only comprehensively trained commanders are capable of successfully carrying it out.
