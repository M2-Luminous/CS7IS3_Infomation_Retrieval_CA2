FR941130-0-00126 FR941130-0-00019 This rule does not involve either an establishment of goals or an adjustment of existing goals; it involves an extension of established goals for which the GSEs were invited to comment. (In the case of the special affordable housing goal, only the baseline is revised appropriately to reflect market conditions and seasonality.) The Secretary will soon propose final regulations implementing the Secretary's responsibilities under the 1992 Act, including establishing new housing goals. Those regulations will be proposed for public comment. However, those regulations will not be effective by the beginning of 1995. Therefore, issuance of this final rule is essential to assure that the GSEs continue carrying out their Charter purposes pending rulemaking. The Fannie Mae Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1716 et seq. ) and the Freddie Mac Act (12 U.S.C. 1451 et seq. ) establish identical purposes for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including ``provid[ing] ongoing assistance to the secondary market for residential mortgages (including activities relating to mortgages on housing for low- and moderate-income families involving a reasonable economic return that may be less than the return earned on other activities) by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing;'' and ``promot[ing] access to mortgage credit throughout the Nation (including central cities, rural areas, and other underserved areas) by increasing the liquidity of mortgage investments and improving the distribution of investment capital available for residential mortgage financing.'' (See section 301 (3) and (4) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act and section 301(b) (3) and (4) of the Freddie Mac Act.) Other Matters Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule is limited to ensuring the continuation of established housing goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pending the specification of new housing goals through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Environmental Impact Statement In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(l) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to the extension of statutorily required housing goals and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism , has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal Government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. Promulgation of this rule merely ensures the continuation of established housing goals for the GSEs pending the specification of new housing goals through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family , has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Regulatory Agenda This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on November 14, 1994, (59 FR 57632) in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 81 Accounting, Federal Reserve System, Mortgages, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities. Accordingly, title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by adding a new subpart F to part 81, as follows. PART 81_REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT OVER THE CONDUCT OF THE SECONDARY MARKET OPERATIONS OF THE FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FNMA) 1. The authority citation for part 81 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 12 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;4641; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). 2. Subpart F is added, to read as follows: Subpart F_Extension of Housing Goals for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ยง81.51 Extension of Housing Goals for 1995. (a) Low- and moderate-income families and central cities. The housing goals for 1994 for purchases by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) of mortgages on housing for low- and moderate-income families and housing located in central cities provided in the Notices of Interim Housing Goals, 58 FR 53048 and 53072 (October 13, 1993), shall apply to 1995. The goals established under this paragraph shall apply on a proportional basis to that portion of 1995 before goals are established and effective following notice and comment rulemaking. (b) Special affordable housing goals. The housing goals for 1993 and 1994 for purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of mortgages on special affordable housing provided in the Notices of Interim Housing Goals, 58 FR 53048 and 53072 (October 13, 1993), shall apply to 1995 with appropriate revisions to the 1992 baseline for the goals as set forth herein. In establishing the levels of these housing goals for 1995, the Secretary has considered the level of estimated mortgage originations in 1995 and that these goals will be in place for only a portion of the year. Consequently, the Secretary has adjusted the baselines applicable to the special affordable housing goals, from the 1992 baselines, so that the goals result in the following dollar amounts: The 1995 goal for Fannie Mae shall be $4.598 billion and the 1995 goal for Freddie Mac shall be $3.357 billion. The goals established under this paragraph shall apply on a proportional basis to that portion of 1995 before goals are established and effective following notice and comment rulemaking. (c) Applicability of clarifications. The requirements contained in the Notices of Interim Housing Goals at 58 FR 53048 and 53072 (October 13, 1993), including any clarifications issued by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee(s), shall apply to the housing goals under this section. Dated: November 23, 1994. Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29433 Filed 11&hyph;25&hyph;94; 9:08 am] BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;27&hyph;P
