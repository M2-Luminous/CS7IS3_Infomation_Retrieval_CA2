"Iraq's dependence on the port of al-'Aqabah in the event of the lifting of sanctions will be primary because neither their port of Umm Qasr nor even Mersin Port would be enough to handle all their goods," Jordan's Transport Minister Adib Halasah told Reuters. Jordanian concerns rose last November when Iraq began importing through Umm Qasr and said whenever possible it would directly import U.N.-permitted goods--mostly food and medicine. "Whatever the size of Umm Qasr, and it's a large port, the anticipated rise in Iraq's import needs would make them need not just al-'Aqabah but other ports," said the minister. Mr. Halasah said use of Umm Qasr, Iraq's only port, would not affect al-'Aqabah as "it would continue to be more economical for Iraq to import its European cargo through it." Umm Qasr would be used mainly for imports from the Far East. He expected activity in al-'Aqabah to surge when sanctions end. Less than 100 trailers travel the al-'Aqabah-Baghdad route daily against 400 before the Gulf crisis. Mr. Halasah said upgrading and modernisation of al='Aqabah was underway to handle "the expected large volume of demand." Sanctions were imposed because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Al-'Aqabah has also suffered from the U.N. inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound ships for goods that could violate the sanctions. Port activity has fallen from pre-Gulf war level peaks of 20 million tonnes annually to around 13 million tonnes in 1993. In an indication of confidence, Mr. Halasah said the Iraq-Jordan Land Transport Company decided in Baghdad last week to buy 100 Renault trucks to modernise its 420 trailer fleet. The firm, set up in 1981 as a 50-50 joint venture between the two states, is registered as a Jordanian company and is not subject to aspects of the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq.
