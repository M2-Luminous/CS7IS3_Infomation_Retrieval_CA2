[Leotard] Good morning. [Giesbert] We have just heard a song sung by your brother, Philippe Leotard, who was advertising Scotch whisky. There are rumors that he was recently found wandering on a road in his pyjamas. Do you have news of him? Is it good news? [Leotard] I do not know what you are talking about. I simply know that he is very talented. I have just heard him singing. He makes me dream. He writes, and I believe that this is a good thing. It is his role and I like it. It is his role, not mine. [Giesbert] In a way, he is the anti-Francois Leotard. [Leotard] You know, we are very fond of each other. You will not manage to drive a wedge between us. [Giesbert] What I mean is that you do not present the same image. [Leotard] He is a poet, he makes people dream. I do not make people dream. That is all, that is how things are. We do not have the same goals, the same job. [Giesbert] Would you like to be in his shoes sometimes? [Leotard] Naturally. I believe everyone would like to be someone else at times. [Giesbert] Would you like to have a drink and write? [Leotard] Naturally, wouldn't you like that yourself? [Giesbert] The conference on science and defense, in which Europe No. 1 is participating, starts today. Would you like to make soldiers who are listening to us this morning dream by describing some of these gadgets which are being designed by the army -- such as high-powered microwave weapons to jam hostile electronic systems? [Leotard] As you probably know, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Liberation. Four years ago it was the 50th anniversary of the defeat -- France's defeat by the Nazis. We lost in 1940 because we did not have the same weapons as others. It was because we were not ready for the invasion, for the war. I believe that my role, like that of my predecessors and that of my followers, is to give the Armed Forces the means they need or the means they will need. One could smile or be worried when hearing about this new equipment. My role is to make sure that the Armed Forces have the necessary weapons for all possible contingencies. I believe that the French people must know that as far as technological knowledge in this field is concerned, we are the best in Europe. This represents a lot of know-how, top-class scientists, superior research centers, and the will not to wage war. This is a will to defend the country, to defend certain values, to be present in the world, but we will not attack anyone. [Giesbert] Are we defending peace through force, as [French writer] Romain Rolland said? [Leotard] Absolutely! [Giesbert] Francois Mitterrand announced on 10 May that nuclear tests will not be resumed and the right-wing majority in parliament expressed outrage. Let us try to consider this issue in detail. The first point is that experts are apparently divided on whether or not to suspend tests before computer tests are possible. [Leotard] In fact, France must obtain as rapidly as possible -- but this will take several years, possibly seven, eight or 10 years -- the ability to simulate [tests], that is, the possibility to study the effects of a nuclear explosion in a laboratory. This is essential for our country if it wants to remain a great power. To achieve this the scientists, all the scientists, are telling us -- as it is their responsibility to do so -- that we must be able to carry out some tests to experiment. [Giesbert] You are saying all the scientists; some say some scientists. [Leotard] I have not once met a single scientist saying the opposite. Not once, not a single scientist. [Giesbert] Are those who disagree not scientists? [Leotard] Generally speaking, they are politicians. This is different. On the whole, French scientists say that to secure this capacity we need some tests. I believe that we must remember what the history of this venture has been since 1960. General de Gaulle developed the French nuclear deterrent against a general opposition. Therefore, I believe we must continue on this path. [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, if all other countries halt nuclear testing do you seriously believe that France will be able to run counter to the international community for long? This will seem rather strange. [Leotard] Not everyone has stopped testing. As you know, since the moratorium was declared, China has continued. Other countries have obtained this capacity of simulating explosions before us and did so better than we did. I believe that France should not allow itself to be left behind otherwise it will lose part of its independence and of its defense capabilities. [Giesbert] Let us now consider European issues. By laying the foundations of a Franco-German army, Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand took a real political risk. They laid the foundations of a European defense policy and we have the feeling that this is moving much slower under a [French] right-wing majority. [Leotard] I do not believe that this can be said. As you may have seen in the [defense] white paper, we expressed a deep European conviction. [Giesbert] We are still waiting for the decisions. [Leotard] They have been made. You just need to consider the expansion of the Eurocorps. [Giesbert] These were often decisions made by Francois Mitterrand or by Socialist governments. [Leotard] Don't say that. It is not true. [passage omitted] [Giesbert] Mr. Leotard, concerning Bosnia, last year you were ready to take things to the bitter end. Today you are, let us say, more realistic. What is behind this U-turn? The government, the ministry, the military? [Leotard] No. I always said that air strikes should have been carried out when there were no UN soldiers on the ground. This was before the summer of 1992. As soon as UN soldiers were deployed on the ground the basic responsible attitude was to avoid endangering their lives unnecessarily. That is all. I never changed my mind on this issue. I believe that we must be very firm on this new doctrine which is currently perverting Europe, namely ethnic cleansing. [Giesbert] Do you really believe that France will carry out its threat to pull out its forces from the former Yugoslavia? [Leotard] I always said, and I repeat, that no one is being forced to do absurd things. I would like you to know that we have begun the process of withdrawing of a certain number of battalions that we have there. First, the one in Glina, in Krajina, and then the one in Bihac. Before the end of the year, there will be about 2,500 fewer French soldiers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]
