FR940110-1-00082 FR940110-1-00006 (iii) Whether there has been a substantial reduction in the Bank's advances outstanding. The Board shall consider the extent to which the Bank's level of advances has declined in any given quarter or year, and whether such decline is projected to continue; and (iv) Whether any other financial condition exists with respect to the Bank which has resulted in, or is likely to result in, the financial instability of the Bank. b. Limitations on grounds for approval of application. Section 960.19(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the Board shall disapprove an application for a temporary suspension if it determines that the Bank's reduction in earnings is a result of: (i) A change in the terms of advances (other than subsidized advances) to members which is not justified by market conditions; (ii) Inordinate operating and administrative expenses; or (iii) Mismanagement. The ``reduction in earnings'' language replaces the term ``financial instability'' used in the Board's existing regulation, because the former is the term used in the Act. See 12 CFR 960.11(c); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). In addition, the requirement in ยง960.11(c)(5) of the Board's existing regulation that the Bank shall disapprove an application if for any other reason the temporary suspension is not warranted, is deleted in the proposed rule because it is not required by the Act, and limits the Board's discretion to balance reasons warranting approval of an application for a temporary suspension. See 12 CFR 960.11(c)(5); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6). 3. Board Decision Section 960.19(c) of the proposed rule provides that the Board shall approve or disapprove a Bank's application for a temporary suspension within 30 calendar days of receipt of such application, and the Board's decision shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by specific findings and reasons for its action. A copy of the Board's decision shall be forwarded to each of the Banks. 4. Board Approval of Application for Temporary Suspension Section 960.19(d)(1) of the proposed rule provides that if the Board approves a Bank's application for a temporary suspension, the Board's written decision shall specify the period of time such suspension shall remain in effect.
