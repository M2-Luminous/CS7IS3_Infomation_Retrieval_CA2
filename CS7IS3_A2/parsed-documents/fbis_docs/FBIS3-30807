The goal of the draft bill we submit is to improve in a qualitative manner the normative basis of this sphere, under conditions of social democratization and the new international relations. The Law on General Military Service, which has been operative since 1958, does not correspond any longer to the new social requirements. The establishment of state organs which have leading functions vis-a-vis the Armed Forces and the defense, as well as the separation of powers among them, must be resolved by a law. Thus much friction, which is evident now, will be eliminated. The draft bill is based on the fundamental principles of civil leadership and parliamentary control over the Armed Forces' activity, banning the Bulgarian Army from participating in resolving tasks of internal political character, legally determining the rights, duties, and responsibilities of the military and improving their social prestige, legally determining the prerogatives of the state organs related to guiding the country's defense, providing the legal possibility of alternative service without having to operate weapons, legally settling the Army's participation in the organs of local administration, and determining the physical and judicial entities involved in the country's defense. As a structure the bill consists of two logically related parts -- on defense and on the Armed Forces. They treat the subject of the higher state organs' prerogatives in the area of defense, the prerogatives of the president of the Republic of Bulgaria as the supreme commander in chief, and the prerogatives of the Council of Ministers related to the general leadership of the Armed Forces. The draft bill explicitly points out that the minister of defense is and will be a civilian. This conforms to the ban on the military's political activity and represents one of the manners of implementing a total civilian control. The functions of the defense minister and chief of the General Staff are regulated by the draft bill. On the basis of Article 9 of the Bulgarian Constitution the draft bill envisages that the Armed Forces consist of the Bulgarian Army, the Interior Ministry Troops, the National Intelligence Service, the National Security Service, and the National Protection Service. A separate bill will regulate the Military Police's organization and activity. This is an important Army unit. A special attention was devoted to the status of the military, namely, entering the regular military service, the municipal organs' role in preparing mobilization, the military's rights and duties, social security, and disciplinary, property, and administrative- penal responsibility. The conditions of the military's training and professional development, as well as their material security, leisure, and leave are specified in the draft bill. The draft bill envisages that the length of military service will be 15 months. It also envisages the possibility of alternative military service without the use of weapons. The regulations and conditions of carrying out military service will be settled through another special draft bill. In the interest of national security the draft bill envisages a ban on the participation of the military in political parties, organizations, and associations with political goals. Simultaneously, as an expression of democratism, they have been afforded the possibility of uniting in associations on a professional basis. The new elements in the draft bill are related to the military ranks attached to specific officers' duties. Promotions will be effected when the officers are transferred to posts which require a specific rank. This is a very important element. I must tell you that four years ago there was a very grave situation in the Army, when many high-ranking officers implemented inappropriate tasks. This caused then a certain inflating of the officer corps. I think that the normal pyramid of military subordination will be restored through the adoption and implementation of this bill. The contract principle is established by the draft bill as the strategy in cadre policy, which provides the military with legal, professional, and social guarantees. This will create the possibility of a gradual transition toward a professional army. The military service age limit for the various ranks was determined in accordance with the practice in most European states and needs of the Army itself. I think that the draft bill that has been submitted to your attention represents a legal foundation on which all legislative aspects of the sphere of the Armed Forces and defense will develop. The adoption of this draft bill will facilitate the implementation of the reform in the Army in accordance with the processes of democratizing society. Thank you for your attention!
