FR940124-1-00052 FR940124-1-00008 Section 602.26(b)(4)␣ Fiscal and administrative capacity as appropriate to the specified scale of operations . Section 496(a)(5)(D) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address the fiscal and administrative capacity of an institution or program in relation to its scale of operation. It is the Secretary's view that the purpose of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine whether the institution or program is fiscally and administratively sound and will likely remain so for a future period. Because the financial condition of an institution is subject to change, the Secretary proposes that an agency must make this determination each time it grants accreditation, preaccreditation, or reaccreditation. The Secretary also proposes that an agency must examine each institution's financial capacity in sufficient depth on an annual basis to determine if the financial capacity of the institution threatens the ability of the institution or program to continue to meet the agency's standards and, if so, to take appropriate follow-up action. The Secretary invites comments as to whether this follow-up action should include notifying the Secretary of the institution's financial condition. The Secretary believes that the enhanced financial monitoring by accrediting agencies that is required by these proposed regulations will provide increased protection to students with regard to problems arising from an institution's financial instability. Section 602.26(b)(5)␣ Student support services. The Secretary found that the standards most accrediting agencies have adopted to evaluate an institution's or program's student support services relate to the overall quality and extent of the services provided and their appropriateness in light of the institution's or program's mission and the types of students it admits. The Secretary considers all of these elements to be good practices for the assessment of student support services. Accordingly, the Secretary requests specific comment as to whether the manner in which these agencies handle standards for this area would be a useful addition to these regulations. The Secretary also invites additional comments regarding other elements that the Secretary should include in the evaluation of accrediting agencies for compliance with this requirement. Section 602.26(b)(6)␣ Recruiting and admission practices; and academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising . Section 496(a)(5)(F) requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's or program's recruiting and admissions practices, as well as its academic calendars, catalogs, publications, grading, and advertising. The Secretary believes this statutory provision contains two different standards. One standard relates to the appropriateness of the institution's or program's recruiting and admission practices. Under this standard, the agency must determine whether an institution's practices are reasonable in light of the institution's or program's educational mission.
