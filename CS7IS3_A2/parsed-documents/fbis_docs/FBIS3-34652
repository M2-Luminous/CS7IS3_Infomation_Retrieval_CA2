"This is an accord on issues which are unimportant in relation to the ultimate goal of achieving a just peace," the former chief Palestinian negotiator at the Washington peace talks told AFP. "The key issue to be resolved, which may lead to a just peace, is that of ending the (Israeli) settlements in Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories," he said. 'Abd-al-Shafi earlier told the Arabic daily Al-Quds: "Palestine existed before this agreement, and will exist after it, but the accord will not allow Palestine ever to appear on the map of the Middle East." He was commenting on PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat's statement after signing the accord that the name of Palestine had returned to the map of the Middle East. Meanwhile Sufyan Abu-Zayda, a representative of 'Arafat's Fatah movement in the occupied Gaza Strip, told AFP the accord "only deals with a tiny part of our demands, and will not last long if the occupation and settlements remain." The Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS, which is opposed to the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal signed in Washington on September 13, said the Cairo security agreement was "worthless," and "fulfils Israeli conditions." "The settlements will remain a breeding ground for provocation and tension, and will allow Israel to justify its persecution of the Palestinians," said HAMAS official Khalid al-Hindi.
