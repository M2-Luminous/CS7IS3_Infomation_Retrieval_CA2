Meanwhile, Secretary of State Warren Christopher has postponed his departure for the Middle East in order to enable Israel and the PLO to conclude their complex negotiations before an effort is made to expedite the Israeli-Syrian talks. On the table at which Muwaffaq al-'Allaf and Itamar Rabinovich will again sit down together will be an Israeli proposal that a phased withdrawal and the establishment of peace be carried out concurrently and over a lengthy period. [Begin Rabinovich recording] We believe an agreement there is an element of a phased implementation and an element of reciprocity or interface [preceding word in English], as it was termed in a CNN interview -- namely, the link between the implementation of withdrawal and the measure of peace dispensed during that phase. [end recording] Meanwhile, it appears that not much will happen in the 13th round, and those who entertained the hope that the Israeli-Syrian talks will achieve a breakthrough in the spring now hope it will happen by the end of 1994 at the latest.
