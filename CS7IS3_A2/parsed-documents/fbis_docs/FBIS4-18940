These were the words of Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri, who was replying to statements made by the Russian ultra-nationalist leader condemning the raids on Serb positions in the town of Gorazde, which were carried out by two F-18 [as received] bombers belonging to NATO forces. The planes left from Aviano, in Friuli. "Italy," stressed Fabbri, "guarantees its participation in all legitimate NATO and UN operations that protect UNPROFOR units and avert the massacre of civilians."
