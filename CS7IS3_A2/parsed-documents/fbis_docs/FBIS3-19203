Ortner] [Text] Changes have been made in the group of WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE shareholders. KURIER, which has so far held 49.5 percent, is leaving and transferring its shares to the HANDELSBLATT publishing group, which now holds 99 percent of the company (1 percent still belongs to Peter Michael Lingens). Thus, the Austrian WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE has finally been integrated in a highly reputed, international publishing group, which comprises publications such as HANDELSBLATT, the German WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE, or the Swiss monthly BILANZ. In addition, linked with the group are the S. Fischer publishing house, the Rowohlt publishing house, the Droemersche publishing company, as well as SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN in the United States, to mention just a few. These products and publishing companies have one thing in common -- a high standard which imposes a duty on us and gives you, the readers, the guarantee that WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE's lead in quality will be steadily increased.
