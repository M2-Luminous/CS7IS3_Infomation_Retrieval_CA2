Mr. President, good morning to you and welcome to the Voice of the Arabs. ['Arafat] Good morning. [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, did the Israeli delegation you met with recently propose anything new to you regarding the peace process, especially after Security Council Resolution 904 was issued demanding protection for the Palestinians and disarming the Israeli settlers? ['Arafat] The delegation came to Tunis carrying a few proposals from the Israeli Government, especially after the draft resolution was issued in the Security Council which was passed unanimously, despite some reservations expressed by the American side on the subject of Jerusalem. The delegation put forward the issue of international presence, but as you know, unfortunately, their initial idea was to have international presence in the form of the International Red Cross. I do not want to say too much, but this was completely rejected. I do not wish to devalue the Red Cross, but the Red Cross is there already. It has always been present in the occupied territories and is performing its duties very well. It has submitted many reports condemning Israel for violating human rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention. There are files and files on this matter in Geneva. What we want is a force, a force to protect... [pauses] The Security Council resolution stipulates protecting, protecting, protecting [preceding word in English], protecting the Palestinians. Protecting the Palestinians cannot be done by some employees of the International Red Cross. This is why we insist on an effective international presence. This international presence should be deployed quickly in Hebron. We also want a force from the Palestinian police to be deployed in Hebron quickly. Of course, the Israeli delegation has so far not given us an answer on this topic. We are awaiting the final response from it. It is possible that we will get the final response from the Israeli Government tomorrow or the day after in Cairo on the sidelines of the donor states' meeting which will be held in Cairo on Thursday [24 March]. Our stand is clear and frank: We demand the implementation of what has been agreed on and stipulated at the Security Council. Israel must take actual measures. These measures must be clear; they should first and foremost deal with the armed settlers and how to disarm them. I can tell you for a fact and very precisely that Article No. 2 of Resolution 904 asks Israel, the occupying power, to continue to take and implement measures, among which are the seizure of weapons with the objective of preventing illegitimate acts of violence by the Israeli settlers. The Security Council also calls for implementing measures to protect and safeguard the Palestinian civilians throughout the occupied Palestinian territories. These include temporary international presence, which will be renewed every year like all other international forces all over the world. This is a matter stipulated in the Declaration of Principles. [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, did the Israeli delegation propose the resumption of the peace talks with you? ['Arafat] This will depend on their final reply. Will they adhere to the UN Security Council resolution? Will the two co-sponsors begin implementing the UN Security Council resolution? Will the Israelis adopt effective measures to ensure the non-repetition of new massacres, new frictions, and new massacres? Therefore, we are awaiting their answer on Thursday, God willing. We hope they will bring answers to these questions. In addition, arrests of our people are continuing. They say they have released 900 detainees. But in the meantime they have arrested about 1,500 people in the past three weeks. [Abu-al-Majd] You also met with Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of the peace process. Did you ask him to see to it that the UN Security Council 904 is turned into real action at the basic level? Did he propose to you anything from the U.S. Administration for the protection of the Palestinians in the occupied territories and for the resumption of the peace talks? ['Arafat] In these talks we discussed how to implement the UN Security Council resolution. We received some positive replies upon which, we can say, we can build. [Abu-al-Majd] What are these replies? ['Arafat] International protection, for example. We support this international protection. It is true that its form and size have not been fully determined between us and the Israelis. However, they agree on international protection and on the implementation of UN Security Council 904 and the others measures that must be taken at the basic level. [Abu-al-Majd] Did the U.S. coordinator propose new ideas regarding this protection? ['Arafat] He proposed many things. I prefer not to mention them until full measures are formulated, which our people will see at the basic level and which will reassure them. These measures will ensure their security and protection. These are basic things for us. These measures will also ensure the safety and security of our Islamic and Christian holy shrines. [Abu-al-Majd] If the Israeli reply is not positive in light of these developments, how do you view the peace process in the coming phase? ['Arafat] We should not anticipate events. We are optimistic. This issue is no longer a Palestinian-Israeli issue. After the UN Security Council resolution, it has become the responsibility of the two cosponors to implement this resolution. We must wait and see how this implementation will take place. We should not anticipate events. [Abu-al-Majd] Was Resolution 904 in harmony with the wishes of the Palestinian people at this phase? ['Arafat] Of course not. Do you think that any state can issue any Security Council resolution it wants? We are not a superpower. We, plus the Arab effort, the Islamic effort, the nonaligned effort, and our friends' efforts, were barely able to win this resolution. Nevertheless, as you have seen, the word Jerusalem turned the world upside down. There were attempts that lasted for weeks to persuade us to omit the world Jerusalem. Nobody can omit Jerusalem, neither from our conscience nor from our decisions. Whoever wants to veto, let him veto. Therefore, this was our position. The resolution was delayed because of this for weeks. The resolution was issued. The resolution in itself was not bad. I cannot say we took everything we wanted. However, the resolution was not bad. The most important thing in it is the world consensus. The United Nations is now responsible for this resolution through the two cosponsors, namely the Russian Federation and the United States. [Abu-al-Majd] Does the Israeli and U.S. rejection of proposals made by Russia recently, that a new international conference for peace in the Middle East along the Madrid conference lines take place, mean that the Russian role has started to diminish, or that Russia is also attempting to exert some pressure on these negotiations? What could Russia propose in the next stage? ['Arafat] First of all, you should not forget that Russia is one of the cosponsors of the Madrid peace process. At that time, it was the Soviet Union and then it became the Russian Federation. The Security Council resolution asks the cosponsors of the conference, the Russian Federation and the United States, to implement the aforementioned resolutions. Therefore, their efforts are stipulated in the resolution. Undoubtedly, we notice good and positive activity from Russia, and we welcome this Russian activity. [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, the Israeli housing minister says that he is confident that negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis will resume soon despite the difficulties. Where did the Israeli housing minister get his optimism, given the current obstacles? ['Arafat] [words indistinct] This minister, along with eight other ministers, that is, half the Israeli cabinet, support taking quick measures against the settlers in Hebron, for example. Therefore, I told the delegation that came to visit me here that half their cabinet is against the activities of the settlers. It is not possible to allow such belligerence to continue these days in cooperation with some political parties in Israel. The whole world sees on their television sets what the Israeli military patrols and the armed settlers are doing. Today in Hebron, there was a tragedy. The houses of Palestinians are being shelled with rockets in southern Hebron under the pretext that there are two outlaws being chased. For the sake of two people we destroy the whole town. This prompts us to affirm that what is happening is collusion between the Army and the armed settlers. Hebron has not yet bandaged its wounds. It is still bleeding. And they go ahead and start this fierce battle in it. [Abu-al-Majd] Do you believe that given the situation now, there is need for a meeting between you and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to resolve all these problems? ['Arafat] I would like to meet with him, but we do not want a meeting like the past ones in which we did not reach any solutions. Are we supposed to add fuel to the fire? I am ready to meet him, but a final decision should be made to accurately and honestly implement what was agreed on and signed in the White House in September of last year, and recently the Security Council resolution that was issued a couple of days ago. [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, how do you view the Egyptian effort now at this stage to help set the Palestinian people on the practical road to establishing their entity? ['Arafat] I wish to thank my brother Husni Mubarak for his patience with us and his concerted efforts, as well as the efforts of his brothers in the Egyptian Government, including the Foreign Ministry efforts and those of Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. We cannot forget them. Our people are recording these efforts with great love and appreciation, and we cannot forget such efforts. It is not strange for Egypt to do this. The relationship that links Egypt with Palestine is not a superficial relationship. No. It is a strong relationship which goes back through the ages historically, geographically, politically, and religiously, with Jerusalem, the third holiest Islamic shrine, the Prophet's destination in his night journey from Mecca, and the cradle of Christ. Therefore, once again, I thank President Mubarak and my brothers in Egypt for their efforts on all levels. My people will never forget their stands. Once again, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. [Abu-al-Majd] Finally, Palestinian President 'Arafat, what do you wish to tell the steadfast Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories over the Voice of the Arabs? ['Arafat] If God helps you, nobody can overcome you [Koranic verse]. I wish to tell my people, be patient and trust in God. I know that our people are a great people who cannot be shaken by a conspiracy, nor can their determination, patience, belief, or jihad be affected by a massacre. In fact, massacres only increase their determination, strength, and persistence to continue along their path. The Palestinian people have been established on the political and geographic map of the region. No one can reject these Palestinian people or the crucial factor they constitute in the Middle East peace equation. [Abu-al-Majd] Dear brothers, at the end of this dialogue, we thank you and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who was with us over the telephone lines between Cairo and Tunis. Thank you Mr. President. ['Arafat] Thank you.
