Simferopol believes that a solution to Crimea's economic problems largely depends on compliance with the Ukrainian President's decree "On an Open Economy Regime in Crimea." The spokesman noted that disregard for the decree was one of the economic reasons why the law on the restoration of the constitutional basis of Crimea as a state had been passed on 20 May. As Interfax has learned, at a meeting Sunday morning Crimean legislators considered what actions Ukraine was likely to take if no agreement were reached. It was suggested that Kiev might resort to an economic blockade or supply commodities to Crimea only at world prices. In such an event, Crimean lawmakers proposed charging for the lease of land by Ukrainian armed forces and the Black Sea Fleet at world levels. According to their estimates, payment at world prices for the 50,000 hectares of land occupied by the Ukrainian army, and for the 52,000 hectares of land held by the Black Sea Fleet "will surpass expenditures for electricity and water from Ukraine." "The Crimean delegation is going to Kiev with such an approach. At its evening conference, only concrete proposals will be made," the spokesman said.
