Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-21JAN94-Russia New Setbacks for Reformers at Opening of Duma SUMMARY The opening days of the State Duma brought new signs of the weakness of reformers and strength of anti-reform parties, especially the Agrarians and Communists, in the election of a speaker and the registration of party factions. The Agrarian Party's candidate, Communist Party (CPRF) Deputy Chairman Ivan Rybkin, was elected speaker of the Duma almost by default, as reform parties were unable to work together and failed to get a candidate onto the final ballot. The formal registration of party factions revealed that the Agrarian Party has considerably expanded its expected membership since the election, while the Russia's Choice faction appeared smaller than its leaders had expected and now is showing signs of splitting. END SUMMARY The selection of a Duma speaker, carried out mainly in secret talks among factions, turned into a fiasco for the disunited reformers. Instead of working with other reform parties and independents to agree on a single candidate to put up against the communists and other hardliners, Russia's Choice entered into long and ultimately fruitless talks with the three other biggest parties--the anti-reform CPRF, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal- Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and the Agrarians--trying to agree on a package dividing up the posts of speaker, deputy speakers, and committee chairmanships. However, the three anti- reform parties worked together against Russia's Choice and presented such tough demands that Russia's Choice eventually broke off talks, accusing the other three of making unreasonable demands (Interfax, 7, 8 January). Russia's Choice's negotiations with the other big blocs appeared to alienate some potential allies among the other reformers, and each of the three reformist blocs ended up supporting its own candidate. Russia's Choice backed Sergey Kovalev, while Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's bloc pushed Vladimir Lukin, and Sergey Shakhray's Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) pushed Shakhray (ITAR- TASS, 12 January). Shakhray assailed the big four parties for conducting talks excluding smaller parties (Segodnya, Krasnaya Zvezda, 5 January). He appeared to look to independents and regional deputies for allies, rather than to Russia's Choice. When Shakhray finally gave up on his own hopes for the speaker's post, he threw his support behind Vladimir Medvedev, nominee of a newly created "New Regional Policy" group of independents (ITAR- TASS, 13 January). While reformers were in disarray, the CPRF, LDPR, and Agrarians appeared able to work together closely. Although they apparently did not finally settle on one candidate until the opening of the Duma, in late December Russia's Choice leader Arkadiy Murashev already claimed that the three parties had secretly decided to back the Agrarian Party's Rybkin for speaker (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 30 December). (See Note 1) Segodnya on 5 January concluded that Zhirinovskiy's party had decided to back Agrarian- Communist candidate Rybkin--although Zhirinovskiy himself later briefly sought the post, according to ITAR-TASS on 12 January. Rybkin personifies the clear connection between the CPRF and Agrarians since he is simultaneously an Agrarian Party leader and deputy chairman of the CPRF. In the old parliament he was leader of the "Communists of Russia" faction. (Note 1) Selskaya Zhizn on 15 January asserted that Nikolay Travkin's Democratic Party of Russia also joined in a coalition with the Agrarians and CPRF, and Segodnya on 15 January wrote that Travkin was allied with the Agrarians and CPRF in backing Rybkin. When the voting for speaker began on 12 January, it appeared that even the anti-reform deal had broken down, as each individual party nominated its own favorite candidate or candidates--ten in all (Selskaya Zhizn, 15 January). Four--Zhirinovskiy, Shakhray, Anatoliy Lukyanov, and Valentin Kovalev--withdrew before the voting (Izvestiya, 15 January). Kovalev, a nonparty candidate backed by the CPRF, withdrew in favor of Rybkin, while Zhirinovskiy withdrew and the LDPR's secretary ordered its deputies to back Yuriy Vlasov, candidate of the nationalist Russian Way group (Izvestiya, 15 January). The anti-reform parties apparently pushed through a proposal to hold a preliminary vote to narrow the field of six remaining candidates. Russia's Choice, now apparently courting the small parties and independents, objected that this would be unfair to small factions and independents (Interfax, 13 January). In the preliminary vote, deputies were able to vote for more than one candidate (Izvestiya, 15 January), and two communist-conservative candidates came out on top--Rybkin with 233 and Vlasov with 2OO (ITAR-TASS, 13 january; Izvestiya, 15 January). Russia's Choice candidate Sergey Kovalev came out next to last with 138 votes (Izvestiya, 15 january). CPRF Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov, noting the "democratic blocs' failure in the preliminary ballot," claimed that Russia's Choice had already begun to disintegrate (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 15 January). When the formal secret balloting was held on 14 January, deputies had a choice only between two anti-Yeltsin and anti-reform candidates (See Box One). Moreover, even that choice was largely ended when Vlasov (who had worked with the CPRF leaders in the recent past) announced before the vote that he would support Rybkin (ITAR-TASS, 14 January). Rybkin won with 223 votes (Radio Mayak, 14 January), a bare majority of the 444 deputies but far more than the strength of the combined CPRF-LDPR-Agrarian factions (163), indicating he won the votes of many independents and perhaps even some reformers. It appears, however, that many reformers did not vote at all: Rybkin's vote was 223 for and 101 against, totalling only 324 of the 444 deputies, and only 334 (23 for, 311 against) voted on Vlasov (Radio Mayak, 14 January), indicating that at least 110 deputies did not vote. Yavlinskiy and Shakhray announced that their factions had voted against both candidates (Segodnya, 15 January). Registration of Factions The reformers' weakness and their foes' strength was also evident in the registration of party factions at the opening of the Duma. The official membership figures for each faction announced on 13 January indicate that Russia's Choice has considerably fewer formal adherents than its leaders had previously claimed, while the Agrarian faction ended up with many more than previous figures had suggested. Perhaps indicating a fluid boundary between the Agrarian and CPRF factions, the CPRF faction has shrunk, registering fewer members than ran under its banner in the election. Meanwhile, a newly.formed faction of centrist independents has displaced Zhirinovskiy's party as the second largest in the Duma (See Box Two). Reform Factions The failure of the expected number of deputies to formally enroll in the Russia's Choice faction suggests that the bloc--a hastily formed coalition of reformist organizations--is already fragmenting. The first meeting of the Russia's Choice faction on 27 December had claimed 94 members, although only 65 attended (Interfax, 28 December), and Gaydar on 9 January again claimed 94 (ITAR-TASS, 10 January). Russia's Choice faction Secretary Sergey Yushenkov on 18 January reported that the faction had grown from 76 to 78 (Interfax, 18 january). Although splintering into small factions is to a certain extent discouraged by the Duma's decision to not allow the formation of any faction smaller than 35 (See Box Three), some prominent members of Russia's Choice have already declared their intention to split off. Finance Minister Boris Fedorov and lawyer Andrey Makarov announced they were leaving Russia's Choice to join a new faction--" the Union of 12 December"--being formed by Irina Khakamada of the Economic Freedom Party and Moscow Deputy Premier Aleksandr Braginskiy of the Russian Movement of Democratic Reforms (Interfax, 18 January). Fedorov indicated he was angry that Gaydar decided to resign as first deputy premier without consulting his cabinet colleagues, according to the 19 january Segodnya, which also stated that many of the new Khakamada faction had come from Russia's Choice. Giving further indication of dissention within Russia's Choice, Segodnya reported that some Russia's Choice members had revolted against Gaydar at a meeting just before the Duma opened, proposing to elect Gennadiy Burbulis as faction head. Members of the component groups of Russia's Choice appear to behave as members of independent organizations making their own policies. Democratic Russia leaders Lev Ponomarev and Gleb Yakunin recently threatened to withdraw support for Yeltsin and the cabinet if he did not drop agriculture chief Aleksandr Zaveryukha as deputy premier. Complaining that the impending reorganization of the cabinet may drop some reformist deputy premiers while leaving Zaveryukha, who represents the Agrarian Party "which consistently opposes reform policy and the presidential decree on land," the DemRossiya leaders said their party "will be forced to revise its course of supporting presidential and government policy" if reformers are dropped and Zaveryukha retained (Interfax, 12 January; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 13 January). Despite the fact that some Duma rules work against small factions, Russia's Choice has been debating whether to split into two big pseudo-independent factions for tactical reasons--to take advantage of the privileges granted to factions by the new Duma rules. Each faction gets a vote in the Duma's presidium, and by splitting Russia's Choice can have two votes (Segodnya, 18 January). Russia's Choice Secretary Yushenkov explicitly referred to such a strategy on 16 January (Interfax, 16 January). While Russia's Choice has appeared to fragment and shrink, Shakhray's reformist PRES registered a larger number of members than included in the published lists of candidates and winners or previous estimates. This apparently reflects the recent decision of a group of 20 "financial and industrial" independents led by St. Petersburg entrepreneur Mark Goryachev, who was elected with the support of the Civic Union, to join PRES, raising the faction's size to 40 (ITAR-TASS, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 January; Segodnya, 13 January). Even with the addition, however, PRES has officially registered only 30 members. Anti-Reform Factions The relatively large gain in registered members for the Agrarian Party suggests that a number of rural officials--chiefs of local agricultural administrations, farm managers, etc.--who did not run as Agrarian Party candidates in the election have now joined the faction to lobby for rural interests. The size of the Agrarian faction puts pressure on Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin to retain Agrarian Party leader Zaveryukha, who has fought reformers over agricultural subsidies, as a deputy premier. The failure of all deputies elected as CPRF adherents to register with their party faction suggests that the Communists, who have heretofor appeared more disciplined than the looser blocs, may be having some problems of factionalism or that they may be allowing some members to form satellite factions. The CPRF faction registered only 45, even though 48 had been identified with the CPRF in the list of winners. One of the straying communists was Anatoliy Lukyanov, who, even though running on the CPRF party list, apparently did not join its faction, as the 12 january Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported him trying to form a separate conservative "Russian Way" faction. Segodnya on 13 january asserted that the CPRF had specifically sent Lukyanov and a group of its members to help Vlasov form the "Russian Way" faction. The LDPR's 63 fell slightly short of the number identified in the list of winners and of party leaders' claims. The list of winners in the 28 December Rossiyskaya Gazeta identified 64 LDPR members, while Zhirinovskiy had claimed 59 party list deputies and 5 district deputies at the first meeting of the LDPR faction on 10 january (ITAR-TASS, 10 january), and LDPR cochairman Aleksandr Vengerovskiy on 11 january claimed his faction would consist of the 59 party list deputies plus 6 district deputies, totalling 65 (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 January). In view of Stankevich's statement that some deputies may still join factions, stray LDPR deputies may simply be slow in joining their party's faction. Independents In a move that may herald a resurrection of centrism in the Duma, a mixed group of centrist industrialists and officials managed to form the second largest faction, the "New Regional Policy" faction. Izvestiya on 14 January said that "judging by the group's declaration," it wants to occupy the center ground formerly held by the Civic Union, which failed to win the minimum 5 percent in the election. The core of the faction, according to Izvestiya, is the leaders of big enterprises, and it includes almost all army generals elected to the Duma and varied members ranging from representatives of republics headed by former CPSU Secretary Aleksandr Dzasokhov (from North Ossetia) to controversial millionaire businessman Artem Tarasov (from Moscow city). Izvestiya also saw a connection with Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, since the premier's assistant Vladimir Kvasov (Moscow Oblast), leader of the cabinet's apparat and recently promoted to ministerial rank (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 10 January), joined the new faction. So, according to Izvestiya, "the talk in the Duma corridors is that the new association enjoys the sympathy of the premier." Implications The reformist parties in the Duma appear to be compounding their poor showing in the December elections through their inability to cooperate to further common interests, and the main reformist bloc--Russia's Choice--appears to be in danger of disintegrating. In contrast, the anti-reform parties' ability to work together (aided by partially overlapping leadership of the Agrarians and Communists) thus far has allowed them to control key decisions even though they do not actually have a majority of the Duma within their own ranks. This state of affairs bodes ill for prospects for cooperation between President Yeltsin and the Duma, but fortunately for Yeltsin, the new constitution allows him to avoid an immediate potential confrontation by giving him the power to appoint new members of the cabinet without seeking Duma confirmation. Box 1 Choice Between Two Anti-Yeltsin Candidates The two candidates for Duma speaker--Ivan Rybkin from the Agrarians and Communists and Yuriy Vlasov from the nationalist "Russian Way" (ITAR-TASS, 13 January)--both appear anti-Yeltsin and anti-reform, with Vlasov perhaps even more hostile to reformers than Rybkin. Rybkin is a somewhat reformist communist, who after the August 1991 putsch praised Aleksandr Yakovlev, Eduard Shevardnadze, and Mikhail Gorbachev as the "intellectual nucleus" of the communist party (Interfax, 10 September 1991). But he also later defended the CPSU against Yeltsin, joining with nationalist Sergey Baburin and others to ask the Constitutional Court to review the constitutionality of Yeltsin's ban on the CPSU (ITAR-TASS, 7 May 1992). Long a prominent communist official, he had been second secretary of the Volgograd CPSU Obkom, then coordinator of the "Communists of Russia" faction in the old Russian parliament, then head of the Russian Communist Party's Central Committee Department for Ties with Soviets (Interfax, 10 September 1991). In October 1991 he helped dissident communist Roy Medvedev organize the "Socialist Workers Party" (Izvestiya, 11 October 1991; Interfax, 26 October 1991). At the February 1993 congress of the CPRF that elected Zyuganov chairman, Rybkin and present Agrarian Party Chairman Mikhail Lapshin were elected deputy chairmen (ITAR-TASS, 15 February 1993). He, like Lapshin, migrated to the new Agrarian Party later in 1993. He opposed Yeltsin's 21 September dissolution of parliament and worked in the parliament during Yeltsin's September-October siege (Komsomolskaya Pravda, 15 January). After being elected speaker, however, Rybkin pledged to cooperate with Yeltsin, to work for consensus, and to "rise above his party allegiance" (ITAR-TASS, 14 January). Segodnya on 15 January quoted one Russia's Choice deputy characterizing Rybkin as an enlightened communst--someone who rose "on the late Gorbachev wave" and "not some sort of Zyuganov." Vlasov, who won 200 votes in the first round of balloting, initially had the reputation of a reformer but later emerged as a radical nationalist and conservative. A former champion weight lifter who was elected to the USSR Congress of People's Deputies in 1989, he won celebrity on 31 May 1989 by openly and harshly denouncing the KGB at one of the first sessions of the congress (Pravda, 2 June 1989), creating a sensation and helping to set a new tone of outspokenness for the Soviet parliament, which for the first time had been elected from among multiple candidates. Since then, however, he has repeatedly worked with ultranationalists and communists, for example, joining with Gen. Albert Makashov, Aleksandr Nezvorov, Sazhi Umalatova, CPRF Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov, and Zhirinovskiy at a mid-1992 "Russian National Convention" (ITAR-TASS, 12 June 1992; Radio Rossii, 15 June 1992), and in October 1993 becoming the No. 1 candidate for conservative Viktor Aksyuchits's Christian Democratic Movement (Izvestiya, 19 October 1993), which, however, failed to get enough signatures to get on the December ballot. Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported on 12 January 1994 that he was working with communist leader Anatoliy Lukyanov, Baburin, and Nezvorov to get enough members to register a nationalist "Russian Way" faction in the Duma. In his speech as a candidate for speaker at the Duma session, Vlasov bluntly told Russia's Choice that "I have opposed you and will continue to do so" (Izvestiya, 15 January). End Box 1 Box 2 Size of Factions Chairman of the State Duma's temporary secretariat Sergey Stankevich announced on 13 January that nine factions have been registered and gave the size of each faction. He cautioned that "these figures were not final because deputies were continuing to apply for membership" in the factions (Interfax, 13 January). In addition to the eight parties apparently automatically entitled to faction status for clearing the 5 percent barrier in the election, a group of independents--the New Regional Policy group- -registered as a faction. The figures given by Stankevich add up to 386 of the 444 elected deputies, indicating that 58 are still unassociated with any faction.

In parentheses is a count including those identified with the party in the 30 November Rossiyskaya Gazeta list of candidates but not in the 28 December list of winners (see the Trends of 5 January 1994, pages 14, 15, 18). ***A 20 December ITAR-TASS report based on "reliable government sources." This has been the highest count for all parties except Yavlinskiy's to appear anywhere. Candidates from the Civic Union, the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, Dignity and Charity, and Future of Russia also won some district seats (see the Trends of 5 January 1994, page 15, 18), but these factions had too few deputies to form a faction. ****Stankevich said 75, according to the 13 january Interfax, but the 14 January Izvestiya and Trud accounts said 76. End Box 2 Box 3 Minimum Size for Factions The Duma after much wrangling decided on 11 january that factions must have at least 35 members (ITAR-TASS, 11 January; Segodnya, 12 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Krasnaya Zvezda, 13 January). Although some groups have responded to this minimum requirement by joining other factions and abandoning ambitions to go it alone, others persist in efforts to attract enough members to constitute a separate faction. According to the 14 january Izvestiya, an "industrial and financial" group failed to gather enough members to form a faction, apparently prompting it to join PRES (ITAR-TASS, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 january). Izvestiya on 14 January said that a "patriotic" group led by former CPSU Politburo member Lukyanov was still trying to form a faction, while Nezavisimaya Gazeta on 12 January said that nationalist Baburin was forming a "Russian Way" group with Lukyanov, extremist television commentator Nezvorov, and Vlasov, but still had not reached 35. Segodnya on 13 January asserted that Vlasov had asked the CPRF to send some of its members to join his group to make it big enough to be a faction and that a group of communists led by Lukyanov had responded. Izvestiya reported that Economic Freedom Party leader Khakamada had failed to form a faction and had joined Russia's Choice, but later reports indicated Khakamada's "Union of 12 December" group was growing and may reach 35. Interfax reported on 16 january that Khakamada's faction had already gathered 23 members and Segodnya on 19 january reported it had 22 members and "verbal assurances" of joining from 8 others. The 35-member minimum did not disbar the parties that made it over the 5 percent threshold in the party list voting but received fewer than 35 seats--PRES with 30, the Yavlinskiy bloc with 25, Women of Russia with 23, Democratic Party of Russia (DPR) with 15--from being officially recognized as factions.
