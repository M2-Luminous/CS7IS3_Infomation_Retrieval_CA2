These rapid tightening measures were taken in just the two and a half months since February. And, again FRB Chairman Greenspan issued a "monetary tightening" statement concurrent with the tightening action. The first two measures were announced following policy decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) composed of FRB directors and FRB regional presidents, but the third money-tightening measure did not have any direct participation by the FOMC. It appears that the FRB is taking the approach of publicly disclosing policy changes regardless of whether an FOMC session is involved. There are various views on why the FRB has adopted the approach of publicly disclosing policy at the time money-tightening measures are taken. First is the "Congressional consideration" view which gave consideration for the heightening demand in Congress for the immediate public announcement of monetary policy when a decision is made. Second is the "market consideration" view calling for the necessity to explain FRB intent in words rather than through market operations so as to prevent excessive stock market reactions to precautioonary money-tightening measures. Third is the "central bank authority" view to strongly demonstrate the autonomy of the FRB in relation to the government on monetary policy. Whether just one of these reasons or several reasons apply is unclear, but it is definitely a case where FRB policy approach has changed substantially in connection with the recent money-tightening measures when compared to past practice. We now hear vociferous debate on potential successors for Bank of Japan (BOJ) President Mieno, whose tenure will expire at the end of the year. President Mieno cites as qualifications of a successor president an "individual who can discharge the duties of the central bank." One might say that I am premature in view of the debate being held on whether the recession has bottomed out, but if one were to lay out the issue facing the next BOJ president, it might be the "timely conversion to a money-tightening stance." During the question-and-answer phase after a speech given at the Foreign Correspondents Club, President Mieno on the 19th stated in reference to monetary policy during the bubble economy, "Interest rates were raised in the late stages of the bubble and as a result the actions were untimely," indicating that lessons were learned from the fact that countermeasures against asset inflation were untimely as the result of placing too much emphasis on traditional commodity price indices such as consumer prices. There were times such as in connection with the 1987 Black Monday when there was no choice but to delay monetary-tightening measures for fear of adversely affecting stock markets in Japan, the United States, and Europe, but the perception is strong even within the BOJ that there were some oversights in policy matters in the latter stages of the bubble. In general, in the area of monetary policy, since the government basically welcomes monetary easing, little friction exists between the central bank and the government. Problems arise in the monetary tightening phase and tension between the government and central bank rises easily, especially during changes from easing to tightening phases. When and how smoothly he implements the next tightening move will be the foremost highlight of the next BOJ president's monetary policies. FRB Chairman Greenspan was faced with the same issue before Japan was. In response, he has said, "I will assume a policy encompassing a public disclosure approach," and has placed that approach in practice. It may be premature to evaluate whether this approach was the right one, but the FRB has certainly demonstrated a clear-cut position. In contrast, has the BOJ prepared itself for the upcoming contingencies? First, the current BOJ process of making monetary policy decisions and handling public announcements is obscure. When it comes to market interest rate adjustments, it says nothing except to say, "Please look at the daily adjustments reflected in the markets." Even if they decide to say something, it happens in the form of a BOJ press conference where a change in interest adjustment policy is acknowledged several weeks after implementation. Further, although the official discount rate is, in principle, set at the BOJ Policy Committee, in reality, it undergoes quick approval at a "general meeting," but prior approval during roundtable discussions of the board of directors and coordination with the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. The minutes of the BOJ Policy Committee are eventually published in summary format, but the nature and contents of debate leading to the policy decisions are not disclosed. The proceedings are structured so that only privileged insiders are privy to the monetary policy decisionmaking process. Although MOF support is usually extended to the BOJ during monetary easing periods, that is not always the case during monetary tightening phases. There are times when monetary tightening must be undertaken, even when such action is contrary to the wishes of the government. I believe such situations should be handled in a manner so that BOJ intentions and contents of decision are promptly made public without the risk of misunderstandings.
