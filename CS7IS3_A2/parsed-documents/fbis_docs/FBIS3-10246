From Edelberto Garcia, at the command post, we have a report: [Garcia] Good morning, "First Thing in the Morning" listeners. In the wee hours this morning, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro visited the command post of the Defense Council of Plaza de la Revolucion Municipality, which was activated yesterday in view of possible imminent storm surges along this part of the Havana coastline. So far, however, there have been only slight surges. Fidel arrived at this coordinating point for the municipality -- which is located at the headquarters of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] -- at 0220 and quickly asked how penetration by the sea might affect the area. This is the second threat of storm surges so far this year. (Eduardo Tejera), PCC first secretary in Plaza de la Revolucion Municipality, briefed the leader of the Revolution on the measures that have been taken, which include the moving of all foodstuffs from gastronomic and commercial centers, the cleaning of storm drains, and the evacuation of 50 percent of the tourists lodged at the Habana Riviera Hotel. Fidel explained that he had visited the Riviera [Hotel] area and had been able to see the measures that had been taken, as well as the retaining wall built recently in front of the hotel to reduce the effect of the waves. In this connection, he explained the importance of providing protective mechanisms for any new hotels that may be built in these areas because everything seems to indicate that, as a result of several phenomena, these surges will tend to increase. Fidel pointed out: We have already had two threats this year; and this one is still not over, because there will be another high tide at noon today and with it returns the threat of possible flooding in low-lying areas of five municipalities in this capital. The commander in chief had a long and pleasant talk with reporters until after 0330. Fidel insisted -- and I wish to stress this to our listeners -- on his concern that the population remain attentive to the reports issued by the weather institute in the next few hours. By the way, there will be a meeting at approximately 0700 today at the headquarters of this city's provincial government to take specific measures in this connection. This has been Edelberto Garcia, reporting from the command post of the Defense Council of Plaza de la Revolucion Municipality for "First Thing in the Morning."
