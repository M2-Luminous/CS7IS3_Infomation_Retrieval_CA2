FR940126-1-00007 FR940126-1-00005 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 227 Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat: Petition To List Coho Salmon Throughout Its Range in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of petition finding and request for information. SUMMARY: NMFS has received a petition to list, either on an emergency basis or through normal listing procedures, coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ) throughout its range in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, and to designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The petition presents substantial scientific information indicating that the request for a non-emergency listing may be warranted. Therefore, NMFS is initiating a status review to determine if the petitioned action is warranted. To ensure that the review is comprehensive, NMFS is soliciting information and data regarding this action. Information received during the comment period for this status review will be used in NMFS' ongoing review of coho salmon populations in California, Oregon, and Washington (including Puget Sound). DATES: Comments and information must be received on March 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the petition are available from, and comments should be submitted to, Merritt Tuttle, Chief, Environmental and Technical Services Division, NMFS, 911 NE 11th Avenue, room 620, Portland, OR 97232. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Garth Griffin, NMFS, Northwest Region (503) 230&hyph;5430; Jim Lecky, NMFS, Southwest Region, (310) 980&hyph;4015; or Marta Nammack, NMFS, Office of Protected Resources, (301) 713&hyph;2322. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 4 of the ESA contains provisions allowing interested persons to petition the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce to add a species to or remove a species from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and to designate critical habitat. Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1544) requires that, to the maximum extent practicable, within 90 days after receiving such a petition, the Secretary make a finding whether the petition presents substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. Petition Received On October 20, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce received a petition from The Pacific Rivers Council (PRC) and 22 co-petitioners to list, either on an emergency basis or through normal listing procedures, coho salmon throughout its range in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined that there is insufficient evidence demonstrating the existence of an emergency posing a significant risk to the well-being of the species and, thus, the request for an emergency rule is denied. The AA makes a finding that the petition presents substantial scientific information indicating that a non-emergency listing may be warranted based on the criteria specified in 50 CFR 424.14(b)(2), and based on evidence presented in the petition that the petitioned populations may qualify as ``species'' under the ESA, in accordance with NMFS' ``Policy on Applying the Definition of Species under the Endangered Species Act to Pacific Salmon'' (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991). Under section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA, this finding requires that a review of the status of coho salmon populations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California be conducted to determine if the petitioned action is warranted. In keeping with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the ESA, the Secretary will make his determination on the PRC et al. petition within 12 months of the date it was received (October 12, 1993). Information received during this status review will be used in NMFS' ongoing review of coho salmon populations in California, Oregon, and Washington (58 FR 57770, October 27, 1993).
