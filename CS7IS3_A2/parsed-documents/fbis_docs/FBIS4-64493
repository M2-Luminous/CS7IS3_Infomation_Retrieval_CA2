Balladur Versus Chirac According to Philippe Reinhard writing in the 15 April Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, the tension between Balladur and Chirac, "friends for 30 years," was "inevitable." Since both aspire to the presidency, "competition could only turn to declared hostility," Reinhard contends, and the rapid deterioration of their relations is "easily explained." Chirac supporters are all the more "pugnacious" because the prime minister's sustained popularity made them fear for their leader for a long time. However, their rejoicing in Balladur's decreasing popularity may be premature, Reinhard continues. Even if public opinion is now negative about Balladur as prime minister, polls indicate that he is still the voters' favorite for president, while Chirac has never surpassed the "fateful 20 percent" threshhold. As the presidential elections draw nearer, the outcome is "more uncertain than ever," Reinhard writes. Chirac's success will depend on his ability to attract voters beyond his own party; according to Reinhard, his acceptance of centrist Dominique Baudis to head the Right's list for the European Parliament elections suggests he is attempting to do this. As for Balladur, he must first end the decline in his popularity and ensure that no more mistakes are made by being "less attentive" to the "suggestions" of a governing majority that has involved him in controversial issues such as the law on secular education. The beginning of an economic recovery may allow him to solve unemployment--his most pressing problem--by the end of 1994. However, failure to solve this problem will mean Balladur has labored "for the benefit of others," Reinhard concludes. Right Termed `Incorrigible' Reinhard's editorial in the 15 April of LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS terms the Right "incorrigible" because of its propensity to continue quarreling even while aware that division may spell defeat in the presidential elections. The situation is complicated by the fact that candidates "have never been so numerous" in the ranks of the majority, Reinhard writes. Besides Chirac and Balladur, UDF [French Democratic Union] leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing will probably not renounce a last fight for the title. However, the parliamentary domination of the RPR/UDF keeps the two parties' officials from recognizing that the Left has succeeded in partially restructuring itself and that it may profit from the Right's internecine quarrels, Reinhard writes. The deteriorating Chirac-Balladur relationship may presage an "annus horribilis" for the majority, he opines. Unity in the upcoming Euroelections would go a long way toward allaying fears that the Right might lose the presidential elections. Additionally, general observance of the traditional rule postulating a single candidacy as early as the first round of the presidential elections is essential. However, personal ambition and the influence exerted by the potential candidates' entourage will come into play. "As surely as the Trojan war, the candidates' war will also take place," Reinhard predicts. Presidential Term Changing the presidential term from seven to five years would be easy today, Reinhard writes in the 18 April LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS. With few exceptions, most political parties and their leaders advocate it, making adoption of this measure possible. In fact, Giscard d'Estaing recently proposed that a referendum be held on this issue in conjunction with the 12 June Euroelections, a suggestion that Balladur has rejected. While the prime minister's reasons are not "altogether convincing"--the "risk of polluting the Euroelections" that Balladur invoked is seen by Reinhard as "very limited"--his refusal has a justification. The prime minister can "propose" a referendum to the president of the Republic, but the final decision rests with the president, Reinhard writes. President Mitterrand, now in the fourteenth year of his presidency, would be reluctant to oppose the idea and thus open an institutional debate, for some might suggest he apply the five-year limit to his current term as well. Again, if Balladur failed to obtain Mitterrand's agreement on the referendum, other members of the majority, first and foremost Giscard, would denounce Balladur's powerlessness in a cohabitation government, Reinhard contends. However, a genuine debate should take place, he continues, as a seven-year term would be too long for today's potential candidates, all of whom are over 60.
