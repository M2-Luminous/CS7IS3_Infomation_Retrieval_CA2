His remarks came at a news conference covering Ulmanis's recent trip to the United States. He emphasized that the principle of preventive diplomacy has now been put forward at the UN as the corner stone of activity, because with its help it is possible to tackle many issues in the world. UN Secretary-General Butrus Ghali, meeting with Ulmanis, promised to render UN assistance in the process of setting up the Baltic peacekeeping battalion by providing specialist training. Ulmanis noted that protection of individual rights rather than states rights is currently being given more emphasis at the UN at this time.
