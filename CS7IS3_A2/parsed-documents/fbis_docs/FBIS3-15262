This was stated by Mikhail Demurin, deputy director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a briefing he gave today. During his visit to Latvia on 23 and 24 February this year, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said, President Lech Walesa of Poland expressed concern at the allegedly excessive concentration of Russian troops in Kaliningrad Oblast. He also called for: The removal of this tumor, which, in his view, posed a potential threat to security in the region. Such statements do not contribute to stability in the Baltic region and are clearly not in keeping with the spirit of recent Russian-Polish accords, including ones reached at summit level, Demurin stressed.
