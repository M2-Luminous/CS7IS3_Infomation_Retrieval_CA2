This time around, in a departure from the previous time, Baghdad apparently chose a European capital, rather than Amman, to leak the "information" and opted for a French rather than a Palestinian mediator as a conduit between it and Israel; apparently to lend validity to the leak. The first time was six months ago when the Iraqis leaked through Jordanian newsmen that Baghdad would be willing to patriate some 400,000 Palestinian residents of South Lebanon in return for Israeli intercession with the United States to lift the economic embargo of Iraq. First of all, that contacts with Israel are no longer an Arab no-no and the Iraqi regime did not have to shroud such contacts in secrecy. That has not been a problem since "Madrid." Secrecy has been meaningless since the Oslo talks and no longer seems to create a magical aura. Furthermore, the Iraqi regime is not one to shy away from any action that would deliver it from its current isolation. The question here is not whether Iraq is secretly seeking to contact Israel. Rather, it is whether Israel would agree and whether it would serve its interests to do so. The answer lies in such questions as: Is Israel willing to create a problem, even a crisis, with the United States for the sake of a regime that Washington and its allies in the West, and particularly in the region, consider a threat to their interests and security? What could Israel, at a time when it is pre-occupied with the peace process and the negotiations with the Palestinians, possibly gain by contacts with a regime whose validity is at a low ebb; which is isolated from the Arabs and from other countries of the region and of the world; and which no longer has any political, military, or moral weight and whose continued existence is a burden to the region and to the rest of the world? The only possible outcome of such contacts would be to create complications for Israel, for the Americans, and for the Palestinians and other Arabs. The peace process, therefore, would not be served under these circumstances if any of the parties concerned embroiled itself in secret contacts with Baghdad. The problem is that it is in Baghdad's interest to seek contacts with Israel and with any other party that could help it escape its isolation. But, what can an isolated regime like Baghdad's do to gain Israeli acceptance and willingness to help it in its crisis and despair? Iran is the only card that Saddam believes to be meaningful to Israel. Truth is, the Iraqi president has never ceased to allude to that card in order to entice the United States to forgive him on the premise that any other regime would mean that Tehran could extend its influence to Iraq; and that the constancy of his regime is therefore the only guarantee against the Iranian threat to Israel and to the peace process. This reasoning is practically the only argument underlying Iraq's current diplomatic campaign to lift or ease the embargo against it. This premise has been emphasized by Tariq 'Aziz in all his meetings two weeks ago with members of the Security Council. It is unfortunate for Saddam Husayn that his premise was not seriously "bought" either by Israel, which denied six months ago, and still does, that it is in contact with Iraq; or by the United States to which Baghdad had previously relayed its desire to contact Israel. Israel has determined that it is in its best interests to support Washington's "dual containment" policy towards both Iraq and Iran. The only distinction is that a dialogue between Washington and the regime in Tehran is not being spurned. It behooves everyone to abandon those flights of fancy perpetuated by the Baghdad regime. The only practical long-range strategy to isolate fundamentalism and bolster the process of peace and security in the region can be provided only by an Iraq that derives its strength from a peaceful system of multipartite democracy.
