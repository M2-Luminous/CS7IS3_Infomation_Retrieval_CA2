FR940328-0-00058 FR940328-0-00013 One commenter suggested that FSIS implement appropriate compliance procedures for safe handling labels, stating the hope that ``after all the commotion and rhetoric accompanying this present rule that more effort will be made to assure not only compliance with it but with all the other regulatory initiatives that are sorely in need of the Department's attention.'' FSIS appreciates the concern of this commenter. It is envisioned that the monitoring of compliance with these requirements will follow the current model of enforcement of misbranding of products at the retail level. Jurisdiction is primarily exercised by State and local food regulatory agencies. Local codes generally require that food be fully labeled in conformance with requirements of agencies having jurisdiction over the product. FSIS and State meat and poultry inspection programs also monitor meat and poultry products in commerce. If products are found out of compliance with these requirements, they generally require that the specific product be brought into compliance or other appropriate action is taken. FSIS anticipates that initial compliance monitoring of this labeling requirement will have an educational focus. Where noncompliance is found, FSIS Compliance and other enforcement officials will provide guidance on these labeling requirements. Where it is apparent that businesses are making a good faith effort to comply with these requirements, they will not be subject to enforcement action. One commenter suggested that FSIS replace the term ``comminuted'' with a different term such as ``non-whole muscle'' products because historically, ``comminuted'' has been used to include only very finely ground meat and poultry products produced from by-products of other whole muscle operations. FSIS does not agree with this comment. Other FSIS regulations, including the August 2, 1993, pattie regulation (58 FR 41138), have defined ``comminuted'' as a processing term used to describe the reduction in size of pieces of meat or poultry, and includes chopping, flaking, grinding, and mincing. One commenter was concerned that styrofoam trays are sometimes reused in children's crafts and that such a use poses risks. The commenter suggested that these trays should include a message saying to discard them. Meat packed in styrofoam trays could pose a potential health risk if ready-to-eat food products are stored in an unwashed tray. Use of these materials by school children has not resulted in any reported foodborne illness. FSIS believes that most consumers either discard the trays or wash them before giving them to their children to use. On this basis, FSIS does not believe a message is needed to address this concern. One commenter suggested that the Department introduce two new categories of product that could be sold in addition to the current products that are labeled ``USDA Inspected and Passed (or For Wholesomeness).'' The first category would be ``USDA Inspected for Cosmetics and Marketing Defects Only_Not Health Hazards,'' and the second category would be ``Uninspected.'' Both of the new categories would be required to include safe handling information on the label. Products meeting the criteria to be labeled ``USDA Inspected and Passed (or For Wholesomeness)'' would not be required to include safe handling information. The Agency does not agree with this commenter. The ``USDA Inspected and Passed'' logo represents an assurance that products are derived only from animals slaughtered under inspection; contain only ingredients from approved sources; are processed in a sanitary environment; and, are processed in accordance with accepted Good Manufacturing Practices. All these assurances are of health and safety concern. The Agency does not agree with an assertion that failure to assure that raw meat and poultry products are sterile reduces inspectional efficacy to assuring only the absence of cosmetic and marketing defects. Inspection of the processing of cooked products is designed to assure a commercially sterile product. Requiring safe handling instructions on the labels of raw and partially cooked meat and poultry products is the appropriate step to alert consumers to the practical limits of the assurance represented by the ``USDA Inspected and Passed'' logo.
