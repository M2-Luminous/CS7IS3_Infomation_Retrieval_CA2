The field is still not occupied, even on the battlefield of the six declared "UN protected areas." However, the situation of the war has been changed in its quality by the second military initiative of the alliance after the Sarajevo ultimatum: Even the air strikes of Gorazde, which are most narrowly limited in purpose, goals, and means, are a leap ahead by the allies across the hurdle that has been in place for two years. It is possible that this second leap will again be too short in the end, but the air strikes can be continued and expanded to other situations. A step-by-step expansion of military interventions, as President Clinton suggested, can reduce the fan of Serbian opposition and shift the operational risks, including the psychological pressure of military action, which is linked with that, to the Serbian troops. This is the only way to break the dynamism of the Serbian attacks and to stabilize the situation by military means. This is the precondition for a solid basis for negotiations. Even though military force cannot solve political problems if the enemy is not defeated and the country is not occupied, but it can force a peace by negotiations, at least for a durable cease-fire. Whether this effect will come about depends primarily on the persistence and the effect of the NATO air raids. The military criterion of the effect in fighting against heavy weapons and preventing major attacks is also the political criterion of readiness for an appropriate, limited, if necessary also continued air war against selected military targets. Thus, the three problems that the allies have tried to evade for two years are now confronting NATO head on under more difficult conditions and pressure of time: The problem of intervention, the problem of escalation, and the problem of acceptance in case of protracted fighting by allied forces beyond their own alliance area. In this respect, the political quality of NATO will continue to change toward an active security alliance for crisis management and ending conflicts beyond its borders. In Bosnia, the shock of the first attacks from the air is affecting the Serbs in NATO's favor and in particular also Belgrade, where one is in reality not counting on an "escalation of war," because it might undermine Serbian rule over Kosovo and Vojvodina, destroy the cohesion with Montenegro, bring NATO combat troops to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM] and even to Albania -- which has offered its ports and airports to NATO -- just as to Bosnia itself and might thus annul the conquests of territory that the Serbs have made so far. Military escalation is the last thing that Serbia could bear. For the nationalist communist Milosevic regime in Belgrade, this risk is linked with the imminent risk of survival. In particular, therefore, Belgrade has tried from the very beginning to use Russia as a power to limit the conflict for Serbia's security within the borders of the territories conquered since 1991. Above all, Russian influence is to protect the endangered unity of Serbia and Montenegro as the Yugoslav rump state and the expansion of the borders as much as possible. This has been recognized in time by Moscow, while the Western governments seem to have taken the alleged threat of escalation seriously, while the government and the army command in Pale and in Belgrade have always shied way for good reason from any military confrontation with NATO and its main power, the United States. It was the capital political and strategic mistake of the Western allies to avoid this experiment with the Serb's political steadfastness. This renunciation of action was also of great disadvantage for a pragmatic realpolitik, which was proved again during the latest NATO air raid: What one could have achieved alone two years ago now depends on Moscow. Approval for the mission had to be gained by diplomatic means from Russia, and an extension of the UN mandate for the effective protection of the "refuges" is not in sight for the time being because of Russia's resistance. NATO and the United States on their own will neither be able to determine the situation in the Balkans nor to control the mediation of a compromise. They will have to share their influence with Russia, with all the consequences resulting for the treatment of Serbia and Bosnia. A privileged "partnership" with NATO, as Yeltsin demands it for the military big power Russia, need not be further considered or criticized in Brussels -- it is developing on its own from NATO's two-year absence and from the resulting situation in the Balkans. NATO needs a strategy of crisis management that is oriented toward action, if it wants to preserve its interests together with and toward Russia and to remain effective as an alliance.
