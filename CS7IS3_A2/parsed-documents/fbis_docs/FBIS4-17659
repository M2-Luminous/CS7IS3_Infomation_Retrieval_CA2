The reason for the disruption to the agricultural timetable was the acute shortage of funds during the preparations for sowing, which caused numerous shortcomings in equipment repair, fuel, and mineral fertilizers. In March the Russian Government promised nearly 40 billion rubles in loans to assist peasants in the Maritime Kray with their sowing operations. However, up to now only a little more than half of this sum has been received. Commercial banks to which the peasants have applied for advances are giving loans only on collateral. However, the majority of farmers have no possibility of accepting this; their workers have not received wages for several months. As a result, only 4,000 hectares of early grain crops have been sown in the Maritime Kray so far, which is 15-fold less than for the same period last year.
