The property rights exchange, which will be built in two months in this south China economic center, will be under the management of the city government. Latest figures show that there are now 25 property rights exchanges in China, with the first one formed in the early 1980s. Chen Kaizhi, vice-mayor of the city, said that all state-owned enterprises in the city will be transformed into corporations in the next four or five years. Except for a number of public utilities like transportation and telecommunications systems, most of the state-owned enterprises will take the form of stock companies, Chen added. Chen also mentioned that in line with the reform of property rights, the city will establish some state-owned asset management companies to take charge of managing, transferring and auction of the state-owned assets of state-owned enterprises. Guangzhou now has more than 20,000 enterprises, more than 4,000 of which are involved in industrial production. Official sources said that this move is partly aimed at revitalizing some loss-making state-owned enterprises which have been in the red a long time because of limitations on transferring property rights.
