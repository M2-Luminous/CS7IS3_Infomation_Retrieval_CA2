This short sentence, stated by Radovan Karadzic after his latest meeting with Vitaliy Churkin, with whom he exchanged opinions about the further course of the peace process, means that the latest initiative made by Washington and Moscow for finding a settlement of the Bosnian conflict without Serb participation will soon fail. Still, the initiative inevitably raises the question of whether the Serbs will know how to make good use of that general situation, without losing much. That question is bothering Karadzic, who has been put under pressure, on one hand by flexible, ready-to-discuss-everything Milosevic, as Churkin describes him, and, on the other hand, by his own army, and for the greatest part by Ratko Mladic and the citizens of the Srpska republic themselves, who are unanimous in the attitude that the aforementioned flexibility is leading directly toward a defeat! As the majority of Serbs believe, since the beginning of the war the Bosnian Serbs have not been asked for their opinion on any issue, particularly when the idea was born in Washington that Croats and Muslims should be forced to agree to a joint state. In the first moment, precisely for that reason, the Serbs refused any talks about possibly joining with the Croatian-Muslim federation, while the same attitude was held by the leadership of the Srpska republic. Having decided that the whole story is about the establishment of a military alliance that will look forward to aiming its artillery at the other bank of Drina River, of course, supported by the foreign assistance, the leadership in Pale quickly started to contemplate how to protect itself, without once more provoking the superior force in the sky. Aleksa Buha [Srpska foreign minister] was happy to substantiate why their apprehensions are not merely a kind of phobia. He has noticed that, in Split, Generals Ante Roso and Rasim Kadic hurried to sign the agreement on the federal army, even though the Constitution of the new Muslim-Croatian state was far from having a definite shape. At the same time, Buha reminds us that the agreement on the military alliance signed by Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic still exists. Therefore he told Churkin, just as Karadzic and Nikola Koljevic had done, that he could feel free to inform Washington that the Srpska republic would not start solving any issue without having previously signed a peace agreement with the new federation, because, at the latest talks in Vienna it had been said that the federation of Croats and Muslims should take in as much as 60 percent of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. What Is the Next Step? Nevertheless, the Bosnian Serbs still started to adjust themselves to the situation, thinking: What is the next step? So that the first thing that Karadzic actually faced was the demand that the Serbs should make certain concessions. To the surprise of many people, Karadzic immediately said he was ready to cede around 16 percent of the territory under the control of the Bosnian Serbs. However, both Washington and Moscow made it clear to him that he is supposed to soften up his attitude even more, and in that respect, nothing is more successful than applying pressure. After having resolutely refused to even discuss the possibility of the Srpska republic merging with the new Muslim-Croat federation, that is, with its enemies, the leadership from Pale quickly changed its mind. They decided that Serbs should get down to talks and negotiations, because the final legalization of the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina still has its good side: It opens the way for the Serbs toward the final union with Yugoslavia. However, this story will as well be paved with huge stumbling blocks. The U.S. officials quickly invented a new trick. They sent the message to Serbs that, if they were to keep the entire 70 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Washington might easily enforce the lifting of the arms embargo against the Croats and Muslims. As an additional means of pressure, Washington sent Churkin to the Srpska republic a couple of times, to make the Serbs even more pliable. On the other hand, although the Russian UN soldiers were given a euphoric welcome in Pale, Karadzic is more than aware that Churkin will not be pursuing exclusively pro-Serbian politics, although Moscow has been somewhat better disposed to their Orthodox brothers in recent times. With obvious interest, and perhaps even surprise, Karadzic listened to Momcilo Krajisnik telling him about Churkin's proposal, according to which all the peoples in former Yugoslavia should join in an association, whereas the association should involve various forms of association. Encouraged by what they heard, as Buha puts it, the Bosnian Serbs have immediately made clear to Churkin that they cannot give up their rights, which have been allowed for the Croats and Muslims -- the right to form their state from ethnic cantons, and also to enter confederation with Croatia. Because, if the Bosnian Croats want a connection with their mother-country, the same desires and rights must be observed and allowed to the other party, so nobody should oppose these arguments and this logic. According to the Pale officials, Churkin has expressed his support for this proposal, and if Washington were to do the same, then the negotiators would find themselves on the same wavelength. World Against the Unification Still, the international community is more inclined to add the Srpska republic to the new federation than to allow its union with Yugoslavia. It has been openly stated that Pale will be much better off if it sticks to the federal Bosnia. The Serbs will cede a percentage of territories under their control, otherwise, if they go for a union with Yugoslavia, all of Posavina [the Sava River basin] will be taken away from them (the Serbs would lose the corridor, while the connection with other Serbian countries would be cut), as well as the enclaves in eastern Bosnia. However, if the Serbs are flexible enough, that is to say, if they join the federation, a corridor connecting them with other Serb lands 10 kilometers wide (Karadzic demands 50 kilometers) would be given to them, and they would also be allowed to keep some predominantly Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia that are now under their control. It is clear to Karadzic that it is impossible to return all the territories in northern and eastern Bosnia to the Croats and Muslims, for a simple reason: The land has been devastated and the people displaced. It is clear to him that he will have to agree to a corridor connecting the Muslim enclaves with the new, Vienna-made federation. It is also clear to him that Washington and Moscow will first require the Croats and Muslims to determine which territories they would accept as final, because they cannot have the desired 60 percent, and also that very soon, given the mixture of concessions and threats, he will be forced into negotiations and further compromises. As for the aforementioned adjustment to the general situation, which was made possible for Karadzic by a sort of timeout, which also included the consultations with Belgrade, a part of that process is also the announcement of the forthcoming meeting of the assembly of the Srpska republic. As we have discovered, at the meeting the possible territorial concessions will be discussed again, as well as certain staff changes. Well-informed sources claim that those changes apply even to the military top brass itself! Whether that will mean that Karadzic has been softened enough remains to be seen. Besides, it will also become clearer how large a piece of Bosnia-Herzegovina the Serbs intend to keep for themselves. The only certain thing right now is that they would not mind joining the Muslim-Croatian federation (such comments were heard after the talks with Churkin), if they could also form a kind of confederation with Yugoslavia at the same time.
