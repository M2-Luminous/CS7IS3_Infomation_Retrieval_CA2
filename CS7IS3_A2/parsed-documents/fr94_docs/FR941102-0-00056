FR941102-0-00056 FR941102-0-00010 Executive Order 12866 This amendment does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' as specified in E.O. 12866. Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date Because this amendment reflects the extension of emergency import restrictions on cultural property which is currently subject to pillage and looting, pursuant to ยง553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, no notice of proposed rulemaking or public procedure is necessary. For the same reason, a delayed effective date is both impracticable and contrary to the public interest. Drafting Information The principal author of this amendment was Peter T. Lynch, Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings, U.S. Customs Service. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development.
