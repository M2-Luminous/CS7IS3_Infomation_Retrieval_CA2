Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to Moscow: "The U.N. chief's three main meetings with President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Defence Minister Pavel Grachev were notable for an abundance of gratitude lavished by the sides on each other. The deservedness of such lavishness cannot conceal a certain difference in their points of view on approach to peacemaking problems". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA quotes Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev as saying that "Articles 51-55 of the U.N. Charter, in particular, allow peacemaking activities on a regional scale. If the conflict in Rwanda is being settled by the United Nations organisation, the one in Haiti by the Organisation of American States, why not legalise the activities of a collective peacemaking force of the countries that are parties to a collective security treaty within the CIS framework?". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes the U.N. secretary-general as saying that "Russia is a great power and a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. We hope that it will contribute to enhancing the role of the United Nations in the international arena subsequently as well". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that a white paper about the October 1993 events in Moscow is being prepared for publication. It is a question of selecting materials about both the events on the October days proper and the preceding developments--the meeting of the Supreme Soviet (parliament), the last congress, official decrees... "Work on a documentary version of the book has been almost completed. This version will be put out in a small print run intended mainly for scientific workers. "A documentary-and-publicistic version of the book is still in the works and will have a much larger print run". PRAVDA carries an interview with former Russian Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy who makes an estimate of the October 1993 events. In response to correspondents' questions, Rutskoy made it clear once again that he does not intend to quit the political stage. "To quit politics now would mean to betray first of all those people who believe me," Rutskoy emphasised. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Federal Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko. Touching upon the possibility of creating a community or a union on confederative principles on the territory of the former Soviet Union, Shumeyko pointed out as follows: "I consider it possible to establish an integrated community of states, which can be done on the basis of the existing CIS institutions, not to recreate the Soviet Union as it was prior to perestroyka." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin. Touching upon the outflow of scientific ideas, high technologies and advanced systems of armaments and military hardware from Russia, Stepashin said "the country in the near future may lose its lead in the development of fundamental and applied research, lose many scientific schools and highly skilled personnel, and suffer considerable and, in point of fact, irreplaceable material damage." "Calculations done by Russian Science Ministry according to U.N. methods indicate that if a specialist emigrates, the country loses about 300,000 U.S. dollars. Russia may suffer a potential damage of about 20,000 million dollars every year as a result of emigration." TRUD frontpages an article about the supply of substandard and quite often tainted foodstuffs to the Russian market from abroad. "In the first quarter of the year alone, the state trade inspectorate rejected almost 60 percent of examined meat products and sausages, more than 70 percent of alcoholic drinks, and over 40 percent of tea and coffee. "The inspectorate checked and found unfit for consumption all imported dairy products that were on sale in Tula and Orenburg regions, Maritime territory, and the republics of Mariy-El and Tatarstan".
