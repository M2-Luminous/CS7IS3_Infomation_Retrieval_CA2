FBIS4-6042 "dreas074_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 18 Apr 1994 South Korea Final Agreement Reached on High-Speed Train Final Agreement Reached on High-Speed Train SK1804090994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0841 GMT 18 Apr 94 SK1804090994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The Korea high-speed rail construction authority has agreed to pay 2,101.6 million U.S. dollars to Gec Alsthom in return for the Anglo-French consortium's supply of trainsets and technology in connection with the multi- billion-dollar Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway project. The authority said Monday it will use the trainsets, related equipment and overall control system of Gec Alsthom's "train a grand vitesse" (high-speed train) on the 430.7-kilometer Seoul-Pusan line. Under the agreement, the French company is also supposed to transfer TGV construction technology to South Korean companies -- Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., Daewoo Heavy Industries Co. and Hanjin Heavy Industries Co. Pak Yu-kwang, president of the Korea high-speed rail construction authority, said a contract will be drawn up soon paying Gec Alsthom 6,009.5 million French francs for trains made by the French company and 1,069.8 million dollars for those made by South Korean firms. The price was about 270 million dollars lower than Gec Alsthom had suggested last July. The financing will come from France's export and export-related funds, carrying the condition of repayment in 10 years with an eight-year grace period. The South Korean authority and France's Banque Indosuez are discussing other details of redemption such as interest rates, Pak said. The agreement enables the South Korean authority and Gec Alsthom to embark on the Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway construction project, which is expected to finish by 2002. The authority sent a report on the agreement to the Transportation Ministry Monday and is awaiting government approval. The ministry will approve the agreement after consultations with the government committee on high- speed rail construction and President Kim Yong-sam before the authority draws up the final contract with Gec Alsthom in May, Pak said. To ensure the TGV's performance and transfer of all technology, South Korean manufacturers and the authority will jointly participate in the TGV construction from the design stage, according to Pak. The TGV should be given the international quality control standard "ISO-9000" series and Gec Alsthom will help the South Korean firms secure the ISO standards, according to the agreement. The authority and Gec Alsthom will cooperate to wind up all technology transfers by the year 2002 so that South Korean businesses can make TGV trains on their own from then on. The South Korean companies will secure the intellectual property rights for the transferred technology, and they are supposed to give 2 percent of the selling price for 12 and a half years from the contract day if they make deals to transfer the TGV technology to third countries. The TGV will begin service between Seoul and Taejon from the year 2000 and run between Seoul-Pusan line from 2002. Meanwhile, the TGV's top speed on the Seoul-Pusan line will be 300 kilometers per hour, according to the authority.
