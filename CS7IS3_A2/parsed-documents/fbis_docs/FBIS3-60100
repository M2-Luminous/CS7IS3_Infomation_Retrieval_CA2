An amateur chemist who had manufactured amphetamines received a sentence of three years and eight months. The Espoo District Court had sentenced him in June to four years in prison. According to the court, the chemist had made a total of just under 2 kg of amphetamines. Over a kilogram of the drugs ended up being sold, but the chemist did not know how to distribute them. The sentences of the chemist's partners in crime were also slightly reduced. Two of the men received prison sentences of four years and eight months and the third man got four years and three months. The sentences meted out by the district court had been several months longer. During the trial the chemist claimed that he had manufactured the amphetamines in cooperation with the police. According to the chemist, the police's plan was to catch the men who ran the drug ring. Because of his claims, the police who were examined in connection with the chemist were suspected of being guilty. They were suspected of incitement to commit drug crimes and of breach of duty. After the preliminary investigation, Provincial Prosecutor Lasse Apio decided that there was not enough proof to bring charges against them.
