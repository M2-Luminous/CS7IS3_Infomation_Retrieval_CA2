FBIS4-64666 "drweu088__a94021" FBIS-WEU-94-088-A Daily Report 5 May 1994 ANNEX Italy & Vatican City Bossi: Suspension of Talks `Pause for Reflection' Bossi: Suspension of Talks `Pause for Reflection' BR0505143094 Turin LA STAMPA in Italian 5 May 94 p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR0505143094 Turin LA STAMPA Italian BFN [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by Giovanni Cerruti in Rome; date not given: "I Could Even Vote Against Them"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Cerruti] Honorable Bossi, what are you doing? Are you shouting orders at the Berlusconi government, are you making the first step toward a break, or are you announcing that the League has outside backing? [Bossi] None of these. It is a pause. A pause for reflection that we are conceding to Berlusconi, and also to the country. [Cerruti] To the country? [Bossi] Perhaps people have not understood well. I agree that the desire for a stable government prevails. However, it is necessary to consider that this Berlusconi does not have a party behind him, but a band to fill the void. He cannot provide any guarantee of democracy, other than his three damn guarantors.... [Cerruti] It may also be a pause, but it has the tone of a clash. Is this all because of the "no" to the Viminale [Interior Ministry]? [Bossi] It is not just the Viminale. In the meantime that man [Berlusconi] goes around hand in glove with AN [National Alliance]; not only does he not want to give us the Viminale, they also want to palm us off with the stuff they do not want. We are federalists, we have been fighting for the distribution of power for a lifetime, and that man wants to keep it all for himself: interior, foreign policy, treasury, justice, post office.... Who is he, Nembo Kid? [Cerruti] He is Berlusconi. [Bossi] Then he should start to respect the rules of democracy. He cannot summon the first political force represented in parliament and say: Here you are, take these less powerful ministries... Ooohhh! What does he think? When I got up he tried to make me stay, but I hope that he has understood one thing; the ideals of the League, starting with federalism, are not for sale. [Cerruti] Are his members of parliament also asking that this government be formed? [Bossi] I do not know, if it will be his personal government... He could even invoke Article 92 [of the Constitution] and go to the president of the republic, and then present himself in parliament and we will see. [Cerruti] What will we see? [Bossi] We will see if a coalition government with the political participation of the League can be set up. [Cerruti] In this way we return to the obstacle of the Viminale and we are at the beginning again... [Bossi] He would make us a present of three-quarters of the less powerful ministries rather than give it to us. All sorts of stories have been invented... [Cerruti] What sort of stories? [Bossi] [AN leader] Fini's sort. He says that we are from the North, and that we are unable to understand the problems of organized crime, the Mafia, and the South, and that we could not be relied upon. Just think, I have to get somebody from National Alliance, which is 85 percent Italian Social Movement, to give me a license to say that I am reliable! [Cerruti] Today you are meeting the members of parliament from your party, tomorrow you should see Berlusconi and Fini again; it is said that the new prime minister could already make his debut in the Senate coming Tuesday [10 May] [Bossi] What a rush. Let us wait until tomorrow's meeting. [Cerruti] Will it be decisive? [Bossi] It could be. However, I must make it clear that the League wants to be in the government to interfere, to control an autocrat who moves without even having a party, and who wants to put all his men into the board of directors of the Italian system. Heh! Wake up! The autocrat is extremely dangerous. [Cerruti] And this is why you decided to suspend the meetings? [Bossi] This is our resistance, and it will become much stronger, because we know the dangers that lie ahead of us. That man has put four of our ideas together, and put them on his television, thanks to the lack of regulations governing television. He took the votes, and now he wants to take the whole country. [Cerruti] Honorable Bossi, is the Viminale still the last trench? [Bossi] Yes, for that which comes under the Viminale, and I am referring most of all to the local authorities. [Cerruti] Is there any condition under which you would cede it? [Bossi] None. We want to be seen and to be decisive. We want to be the guarantors of democracy against the autocrat, and our resistance will continue.
