The delegate of the Third World Movement Against the Exploitation of Women said Japan had failed to take effective measures to compensate the "comfort women for the army" and the United Nations must take steps for the punishment of the criminals and an adequate compensation to the victims. The delegate said that to this end, a step should be taken immediately to set up an international court and establish an international arbitration tribunal so that the Japanese government may deal with suits brought by victims. The delagate of the World Council of Churches said Japan had not admitted that it was its legal obligation to make an adequate compensation to the "comfort women for the army" but merely repeated that it felt responsible for its crimes. He said the World Council of Churches demanded that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights put pressure on Japan to punish the criminals and compensate the victims. The delegate of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation said that if the Japanese law was not enough to punish the criminals involved in the issue of the "comfort women for the army," Japan must enact another law to discharge its obligation according to the international law and that the organization had presented recommendations to the Japanese prime minister to enact a "law for punishing the war crimes and crimes against humanity and other crimes in view of the international law." Noting that Japan, however, punished none of those responsible for the criminal acts against more than 200,000 "comfort women for the army," he stressed that though the Japanese government was trying to hush up the crime, it could by no means evade its responsibility.
