These facilities are not included in these estimates. e Given the structure of the UTD cost estimates, distinctions between the costs at 93 percent and 95 percent emission reduction were not possible. However, costs would be at least as high as those shown at the 93 percent emissions reduction plus additional retrofit costs for vessels. (Retrofit costs for vessels range from $9,000 to $61,000.)

Impacts of the Regulatory Alternatives The impacts of the product loading regulatory alternatives are summarized in Tables 4 through 6.
