Most of the victims were women, children, and elderly people. The men in the service of Jonas Savimbi have stopped shelling Cuito. A relative calm prevails, but this could be designed to deceive government troops. The operational command of the Angolan Armed Forces says UNITA's decision is to gain time and reorganize its forces in view of the defeats it has suffered. Brigadier (Filione Mukume), deputy commander of the government forces stationed in Cuito, says UNITA will be met with the appropriate response if it tries to gain the upper hand.
