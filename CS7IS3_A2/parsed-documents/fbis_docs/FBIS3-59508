Europe has the largest trade deficit in this field. This deficit will double by the end of the decade. But Europe also has a "second chance" in microelectronics if European manufacturers focus on independently supplying custom-designed circuits (ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits]). Dr. Max Syrbe, a professor and president of the Fraunhofer Society, has now called attention to this in a 10-thesis paper. Japan dominates the memory market and America the processors. Custom- designed circuits offer Europe opportunities for independent developments, he says. The strategy of catching up in technology in the field of memory devices has failed, Syrbe believes. The basic mistake was copying the Japanese way, because it was believed that the technology of very-large-scale integration for memory chips would be the engine for constant technological progress. However, it would be a mistake to believe that the future can be ensured with international cooperation in every area of demand. Syrbe argues further that the danger of dependence is less threatening from mass-produced devices than from application-specific chips, in which a major part of the functionality of new products lies. Because of this Europe's strategy for the future must be the development of microelectronic manufacturing geared to the needs of the small and medium-sized user industry. The factory designs are also different here. While memory factories have to be designed for the best possible mastery of standard mass products, short process times and great flexibility prevail in ASIC factories. By means of flexible manufacturing technology with a high degree of automation the Europeans could offset the lead that Japan has in mass devices. The level of integration and the packing density of chips are not primarily decisive for the success of European products, but the cost and properties of the overall system are. Syrbe is asking that now a structure also be found that has a form of sharing the work and risk with science that is advantageous for small and medium-sized companies, "as a specifically European way for microelectronics." New CAD tools for circuit design must constitute one footing, and new manufacturing technologies by means of which small numbers of items can also be manufactured economically, the other. Minifactories could set themselves up as adequate partners for a small and medium-sized user and manufacturer industry. The "single-wafer factory" project of Texas Instruments in the USA also demonstrates this. He who brings his products more quickly onto the market has the competitive advantage. The microchip alone is not decisive here, but the product advance achieved by its means. Therefore the tight knitting together of semiconductor manufacturers and users is the prime necessity here.
