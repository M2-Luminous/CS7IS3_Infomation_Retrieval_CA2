The experts said the relations between Poland's unemployment rate and an inflation rate are in great part a political and not only an economic choice. They explained that the keeping of high employment would not increase inflation if the number of weekly working hours were cut and wages were decreased accordingly. Secretary of State at the Cabinet Office Jan Monkiewicz and Director General at the Cabinet Office Jerzy Hausner said such methods have been applied in Germany. They argued that it is necessary that society and, most of all, trade unions are aware of such solutions. The experts agreed that the "Strategy for Poland" targets in agriculture go beyond the period of four years the document covers. The creation of jobs in the countryside and the changes in financing agriculture are important in the first phase of the plan's implementation. Also on Monday, Chairman of the Polish Business Council Jan Wejchert said the organisation is satisfied with the programme and stressed that its provisions are in great degree consistent with the council's opinions and demands. The council presented its opinions on the government-prepared programme to Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak during its general assembly meeting last week. Council Deputy Chairman Zbigniew Niemczycki stated the council is ready to work on detailed issues included in "Strategy for Poland." The council members agree that the success of the programme will hinge on a rapid implementation of concrete solutions. The council argued that if implemented, the solutions would help accelerate privatisation and development of equity market as well as the introduction of export- and investment-minded changes in the tax system. The council announced again its measures aimed at encouraging investments and giving Polish entrepreneurs bigger say in a rapid privatisation of the economy, including the introduction of privatisation by instalments, a consolidated balance sheet for holdings and the setting up of a guarantee fund for privatisation and development.
