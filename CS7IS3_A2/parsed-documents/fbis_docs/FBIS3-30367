He was responding to the REUTER report in which Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said that Israel is able to refit this type of aircraft to Western standards and has allegedly already discussed cooperation. Imrich Andrejcak said that the talks between Jozef Moravcik and the Israeli partners were not binding and were probably misinterpreted. However, the defense minister did not rule out the possibility that our Army would consider modernizing MiG-21's and MiG-29's as early as this year.
