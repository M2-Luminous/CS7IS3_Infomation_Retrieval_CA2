FR941216-0-00020 FR941216-0-00007 Additionally, several non-anchorage areas are established for the period of these regulations to promote smooth traffic flow and ensure access to docks and piers. Special Local Regulations will be enforced for that portion of the race venue which is located within the navigable waters of the United States to minimize navigational dangers and ensure the safety of vessels participating in and viewing the races. Nonobligatory guidelines are included for that portion of the race venue which falls outside the navigable waters of the United States. All vessels which fail to comply with this regulation while operating within the regulated areas during the regulatory periods are subject to citation for failure to comply with this regulation, and subject to the penalties presented in 33 U.S.C. 1236 and 33 CFR 100.50. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under Section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures is unnecessary. Collection of Information This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this regulation in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The environmental impact of this regulation has been analyzed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared by America's Cup 1995, the organizing committee of the races, in connection with its application for a Coast Guard regatta permit. A copy of the EA has been made a part of the public docket and is available for review at the Eleventh Coast Guard District Office at the address listed under ADDRESSES . The Coast Guard has reviewed the EA submitted by the sponsors of the event, considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it will have no significant environmental impact and it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been prepared in connection with the regatta permit, has been made part of the public docket, and is available for review at the address listed under ADDRESSES .
