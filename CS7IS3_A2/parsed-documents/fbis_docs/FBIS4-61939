At UNIAN's request, members of the delegation commented on the trip to meet with Crimea's leaders. In the view of Roman Shpek, Ukraine's economy minister, "Crimea remains a political issue and one has to know how to be noble. It is not worth trying to convince one another on the telephone of incorrect approaches -- it should be done on the basis of an analysis of local enterprises' balance sheets. As far as relations with the regions is concerned, it is necessary to change from confrontation to cooperation." Roman Shpek added that last year the Supreme Council of Crimea had turned down assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and the International Finance Corporation. This year, however Crimeans asked for such help and Kiev is prepared to meet their requests. The minister of the economy continued: "It is worth studying carefully Yuriy Meshkov's economic decrees. Firstly, in order to bring them into line with Ukrainian legislation and secondly, to use the beneficial aspects of the decrees when reforming Ukraine's taxation system." Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, Ukraine's finance minister, said: "Ukraine's budget relations with Crimea are set in accordance with the 18 February 1994 treaties between the governments of Ukraine and Crimea. The amount of taxation that can be received by the Crimean budget for 1994 is 7.4 trillion karbovantsi. Crimea's share in financing general state programs is 4.3 percent or 6.2 trillion. However, according to an agreement Simferopol does not transfer these funds to Kiev. The Republic of Crimea's expenses reach 4.7 trillion karbovantsi. It has been agreed that Crimea should transfer just 2.7 trillion karbovantsi to Kiev." Hryhoriy Pyatachenko added that in the first quarter Crimea owed 500 billion karbovantsi because of a fall in production and transferred nothing to Ukraine's budget. Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, said he considered Yuriy Meshkov's decree on "Banks and Banking Activity on the Territory of Crimea" to be the most dramatic contradiction: "I think this law was copied from the Ukrainian law on banks but with the difference of where it mentions the National Bank of Ukraine, the decree mentions the Republican Bank of Crimea which becomes the property of the Republic of Crimea." He expressed concern at the Crimeans' insistence to obtain the right to issue licenses for the activity of commercial banks. In Yushchenko's opinion talks with representatives of Crimea would continue, but the best option would be if "they repealed the legislative acts that contradict Ukrainian legislation." The National Bank chairman reserved the right to "use protectionist measures to protect the national currency from imported Crimean inflation."
