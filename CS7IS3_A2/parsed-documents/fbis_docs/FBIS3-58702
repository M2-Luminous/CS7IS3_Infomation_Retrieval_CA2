If by January 10 NATO was "there, and doing something," the summit would be a success. But if Sarajevo had "gone down the tubes" it would be a failure. January 10 is here, and NATO is not "there." At least, it is no more there than it was in September. The headquarters unit provided by NATO for the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) is still there, but the force is no more able than it was four months ago to protect the civilian population of Sarajevo and other towns from Serb shelling, which continued cynically through the Christmas "truce," if anything at greater intensity than before. In August NATO threatened air strikes if the "strangulation" of Sarajevo continued. It persists but there have been no air strikes. The UN commander in Bosnia, General Francis Briquemont -- a representative of NATO's host nation -- has just resigned, "exhausted" after six months in the job and publicly deploring the "fantastic gap" between UN Security Council resolutions, "the will to execute those resolutions and the means available to commanders in the field." The resolutions in question authorise the use of "all necessary means" to ensure that relief supplies reach their destination. Yet tanks intended for the protection of UN troops trying to reopen the airport at Tuzla, so that relief supplies can be flown in, are stranded at a base in Serbia because Bosnian Serb leaders (against whose forces the protection is required) are allowed to block their passage; and the Serbian government extracts payment from the UN for allowing supplies through, to offset the effect of sanctions which the UN has itself imposed. Peace Agreement When the U.S. official spoke in September of NATO being "there, and doing something," she alluded to the plan for a NATO force including 25,000 U.S. troops, to supervise the implementation of a peace agreement between the three Bosnian parties. Today not only does a peace agreement seem further off than ever, but no one any longer believes, after the retreat from Somalia and Haiti, that U.S. troops would be sent to Bosnia even if a peace agreement were reached. In short, while Sarajevo may not quite yet have disappeared "down the tubes," in other respects conditions in Bosnia are precisely those required for the NATO summit to be a failure. Nor can NATO get away with blaming the UN for this state of affairs. The same governments call the tune in both organisations. Military Muscle Only NATO could provide the political and military muscle for the UN to enforce its resolutions in Bosnia, and it has conspicuously failed to do so. No wonder, then, that Central European governments lack confidence in it. No wonder they interpret the proposed Partnerships for Peace, not as a bold strategy for gradually expanding NATO's zone of peace but as a fudge, designed to avoid any risk of confrontation between NATO and Russia. Indeed who can expect that NATO would stand up to Russia if it lacks the courage to stand up to Serbia and Croatia? Who can be surprised, when Serbia is allowed to get away with ignoring frontiers and forcibly moving populations in the name of ethnic solidarity, that Russian leaders from Boris Yeltsin downwards increasingly invoke the same principle in dealing with other ex- Soviet republics, and seem increasingly disposed to defend the involvement of Russian military units in conflicts beyond Russian borders as a contribution to "stability" or even "peacekeeping?" Of course, Russia is not Serbia and Yeltsin is not Milosevic. There is still a chance that Russia under Mr Yeltsin's leadership will remain democratic and friendly to the West. NATO leaders do not want to jeopardise that chance, and recognise that any Russian regime will be concerned with the stability of Russia's neighbours, particularly those with large ethnic Russian populations. But that does not mean they should encourage anyone in Russia to think that such interests can be asserted legitimately or with impunity by military force. Further passivity in Bosnia is all too liable to have that effect.
