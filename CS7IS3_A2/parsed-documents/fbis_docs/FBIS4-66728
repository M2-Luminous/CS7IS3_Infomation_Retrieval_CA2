FBIS4-66728 "jpnea026___94013" JPRS-NEA-94-026 JPRS Near East & South Asia 27 March 1994 NEAR EAST SAUDI ARABIA SAMA Issues Development, Treasury Bonds SAMA Issues Development, Treasury Bonds 94AE0096A London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 27 Mar 94 p 9 94AE0096A London AL-HAYAH Arabic CSO [Article by 'Umar Idris] [Text] Saudi sources disclosed to AL-HAYAH that SAMA, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, issued during the first quarter of the current year development and treasury bonds valued at 22 billion riyals [SR] ($5.8 billion). The same sources stated that a few days ago the sixth and last issuance of the development bonds for the first quarter was made; the cost was SR1.5 billion ($400 million). This makes the total value of development bonds so far issued at SR9 billion ($2.4 billion). During the same period SR13 billion ($3.4 billion) of short-term treasury bonds were issued three times. The banking sources indicated that the Saudi development bonds are one-to-five-year bonds. Interest on these bonds is paid every three months. The interest rate is 4.3 percent. Each bond is SR5 million ($1.3 million). Interest on short-term treasury bonds is paid at the maturity date of the bond; these are 30-90-day bonds. Each bond is SR1 million ($266,000) The banking sources described the return on these bonds as acceptable, that it changes according to the changes in the world market, and that it is linked to the changes in the interest rate on the dollar. Due to the difference between the values of the riyal and the dollar, the interest rates on these bonds are 0.3 percent higher than those on American treasury bonds. The same sources stated that local banks buy these bonds because they find it a convenient means to make use of the great liquidity they have. If the local bank needs liquidity, it can reverse the bonds to SAMA as a temporary mortgage for a fixed period after which the local bank gets back the bonds and liquidity returns to SAMA. Such a procedure is an important banking method to control the monetary bloc. The sources also reported that big Saudi investors prefer to own these bonds as soon as SAMA puts them on the market. The sources indicated that sales from bonds issued during the first quarter of the current year were used to pay back the value of previous bonds owed to banks and companies. There are indications that SAMA first issued development and treasury bonds in 1989 when the government decided to enter as a major borrower from the banking market. The government started by getting a domestic loan of SR25 billion ($6.6 billion). In the ensuing five years, the value of treasury bonds doubled as bonds valuing SR120 billion ($32 billion) were issued in the Saudi banking market. The same sources expect that during the current year new development and treasury bonds worth SR30 billion ($8 billion) will be issued.
