Hendrick Martin is on the line to us from there now to give us an update on the bomb which occurred there earlier this morning. Hendrick Hello. How close are you to where the bomb actually exploded? Martin: Well, I'm on the spot where the bomb exploded, on the inside of the airport building. It's actually just outside the windows on the second floor, a sort of parking area, it's just opposite the international departures hall. A lot of damage has been done. The windows are smashed. The ceiling has fallen in in several places. Even from the ground floor outside, some of the windows were shattered, and you can also [see] parts of the ceiling hanging down. [passage omitted] Glyn So Hendrick let me get this straight, the bomb was planted in a car outside the international arrivals hall, but the distance between where the car was parked and the hall was merely a matter of meters, was it? Martin That's how it looks. According to this witness, he told me his whole story. He saw a white Peugeot vehicle and he saw smoke coming from the boot of this car. He had two traffic officials with him, they also saw it, and they tried via radio to contact, to get help, to get someone to come and look at this, and he said the next moment there was a tremendous blast, and it is literally just on the other side of the window. Glyn Now did this person also see the man that the police are looking for, some chap with red hair who was taken away, or drove away in a Toyota Corolla? Martin No, he didn't see anybody, at least he didn't mention seeing anybody, but another witness apparently did see someone running away from the area, and apparently the police are in the process of compiling an identikit based on the description of the person. Glyn Hendrick, thank you very much.
