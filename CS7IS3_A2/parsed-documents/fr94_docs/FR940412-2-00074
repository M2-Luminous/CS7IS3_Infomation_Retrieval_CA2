FR940412-2-00074 FR940412-2-00055 [Docket No. QF93&hyph;129&hyph;000] Syracuse Power Co.; Petition to Intervene and Motion to Revoke Self-Certification April 6, 1994. Take notice that on April 1, 1994, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (Niagara), filed a petition to intervene and motion requesting the Commission to revoke qualifying status of the cogeneration facility owned by Syracuse Power Company (Syracuse). Syracuse's notice of the self-certification was filed with the Commission on July 9, 1993, in the above-captioned docket. Niagara maintains that certification should be revoked on the ground that the facility failed to meet the Commission's operating standard during the 1993 calendar year [See, 18 CFR 292.205(a) (1993)]. Niagara alleges that although the facility began commercial operation on July 26, 1993, and produced power during the year, no useful thermal output was produced. This, Niagara states was due to the fact that Purity Water Co., Inc., the facility's steam host, was unable to obtain the necessary permits from the New York State Department of Health Regulations to produce bottled water. Any person desiring to be heard or objecting to the granting of qualifying status should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests must be filed within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register and must be served on the applicant. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
