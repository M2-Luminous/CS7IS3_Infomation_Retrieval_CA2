The site of the meeting is expected to be Phuket, where the Malaysian minister has informally expressed a willingness to go, according to an official who asked not to be named. Prior to the meeting, Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin is likely to raise the financial aspect of the Apec forum at a meeting with US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, during the latter's visit to Thailand from Jan 17-19. Thailand will ask the Apec finance ministers to maintain the original objective of Apec, which is to act as a trade and investment consultative forum. Tharin is likely to suggest to his Apec counterparts that they discuss the latest global financial policy and also sort out the obstacles hindering world trade, and how to resolve these problems. The US and some developed Apec countries earlier informally suggested the Apec finance ministers meet and discuss how to integrate the "harmonization system" and the customs code among the Asia-Pacific nations. The proposal was opposed by some Apec members on the grounds that the pace of cooperation might be too fast. Tharin, meanwhile, said that he would put a double taxation treaty and financial liberalization high on his agenda during the upcoming meeting with his US counterpart. Bangkok and Washington have failed to come to terms on the double taxation agreement for 20 years, and Tharin stated that he would accelerate the negotiations for the benefit of the two countries. During Bentsen's visit, sources said that both sides are likely to discuss the two remaining points: the licensing fee and tax exemption for the international transportation business. Bentsen is also expected to urge Bangkok to do more to bring down the barriers in the financial sector for the benefit of US business, but Tharin said: "Thailand would have to see the attitude of the US before elaborating on what to do next." Apart from Thailand, Bentsen will go to China and Indonesia to boost US interests in Asia. On the offensive front, Thailand is expected to inform the US treasury secretary that it plans to amend or revoke the bilateral Treaty of Amity and Economic Cooperation signed in 1966. The treaty grants privileges to US citizens doing business in Thailand in the same way as Thais, and vice versa. The contentious issue in the treaty is the shareholding structure, which allows US investors to hold more than 25 per cent of local firms, a source said. Thailand is the only Asean country which has signed such a treaty with the US, and Thai officials earlier expressed an intention to amend the treaty on the grounds that it is outdated and not of benefit to Thailand. One official said that Thailand is likely to stand firm on the US request for financial liberalization, and will present its liberalization package to show the US the country's progress towards financial reform. Bangkok has often said that it will not do more, as the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks did not include agreements on trade in services.
