In HANNOVERSCHE NEUE PRESSE (Wednesday [20 April] edition), the peace researcher also warned that the helplessness of the United Nations in Bosnia might lead to a "relapse into the policy of strength." He demanded that the United Nations must be strengthened and developed into a global collective security system. At the moment, the United Nations is only a collection of nations "whose 1945 charter has never been implemented, because the East-West conflict interfered." A collective security system would have been capable of taking timely precautions against the emerging aggression of the Serbs, Bahr says. Now the United Nations and the European Union (EU) cannot even ensure a watertight embargo. The peace researcher said that it is a step into the right direction that the nations are supposed to commit themselves to providing contingents of armed forces for blue helmet missions.
