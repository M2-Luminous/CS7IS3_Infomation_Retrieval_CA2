He faced the tricky dilemma of maintaining Britain's voting powers to block EU legislation while not threatening the enlargement process, which Britain backs. He was applauded by Tory backbenchers at a private meeting in the Commons tonight after returning from Brussels, where he and fellow foreign ministers reached deadlock after 10 hours of bitter talks. Britain is refusing to budge from the present position where 23 votes (from the 76 available among the 12 member states) can block Brussels legislation. All the other countries -- except Spain -- say that with the addition of Finland, Austria, Norway and Sweden, that figure should increase to 27 from the 90 votes then available. Negotiations will resume in Brussels on Tuesday [22 March] -- with the prospect of one of the biggest Euro-rows blowing up for years. But Mr Hurd warned Tory MPs that delay could threaten Community enlargement, which Britain champions. Equally any weakening of Britain's position could create fresh Tory strife which could have a calamitous effect on the party's showing at the June Euro-elections. Mr Hurd bluntly told the MPs that enlargement was something they had worked for for many years and for very good national reasons. "This is the kind of Europe we want," he said. "It clearly would not be sensible to scrap that policy just when it had succeeded. We are not prepared to accept an automatic mechanical upgrading of the qualifying majority from 23 to 27." But he warned them that to delay enlargement indefinitely could risk the collapse of the enterprise. Mr Hurd told his colleagues, at the meeting which lasted more than an hour, that he did not want to get into details of the ideas coming forward. But he declared: "I have not shifted at all." Even so, MPs expect the days between now and Tuesday to be occupied with attempts at compromise -- without, in the words of one Tory Euro-dissident, "selling Britain down the river." There were, Mr Hurd told MPs, people "trying to breach the gap." Meanwhile, Tory Euro-rebels -- who caused such havoc during the Parliamentary passage of the Maastricht legislation -- are tonight standing four-square behind Mr Hurd. But the growing fear among Tory business managers is that if Britain is forced to compromise and weaken her position, the Euro-storm will flare up uncontrollably again. Mr Hurd, however, has told colleagues since the meeting that when he said that support was what he needed, it was forthcoming "beyond the ordinary." His clear message was: "We will just go on until we get there." But he remained tight-lipped about his tactics, saying that he was in the middle of difficult and delicate negotiations. Plainly he did not wish to expose his hand to his opponents ahead of the next Brussels encounter. [passage omitted]
