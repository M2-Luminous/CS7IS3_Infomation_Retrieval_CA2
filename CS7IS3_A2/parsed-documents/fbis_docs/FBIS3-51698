Even Democracy 2000 -- a group within the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) -- has withdrawn its support for Colosio, because "he is not doing what is best for our party." "Democracy 2000 in Veracruz withdraws its support for your candidacy and your political campaign because it believes this modest current of (PRI) opinion has more clout in civil society than organized or authoritarian PRI-ism," it was stated by disgruntled members in a letter delivered to Colosio on Tuesday during a campaign tour through communities in Veracruz. Colosio, as well as a great many Mexican Government authorities, were surprised by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion on 1 January 1994 in Chiapas, where the candidate had plans to begin his campaign. The state had also been considered a bastion of votes for the PRI before the rebellion. Mexican analysts have mentioned for several days the possibility that the PRI may change its candidate for the 21 August presidential elections, while the PRI leadership remains silent. Only traditional leaders such as Fidel Velasquez, head of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), have openly supported Colosio. "Approximately 70 percent of Democracy 2000's 32 coordinating boards in the country always supported Camacho's appointment as presidential candidate. However, in a settlement reached during the national convention, we agreed to support whoever was designated (Colosio) -- someone who is not doing what is best for our party at this time." According to Mexican political tradition, the current president -- in this case, Carlos Salinas -- designates the PRI candidate and the party merely ratifies the appointment. Following Colosio's designation, Camacho resigned from the post of Mexico City mayor and accepted the post of foreign minister to -- he said -- prevent divisions within the party. Upon learning about the magnitude of the social rebellion in Chiapas, Salinas appointed Camacho, who is famous as a negotiator and has good relations with the opposition, as a peace commissioner, and his political status rose, although it was considered he had been defeated following the official candidate's election. PRI "democrats" indicated, "The political strategy outlined by the Change 2000 Foundation for the upcoming elections pertains to a Mexico that no longer exists and that was left behind on 31 December 1993, when the mythological dream about the country's modernization came to an end." Colosio served as social development secretary before being nominated the PRI's presidential candidate, and he was in charge of resolving the critical problems of extreme poverty which afflict approximately 13 million Mexicans, including the Indians who comprise the EZLN and who are demanding social justice. Members of Democracy 2000 argue: "The (PRI's) influence peddling policy has failed, along with the supporter roundup (mandatory trips to attend PRI rallies) methods and false mass rallies -- all of which belong to a Mexico that has been left behind with its traditional and institutional type of campaign." Certain newspapers have reported that Colosio's rallies were a failure, surpassed by current events in Chiapas, and organized "in the PRI's own style," with supporter roundups and staged scenes that include Indians and poor people from various places in the country.
