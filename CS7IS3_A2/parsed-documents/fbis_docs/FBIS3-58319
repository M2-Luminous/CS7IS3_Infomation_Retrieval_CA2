"I do not think it is possible to be pleased about this sort of work in a country with bloodbaths and atrocities. On the humanitarian level, however, I have helped to create something extraordinary." A Talk in UN Headquarters in Sarajevo. A few shells go off within hearing distance of the residence in which Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont is staying. He beckons to his colleague: "We have to call Milovanovic." He then explains to us: "If the shelling starts up, we telephone to try to calm things down. Sometimes that helps." It helps this time. For a little while, at least; you cannot expect anything more. The lieutenant general, who in normal life is the commander of the 1st Corps (including the Belgian troops in Germany), is living these days with the failure of the laboriously achieved Christmas and New Year's truce. On 23 December, some 1,300 projectiles fell on and around Sarajevo. Five were killed and 68 were injured -- a miserable way to begin a truce. "I had resolved never to let any more documents be signed. They (the leaders of the fighting parties) never respect their signatures. We have signed 25, 35, or is it 40 cease-fire agreements, and they have never been respected. The Christmas truce was proposed by the Croats, and then accepted by the Bosnian, and later the Serb military officials. In Brussels, the political officials ratified it. And what was the result of all this? The fighting in Sarajevo over the past few days has been more intense than in the last five months. Something like that therefore has a political meaning. Since (the breakdown of) the negotiations in Brussels, none of the parties wants to appear weak; none of the parties wants anything that has been imposed. I feel this very strongly in the talks. In the meantime, military activity has again dropped somewhat." [Rotthier] Relatively speaking... [Briquemont] You can get used to anything, you know. When I came here in July, there were 3,000 shells falling every day. There is always provocation in the southern part of the city, and the Serbs react -- how should I put it? -- too strongly. They have problems with the concept of an "appropriate reply." I tell them that, too. Shelling Sarajevo is stupid from the military point of view, and always a tragedy from the humanitarian point of view. On the other hand, I cannot understand why there are always talks about Sarajevo. To me, the Croatian shellings of Mostar are just as questionable as the Serb shellings of Sarajevo -- or what the Bosnians are doing in the area around Vitez. [Rotthier] Do you think that all the parties are equally bad? [Briquemont] If you judge the situation on the basis of international principles of law, it is difficult to see how the Bosnian Government could be wrong. It is an internationally recognized state, so the Bosnians feel it is difficult to be placed on the same level as the Serbs or Croats who are attacking their state. I personally have always tried to approach the situation as it is, and not as people would like it to be. It is clear that, in order to reach an agreement, all three parties must sit down at the table. In the beginning, we thought in terms of a multicultural, multiethnic Bosnia with perhaps 10 provinces. We have now ended up with a division of the land, and even the Bosnian Government is now agreed that there must be a Muslim state alongside a Serbian state and a Croatian state. There has been talk of a Union of Bosnian States. President Izetbegovic has admitted that it is no longer possible to keep a central government. All three parties break the truces. They tell us: "We will comply with them [the truces] if the others do." But there is always some hothead who fires off a cannon or who empties a machine gun. As for atrocities, these happen on all sides, but I have noted for some time now that the military leaders -- especially the Bosnian and Croat ones -- have been trying to bring their armies under control. In Sarajevo, we almost saw a purge of disobedient units. A number of corp commanders have been replaced. A British vehicle was hijacked in the Vitez area a couple of days ago. The Bosnian commander did everything possible to restore the vehicle to its owners. The same is true for the Croats. I am not saying that nobody steps over the line, because in this country it is difficult to keep everyone under control. However, the military leaders are doing what they can. [Rotthier] But you will not sign any more agreements with them? [Briquemont] That serves no purpose -- literally. My predecessor, Gen. Morillon -- and this is not a criticism -- clung to this in order to meet with the commanders. He hoped to drag the parties along and to get signed agreements. I rapidly became aware that meetings in front of journalists would only lead to posturing. People were not coming to negotiate, but to see the spectacle. This is not directed just at journalists, but also at ourselves. In the beginning, the officials always came with three, four, or five colleagues: Not so they could negotiate better, but to show their own delegation that they were the boss and capable of imposing their will on others. After two or three weeks, I then decided only to negotiate with the generals -- as confidentially as possible. Since then, I have realized that it is difficult to have all three of them together. Many problems are better discussed with two parties, or even in a tete-a-tete. The negotiations are always tough, but at least the atmosphere is calm, and from time to time they even discuss the problems seriously. [Briquemont ends] [Rotthier reports] The general (58) received us in a very modest office in the residence that used to be reserved for Marshal Tito. The building is currently being used as the UNPROFOR headquarters for Bosnia. It is from here that Briquemont coordinates operations, negotiations, transportation, and the distribution of food and other vital supplies. He has a reputation for being straightforward, someone who pushes things through, energetic, and a committed negotiator. He is certainly not displeased to see us -- we are the first Flemish journalists to visit him in Sarajevo-- but the Bosnian mess is taking its toll. [Briquemont] "I am tired," he said. "I will admit that. We had hoped to reach an agreement in August, then in October, and then in December. We have to start the same negotiations every time, and every time we run up against the same problems, the same breaking points. I have the feeling that it would be easier to reach an agreement between the military men than between the politicians, which is pretty amazing." [Rotthier] Is that because there is a better understanding between military men? [Briquemont] They know each other. Generals Dilic and Mladic (the Bosnian and Serb commanders) served in the same Army. They had the same training; they know each other. I recently had a meeting with both generals. I said something like: "So, now you two have spoken with each other." "That is true," said one of them, "Why aren't we talking." To which the other one replied, "And why are we fighting anyway?" That is extraordinary, is it not? It is unbelievable to see the politician at work in Geneva during the negotiations. All too often they do not think of their own people. There are quite a few who are still covered in a thick layer of Communism and who manipulate the gibberish in all its glory. Western politicians assume the generals will automatically apply the agreement that the politicians sign. They are mistaken. It is almost funny. I was once going over a political agreement from Geneva with the generals. I said thoughtlessly: Seeing that the politicians are agreed about this section, then everyone here should also accept it. Gen. Mladic looked at me and said: "Cospodine generale, non" ["My dear general, no."] He later added: "What the politicians discuss in Geneva is their problem. They do not know anything about the military aspect, general. We are going to rewrite this section, and then they will have to carry it out." That was how Gen. Mladic reasoned. [Rotthier] So do the generals really have an eye on the needs of the people? [Briquemont] I would not dare say that. But they are certainly aware of the situation of their own troops. Military men think in terms of balances of power. The Croats realize the Serbs are on the sidelines watching how they fight the Muslims. Military men know they must not needlessly exhaust their troops. They know that perhaps better than the politicians do. Time is beginning to be of the essence. It would be very bad if no agreement were reached by the end of winter. We are here to provide humanitarian aid on site. Almost every week, someone dies at the steering wheel of a vehicle that is supplying aid. A few days ago a Belgian was brutally murdered; there is no other way to describe it. A few weeks ago, a French soldier was seriously wounded by a Bosnian sniper, while he -- get this -- was distributing food to the Bosnian population. Public opinion is becoming increasingly less acceptant of this. [Rotthier] Has a perpetrator ever been found? [Briquemont] No. Listen. We return aggression, since our political officials agree to this. It is very difficult to get a sniper, however. He shoots once and disappears -- in the city and in the woods. In the city, returning fire could have horrible consequences. Even their own army chiefs cannot find them again, because we must admit: Often, the discipline at lower levels is lacking. Perhaps you have already noticed this at a checkpoint. They are 18 years-old. They think they are the kings of their turf, and that they can threaten anyone or make anyone wait half an hour. The big bosses do not have much to say to units that, in some places, are surrounded or, in any case, are distant. Weapons were stolen from the British vehicle. Gen. Dilic said they would be recovered. Well, that is not the case. Those weapons were dispersed in no time. They are sold or kept as souvenirs. We are in a nasty predicament. We came as a peacekeeping force. As you know, peacekeeping in a country at war is not very gratifying. Gen. Cot (UNPROFOR commander in chief) said last week: It would be easier to wage a war than do what we are doing now. We wear blue helmets; we ride in white vehicles. We are a perfect target, and can be recognized at a distance. We only have very light weapons. It is not easy. [Rotthier] If I question people in Sarajevo, they say: What does UNPROFOR bring us? There has not been water for days in the house where we live, and there has not been electricity for even longer. [Briquemont] Recently, I heard someone say: If my child has something to eat, it is thanks to UNPROFOR. I think the people certainly respect the work we are doing. In the beginning, there was an enormous misunderstanding. People thought UNPROFOR had come to fight the aggressor. That was not our mandate. [Rotthier] No, but is it really not possible, with the troops and resources you have, to provide electricity, water, and gas to the city? [Briquemont] Gas is a separate problem. It comes from Russia, and passes through Hungary and Serbia. We checked more than 117 km of gas pipes between Sarajevo and Zvorni (a border town between Bosnia and Serbia), and after a few problems everything was in order. I have not managed to find out where the real problem lies. Sometimes the pressure in the pipe is normal, but usually it is too low. The gas has been played around with, which is extremely dangerous. People "tinker around" with the pipes. If the pressure should return to normal, there will be a risk of accidents. I met with Mr. Kozyrev (Russian foreign minister), who told me Russia would continue supplying [gas], even if the Bosnians did not pay. This is a matter between Bosnians and Serbs. It is also a question of money, since the Bosnians are refusing to pay their bills because they suspect they would be contributing to the Serbs share, too. As for electricity: If we get 35 megawatts, we are in good shape. You might be staying in a place that depends on a generator. In Sarajevo, there are 227 generators in all. At the beginning of the war, all the coolant oil was taken out of them because, as chance would have it, you could drive using these oil tanks. We now need 100 or 150 liters of oil per transformer. We had all the authorizations to supply this special oil according to a fixed quota: two-thirds for the Bosnians, one-third for the Serbs. But now there is another problem: The oil is being stolen. The police commissioner and I have looked for a way to protect the oil -- so far unsuccessfully. We should be able to add something to it so that it can no longer be used for cars. There is water when there is electricity, so electricity is the key. We are now trying to repair a tram line. That would be something very concrete. People are tired of walking around. There are 20 tram cars left. [Rotthier] And electricity is needed for them too? [Briquemont] The snipers are a bigger problem. At a tram stop it would be all too easy to find some victims. We are thinking about painting the tram cars white and putting UN insignias on them. Generally speaking, the situation is rather disapppointing for the people -- that I can understand. You must also realize, however, that every day the French distribute 80 to 100 tonnes of foodstuffs to all the population groups. Naturally, the ministers do not like this, because then there is nothing for them. I have been told that people lost an average of 15 kilos in weight last winter. We are once again inviting artists, who can eat their fill. We received a visit from an opera singer who probably used to look like Montserrat Caballe. When I saw her, she was like... [Rotthier] Callas. [Briquemont] Yes. Certain products are lacking. Not enough sugar is distributed. People crave sweets. If you offer someone a piece of chocolate, it looks like you are giving away gold. And that is not just because it is Belgian chocolate. However, it is wrong to busy ourselves just with Sarajevo. Other parts of Bosnia are worse off: Tuzla, for example, where 800,000 people, including many refugees, are stuck. [Rotthier] UNPROFOR is bound by a mandate that says it must be limited, for the most part, to a humanitarian role. What would your ideal mandate be? [Briquemont] According to me, it is not so much a problem of mandate. It does not please me to repeat it: There is a gap between the resolutions in the UN Security Council and the resources the military personnel receive on the ground for applying the mandate. That is the problem. Recently, [Belgian Foreign] Minister Claes invited me to Luxembourg to talk about the plans for a humanitarian corridor. Gen. Cot said: We need an extra 4,000 men for that. During a subsequent meeting, all possible subjects were discussed, but nothing was arranged for these 4,000 men. The meetings continued. People would say: We should have this, and we should have that. But if we asked for resources to carry it out, we got nothing. I am now going to welcome a battalion from Malaysia. We have been asked to help them with their equipment. I do not know if Malaysians know what a snowflake looks like. I pity these soldiers. They are coming in midwinter, when temperatures are minus 20 degrees celsius. What will they do? Sit around a fire hoping not to die of the cold. I cannot put them at the checkpoints; I cannot let them go on patrols. I will probably not be able to use them properly before spring. I do not resent them; they are doing what they can, but they are a strain on the troops that are already here, and they are going to have a tough time all winter. This is an army that has been cobbled together. Each country has its own equipment. There are just 400 Ukrainians, which means they have difficulty keeping their logistics up to the mark. There are differences in training. There are problems with language. The Ukrainians speak no English or French; communication is achieved through an interpreter. In periods of crisis, this is not feasible. At such times, you must be able to communicate directly. There are also governments that do not accept all the assignments. The Scandinavian battalion came under certain conditions: It only wants to operate in Tuzla. The Danes wanted to come with tanks as a matter of course. I do not want to go into this too much, because there is little sense for me to moan the entire time about what the political officials in charge decide; but for the first time in my career as an officer, a battalion commander has refused to carry out an order because his government did not allow it. You must realize what that means for an officer: refusing an order. I wanted to put the Scandinavians in Srebrenica temporarily, while awaiting the arrival of the Netherlanders. That was rejected. The Danes have been stuck in Belgrade for two and a half months because the Serbs are refusing to let their tanks through. They regard tanks as weapons of war, not as peacekeeping instruments. Generally speaking, the problem is that we have to make compromises without a clear goal. As long as there is no military agreement, we will divide our attention between providing humanitarian aid, accompanying convoys, the mission on Mount Igman, defending not very well defined safe areas, and so on. I can assure you: It is not easy. [Rotthier] A few months ago, reports appeared about irregularities within UNPROFOR: the black market, prostitution, drugs. How much of this is true? [Briquemont] There was an inquiry. I have just read the results and I am somewhat reassured. There were a few individual deeds, which, in a couple of cases, were punished. In a city like this, it is hard to stop an individual from selling a pack of cigarettes, or to pay for a girl with a carton of cigarettes. I was afraid there was an organization behind it, but that was refuted by the inquiry. [Rotthier] What about prostitution? [Briquemont] Not especially. There is prostitution in all cities. So why not in Sarajevo, too? [Rotthier] Drugs? [Briquemont] Very little. The main problem is fuel. The black market prices are so high (700 Belgian francs per liter -- DE STANDAARD editor's note) that it is difficult not to find oneself short of a liter now and then. [Rotthier] About one year ago, in an interview with DE MORGEN, you spoke of your concern for the future of the Belgian Army. How are the Belgians doing here? [Briquemont] Well. Very well. However, they are involved in special programs: engineering and transportation. I am still uneasy about the future of the Belgian Army. Following the abolition of military service, we had to form units by going virtually everywhere to look for men. Some had to alter their function, which -- we must admit -- caused extensive disorganization. Because, giving you just one example, who will maintain the tanks if their drivers are being retrained in communications? We must look to find sufficient professional volunteers. We will also suffer Flemish-Walloon problems, about which we can do nothing. For a whole series of historical, political, social, and economic reasons, it is easier to find recruits in Wallonia. We used to be able to compensate by using militiamen, but what shall we do now? I heard one former general say that a professional army is not more expensive -- but that is nonsense. You have to offer the soldiers something, training, specialization. Here I have come up with a whole range of ideas for training. I have discovered that everyone -- officers, even young noncommissioned officers -- have to display tremendous cool-headedness. They often find themselves alone in extremely difficult situations. Yesterday, a mortar exploded 10 meters from my vehicle. They must act. They must be capable, for example, of being detailed to Mount Igman, where the Serbs are 50 meters to the left and the Bosnians are 50 meters to the right; and of not losing their cool if the two sides start shooting at each other. In conventional military situations, you fight for four or five days before being relieved. Here it never stops, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It may meet with resistance, but when I return to the 1st Corps, they will realize it is not a matter of forming a professional army on the basis of acquired rights such as a 38-hour work week, recuperation days, and so on. We must have fresh, trained men. A professional army will not accept simply anyone. Soldiers must be in good condition. That is the only way to limit losses. And it is the only way to be capable of handling situations of this kind. [Rotthier] Turning to your own future, how long will you go on doing this? Your assignment is of no fixed duration. [Briquemont] No, but fatigue plays a role. I have been here for six months. In principle, all assignments last for six months. [Rotthier] Are you thinking of retiring? [Briquemont] Ha! No, not at all. The defense minister and my superiors see what I am doing and are aware of the limits of what is tolerable. Anyone who becomes too tired makes wrong decisions. [Rotthier] How do you see the future in Bosnia? Two months ago, in an interview with VOX [Belgian Armed Forces magazine], you were still conspicuously optimistic. That would now seem to be less the case. [Briquemont] That is true. I believed an agreement would be forthcoming. There was a period of international consensus that an agreement had to be reached. I was optimistic. I am not a pessimist by nature. The agreement never materialized. Lord Owen is now maintaining once again that an agreement is not far beyond our reach. I have become more cautious. Never again will I say that I am optimistic. Should an agrement come about quickly after all, then that would be wonderful. [Rotthier] There are signals emanating from Great Britain and France that could be taken to indicate that these countries are considering withdrawing their troops. Is there a chance UNPROFOR will withdraw from Bosnia? [Briquemont] Many countries are asking themselves questions. That is normal. However, suddenly pulling out, even if no agreement is reached, would be difficult to understand. By the way, I too wonder whether the inhabitants of Sarajevo would allow us to withdraw. We are strongly criticized -- and I can understand that, because the people are suffering -- but we are nonetheless guaranteeing the civil population minimal security, merely by virtue of our presence. Our presence makes a difference. That is what I find disturbing about the criticisms leveled at us. We have few resources, but I can say we have saved the lives of hundreds of people. Our soldiers realize full well what their work means. When I see the enthusiasm with which French Legionnaires distribute food...well, that is not something you expect of a Legionnaire. They even do puppet shows for the children. We receive our fulfillment from the population, which expresses its gratitude to us. [Rotthier] Are you satisfied that you have fulfilled your duty? [Briquemont] I do not think it is possible to be satisfied with this kind of work in a country ravaged by bloodbaths and horrors. You must bring yourself to display great modesty. I came here to take sides with the population. If I succeeded in helping to save human lives, then I would consider my assignment to be partly successful. I am disillusioned that we have still not made very much progress along the road to a peace settlement, but at the human level I have experienced something extraordinary. I have reached the conclusion that this kind of conflict can never be solved by violent means. I have also grown aware of the fact that in this kind of operation you have to switch off at the personal level, which is not easy for a general to do. You must listen, exercise patience, and be modest. Incidentally, I already said to my wife: "When I return, you will have another husband." [end Briquemont] The interview is over. The general poses, rather uncomfortably, for the photographs. He refuses to smile. "That would not be appropriate," he says.
