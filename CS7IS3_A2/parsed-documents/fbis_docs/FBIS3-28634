While meeting with reporters at Kimpo Airport upon his return from a visit to three Nordic countries, Kim said he believes North Korea would accept it if the United States, in concert with China, persuades North Korea over a package deal. Kim stressed that the nuclear question should be resolved at an early date before it is referred to the U.N. Security Council. The former opposition leader also said that if a war recurs on the Korean peninsula, it would deal a tremendous damage to the 70 million Korean people. Referring to the idea of taking Pyongyang in a war, which was recently voiced by a senior U.S. Administration official, Kim said, "We must cooperate with the United States in areas where we should, but the United States ought to be more prudent over matters like this."
