The letter from Friday [7 January] claims that the previous letter did not contain a murder threat against [former PDS Chairman Gregor] Gysi but "only" against all those who move about freely in the PDS office. The Office for the Protection of the Constitution is greeted with the remark that it will not catch the "WAW," instead, "we will catch you all." Just as in the first letter, an ultimatum is posed to the PDS for clearing out the office by the end of January. In flowery words the authors glorify Hitler and are outraged about being called fascists -- they are, on the contrary, National Socialists. The PDS office has filed another complaint with the police, who reportedly are watching the house more intensively now. According to findings by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the "WAW" is a group of extremely militant neo-Nazis.
