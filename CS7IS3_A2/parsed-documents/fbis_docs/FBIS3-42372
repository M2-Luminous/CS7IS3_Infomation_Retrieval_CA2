[passage omitted] [Rabin] Syria could influence Hizballah and prevent it from continuing its activities. Syria does not control Hizballah; it is commanded by Iran and Lebanon. Nevertheless, Syria could use its influence to curb its activities. Syria could give its backing to the Lebanese Government by allowing it to deploy more troops in south Lebanon, as it wanted to do after Operation Accountability, thereby creating the conditions for tranquility with a view to reaching a peace treaty with Lebanon, which entails certain arrangements concerning security and some guarantees concerning the Lebanese who have been operating alongside us. Syria has not done that, and I am afraid that in this respect, it has not shown by word or deed what we would expect of it if the idea is to establish confidence-building measures with a view to continuing the peace talks with us.
