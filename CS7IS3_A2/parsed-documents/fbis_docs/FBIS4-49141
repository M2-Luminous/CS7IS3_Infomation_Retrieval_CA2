According to confidential documents from the Canadian Department of Citizenship and Immigration, a new "control strategy" hopes to cut down on the number of immigrants who come to Canada and fail to set up promised businesses. Once the changes are in place, it could become much harder to qualify as a business immigrant. Those who do will be subject to far stricter monitoring. Entrepreneurs in British Columbia will soon be asked to allow immigration officers to review their tax files. "For deterrence to be effective, participants must believe that the chance of detection is high," the documents say, with "severe consequences". The move is in response to widespread abuse of the entrepreneur programme, which allows experienced business persons to obtain Canadian citizenship in exchange for setting up a small business that employs at least one Canadian. In most cases, the business must be established within two years. To cut down on abuse, Canada started issuing conditional visas in early 1993, but there has been little improvement. In fact, abuse has been so bad that in some parts of Canada immigration officers cannot locate many of the participants. Many of the abusers are Hong Kong immigrants. A few years ago, an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found 149 Hong Kong residents who were setting up fake businesses in Canada. In order to drive home the point that Ottawa is serious in encouraging entrepreneurs to stick to their plans, it is to deport several immigrants who have violated their visas. There is no indication of how many entrepreneurs might be targeted for removal from Canada, but one source said 34 cases in the Montreal area are facing charges. "In our view even a small number of successful removals of entrepreneurs...would provide a strong deterrent effect," the documents say. Other proposed measures are: to take action against immigration lawyers, consultants and agents who "misrepresent" the entrepreneur programme, often by falsely claiming government approval or watering-down the programme's requirements; better overseas selection of entreprenuer immigrants-creating an "electronic file" on each entrepreneur immigrant; requiring them to submit progress reports every six months; requiring entrepreneurs to post a performance bond upon landing; and information exchanges with other organisations to locate missing entrepreneurs. Most Hong Kong people applying as business immigrants go to Canada as entrepreneurs. According to the immigration section at the Commission for Canada in Hong Kong, most of the business visas issued to Hong Kong immigrants are given to entrepreneurs. Of the 28,217 total landings from Hong Kong in the first nine months of last year, 6,011 were in the entrepreneur category. Even before the plan has been implemented, it is already the subject of controversy. A Toronto immigration lawyer, Mendel Green, who has been asked by Ottawa to help assess the business immigration programme, branded the plans "infantile". "They should perhaps put their efforts to showing the great successes of Hong Kong immigrants in Canada as an example to others since the abuse is in such a low level," he said. Green said the Immigration Department had exaggerated the problem.
