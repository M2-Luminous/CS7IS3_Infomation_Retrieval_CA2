FR940414-2-00016 FR940414-2-00009 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION [OMB Control No. 9000&hyph;0113] Clearance Request for Acquisition of Helium AGENCY: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Notice of request for an extension to an existing OMB clearance (9000&hyph;0113). SUMMARY: Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501), the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Secretariat has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request to review and approve an extension of a currently approved information collection requirement concerning Acquisition of Helium. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Fayson, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy, GSA (202) 501&hyph;4755. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Purpose The Helium Act (Pub. L. 86&hyph;777) (50 U.S.C. 167a, et seq. ) and the Department of the Interior's implementing regulations (30 CFR parts 601 and 602) require Federal agencies to procure all major helium requirements from the Bureau of Mines, Department of the Interior. It has been the Department of the Interior's policy, consistent with Congressional intent that Government helium be used in Government contracts, and that all Government contracts involving the use of significant amounts of helium require that Government helium be used in performing the contract. The appropriate vehicle for the establishment of requirements pertaining to Government procurement is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Current FAR coverage on the subject references 30 CFR parts 601 and 602. These are Department of the Interior regulations dealing with helium sales and helium distribution. However, the FAR contains no substantive guidance on procurement of helium and does not require submission of information that will permit the Bureau of Mines to ascertain whether Federal agencies are using Government helium and are requiring in their contracts that Government helium be used in contracted-for work. The new FAR coverage provides an appropriate level of guidance on the subject, including a requirement that offerors responding to contract solicitations provide information as to their forecast of helium required for performance of the contract. Such information will facilitate enforcement of the requirements of the Helium Act and the contractual provisions requiring the use of Government helium by agency contractors, in that it will permit corrective action to be taken if the Bureau of Mines, after comparing helium sales data against helium requirement forecasts, discovers apparent serious discrepancies. The information is used in administration of certain Federal contracts to ensure contractor compliance with contract clauses. Without the information, the required use of Government helium cannot be monitored and enforced effectively. B. Annual Reporting Burden Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average .5 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 50; responses per respondent, 1 ; total annual responses, 50 ; preparation hours per response, .5 ; and total response burden hours, 25 . C. Annual Recordkeeping Burden The annual recordkeeping burden is estimated as follows: Recordkeepers, 50; hours per recordkeeper, .5; and total recordkeeping burden hours, 25. OBTAINING COPIES OF PROPOSALS: Requester may obtain copies of OMB applications or justifications from the General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), room 4037, Washington, DC 20405, telephone (202) 501&hyph;4755.
