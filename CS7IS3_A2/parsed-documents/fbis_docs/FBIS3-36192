He said that these statements must not be taken seriously because they were made "in the heat" of the election campaign in Crimea. To quote the diplomat, in Massandra the Russian and Ukrainian presidents agreed that the Black Sea Fleet would be Russian. "The talk about changes in Ukraine's official position and about a roll- back to the Yalta agreements, according to which the Black Sea Fleet was equally divided between Russian and Ukraine, might be resumed only if President Kravchuk made a corresponding statement," he said. Russia will not depart from the Massandra agreements, a high- ranking Defense Ministry official told Interfax. He said that the Defense Ministry continued work on new agreements that would supplement the Massandra accord. He noted in particular that some of the actions by the Ukrainian side contradict with these agreements. "Thus, on Wednesday, February 2, the Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev sent a response to his Ukrainian counterpart Vitaly Radetsky in which he opposed Kiev's initiative to institute the post of commander of the Sevastopol military district," he said. "Why should we institute a separate post if it is already occupied by the commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral Eduard Baltin, nominated by the presidents of the two countries?" "Suppose we resumed the discussion of the fleet division. What then? Even in better times Kiev financed only 16 percent of the Black Sea Fleet's needs. Ukraine cannot afford the Black Sea Fleet and will auction it off. It is also clear that this will not benefit either Russia's or Ukraine's defense capability," he said.
