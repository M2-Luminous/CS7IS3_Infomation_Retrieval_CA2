According to local officials, the power plant in coastal Zhejiang Province, has so far generated 2.93 billion kwh of electricity, and the waste gas, waste water and trash produced are far below the limits set by the central government. The officials attributed the achievement to the effective measures adopted by the Qinshan nuclear power corporation. For instance, the company has used TV, radio and exhibitions to enhance consciousness of safety in production among workers in a bid to ensure that the nuclear power plant operates safely on a long-term basis. The Qinshan nuclear power plant started full-load trial operation in July 1992. Its construction began in 1985 and took six years to complete.
