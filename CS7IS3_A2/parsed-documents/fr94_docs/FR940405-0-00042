FR940405-0-00042 FR940405-0-00004 B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. DOE certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. C. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act No new information collection or record keeping requirements are imposed by this final rule. Information collection provisions of this rule were previously approved under OMB Control No. 1910&hyph;0300. Accordingly, no Office of Management and Budget clearance is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1990 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and the procedures implementing that Act, 5 CFR 13230.1 et seq. D. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act The DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent a major Federal action having significant impact on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1959 [42 U.S.C. et seq. (1976)], or the Council of Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508) and DOE guidelines (10 CFR part 1021), and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA. E. Review Under Executive Order 12612 Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987) requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government, the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. This final rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions of States. F. Review Under Executive Order 12778 Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. The DOE certifies that today's rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.
