FR940323-2-00044 FR940323-2-00030 Refund Applications Acme Steel Co., 02/01/94; RF272&hyph;45165; RD272&hyph;45165 The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed by Acme Steel Company (Acme), a producer of steel and steel products, in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding. A group of States and Territories (States) objected to the application on the grounds that the applicant was able to pass through increased petroleum costs to its customers. In support of their objection, the States cited increases in Acme's sales and earnings from 1973 to 1974. In addition, the States submitted an affidavit of an economist stating that, in general, the steel industry was able to pass through increased petroleum costs. The DOE determined that the evidence offered by the States was insufficient to rebut the presumption of end-user injury and the applicant should receive a refund. The DOE also denied the States' Motion for Discovery, finding that discovery was not warranted where the States had not presented evidence sufficient to rebut the applicant's presumption of injury. In addition, the DOE found that the petroleum coke purchased by Acme originated in a crude oil refinery and was purchased from a reseller who did not substantially change its form. Therefore these purchases were found to be eligible for a crude oil refund. The refund granted to the applicant in this Decision was $75,035. Lou-Jak Trucking Service, 02/03/94; RC272&hyph;226 The DOE issued a Supplemental Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by Wilson, Keller and Associates (WKA) on behalf of Lou-Jak Trucking Service (Lou-Jak) (Case No. RF272&hyph;91757). Lou-Jak was granted a refund in Linston Inc., Case Nos. RF272&hyph;91500 et al. (January 3, 1994). After that decision was issued, WKA informed the DOE that a substantial portion of Lou-Jak's gallonage claim was based upon purchases made by the owner-operators of vehicles whose services were rented by Lou-Jak. WKA stated that the owner-operators, not Lou-Jak, purchased this fuel. Accordingly, the DOE rescinded the portion of Lou-Jak's refund that was based on the purchases made by the owner-operators. Texaco Inc./Burlington Northern Railroad; Dairymen, Inc. 02/04/94; RF321&hyph;8232; RF321&hyph;8353 The DOE issued a Decision and Order in the Texaco Inc. refund proceeding concerning Applications for Refund filed by Burlington Northern Railroad and Dairymen, Inc. Both of these applicants had purchased some of their Texaco products through retail outlets at locations nationwide. The applicants attempted to estimate the amount of product purchased through retail outlets using their total cost as reflected in Texaco credit card payments. The DOE found that the applicants were entitled to refunds based upon their retail purchases, but that their estimates were flawed because they used inappropriate per gallon costs in converting purchase costs to purchase volumes. The DOE calculated, for each year of the refund period, a nationwide average retail price for branded motor gasoline, and used those selling prices to calculate the applicants' purchase volumes. The applicants were granted refunds based upon both their direct Texaco purchases and their purchases through retail outlets. The refunds granted in this Decision and Order total $401,962 ($291,340 in principal plus $110,622 in interest). Texaco Inc./Fairwood Texaco, 02/03/94; RF321&hyph;20044 The DOE issued a Supplemental Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by Robert West on behalf of Fairwood Texaco (Case No. RF321&hyph;9165). Fairwood Texaco was granted a refund in Texaco Inc./Gaeta Brothers Oil, Inc. Case Nos. RF321&hyph;6560 et al. (September 28, 1993). The DOE received another application on behalf of Fairwood Texaco filed by Robert Brisendine (Case No. RF321&hyph;16546). Mr. Brisendine claimed and documented ownership dates that overlapped with those claimed by Mr. West. In response to a request for documentation of his ownership dates, Mr. West informed the DOE that Mr. Brisendine's dates of ownership were correct. Accordingly, the DOE rescinded a portion of Mr. West's refund.
