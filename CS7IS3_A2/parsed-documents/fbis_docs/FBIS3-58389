However, it does not give a timeframe, nor is there any talk about security guarantees. I would say there is too little meat on the bones. [Woerner] On the contrary, Mr. Burkhalter. There is a lot of meat on the bones -- concrete military and political cooperation, to include consultations in crises. This means a lot. It means that their security will also be strengthened through such cooperation. But, of course, there are not yet security guarantees. This does not mean, however, that we would remain passive in case they were attacked. [Burkhalter] Mr. Woerner, Russia plays a special role in NATO's considerations. Reduced to a formula, I would say -- neither NATO together with Russia, nor NATO against Russia. What is Russia to NATO? [Woerner] Oh yes, Russia is a very important partner, with whom we are seeking a special partnership, including a strategic partnership. What we want is to build a greater Europe, a Euro-Atlantic community with the Russians, so that they do not have to feel excluded or even surrounded. What we are doing is a great historic attempt to include them. However, we do not allow anyone to dictate to us to whom we should extend the alliance. [Burkhalter] What exactly do you mean by include, Mr. Woerner? [Woerner] What we mean by this is that we will not only build such a Europe with them, but we will also make decisions following close consultations and discussions with them. [Burkhalter] Polish President Lech Walesa demanded that NATO should test Russia's credibility. [Woerner] Well, this is his formulation; I would put it differently. I would say we expect the Russians not only to respect human rights at home but also their neighbors' sovereignty. Such cooperative behavior, or -- to put it this way -- such respect for the neighbors' sovereignty and their intention not to pursue hegemonic objectives again, are certainly prerequisites and preconditions for fruitful cooperation with NATO. [Burkhalter] But such conditions do not yet exist. [Woerner] Well, some people there are using language we do not like to hear. I hope they will moderate their language. By the way -- the coarser the language in Moscow, the more they will drive some Central and East European states into NATO's arms. [Burkhalter] A few words on NATO's stance on the Bosnian conflict, Mr. Woerner. Some NATO members are audibly thinking about air raids against Serbian positions, and the U.S. side has said -- I quote -- that one is ready to consider attacks, if the siege of Sarajevo and the situation justify this. Is this not a slap in the face to the people who are being killed there in a war that has lasted for two years now? [Woerner] Do not forget that we depend on the United Nations. We can only do what the United Nations has mandated us to do, and we have carried out that mission swiftly and efficiently. We have now offered to use our air power if Sarajevo or other cities are strangulated, or if Srebenica is blocked. But here, too, we depend on the approval of the United Nations and on the opinion of the UNPROFOR troops in the former Yugoslavia. [Burkhalter] This means that NATO is now embarking on a tougher course. [Woerner] The current mood here and the much greater determination among NATO members indicate at least that things cannot continue. This is what I felt last night when I had a very detailed talk over dinner with the heads of state and chiefs of government. Let us hope that this determination is followed by deeds. We would like to see the responsible people take notice of these signals, so that we do not have to take such measures. [Burkhalter] Mr. Woerner, I thank you very much for this interview.
