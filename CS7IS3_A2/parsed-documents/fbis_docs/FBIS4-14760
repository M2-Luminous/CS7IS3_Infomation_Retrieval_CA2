It is that task which is the main aim behind the draft document "On Securing Civil Accord" which Russian President Boris Yeltsin gave to State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin last Thursday. Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko also received a copy of the draft, so all Federal Assembly deputies will be familiarized with it. The document is seven-and-a-half pages long. It contains sections on the economic, political, spiritual, moral, and cultural life of society, on nationalities and regional policy, and, lastly, on the terms for the fulfillment of the agreement and on the sides' liability for the violation of these terms. It would evidently be inadvisable and even harmful to envisage tough punitive measures. There is no prosecutorial tone in the draft. It is proposed to set up conciliation commissions to deal with contentious issues; these are to operate openly and submit their opinions and, if necessary, their censure of anyone's actions to public verdict. It is still hard to talk about a firm date for the signing of the agreement. The president would like to start the signing procedure in late April and has set a provisional date of 28 April. With a whole series of provisos he has also set the number of possible signatures at around 25, so that more and more political forces can subscribe to the agreement as they "mature." People who think that Boris Yeltsin's political temperament is exhausted are mistaken. That note was struck in the assumption that he will only take part in the 1996 presidential elections as a voter. The president will not leave the helm unless he is sure he is giving it into safe hands. It cannot be ruled out that a sufficiently large proportion of the population will ask Yeltsin to run. Needless to say it will be the president himself who will make the decision, but in the meantime I would not be as hasty as some of our media in tossing this subject into our heated political life. This will only agitate society. A moratorium on political passions would be more useful. The agreement must play that role.
