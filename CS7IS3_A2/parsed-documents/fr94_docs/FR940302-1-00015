FR940302-1-00015 FR940302-1-00004 Assume a debt is established against a veteran on a loan originated after December 31, 1989, because he or she did not respond to VA outreach efforts. After foreclosure, the veteran explains and documents that he or she did not contact VA and pursue alternatives to foreclosure because, at the time, there was insufficient family income available to obtain any other housing. The veteran therefore intentionally took advantage of the time required to complete foreclosure to provide shelter for his or her family. If the veteran questioned the validity of the debt by asserting that, under the circumstances, he or she did not show bad faith, the case would be reviewed by Loan Guaranty. (It could not be reviewed by the COWC because the COWC lacks jurisdiction over cases where the validity of debt is at issue.) Loan Guaranty could determine there were compelling reasons for the veteran's action, which would permit recission of the finding of bad faith, thereby invalidating the debt. The examples included with the definition are considered appropriate because Loan Guaranty debts arise from substantially different circumstances than other VA liability accounts. The proposed regulation is intended to clarify the types of conduct which would be considered ``bad faith'' with respect to Loan Guaranty debts. Comments are specifically invited on these points. Other changes required by Public Law 101&hyph;237 are being incorporated into the regulations through separate amendments. In addition, an amendment has been made to ยง36.4275 to conform to the requirements of the Fair Housing Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq. which make it unlawful to discriminate in residential housing transactions against any person because of familial status or handicap. Paperwork Reduction Act Sections 36.4275 and 36.4315 of these regulations contain information collection requirements which will result in a reporting burden. The reporting burden is estimated to average 10 minutes per response for a total of 16,667 hours. The average estimated time per response includes the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request that it approve this information collection requirement. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments for consideration by OMB on these proposed information collection requirements should address them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Joseph F. Lackey. The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendments will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The proposed amendments update VA regulations to implement the changes made by Public Law 101&hyph;237. The clarification of when a veteran has liability due to a loan default directly affects individual veterans, not small entities. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulations are exempt from the initial and final regulatory analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program numbers are 64.114 and 64.119.
