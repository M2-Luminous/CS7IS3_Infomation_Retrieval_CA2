The office is located in Lomas de Chapultepec, very close to Radio ACIR. Cuahtemoc Cardenas met with members of the PRD National Council, chaired by Porfirio Munoz Ledo, to discuss the situation following the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI candidate. The following is a report of what happened early this morning at the PRD office. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] The PRD joined the country's political organizations unanimous rejection of the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta. PRD presidential candidate Cuahtemoc Cardenas has voiced his sorrow for the violent action that took the life of the PRI candidate. He strongly condemned Colosio's murder and demanded it be immediately resolved. [Cardenas] We deeply regret and strongly condemn this action, which should be resolved. All Mexicans, and particularly his family, must learn the motives that caused the Colosio's murderers to commit such a deplorable action. [Reporter] Cardenas Solorzano, who met until very early this morning with the members of his party's National Council, has just suspended his campaign tour in Tlaxcala State. Cardenas said it is necessary to reestablish normalcy in the country's institutions, and added that the government has the obligation of guaranteeing the security of all citizens and those participating in the political events of the nation until the August elections are held. The elections will become the fulcrum to reestablishing the unity of all Mexicans. [Cardenas] We must restore normalcy to the country's institutions. We must have full guarantees for the development of the country's normal everyday activities, including economic, social, and political activities. The government has the obligation of offering security to all citizens. The government must also provide security to all of us as we exercise our rights so political activities continue and culminate in the elections, which we believe must be the point that will reestablish the unity of all Mexicans. [Reporter] The PRD candidate, who will personally present his condolences to the Colosio family and the PRI leadership, has urged citizens to remain united so that normalcy of the country's institutions can be restored as soon as possible. Cardenas Solorzano said that although he will continue with his electoral campaign as scheduled, he will modify his most recent calendar activities. [Cardenas] For the time being, the trip we had planned to Oaxaca State will not take place, and we will closely follow what happens these next few days. We will watch to see what other organizations as well as the pro-government party will do. According to its own statutes, it will have to replace the candidate. We will see what it does. It will be a new event of great importance for the country. [Reporter] The PRD candidate, who talked to the press after meeting with his party's National Council at his private office in Las Lomas, said he thought it unadvisable and risky to postpone the August elections. [Cardenas] It would be more traumatic to think the elections will not be held. That is why we feel the elections should be held, regardless of the fact we know we are experiencing an extremely delicate situation. We can save our institutions and save the law by reaffirming the life of our institutions. [end recording]
