This conference is an important political event in the political life of our party and people. The conference is designed to review the actual situation to continue to step up the renovation process -- a process that is being undertaken in a changing and complex world situation. The conference vociferously debated the Seventh Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee's political report presented by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi at the conference. Following the sixth party congress, the seventh party congress [as heard] has, over the past few years, substantiated and further perfected the renovation policy through its political platform and its socioeconomic development strategy which chart the course for the renovation to be carried out in a more extensive, harmonious, and steadier fashion along the socialist path. However, the renovation process, which is something new to us, is carried out at a time when the world situation is developing in a complex manner and when there are many new arising problems to be resolved promptly. Over the past few days, during their debates -- either in group debates or collective debates -- and during their refreshment breaks, the delegates enthusiastically discussed and unanimously agreed with those essential matters cited in the political report, ranging from the review of the implementation of the seventh party congress resolution to the summming up of the actual situation of the renovation process, and the determination of major policies and measures aimed at firmly defending the country under all circumstances to successfully implement the seventh party congress resolution. The delegates unanimously noted the three major achievements scored by our country, the most important being the fact that we have been able to overcome by a very important step the state of socioeconomic crisis, continue to maintain and consolidate political stability, broaden foreign relations, improve our country's prestige and position in the world, and thereby create a favorable international environment for our national construction and defense. Against a background of a complicatedly changing world and a domestic situation plagued with difficulties, what has been achieved by us attests to the correctness of the party's policy and the appropriateness of its steps. Our national revolution has been and is being carried out in the right direction along the path of consolidating national independence and building socialism -- the path chosen by our Uncle Ho, our party, and our people. These great achievements have generated new stature and strengths and new opportunities for us to gradually shift to a new stage of development where we can further accelerate our national industrialization and modernization. Besides these opportunities, the Vietnamese revolution is also facing new challenges, new deficiences, and new problems. Generally speaking, all the delegates unanimously agreed with various points summed up by the party Central Committee in its political report. These points are: -- Although having achieved some economic development, our country remains one of the world's poorest countries. -- Despite its faster pace of economic growth, there is the danger of being left further behind economically compared to nearby countries. -- While we want peace and development, hostile forces are resorting to various schemes and tricks aimed at realizing their peaceful evolution strategy. We must always heighten our vigilance against this. -- Our socioeconomic development, though guided along the renovation process, has given rise to many problems to be correctly dealt with if we are to keep our country from straying off the socialist path. -- Corruption and other social ills, which have not been dispelled, are causing serious losses economically and a drop in the people's confidence. All these are challenges to be overcome on the road toward development. Though not too optimistic, all the delegates firmly believed in the success of the renovation process. This is because we have, over the years, drawn on many useful lessons from objective realities. These lessons call for firmly maintaining the socialist course during the renovation process, linking the persistence in principles and revolutionary strategy with the flexibility in tactics, and remaining sensitive to acquire new things. While regarding as necessary the carrying out of the renovation in a comprehensive and uniform fashion, we must adopt appropritate steps, forms, and methods. We must also maintain the party leadership and state management in carrying out the commodity-based multisectoral economic development. We must develop socialist democracy, discover and correctly resolve those problems newly arising in renovation process. We must pay attention to reviewing realities, constantly supplement and gradually perfect our theory about the path toward buidling socialism. The delegates unanimously agreed that although the renovation is an unprecedentedly difficult process, we have boldly found a way out, bravely marched forward, and scored very important successes. The most basic and most decisive factors are that our party has held a ruling role, that we do not accept pluralism and a multiparty system, that we have upheld a sense of independence, sovereignty, and creativity, that we have adopted a policy and line in conformity with the pattern of activity and the realities of Vietnam and that we have been able to develop the integrated strengths of the all-people great solidarity bloc and to broaden our international relations. With a high sense of responsibility, all the delegates, whatever their field of activity, have expressed their sympathy for and contributed their views to unfailingly achieving the orientations and tasks for the period ahead as outlined in the political report, which calls for spurring a change in the econonomic mechanism along the direction of industrialization and modernization, consistently implementing the multisectoral economic development policy, and creating a driving force and more favorable environment for various economic components and various forms of enterprises to develop quickly and to achieve high results. We must harmoniously build the market system under the state management along socialist direction. The delegates contributed numerous views on the tasks of caring for, fostering, and developing the human factor as a driving force and a goal of the revolution. The most prominent issues discussed consist of achieving social justice, improving intellectual standards, ameliorating the society, and preserving and developing the identity of folk culture. Fighting corruption -- a present burning and pressing issue -- was also given attention by the delegates who unanimously agreed that the fight against corruption must be carried out in a resolute and drastic fashion in our entire working apparatus covering various echelons and sectors from the central down to local levels. Not only was the national security and defense issue given attention by delegates from the armed forces but it also received the views of almost all the participants who called for maintaining political stability, fighting the enemy's peaceful evolution strategy, and preventing social negativism. Most of the delegates also paid attention to the party-buiding and mass motivation tasks, especially the task regarding cadre organization. Some believed that we must have a consistent cadre organization policy that calls for not only gathering and propagating the younger generation of officially-trained party cadres and members but also for rallying the generation of party cadres and members with good records and experiences. They said that not much has been done in the spreading of propaganda on the party, especially among the younger generation, and that theoretical studies, especially the study of the theory on socialist construction, has not met requirements for attractiveness and for ideological guidance and actions among society. Many delegates also analyzed the role of grass-roots party organizations at the village and ward levels, especially those in the rural areas and in mountain regions and those belong to state-, state-private, and privately-run economic establishments. They stressed the need to establish order and discipline within party organizations, improve daily party activities, both in terms of format and contents, to increase leadership skills, militancy, and the ability to fulfill the duties of the entire party and of each party echelon. Delegates noted those results obtained in mass motivation in the past and pointed out the need to continue to strengthen leadership and guidance in a more practical fashion for the activities of various mass organizations, regarding this as an important factor to contribute to increasing the militancy and leadership skills of the party. As clearly outlined in the political report delivered by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi, lying ahead of us is a new stage with promising prospects and great challanges that must be definitely overcome by us, and with opportunities that must be fully exploited. All of our party, Army, and people must be of the same heart and minds and must be united as one, trying to struggle to bring the renovation forward so as to score even-greater successes. After four days of debates held in the form of both group debates and collective debates, the CPV Central Committee's political report delivered by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi, today, 25 January 1994, delegates to the midterm national party conference held group debates, discussing and exchanging views in preparation for a by-election of members to the Seventh Party Central Committee. Tomorrow, 25 January, the conference will be in plenary session at the conference hall.
