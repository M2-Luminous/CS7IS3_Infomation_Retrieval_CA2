FR940627-2-00127 FR940627-2-00052 Other violations found during the NRC's inspections and investigations, but unrelated to the July 1993 incident, include the Licensee's failure to: (1) ensure that pocket dosimeters worn by radiography personnel were checked for correct response to radiation at 12-month intervals, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(c), a violation that occurred on January 18, 1994, 13 days after the inspector had informed the RSO that he should remove uncalibrated dosimeters from service; (2) perform and record quarterly audits of radiography personnel for all calendar quarters in 1992, as required by license condition; (3) maintain constant surveillance and immediate control of licensed material in March 1993, as required by 10 CFR 20.207; (4) submit to the NRC a quality assurance program for use of shipping containers, as required by 10 CFR 71.12(b), a repeat violation in that it was cited in 1992 and had not been corrected by January 1994; and (5) leak test sealed sources prior to removing them from storage and transferring them to the manufacturer in April 1993 and December 1993, as required by license condition. The NRC has also concluded from its inspections and investigations that Mr. Wicks and employees of WIX violated the provisions of 10 CFR 30.10, ``Deliberate Misconduct,'' a regulation which prohibits individuals from deliberately causing a licensee to be in noncompliance with NRC requirements and prohibits individuals from deliberately providing materially false information to the NRC or a licensee. Specifically, based on its review of the July 31, 1993 incident, its review of the OI findings, and its review of the enforcement conference transcript, the NRC has concluded that Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to perform an evaluation of the assistant's radiation exposure; that Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to send the assistant's TLD in for immediate processing; that the radiographer deliberately failed to watch an assistant perform radiography operations; and that the radiographer and assistant deliberately provided materially false information to the Licensee about the incident. Based on its review of violations that were unrelated to the July 1993 incident, the NRC has concluded that Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to perform and record quarterly audits of radiography personnel in 1992, because Mr. Wicks stated that he was aware of these requirements and his responsibility to comply with them but failed to do so. The NRC also has concluded that Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to ensure that alarm ratemeters used by radiography personnel in March, April and July 1993 and January 1994 were calibrated at a one-year frequency, again because Mr. Wicks stated that he was aware of these requirements and his responsibility to comply with them but repeatedly failed to do so. III Based on the above, it appears that Licensee employees, including the president and radiation safety officer, have engaged in deliberate misconduct by deliberately violating NRC requirements that are important to the protection of radiography personnel and the public and have failed to ensure compliance with numerous requirements that are important to the safe use of radiographic sources. Deliberate violations of the nature described above cannot and will not be tolerated by the NRC. Further, the history of numerous violations, including repetitive violations, and the failure to follow through on important safety issues, indicate that Mr. Wicks, who is the president and radiation safety officer, is either incapable or unwilling to ensure that the Licensee's radiography program is conducted in accordance with all NRC requirements. Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the Licensee's current operations can be conducted under License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public, including the Licensee's employees, will be protected. Therefore, the public health, safety, and interest require that License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 be suspended. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the violations and deliberate misconduct described above are such that the public health, safety, and interest require that this Order be immediately effective. IV Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 30 and 34, It is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that license no. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 is suspended pending further order. The Regional Administrator, Region IV, may, in writing, relax or rescind this order upon demonstration by the Licensee of good cause. V In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, the Licensee must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation, specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this order and set forth the matters of fact and law on which the Licensee or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of the hearing request also should be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011, and to the Licensee if the hearing request is by a person other than the Licensee. If a person other than the Licensee requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d). If a hearing is requested by the Licensee or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be sustained. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), the Licensee, or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
