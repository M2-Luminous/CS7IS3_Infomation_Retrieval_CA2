The report takes up for the first time the cases of Taiwan and China, which is applying for GATT membership, enumerating such high tariffs and other "points whose correction is desired" in order for China to realize its bid for membership in the near future. Regarding the United States, the report strongly criticizes such unilateral measures as the Super 301 section of the Omnibus Trade Law (for designating and applying sanctions against nations conducting unfair trade and acts). It seems likely that other countries will oppose such criticisms, saying that Japan first needs to reduce its trade surplus. They may also question Japan's stance to tackle such tasks as expanding imports. The report was put together by the ISC World Trade Organization (WTO) Committee's investigation subcommittee for unfair trade policies and measures (chaired by Seikei University Law School Professor Mitsuo Matsushita). The report can be said to be a Japanese version of the "report on foreign trade barriers" that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) announced in late March. The report classifies unfair policies and measures, -- including import volume restrictions, antidumping measures, and subsidies, which are obstacles to free trade -- into 13 areas. By using the rules of GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a yardstick, the report determines whether policies and measures of each trade partner are fair. The report includes comments on the ten major countries and regions that are Japan's major trading partners, including the United States, the European Union (EU), the ROK, Hong Kong, and Australia. In addition, Taiwan and China, which is applying for GATT membership, are also included in the report. Of the 12 nations and regions, 8 nations and regions are in Asia. Japan's trade surplus with the Asian nations in fiscal 1993 exceeded for the first time that with the United States. Reflecting changes in Japan's trade structure, the report attaches importance to Asia. However, since it points out Asian nations' problem points, it is certain that Japan, which has a huge trade surplus, will be urged to make further efforts to open up its market. China, (treating the EU as a single region), is Japan's third largest national trading partner. In fiscal 1992, Japanese investment in China doubled over the previous year's level. Although China is deepening its economic ties with Japan, the report clearly spells out China's various trade restriction measures as obstacles hindering the activities of Japanese corporations. Specifically, the report urges China to unify its trade systems, which vary by region and even by organization. China is also asked to revise its double price system whereby foreigners and Chinese are charged different fees for the same services and to improve its high tariff rates (35 percent on average) and import and export volume restrictions. Following China, Taiwan is Japan's fourth largest trading partner. The report points out that Taiwan has high tariffs on trucks (42.5 percent) and passenger vehicles (30 percent), and quantitative restrictions. In particular, Taiwan prohibits imports of passenger vehicles, motorcycles, fruits, alcoholic beverages, and cigarettes from Japan. Therefore, the report urges Taiwan to revise the import bans as quickly as possible. Moreover, the report names the United States in 10 out of 13 categories of unfair trade practices. It also says that the EU and the ROK have problems in four and five fields respectively. Regarding U.S. trade policies, particularly those for setting numerical targets, the report strongly criticizes the United States: "They can be said to violate the WTO accord and constitute `managed trade.'"
