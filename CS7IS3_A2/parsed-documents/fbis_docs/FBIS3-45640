In an interview with this year's No. 2 issue of the fortnightly magazine ZHONGHUA YINGCAI [CHINA'S TALENTS], Qiao Shi said: There is no precedent in the world for a smooth transition from a planned to a market economy, no ready formula for establishing the legal system of a socialist market economy. Therefore, China has to explore this on its own. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee was convened, the NPC and its Standing Committee have adopted more than 200 sets of laws and decisions concerning the law. Following the First Session of the Eighth NPC, 13 sets of laws and 11 decisions concerning the law have been adopted. A number of important laws will be enacted this year. The enactment and enforcement of these laws have guided, standardized, guaranteed, and regulated the creation of a socialist market economic structure. However, because the legislation for the socialist market economy covers extensive areas, there are numerous laws that need to be enacted. We must pay close attention to planning in our legislation. Judging from the present situation, the NPC and its Standing Committee must act promptly to formulate laws designed to standardize norms for the market, keep the market orderly, perfect macroeconomic control and regulation, and improve social security. The enactment of laws in these areas is essential to the establishment and perfection of a socialist market economy, which requires standardization and perfect legal guarantees. We should accelerate the pace of economic legislation and update the backward legal system in the spirit of reform so that people can be aware of legal and illegal behavior under the conditions of a market economy, and can use laws to guide, promote, and guarantee the smooth progress of reform and to provide a legal basis for the growth of the market economy. Meanwhile, we should revise or abolish in time laws and regulations which are incompatible with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure so as to ensure the consistency and coordination of the legal system of the market economy. In discussing outstanding problems in the current legislative work, Qiao Shi said: In formulating laws concerning the socialist market economy, it is imperative to follow the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to act in the spirit of the party's 14th National Congress and in accordance with China's Constitution. We must be bold in exploration and practice, and we must imbue ourselves with the spirit of reform in handling and resolving problems and difficulties in the course of legislation. First of all, we must maintain legislation in pace with the progress of reform and opening up. In accelerating the pace of economic legislation, we must have a thorough grasp of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's guideline that it is better to have than not to have laws and to expedite than to proceed slowly with the enactment of laws. To avoid legislation lagging behind reform, it is necessary to promptly formulate laws concerning matters that should be promoted or abolished. Second, we must subordinate local interests to the overall interests of the state. The growth of a market economy will inevitably break the traditional pattern of separating administrative powers. Therefore, in drafting laws, it is necessary to bear in mind the overall situation of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the state and its people, and to avoid undue emphasis on local interests and powers. Third, we must proceed from the reality in China and boldly study and draw on the experience of other countries. Fourth, we must improve the legislation of local people's congresses and promptly formulate local laws and regulations concerning the market economy. Fifth, experts should play a more important role in lawmaking. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said long ago that we must have more experts specializing in various fields to take part in making laws. This idea is important. From now on, whenever any department wants to draft a law, it must seek the support of experts in related fields to do the job. When we do so, not only can we pool the views of all quarters, broaden our vision with collective wisdom, and accelerate the legislative process, but we can also speed up the process of training legislative, judicial, and law enforcement personnel. Sixth, while speeding up the legislative process, we must also pay attention to improving the quality of laws. When a law is being made, we must thoroughly study the legal principles and repeatedly assess the feasibility of their application. While the articles are being drafted, every effort must be made to make them clear, specific, and applicable. We must also pay attention to the compatibility between laws and draw up supporting regulations. After laws have been enacted, some laws need guidelines for implementation, and others must be interpreted. Meanwhile, the inspection and supervision over the implementation of those laws must be intensified so that they can effectively safeguard and promote the development of our socialist market economy. Qiao Shi pointed out: Drawing up laws concerning the socialist market economy is something new for us. While we must consider China's actual situation when we draw up laws and regulations, we must also broadly study and borrow other countries' legislative experiences and learn about those that are useful to China. All the laws must be conducive to developing the economy and safeguarding China's stability and unity. While we must consider China's actual situation when we make a law, this does not mean that we can ignore foreign experiences. We must dare to assimilate that in foreign laws which is good and useful to us. We should also learn from their mistakes. We may directly transplant those articles that we can use, and then reinforce [chong shi 0339 1395] and improve them during their application. Because the market economy is an open, worldwide economy, our laws relevant to the market economy must be compatible with certain foreign laws. This compatibility not only can speed up our process of creating market economic laws but can also link our economy with the world economy and enable us to compete in the world. Stressing that laws must be strictly enforced in order to fight corruption, Qiao Shi pointed out: The problem of fighting corruption must be solved comprehensively. The problem cannot be effectively solved unless it is tackled with educational, administrative, legal, and various other measures. Over the years, the NPC and its Standing Committee have drawn up many laws specifying how corruption, bribery, smuggling, prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, drug trafficking, and other types of lawless behavior should be censured, and these laws are the legal basis for cracking down on economic crimes and punishing the corrupt elements. The problem now is that these laws have not been effectively enforced. Because laws are not obeyed -- or not strictly obeyed -- lawless conduct is not punished, and in certain places laws are replaced by verbal rulings or are repressed by wielders of power and crimes are even committed by law enforcement elements, certain lawless elements are not censured and acts of corruption have not been curbed effectively. Such phenomena must be corrected. To intensify legislation, law enforcement, and to censure corruption according to the law, the laws and regulations that have been drawn up must be firmly followed, everybody must be treated equally before the law, and no organizations or individuals may have the special privilege of placing themselves above the law. The NPC and its Standing Committee must intensify their inspection and supervision of the implementation of laws and must make every effort to correct the situation in which laws are not effectively enforced. Meanwhile, we must also seriously study the characteristics and the ways of fighting corruption when the country is adopting a socialist market economy, and we must continue to formulate or improve our laws and regulations relevant to administrative ethics so that there will be legal basis for censuring corruption more effectively. Qiao Shi stressed: To intensify the anticorrutpion struggle, the party and the state must also improve their supervisory functions. Socialist market economic operations certainly will give rise to readjustments of administrative authority over the economy between central and local authorities and among various departments, and we must devise effective mechanisms for controlling and supervising this authority. While establishing our socialist market economic system, we must have effective control and supervision over authority. Uncontrolled power is apt to generate corruption. During the course of the building of our socialist market economic system, we must also intensify our control and supervision over authority. We must set up a powerful supervisory system by organically combining the supervision by the party, state organs, organs of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the masses as well as by the media. The establishment and the perfection of the legal system governing our socialist market economy certainly will be fundamental measures helpful for guarding against the generation of corrupt phenomena.
