While recognizing the rare unvetoed resolution, they urged the international community to ensure the protection of the Palestinians. They also voiced concern at Washington's position on Jerusalem. Maha al-Sha'ir went to the Parliament and asked some of its members about last night's resolution. [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Hadi al-Majali, Foreign Relations Committee chairman] I was really disappointed that the resolution took more than three weeks to be adopted and in the consultation and negotiation behind the scenes until they reached that resolution. The positive, I suppose that this has been a resolution which give the Palestinians the right to have a protection in the occupied territories, international security present to protect the Palestinians and to give them certain protection in the occupied territories. The negative thing is the position of the United States concerning the Jerusalem problem. The massacre itself has proved that Jerusalem is a very important issue and the sensitive and important issue should be discussed. [Samir Qa'war] You know that Jerusalem is for everybody in the world really and it is for the three religions and it has to be solved within the context of the peace process negotiations, but we hope that the Arab rights in East Jerusalem will be realized to be controlled by the Arabs. ['Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah] Well, I don't think this is a pertinent resolution concerning a massacre of such a magnitude and the delay of the resolution which has taken around one month. Were it against any other country, it would have taken place instantaneously. The United States has been delaying taking such a resolution up until it mitigated the massacre itself after putting so many pressures on the PLO and on other members of the Security Council. Second, it only condemns; it didn't take any measures concerning the occupation, concerning the protection of the Palestinians. [end recording]
