Under-age people living in large cities are most at risk. In this respect, Szeged is considered to be an especially dangerous place. Szeged is a city along the Balkans drug route. The border crossing points and their surrounding areas at Nagylak and Roszke, the truck parking areas, and the market at Cserepes street, and half a dozen entertainment places in the city are intensely affected in the drug issue. Views differ on the number of drug users. It is estimated between 300 and 700. Some young people became drug addicts when glue-sniffing was in fashion, others have become addicts in recent times. Their number increases by some 50 each year. They mainly use cheap natural materials--mainly poppy--as a base. One dry poppy head costs 15 to 20 forints but the young people themselves can also get hold of green poppy. Some buy cigarettes costing 300 to 400 forints. The spread of hard drugs is not yet typical. Drug users usually enjoy the pleasure together, in apartments, mostly with materials made by themselves. A small number of known criminal cases are linked to drugs--some 12 of the 7,000 last year. However, it is not a negligible fact that more than half of the 14 to 18 age group has tried grass but in some classes, 90 percent of children said the same. It is a big problem that a large section of them see drugs as something positive. Recently, three deaths occurred that were directly linked with drugs. Prevention was first started in Szeged in 1987 by chief physician doctor Terez Farkasinszky, who has earned undying credit nationally. The drug surgery is located in Ujszeged at 4 Fesu street where, on average, 20 to 30 young people are seen a day. Since November, a nationally unique rehabilitation center has been operating in the area of isolated farms at Deszk. Drug addicts who have gone through detoxification can come here voluntarily if they accept that they will not leave the institute for a year and will abide by the conditions.
