Veber, Russian Academy of Sciences, Institute of Applied Physics, Nizhnyy Novgorod] [Abstract] A theoretical analysis was made of the effect of wind waves on the point scattering function of viewing systems used in the observation of undersea objects. The author points out initially that, while in the case of diffused illumination from a fairly wide light source the optical transmission function can be described as a Gauss function, in the presence of directed illumination from a single light source, such as the sun, the Gauss function no longer applies, and determining the optical transmission function becomes extremely difficult. In this case an analysis of the point scattering function is more useful. Through a series of formulae the author determines the integral paramemeters of the point scattering function under conditions of a rough sea surface illuminated by direct sunlight. The author concludes that distortions of the point scattering function are mainly caused by the effects of the cross-correlation of light radiation falling on the sea surface and of that coming from beneath it, and are specific for the conditions of directed illumination. At the same time the degree of distortion is dependent on a number of factors, chief of which are the angle between the direction of illumination and that of observation, the depth of the undersea object under observation, and the roughness of the waves, which is determined by surface wind velocity.
