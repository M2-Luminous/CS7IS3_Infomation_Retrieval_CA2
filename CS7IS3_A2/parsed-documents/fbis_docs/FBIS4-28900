Working-level negotiations on the three priority sectors of automobiles, government procurement, and insurance were held with division-chief-level officials from the two countries in attendance prior to the vice ministerial negotiations, but the working-level negotiations ended after both sides only exchanged views on their differences. "Objective criteria" have been the focus of contention in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, and the two countries have just started a full-fledged discussion of them. While some officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] say, "We intend to seek a settlement on all three priority sectors prior to the summit talks of major industrialized nations (the Naples summit) scheduled for July," the U.S. side is taking a wary attitude toward settling the three priority sectors, saying, "There is a possibility of the two countries agreeing on only part of them." At the outset of the working-level negotiations on automobiles, which were held in the Foreign Ministry on 3 June with division- chief-level officials from the two countries, the U.S. side said, "Let us not take up the quantitative criteria for discussion at these negotiations." The quantitative criteria may lead to a numerical target depending on how the "objective criteria" are handled in the future. The U.S. side wanted to put off discussing the quantitative criteria. Hard To Fathom Real Intent At the working-level negotiations on automobiles, both Japanese and U.S. officials almost completed the discussion of qualitative criteria. They made a certain headway by agreeing to adopt a criterion to measure progress in the improvement of bidding procedures, but they agreed to put off discussing the quantitative criteria to mid-June until after the second round of the vice ministerial negotiations. In late May, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor asked Japan to increase the number of car dealers selling foreign automobiles as an example of the objective criteria to measure the sales of foreign automobiles and auto parts in Japan, claiming, "Japan is supposed to promise to increase the number of car dealers selling foreign-built automobiles." His remark was tantamount to denying Japan's view that "The United States will not seek to set any numerical targets." A senior MITI official, for whom it seems hard to fathom the United States' true intentions, asks: "What do stores dealing in foreign cars mean after all? Do they mean car dealers selling foreign cars or dealerships selling foreign cars exclusively?" The handling of the objective criteria, including the definition of car dealers, will inevitably become a focal point at the vice ministerial negotiations that will be held between Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten and MITI Deputy Minister Okamatsu for two days beginning 10 June. The Japanese side has raised an objection to adopting the objective criteria to gauge the amount of auto parts imported by Japan, the number of U.S.-built right-hand-drive automobiles sold on the Japanese vehicle market, and the number of finished automobiles imported by Japan. The United States plans to propose that both Japan and the United States jointly assess these twice a year. The United States, however, may assert that the objective criteria should be set in a way that the number of car dealers selling foreign-built automobiles in Japan will increase visibly. NTT Is the Obstacle Another set of working-level negotiations on the insurance sector have only confirmed areas of agreement and differences but included no in-depth discussion of how the objective criteria should be set for that sector. At issue is how to treat foreign insurance companies that are expected to suffer financially by the deregulation of the third sector, in terms of insurance for safety custody [kaigo], injury, and disease. A Japanese negotiator anticipates rough sailing at the future negotiations, saying, "We do not necessarily need to reach an agreement with the U.S. side on the insurance sector prior to the Naples summit." Both Japan and the United States share the common view that "they must avoid creating a situation wherein the upcoming Japanese-U.S. summit talks are broken off again by settling first the insurance and automobile sectors out of the three priority sectors." In February, the two countries agreed 90 percent on the issue of government procurement (according to a Japanese Government source). The handling of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) issue is an obstacle to concluding the government procurement talks. The U.S. side has insisted that the NTT's procurement of communications equipment be taken up for discussion at the framework talks. In response, the Japanese side has rejected the U.S. side's demand, arguing, "It is improper for the framework talks to discuss procurement by a company that has been privatized." In this way, the two sides have confronted each other over NTT's procurement of communications equipment. NTT is set to take the lead in building the next-generation communications network in which Japan is expected to make a massive investment. This prospect has prompted the U.S. side to make its demand. The Japanese side intends to seek the understanding of the U.S. side by proposing that another set of bilateral negotiations be held to discuss the issue of NTT's procurement practices. MITI Eager To Speed Up Negotiations U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is mindful of the subtle differences in the progress achieved in the individual sector-by-sector negotiations, has indicated the prospect that "Japan and the United States will reach a partial agreement at the upcoming Japanese-U.S. summit talks." The negotiations on the automobile sector have lagged behind those on the other sectors. MITI and other relevant ministries, who are concerned by the possibility that "the two countries may put off reaching an agreement on the automobile sector, which has been taken as a symbol of Japanese-U.S. trade frictions," aim to settle matters in all three sectors. If Japan is too hasty in wanting to reach an agreement on the automobile sector, it will then have to make extensive concessions to do so. While the Japanese automobile industry is paying attention to the negotiations, the two countries have only one month before the Naples summit is held.
