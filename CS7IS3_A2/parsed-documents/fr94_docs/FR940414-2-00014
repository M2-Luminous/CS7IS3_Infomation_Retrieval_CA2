FR940414-2-00014 FR940414-2-00007 `` XXXX Amendment. An accused who waives or withdraws appellate review under this rule may no longer file an application for relief to the Judge Advocate General under R.C.M. 1201(b)(3). This promotes judicial efficiency and economy, as most issues are best resolved through the normal appellate process rather than through special application to the Judge Advocate General.'' The Analysis accompanying R.C.M. 1201(b) be amended by inserting the following at the end thereof: `` XXXX Amendment. Subsection (b) was amended to limit an accused to the filing of only one application for relief within the two-year filing period. Under R.C.M. 1110(g)(1), an accused who has previously waived or withdrawn appellate review may no longer file an application for relief under this rule. These changes ensure that all potential issues are resolved at the earliest opportunity and do not prohibit an accused from filing a petition for new trial under R.C.M. 1210 or restrict the ability of the Judge Advocate General to review the case, sua sponte.'' The Analysis to paragraph 4c be amended as follows: `` XXXX Amendment. Subparagraph (4) is new. It recognizes a limited defense of voluntary abandonment. It is based on case law. United States v. Schoof, 37 M.J. 96 (C.M.A. 1993); United States v. Rios, 33 M.J. 436 (C.M.A. 1991); United States v. Byrd, 24 M.J. 286 (C.M.A. 1987); Rios 32 M.J. 501 (A.C.M.R. 1990); United States v. Miller, 30 M.J. 999 (N.M.C.M.R. 1990); United States v. Walther, 30 M.J. 829 (N.M.C.M.R. 1990). The prior subparagraphs (4)&hyph;(6) have been redesignated (5)&hyph;(7), respectively.'' Insert the following after the analysis of paragraph 103: ``103a. Article 134 (Self-injury without intent to avoid service) c. Explanation. This offense is based on paragraph 183 a of MCM, U.S. Army, 1949; United States v. Taylor, 38 C.M.R. 393 (C.M.A. 1968); United States v. Ramsey, 35 M.J. 733 (A.C.M.R. 1992), pet. granted, C.M.A., 37 M.J. 25 (1993); see generally TJAGSA Practice Note, Confusion About Malingering and Attempted Suicide, The Army Lawyer, Jun. 1992, at 38. e. Maximum punishment. The maximum punishment for subsection (1) reflects the serious effect that this offense may have on readiness and morale. The maximum punishment reflected the range of the effects of the injury, both in degree and duration, on the ability of the accused to perform work, duty, or service. The maximum punishment for subsection (1) is equivalent to that for offenses of desertion, missing movement through design, and certain violations of orders. The maximum punishment for subsection (2) is less than the maximum punishment for the offense of malingering under the same circumstances because of the absence of the specific intent to avoid work, duty, or service. The maximum punishment for subsection (2) is equivalent to that for nonaggravated offenses of desertion, willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer, and nonaggravated malingering by intentional self-inflicted injury. f. Sample specification. See appendix 4, paragraph 177 of MCM, U.S. Army, 1949. Since incapacitation to perform duties is not an element of the offense, language relating to ``unfitting himself for the full performance of military service'' from the 1949 MCM has been omitted. The phrase ``willfully injure'' has been changed to read ``intentionally injure'' to parallel the language contained in the malingering specification under Article 115.''
