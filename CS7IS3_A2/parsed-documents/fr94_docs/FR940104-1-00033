FR940104-1-00033 FR940104-1-00007 II. USEPA's Evaluation of the Proposed Revision A. NSPS and NESHAP The Federal PSD definitions at 40 CFR 51.166 pertaining to: (1) ``Best Available Control Technology'' (BACT), (2) ``Allowable emissions'', (3) ``Federally enforceable'', and (4) the control technology review requirements make reference to applicable standards and standards of performance under 40 CFR part 60 (NSPS) and 40 CFR part 61 (NESHAP), respectively. In the comparable provisions of the State rule, the State refers to other NR 400 series chapters, i.e., NR 440, 445 to 499, and 400 to 499 of the State code. Although the State may have intended that these chapters approximate the requirements of 40 CFR parts 60 and 61, Wisconsin's NSPS and NESHAP regulations are not federally enforceable and may, in certain circumstances, differ significantly from the parts 60 and 61 requirements in the Federal PSD requirements. The references to parts 60 and 61 in the Federal PSD requirements for BACT and control technology review (§§51.166(b)(12) and 51.166(j)(1), respectively) set minimum emissions requirements. Because the State can set less stringent NSPS and NESHAP emission limits than the Federal standards, or not set any limits at all, the State PSD provisions which are dependent upon the requirements of Chapter 440 and Chapters 445 to 449 are not approvable. B. Stack Height The provisions in 40 CFR part 51, subpart I_``Revision of New Sources and Modifications'' set forth both general and specific requirements for permitting PSD sources, including definitions. In order for the State to implement the stack height provision in accordance with 40 CFR 51.164 and 51.166(h), it must have definitions of such terms as ``stack'', ``dispersion technique'', and ``good engineering practice''. On November 6, 1985, the State submitted a letter stating that permits issued for new or modified sources will conform with the requirements with the Stack Height Regulation, as set forth in the Federal Register on July 8, 1985, until such time that the State promulgates its own rule. As submitted, this provision meets the stack height requirements of the PSD program, and USEPA approved Wisconsin's commitment on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32074), as a portion of Wisconsin's stack height plan. C. Federally Issued PSD Permits In the State's definition of ``major modifications'', NR 405.02(21)(b)(6), the rule exempts an increase in hours of operation or in production rates from review unless such increases are prohibited by permits issued after January 6, 1975, under NR 405. This rule is deficient for not requiring review of sources with such increases if the increases were prohibited by previously issued Federal permits or during the period when EPA issued the permits prior to the delegation of the program's authority. The State rule only exempts from the exclusion those permits with conditions ``pursuant to this chapter'', which is in the Wisconsin rule. There is no requirement for review of modifications to federally issued permits with exemptions pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21. As submitted, this provision is not approvable as a PSD rule. D. Source-Specific Allowable Emissions NR 405.02(1) contains the term ``source-specific allowable emissions''. The meaning of the term is unclear. The Federal rule depends upon the preamble language published in the Federal Register on August 7, 1980 (Vol. 45, No. 154), to qualify the term to exclude cases where data on actual emissions are available. The language in NR 405.02(1) would have to be clarified so that the State term has the same meaning as the Federal term. This provision is not approvable in its present form. E. PSD Increments The State PSD increments for sulfur dioxide and particulate matter are found in Chapter NR 404.05. The increments were not included in Wisconsin's March 16, 1987 PSD SIP submittal, but were included in its November 24, 1992 submittal. F. Modeling Guidelines The modeling guidelines referenced in NR 405.10 are now outmoded, although they were current at the time of submittal. To make NR 405.10 approvable, it would either have to reference the most recent guidelines (See 40 CFR 165(l)) or state that the applicant must use USEPA's most current applicable guideline models. Although the modeling guidelines were current at the time of submittal, this deficiency would need to be addressed if Wisconsin were to resubmit the rule as a SIP revision. G.
