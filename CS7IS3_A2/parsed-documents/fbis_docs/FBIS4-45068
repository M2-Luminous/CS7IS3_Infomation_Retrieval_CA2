But the Iraqi regime has continued its hostile policy in violation of the provisions of the above-mentioned UN resolution even after it was issued. We refer, in particular, to the regime's imposition of the economic blockade on the liberated area of Kurdistan, which currently includes the governorates of Irbil, Dahuk, al-Sulaymaniyah, as well as part of Kirkuk, and its continued implementation of the policy of forced relocation and Arabization [of Kurds] in the Kirkuk and Khanaqin areas and the Kurdish areas in al-Mawsil, which are presently under the control of the Baghdad government. The regime is also continuing to arrest Kurdish citizens in these areas and to execute many of them without trials. In addition to all this, the regime is continuing to follow a policy of genocide against the people of southern Iraq, is draining their marshes, and is mounting constant military campaigns against the inhabitants and using chemical weapons against them. All of the UN Security Council resolutions dealing with Iraq, including Resolution 688, were issued because of the regime's aggressiveness and violation of the precepts of international law, as well as human rights in Iraq. There are lots of measures that the international community could take against the Iraqi regime in order to ensure compliance with the above-mentioned resolution, and they include the following: 1) Lifting the international economic blockade against Iraqi Kurdistan. In order to justify keeping the international economic blockade against the liberated areas of Iraqi Kurdistan, some people quote the fact that these areas are part of Iraqi territory and that one should not lift the blockade against them as long as a blockade was imposed against Iraq in its entirety. This pretext is nothing more than a pure formality, resembling the pretext for non-intervention in the internal affairs of sovereign nations, even if human rights are violated. Fortunately for persecuted peoples, this pretext ended with the end of the Cold War and violations of human rights are now considered grounds that permit intervention under any circumstances and conditions. The issuing of any law or piece of legislation, whether domestic or international, takes place because of particular reasons, which are usually called "compelling reasons for legislation." As we know, the compelling reasons for the Security Council's issuing its resolution dealing with the imposition of the economic blockade against Iraq were to punish the Iraqi regime and to force it to comply with other resolutions that the Security Council had issued. The inclusion of the liberated areas of Kurdistan in the resolution imposing the blockade against Iraq is a tremendous injustice against the Kurdish people. The reason for this is that the Kurdish people have never been part of this regime, but rather they have always been among their fundamental victims. Even with regard to the second war in the Gulf, which brought on the imposition of the blockade against Iraq, it is a fact that the Kurdish people participated in it only incidentally. This is because most of the Kurdish soldiers gradually left the ranks of the Iraqi armed forces after Iraqi forces entered Kuwait. During the attack against the Iraqi forces on the night of 17 January 1991, most of the Kurdish soldiers had already left the ranks of the army. As we know, it is not right to punish a person or a party for a deed that that person or party has neither committed nor participated in committing, especially if the person or party is one of the foremost victims of the perpetrator--which, in this case, is the Iraqi regime. The Iraqi regime that began its invasion of Kuwait at the beginning of August 1990 had already begun its aggression against the Kurdish people starting in the latter part of March 1975 by destroying its cities and villages and waging genocide against them. The result of this policy by the regime was the destruction of more than 4,500 Kurdish villages and dozens of their principle towns, the killing of more than 100,000 Kurds in the notorious looting operations, chemical attacks on Kurdish cities and towns, and the forced relocation of tens of thousands of Kurdish families to southern Iraq where they were forced to live in compulsory "collectives." The imposition of the international economic blockade on Kurdistan has led to punishing the victim instead of the criminal who has gotten off scot-free, except from the blockade--the effects of which are being suffered only by the Iraqi people in general, and the Kurdish people in particular because they are not included in the scope of government supply operations. One of the strange ironies is the fact that the Iraqi regime does not consider the liberated area of Kurdistan to be part of Iraq and treats it as if it were a hostile country. For this reason, the regime has proceeded to impose still another economic blockade on this area and is preventing food supplies, fuel, and fuel supplies from reaching Kurdistan. Recently it agreed to sell fuel and fuel supplies to the government of the territory of Kurdistan through the international aid organizations, which undertook to pay the Iraqi Government for these materials in U.S. dollars at official prices. The Iraqi Government took another despotic measure against the territory of Kurdistan when it made the decision to cancel the 25-dinar denomination of Iraqi currency in May of 1993 and then prevented people from Kurdistan from going to Baghdad to exchange the 25-dinar bills that they had in their possession. This hurt people very badly and inflicted great damage on Kurdistan's economy--to the tune of hundreds of millions of Iraqi dinars. The Iraqi regime once again proved that it does not consider the people of Kurdistan to be Iraqi citizens, but rather as hostile foreigners. A Kurdish citizen feels this look of hostility when he is forced to cross the government "control points" where he is subjected to harsh treatment that is experienced only by foreigners who are from a hostile nation. There is absolutely no justification for the world community's insistence on maintaining the international economic blockade against Kurdistan on the pretext that it is part of Iraq. This is why we see numerous international circles and parliamentary figures and bodies in many countries demanding that the world community lift this blockade against Kurdistan, particularly since the creation of a safe zone in Kurdistan for the purpose of protecting it from the aggression of the Iraqi regime has given an international dimension to Resolution 688 in order to grant it international protection. 2) Compelling the Iraqi regime to lift the state of siege that it has imposed on Kurdistan. The imposition of the economic blockade against Kurdistan by the Iraqi regime was a despotic decision that is in violation of Security Council Resolution 688 both in letter and in spirit. The regime's aim in imposing this blockade is to starve the people of Kurdistan and to drive them away from their homeland again. The [Security Council] resolution was supposed to prevent this. Ever since the Iraqi regime imposed the blockade against Kurdistan in early September of 1991, we were expecting the international organization to take the initiative to warn the Iraqi regime and tell it to lift the blockade, particularly since the leaders in Kurdistan demanded that this organization intervene with the Iraqi authorities in order to get the blockade lifted, especially with regard to fuel and fuel supplies. The Iraqi regime's decision to prevent fuel and fuel supplies from reaching Kurdistan has led to skyrocketing prices for these materials. Before the blockade, gasoline used to cost 200 Iraqi fils per gallon, but now, after the imposition of the blockade against Kurdistan, a gallon of gasoline costs 60 dinars and sometimes even more. The Iraqi regime's continual prevention of fuel and fuel supplies from reaching Kurdistan has led to the cutting down of trees in the forests in order that the wood be used as fuel during the long and very cold winters, and this has resulted in damage to the environment there. Lifting the international and Iraqi blockades against Kurdistan would make it easier to rebuild the economic infrastructure that the regime previously destroyed, and would make it easier for people to go back to working in their fields, factories, and businesses and not be solely dependent on the humanitarian aid that international aid organizations are providing to them. 3) The return of the tens of thousands of Kurdish families, which were relocated by force, to their Kurdish areas which are under the control of the Iraqi regime. The rebellion of 1991, which took place in all parts of Kurdistan, resulted in the liberation of all of Kurdistan, including the areas of Kirkuk, Khanaqin, and the Kurdish areas in al-Mawsil. Then the Iraqi regime mounted a counterattack in which it used all types of heavy weapons and combat helicopters, and this enabled them to recover and reoccupy some of the Kurdish areas, particularly Kirkuk, Khanaqin, Shaykhan, Sinjar, and other areas. Ever since the regime reoccupied these Kurdish areas, the Kurds there have been subjected to very bad treatment. There are mass arrests and kidnappings, they are killed and their bodies are not even handed over to their relatives, and whole residential areas are destroyed and their inhabitants are driven away. The security forces in these Kurdish areas are also expelling the Kurds and forcing them to head for the liberated areas of Kurdistan after all their possessions have been taken away from them. Then Arab bedouins are brought in to occupy their houses and businesses. Intervention by international bodies to protect the Kurds in these Kurdish areas would be considered legitimate intervention within the framework of the concept of Resolution 688. The authorities have prevented these families, estimated to be in the tens of thousands, from returning to their homes in spite of the agreement that was signed by the Iraqi government and Kurdish leaders in May of 1991 and in which the regime committed itself to allowing all Kurds to return to their original places of residence. Among these Kurds, there are a lot of people who are afraid to return to their homes because they were soldiers who deserted or they took up arms against the regime during the March [1991] rebellion. All of these families--totalling more than three-quarters of a million Kurds who live in the liberated areas of Kurdistan--depend on the aid provided to them by the international aid organizations in order to survive. One of the basic aims of Resolution 688 is the return of all of these Kurdish families to the city of Kirkuk and the other Kurdish areas that are under the control of the Iraqi regime. For this reason, action should be taken to implement this humane demand before these people start slowly dying off. We should bear in mind that thousands of them have already died as a result of the spread of diseases and malnutrition, especially children and older people. But, if they return, this should be done under the permanent protection of international observers. This is something that the Iraqi regime has rejected so far, even though this measure is included in the concept of Resolution 688. 4) The holding of general elections in Iraq under international supervision. In practice, Resolution 688 dealing with guaranteeing human rights in Iraq can be carried out only by a government that represents all the people as a result of the holding of free elections in all parts of Iraq, but under international supervision. In this context, there should be a change in the current elections law, and the electoral districts in Iraq should be redistributed. The reason for this is that the current law was set up especially to have members of the ruling Ba'th Party become members of the National Council. For example, Paragraph 2 of Article 14 of Modified National Council Law No. 55 of 1980 stipulates that a candidate for the above-mentioned council "have completed military service or have been exempted from it and not have committed the crime of desertion or failure to show up for military service during the time period of Saddam's al-Qadisiyah [Iraq's war with Iran]." According to Iraqi law, this is considered to be a major crime punishable by execution in accordance with Law 137, which was issued on 13 December 1983. Paragraph 5 of the same article stipulates that a candidate must "not have been convicted of the crime of conspiracy against the revolution of 17-30 July 1968 or the ruling regime, or the crime of attempting to overthrow it, or the crime of being in contact with foreign groups." Paragraph 9 of this article makes another stipulation, previously referred to, concerning the necessity that the candidate believe "in the aims and principles of the glorious revolution of 17-30 July." These conditions naturally lead to keeping out all those who do not share the opinion of the ruling party concerning the war with Iran, "Saddam's al-Qadisiyah," and the second Gulf war with Kuwait. Furthermore, the above-mentioned law stipulates the agreement of the "higher body that supervises elections" to applications for candidacy, and this higher body includes leading members of the ruling Ba'th Party and some ministers and national leaders. The above-mentioned body determines the names of the candidates and has the right to omit from the list of candidates any candidate who, in their view, "does not believe in the aims and principles of the glorious revolution of 17-30 July." Any person whose name is removed from the list of candidates has the right to protest this within three days before the Revolutionary Command Council, whose decision will then be final. From all of the above, it appears that it is impossible for non-members of the ruling Ba'th Party and persons who do not support its policies to become candidates for membership in the current National Council. For this reason, National Council Elections Law No. 55 of 1980 should be completely changed. Furthermore, the electoral districts should be redistributed and there should be a return to the Chamber of Deputies elections law which was in effect before 1958, or else a new law should be legislated.
