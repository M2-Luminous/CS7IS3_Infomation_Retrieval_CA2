One grenade was aimed at two vehicles belonging to the minister and his supporters and another at a minibus belonging to one of the minister's supporters. Talking to a Kampala Radio Uganda Network reporter by telephone from Mbale, Mr. Rwigyemera assured the people of Mbale and the entire country that government authorities in Mbale have zeroed on those reactionaries and security precautions have been maximally undertaken to ensure that such acts of thuggery do not occur again, and that elections are not disrupted at all. He disclosed that they are aware that the target area for the thugs are Mbale municipality, Bubulo east and west constituencies and Manjiya County. He said the cause of these is that the reactionaries have realized that they are in for a shock on Monday [28 March], contrary to the fallacy that Bugisu and eastern Uganda are their power base. He said that the thugs have also realized that the people can no longer be manipulated. The central government representative expressed condolence to the relatives of the young man who was killed in the attack. He also expressed sympathy to the relatives of those who were injured.
