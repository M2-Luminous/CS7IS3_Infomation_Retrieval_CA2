FBIS4-54360 "dreas103_a_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-103 Daily Report 27 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan 3-Year Period Between Tax Cuts, Rise Projected 3-Year Period Between Tax Cuts, Rise Projected OW2705072294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0653 GMT 27 May 94 OW2705072294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry is inclined to adopt income tax cuts three years before an offsetting consumption tax hike in line with a U.S. demand, a ministry report suggested Friday [27 May]. The report, submitted to the government's advisory panel, estimates net revenues in fiscal 2000, after the 6.2 trillion yen tax cuts are extended and the current 3 percent consumption tax is hiked to 7 percent to 10 percent from April 1997. This represents a three-year lag until a future tax raise from already implemented tax cuts, which include 5.5 trillion yen in income and resident taxes, that are limited to the current fiscal year. The ministry also called for net revenue increases beyond a consumption tax increase to 6 percent to cover the tax cuts, in order to fund heavier welfare burdens amid a graying society. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently said the United States would endorse Japan's plan to link tax cuts with offsetting indirect tax hikes if the two measures are separated by at least three years. The report will be a key reference for the tax commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister. It is scheduled to issue its proposals by the end of June, by which time Japan promised in its March market-open package to detail full-fledged tax reform. Based on the panel's proposals, the government and the ruling coalition parties are to decide on reform, but uncertainties remain amid the yet-fluid political situation for the coalition parties holding minority Diet seats. The ministry's report also poses various problems for the panel to use without further reviewing. The tax forum is to draft alternatives with concrete figures for presentation at regional hearings in early June. The estimates exclude possible effects from fiscal and administrative reform and expected "natural" tax revenue increases despite the panel's intent to factor them into its alternatives. Based on a 7 percent consumption tax, the report estimates a net tax revenue increase of 2 trillion yen in fiscal 2000. However, a revenue shortfall of 5.3 trillion yen results when 1.8 trillion yen in funds to repay "bridge" bonds and 5.5 trillion yen in increased welfare spending are included. The "bridge" bonds are debts to finance the advance tax cuts, and the ministry wants to clear them in 10 years. Welfare spending is based on a 21st century welfare vision issued in March by an advisory panel to the Health and Welfare Ministry. A plan proposed in February by then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would have replaced the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare" tax. The ministry sees a revenue surplus only with the 10 percent model, which would generate 700 billion yen. Although not included in the models, the report estimates a "natural" increase in tax revenues of 2.8 trillion yen to 3.0 trillion yen based on a revenue elasticity rate of 1.1 and a nominal economic growth rate of 5 percent. The ministry report noted that the government must secure funds for a planned increase in the amount of the 10-year, 430 trillion yen plan in public works spending started in fiscal 1991. Japan also pledged in its March package to decide on the boost by the end of June.
