Swart] [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- Hundreds of West Rand hostel residents would be transported to the East Rand to reinforce hostels "under attack" by the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], the National Hostel Residents Association [NHRA] said on Tuesday. NHRA spokesman Thulani Mlothshwa said: "Let the world know more militants will be deployed on the East Rand and they will be told to take no nonsense from the NPKF who, with township residents, attacked our hostel yesterday (Monday)." He was referring to a gunfight between NPKF and Thokoza hostel residents on Monday which resulted in the death of news photographer Ken Oostebroek. Mr Mlotshwa said the deployment of the NPKF had given a boost to the enemies of hostel residents. "They thought it would now be easier to attack the hostels. This was proved yesterday (Monday) when township residents came in large numbers, accompanied by NPKF members, to attack the Thokoza hostel. As a result the hostel inmates were forced to defend themselves." Hostel residents were protected by their own "military" and 500 reinforcements from West Rand hostels would be brought in to protect East Rand hostels from attack. "We would like to warn all those who are still prepared to attack the hostels that if they think they are militant, they will find us more militant," Mr Mlotshwa said.
