The Office of Trade and Industry Ombudsman urged government ministries to ease 21 irksome regulations listed in a report submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The report comes against the backdrop of mounting criticism that Japan's rigid regulations shut out foreign products. U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc. has complained about "an almost impossible driving license test" for motorcycles with an engine displacement over 400 cc. In a complaint filed with the office by the U.S. Embassy, Harley-Davidson said the system effectively blocks imports of foreign motorcycles, almost all of which have larger engines. Two years ago Japan's four major motorcycle makers appealed for eased regulations on large bikes and the rigid examination, but no change has been made. As requested by Harley-Davidson, the report also recommends the government review its ban on tandem riding on highways and change the highway speed limit for motorcycles to 100 kilometers per hour from 80 kilometers per hour in line with that for automobiles. The report also urges flexible enforcement of rules on issuing a model certificate by accepting widely acknowledged foreign inspection and safety standards. It also said the time required for obtaining import permission for cosmetics and perfume should be shortened from three to six months. Other rules cited in the report include: Regulations on foodstuff, health care and medical goods -- Standards on condensed grapefruit juice. -- The prevention system for plant epidemics. -- Inspection rules on dairy products. Regulations on industrial goods -- Standards on labeling for textile products. -- The licensing system for automatic nail driving machines run on internal gas combustion. -- Rules on electric wheelchairs. Regulations on transport -- Safety standards and inspection rules on automobiles and auto parts. -- Regulations on batteries used in electric cars. Regulations on construction -- Rules on fire-resistance tests. -- Standards on wallpaper.
