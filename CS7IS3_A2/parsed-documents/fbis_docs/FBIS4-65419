"The foreign ministers of Iran and Turkey meet from time to time to discuss the developments in Iraq," he said. He pointed out that there were still a number of PKK infiltrators to Turkey from the Iranian border, even though the two countries have an excellent cooperation. On the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline which has been closed since the Gulf War because of an international embargo, Demirel said, "Turkey is being treated unjustly. Its losses because of the ban is 3 billion to 5 billion U.S. dollars annually. Moreover, our pipeline is on the verge of rotting and needs to be filled and emptied several times." He stressed that Turkey opposed the division of Iraq and that Iran wanted the territorial integrity of Iraq to be maintained too.
