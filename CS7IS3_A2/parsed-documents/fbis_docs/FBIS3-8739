[Weiss] Of course, because these negotiations did not begin just last week. There will be another meeting of opposition representatives this afternoon, and a decision should be reached then about the most fundamental personnel questions. [Samel] Some time ago, a demand was made that party chairmen should not be included in this government. Can you tell us if they are going to be in the government? [Weiss] I am of the opinion that this demand should be respected. After all, we made it recently. [passage omitted] [Samel] The present opposition parties are presenting the new government as a good alternative at this time. However, there are voices casting doubts on the efficiency of such government in view of the fact that there would be too many parties participating with too diverse an orientation. Judging by the atmosphere at the talks, can you say that this government would not be problem and conflict ridden? [Weiss] This government is going to be interested in agreeing on basic policy priorities, on things that need to be solved first of all within a given time. Of course, it will be a government that is going to be aware of its responsibility to the Slovak Republic and its citizens. It will certainly not be an anti-Slovak government that some people are trying to suggest. It will simply be an alternative to that type of rule that we have just lived through. This government will invest in expertise, will resolutely press ahead with the transformation of the state economy, and will try to act competently. It will definitely tell people the truth about the state of the economy, even if it is bitter. The citizen does not need to be lied to because he can become optimistic only if such optimism is warranted and based on a true picture of the state of the national economy and its potential. We do not want a government that just keeps things going, but one that will create genuine conditions for the continuation of the transformation process after the early elections, and for businesslike solutions to a multitude of problems weighing down on people. Apart from economic and social problems, this government will make it its priority to deal with growing criminality. [Samel] What economic measures can be expected from the new government? [Weiss] The government wants to set off on a course of pursuing a realistic policy of macroeconomic transformation. As I have already said, the platform will be an analysis of the state of the economy, especially so that the government is able to send a clear signal to the public about the conditions under which it is taking over the economy, and what the reasons for this situation are. The government will undoubtedly cooperate with the banking and capital market to find an immediate solution to corporate insolvencies, including bankruptcies, reviving the flow of money, and developing the capital market. Work on amending the law on the state budget will definitely begin so as to put its revenue and expenditure on a more realistic basis. The government will strive to maintain external balance [as heard]. Through its economic policy, it wants to sustain the internal convertibility of the currency. Its political decisions will not interfere with currency stability. Above all, exchange rates will not be artificially sustained at the cost of increasing foreign indebtedness. Measures aimed at protecting the domestic market will be implemented in compliance with international agreements. Another important aspect of the government's work will be to depoliticize privatization in accordance with the adopted amendment to the law on big privatization. Special emphasis will be placed on the equality of [privatization] methods, on the equal standing of those who enter into privatization process, on transparency, and on exercising parliamentary and public control over privatization. The government will try to begin preparation of the second wave of coupon privatization, so that it might begin in the second half of 1994. It is natural that the government that takes over responsibility will be exposed to a huge number of risks, and the time it will have at its disposal will not be sufficient. But transformation must be continued, and, at the same time, the most pressing difficulties hampering people's lives must be pragmatically resolved. Wherever possible, the new government will try to compensate for the impact of certain economic measures on the population by introducing positive measures in other spheres--for example, in the social sphere or in reducing criminality. [Samel] The law on reducing the [parliamentary] term of the office is due to be adopted in the near future. But for this you will need the votes of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS]. Have there been any parallel talks with these deputies' groups? [Weiss] Yes, talks did take place. All of them want to call early elections. I hope that we will crack this problem on Wednesday [16 March, when the Slovak Parliament is due to resume its session]. It would a very good thing if the government had a clear mandate for its work. [Samel] Have you had any indications that some deputies from the HZDS and the SNS will be willing to vote for the elections to be held at the end of September or the beginning of October? [Weiss] There are, of course, some indications, but we should wait until this important hurdle is overcome.
