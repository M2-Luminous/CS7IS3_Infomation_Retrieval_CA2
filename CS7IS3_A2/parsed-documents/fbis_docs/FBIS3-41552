Many of us probably remember the furor that arose a few years ago over the alleged contamination by the factory of village water resources in the Porsea area, about 200 kilometers southwest of Medan, where the plant is located. The agitation died down after assurances by high-ranking officials that the plant had done what needed to be done to ensure a clean environment. The incident developed into the first environment-related court case in which charges were pressed, although without success, against an alleged offender by the public, represented in this case by the Indonesian Environmental Forum (Walhi). Complaints of environmental pollution and indiscriminate logging have since emerged off and on, although the company has disclaimed allegations that its felling of trees has caused a drop in the water level in Lake Toba, which feeds the Asahan, one of the major rivers of North Sumatra. Nobody, however, could have foreseen the vehemence of the massive protest that occurred on Saturday, 6 November, after what was reported to be an explosion at the plant set off panic among villagers living nearby. Newspaper reports quoted one of the PT Indorayon directors as saying the explosion involved one of the factory's three bleaching tanks, each of which contained several hundred kilograms of chlorine. As white smoke billowed from the damaged installation, fear of another Bhopal incident triggered panic in Porsea and thousands of villagers fled to safer areas at Siborong-borong Tarutung and Parapat. Later, into the night, hordes of enraged villagers forced their way past the outnumbered security guards into the compound, smashing everything in their path. The hysteria receded for a while, when factory officials agreed to speak with the villagers. But some time later, scores of the terrified villagers returned, demanding that the plant be closed for good as they set houses ablaze and vandalized the factory. Informal local community leaders had to be called in to restore calm and order at the site of the violence. In Jakarta, reports of the unrest motivated a member of the House of Representatives to urge the company to suspend operations until a thorough investigation could be conducted and proper safety measures taken. As the company's general manager for corporate affairs, Brett Hutton, later explained in Jakarta, the ferocity of the villagers' reaction was the result of ``wild rumors fanned by parties including the Medan press'' about the dangers of the gas leakage. ``The explosion concerned a very small pipe. It let out some gas but basically posed no danger to anyone. It was fixed very quickly,'' Hutton said. He also said the company had made a policy of fostering good relations with the community, ``as attested by the award it won last year for its efforts in this area.'' To judge by the constant public complaints about its operations, however, it is apparent that still more effort is needed. Our mention of the Indorayon case, of course, serves merely as an illustration of the importance of considering other than economic factors in any undertaking in which community acceptance can play such a decisive role. Surely, the recent Porsea incident can serve as an important lesson for not only Indorayon, but for any businessman about to invest his money in Indonesia.
