Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 1. Williams Natural Gas Co. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;181&hyph;000] Take notice that on January 13, 1994, Williams Natural Gas Company (Williams) P.O. Box 3288, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;181&hyph;000, an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon approximately 73.3 miles of 12-inch and 20-inch transmission pipeline located in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma and Barber, Harper, Sumner and Sedgwick Counties, Kansas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Williams proposes to abandon by reclaim approximately 8.8 miles of 12-inch pipeline and 61.2 miles of 20-inch pipeline and to abandon in place approximately 3.3 miles of 20-inch pipeline. Williams states that all deliveries made from the pipeline to be abandoned have been relocated to an adjacent 6-inch pipeline, therefore there would be no abandonment of service. Williams states further that the estimated cost of abandonment would be approximately $227,130 with an estimated salvage value of $525,000. Comment date: February 15, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. [Docket No. CP94&hyph;188&hyph;000] Take notice that on January 18, 1994, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company (Panhandle), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1642, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;188&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Sections 7 (b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of certain new facilities and the abandonment of certain other facilities in its Howell Storage Field, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Specifically, Panhandle proposes to construct and operate a new injection/withdrawal well and approximately 225 feet of 8-inch storage well flow line in its Howell Storage Field in Livingston County, Michigan. Panhandle states that part of the storage field lies directly under the City of Howell where there are no existing injection/withdrawal wells, which results in this portion of the storage field not being drained efficiently. The proposed well would enable Panhandle to more efficiently cycle the portion of the storage field under the City of Howell, it is stated. Panhandle further states that the proposed well would increase the working gas inventory by about 900,000 Mcf, with a corresponding decrease in the base gas inventory. Panhandle asserts that the new facilities would not increase the certificated maximum capacity of the field or the maximum peak day withdrawal rate. Panhandle further proposes to connect an existing well to the new storage well flow line and to abandon in place the 4-inch storage well flow line presently connecting the existing well to the storage field gathering system. Panhandle states that the proposed well would be drilled utilizing new horizontal drilling technology at a location 90 feet from the wellhead of an existing well. Panhandle asserts that because of the experimental nature of the new well, its drilling and completion are being done in cooperation with the Gas Research Institute (GRI). GRI has agreed to co-fund this project and will share the technical results with other GRI members. Panhandle estimates the cost of the project to be $1,104,200, which will be financed with general funds available to Panhandle. GRI would contribute $300,000 toward the cost of the project it is stated. Comment date: February 15, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.
