He believes that NATO is attempting to somehow broaden its activities and bring them closer to Russia's borders. Those who think that this may help develop relations and establish calm are wrong. On the contrary, the seeds of feud and suspicion have already been sown, believes Gorbachev. He said that first the issue on membership in NATO by more countries would be raised in the near future. But seeing Russia's negative approach to the prospect, the North Atlantic Alliance has invented the initiative "Partnership for Peace". It was obvious that NATO had not given up the idea of expanding the bloc, he said. Gorbachev said that the United States suspected Russia of threatening its neighbors. "This is an insult for Russians," said the ex-president. He said that if NATO really wanted to tackle European problems, the bloc's structure should have representations of all countries on the continent. Gorbachev believes that the Russian president's and the government's positive response to the adoption of the partnership concept at the recent NATO summit in Brussels indicates that Moscow's foreign and domestic policies lacked consistency. Speaking about the problem of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the ex- president disagreed with the idea that Ukrainians lacked a grasp of reality. "They understand everything well," he said, "and will certainly comply with the provisions of the START-I treaty." They are bargaining to make up for the expenditures in terms of the nuclear arms scrapping, said Gorbachev. He believes that in the nuclear bargain everyone benefits, the Americans most of all. Their president has shown that he can add pressure on Ukraine, after which Ukraine signed the treaty. The Americans do not miss such chances. Gorbachev said that Russia will never agree to play the role of a "younger brother." "Russia," he said, "is a great power and will remain such. One must do business with it on equal terms, even though today we have temporary difficulties," he said. Gorbachev voiced satisfaction with the fact that during his visit to Russia Bill Clinton spoke about the U.S. attitude to Russia as an equal partner and that he recognizes its role. "Thank God, this is so. Earlier I did not feel such a categorical position on the part of our American partners," said Gorbachev.
