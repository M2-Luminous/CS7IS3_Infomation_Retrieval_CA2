He told a news conference today about the results of the visit to the Crimean Peninsula by an official Nagorno Karabakh delegation. A communique on the results of the meeting has been signed between the Nagorno Karabakh republic and the Crimean republic, as well as an agreement on trade and economic and cultural cooperation. It is envisaged that there will be an exchange of representative offices and that privileges will be granted on transit freight and other things. On the political level, the sides came to agreement on coordinating actions, and also on possible joint steps in respect of a political settlement of the problems facing the two republics. Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov may make a visit to Nagorno Karabakh in return. Evaluating the current situation in Crimea, Robert Kocharyan commented that this was an attempt by the Ukrainian leadership to oppose any deepening of Crimean sovereignty. Karabakh has already passed this stage, and in Robert Kocharyan's view, this will have a consequence for Crimea and will only strengthen its sovereignty.
