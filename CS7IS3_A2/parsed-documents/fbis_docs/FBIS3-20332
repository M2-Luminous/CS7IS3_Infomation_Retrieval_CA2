In retrospect, Stihl also favors the employers' spectacular cancellation of the metal industry's vacation compact. "It was necessary for the employers to give this unequivocal signal to emphasize the seriousness of the situation. Such a sledgehammer approach is sometimes needed when dealing with trade unions to help them understand economic realities." Stihl said that this time the metal industry had been able to avoid disproportional increases for low-wage groups, which in the past had contributed to a steadily rising unemployment base. In the course of such mistaken wage policy, wage groups I and II had been abolished. Thus, an important potential source of employment was voluntarily eliminated. It would help facilitate reincoporation of the unemployed if these two wage groups were resurrected. It is unfortunate that the Industrial Trade Union of Metal Workers resisted an increase in the 13/18 percent ratio of employers with a 40-hour workweek. An increase in this ratio is necessary to strengthen research and development in the German metal industry. "It is still true that in Japan research and development engineers and other highly qualified employees work up to 600 more hours a year than in Germany. In the long run, we cannot afford such a disparity." The current differentiation in the workweek in the metal and electrical industry could be regarded as adequate, especially since many companies have not taken full advantage of all the options offered by the wage agreements. "And for that I would criticize the corporations; they demand greater flexibility without taking full advantage of existing rules." Opening Wage Negotiations to Corporations Is Not Rescindable The Hannover secure employment agreement, which opens the way for plants to negotiate wages, is limited to two years. There will now be many deviations from collective bargaining agreements. Stihl thinks that it will be impossible to rescind such variations after two years to return to an industry-wide wage agreement. "The opening for the plants must and will continue to exist; the traditional industry-wide wage agreement cannot be maintained since it no longer meets the needs of a widely varied industrial structure." However, Stihl opposes wage agreements differentiated by metal branches. After all, industrial branches can develop wage policies tailored to their needs since the plants now have that opportunity. In the course of time, the in-plant agreements will show certain patterns for each industrial branch since there will be an internal exchange of information within each branch. That should be enough. The overall metal-industry association should not become the manager of the varied collective wage arrangements of the different branches of the metal industry. "Because then, it would become necessary for the overall metal-industry association to subdivide into numerous branch associations. It is an advantage that we only have a few associations in Germany which negotiate with the trade unions independently. Thus, the authority to negotiate is consolidated in the metal industry's overall association. But to allow as many associations as possible to consolidate, the collective wage agreements should only contain minimum provisions." If the economic climate improves again, the works councils will try to rescind the wage sacrifices to which they have now agreed. This will create many conflicts within plants, and the Works Council Statute has not provided the machinery to resolve such conflicts. The president of the German Industrial and Trade Association is convinced that the metal industry's Hannover wage agreement will create a precedent for the public service sector. "The signals emanating from the collective bargaining agreements of the Industrial Trade Union of Metalworkers--the largest industrial trade union in Europe and even the world--have always determined subsequent agreements with other trade unions. Actually, the agreement with the Public Services, Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union should fall significantly short of that of the metal industry." Stihl called on German industry to pay more attention to college and university graduates. His firm is currently conducting an 18-month training program for such graduates with reduced pay in which they can gain work experience and augment their expertise. Stihl commented on the dispute about nursing-care insurance, which industry considers to be badly conceived. If it fails, there is a chance that it could be reinstituted under private law, which is the only approach industry approves. "The political contortions that an amazed public has been exposed to hurts the reputation of all parties." That a team of experts is now supposed to find a mode of compensation, "is simply another harebrained idea in a long series of strange ideas that have been advanced on this subject." Commenting on the economic programs that the political parties have now evolved, Stihl said they all seemed acceptable at first glance. For instance, if the German Social Democratic Party [SPD] calls for greater fiscal economy or for relief for industry, one can support the idea. However, when it comes to financing, it becomes apparent that the SPD wants to resurrect preoccupation with envy. It talks about "unwarranted income," and wants higher taxes on the income of top management. Politics Cannot Produce Jobs This is not the way to finance the government, just as politicians cannot solve the unemployment problem with work programs. "There is only one primary labor market and all political attempts to stimulate employment by artificial means are bound to fail." Instead of becoming entangled in employment policies, the government should cut expenses. "There is no reason why Germany needs to pay for 16 land governments, 16 landtags, 16 land administrations and more than 600 Bundestag representatives. Consolidation is just as urgently needed here as in industry. However, contrary to political institutions, industry attacks its problem with great zest." Stihl criticized the "remarkable lack of scruples," the United States demonstrated to create the tools to apply pressure on Japan's trade policies. It is, of course, correct as always maintained that the type of surplus Japan achieves in trading with North America can only be explained by the fact that Japanese markets are not so open as is always claimed. Distribution channels in Japan are firmly in the hands of large conglomerates which can control the success or--more often--the failure of an importer. Thus, one does have a right to demand that Japan become more open. But according to Stihl such demands for openness should apply to the whole Western world and not just bilaterally to the United States. German industry welcomes the expansion of the European Union with the addition of the nordic states and of Austria. These states are aware of the need for stability and favor free trade. However, this expansion creates a need for reform within the European Community. Sixteen countries can no longer be subjected to Brussels' penchant for regulations but must be treated in accordance with the principle that only those acts are legitimate that member states cannot perform for themselves.
