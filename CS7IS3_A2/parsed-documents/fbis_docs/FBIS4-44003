According to the Defense and Finance Ministries, the stocks of wheeled vehicles considerably exceeds previous estimates. Nonetheless, they say that the arms were scrapped, given away, or disposed of faster than planned. According to the report, the Bundeswehr has been largely relieved of the task of stockpiling the military materiel. This work is carried out by two companies running approximately 60 depots. Roughly 850 armored combat vehicles and artillery guns have been given away to NATO partners, other countries, or the United Nations. The report does not list the countries concerned; however, it is known that Turkey is one of the largest buyers of former NVA weapons. More than 69,000 wheeled vehicles of the former NVA, above all cars and trucks, have been made use of, but the report does not say whether the vehicles were scrapped or supplied to other countries. However, a major number of vehicles are no longer technically usable and must therefore be scrapped. The people running the depots have counted more than 110,000 vehicles. Of the huge ammunition mountain, 100,000 tonnes have been destroyed, and approximately 60,000 tonnes were given to other countries. Approximately 111,000 tonnes are still in the depots. Approximately 3,000 tonnes can be destroyed every month. In addition, so far, a total of 956 combat tanks, 2,074 armored combat vehicles, 814 artillery guns, and 140 fighter aircraft have been destroyed. Under the arms control law, an equal number of tanks and combat vehicles as well as 290 artillery guns will yet have to be removed.
