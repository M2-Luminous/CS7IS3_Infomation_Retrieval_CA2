FR941021-2-00138 FR941021-2-00089 The multiplier for each security in the Banking Industry Portfolio will generally remain unchanged except for limited adjustments that may be necessary as a result of stock splits or stock dividends. 14 There will be no adjustments to the multipliers to reflect cash dividends paid with respect to a portfolio security. In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect. 14 Lehman Brothers will adjust the multiplier of any portfolio security if the security is subject to a stock split or reverse split to equal the product of the number of shares issued with respect to one share of the portfolio security and the prior multiplier. In the case of a stock dividend, the multiplier will be adjusted so that the new multiplier will equal the former multiplier plus the product of the number of shares of such portfolio security issued with respect to one share of the portfolio security and the prior multiplier. If the issuer of a security included in the Banking Industry Portfolio no longer exists, whether for reason of a merger, acquisition or similar type of corporate control transaction, then Lehman Brothers will assign to that security a value equal to the security's final value for the purposes of calculating portfolio values. For example, if a company included in the portfolio is acquired by another company, Lehman Brothers shall thereafter assign a value to the shares of the acquired company's securities equal to the value per share at the time that the acquisition takes place. If the issuer of a Banking Industry Portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, insolvency, or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the Banking Industry Portfolio so long as a market price on an exchange or through Nasdaq for such security is available. If such a market price is no longer available for a portfolio security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar proceeding, then the value of the portfolio security will be assigned a value of zero in connection with calculating the daily portfolio value and the closing portfolio value of the Banking Industry Portfolio, for so long as no such market price exists for that security. 15 15 Lehman Brothers will not attempt to find a replacement stock or to compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy or a similar event. The value of the Banking Industry Portfolio will be calculated continuously by the Amex and will be disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape Association's Network B. The portfolio value will equal the sum of the products of the most recently available market prices and the applicable multipliers for the portfolio securities.
