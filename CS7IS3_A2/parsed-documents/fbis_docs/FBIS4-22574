The businessmen's initiatives may create a favorable climate for normalizing Russian-Latvian political relations. One gets the feeling after every meeting of Russia's entrepreneurs with their colleagues from the republics of the former USSR that the system of interstate relations created is not focused on developing entrepreneurial activity among countries. Yesterday's event organized by the efforts of the chambers of commerce and industry of Russia and Latvia was no exception either. Nonetheless, the meeting fulfilled its priority task, which, judging from the heightened interest shown toward the event by the Russian government, was expanding unofficial channels of economic cooperation. At this time the main obstacle in the way of expanding trade-economic cooperation between Russia and Latvia is the lack not only of a free trade system (Russia has concluded such agreements with all the CIS countries), but also of most favored nation status. As a result, double export-import customs duties are imposed on goods crossing the border. Conditions of Latvian export became especially difficult after the Russian government authorized new import customs tariff rates. But Latvia instituted favored nation status for Russia unilaterally. In the opinion of both Russian and Latvian businessmen, at this time cooperation in the financial sphere is most promising. Russian bankers believe that Latvia is the only country on the territory of the former USSR where the economy drives politics. In Latvia favorable conditions have been created to conduct banking transactions. This is confirmed by the fact that with a population of less than 3 million people on the republic's territory, more than 250 commercial banks are in operation and the confidentiality of deposits and free transfer of capital abroad are ensured. Starting in 1994, foreign banks are allowed to open branches in Latvia; they must register at the Bank of Latvia to do this. On the whole, there are no legislative restrictions on transactions of nonresidents in Latvia's financial sphere. In the opinion of Russian financial experts, as a result of a liberal currency policy, Latvia is acquiring the pronounced features of a financial "offshore" zone, which makes its commercial banks attractive for placing hard currency deposits and carrying out transfers of hard currency to third countries. Russian-Latvian trade relations are based on importing raw materials from Russia, above all for them to be re-exported later, and exporting to Russia finished output which is produced on the basis of Russian components. The formation of this trade structure is the result of the constantly rising rate of the lat in relation to the dollar, which even with high customs duties makes re-export more profitable as compared to the export of Latvian goods. It is very likely that this is precisely what keeps the Russian authorities from establishing liberal trade conditions with Latvia. But businessmen believe all the same that the economic relations of the two countries can be moved ahead. That is feasible in the area of joint operation of oil and gas industry installations which are on Latvia's territory. The development of cooperation in this area will not only provide direct financial benefits to the two countries, but will also make a contribution to solving the pressing problem of creating new jobs for the Russian-speaking population.
