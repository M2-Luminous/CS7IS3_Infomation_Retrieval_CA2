Foreign currency reserves have been increased, the gold reserves are not being used. The Federal Government has adopted a decision to mint a gold coin. It has also issued a statement regarding the latest events in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which warns, among other things, the United Nations and the Security Council that the Muslim-Croatian forces are stepping up their attacks. Mirjana Protic reports: [Protic] Immediately after the session of the Federal Government, Prime Minister Radivoje Kontic held a news conference in the Palace of the Federation at which he expressed the most important details regarding the work of the government in the past week. At a joint session of the Federal Government, the heads of the republican governments, and the governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia [Dragoslav Avramovic], the participants discussed the realization of the program of economic and monetary stabilization and the economic recovery of the country. Within its constitutional powers, the Federal Government also discussed the realization of the economic policy for this year. Prime Minister Kontic conveyed the Federal Government's assessment of how the program is being realized. [Begin Kontic recording] In the realization of the economic policy this year, positive trends have been noted in all sectors, in almost all sectors of production. In brief, what is this reflected in? First of all the stability the dinar has been preserved. This is best reflected through the retained parity of one to one [not further specified], even though we had in the meantime several attacks, several attempts to destabilize the dinar. However, we responded successfully to all these attacks. I would say that the stability of prices has been maintained, with some occasional fluctuations. So, for instance, when I was here last time, I think I expressed dissatisfaction with the way prices were increasing in the agricultural sectors. In the third week of June, prices went up by as much as 2 percent. Explaining this increase, I said at the same time that next week, considering the causes of the price increase, prices of agricultural products would fall. I can say with great pleasure that last week, in comparison with the previous week, there was a general fall in prices amounting to 1.9 percent. [end recording] [Protic] Prime Minister Kontic then stressed that the foreign reserves of the National Bank of Yugoslavia have been increased, and that gold reserves are intact. Positive trends have been recorded in the rate of increase of production. Prime Minister Kontic also spoke to the journalists about the situation in the Nonaligned Movement. The direct motive for that was the behavior by certain countries and the failure to invite the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to take part in the recent conference in Cairo. The Federal Government has concluded that the Non-Aligned Movement has not managed to adapt itself to the new conditions in the world. Room has been left for some Islamic countries to exert their influence. Prime Minister Kontic said that there are some exceptions. However, the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as an equal members has been denied. The official document on Bosnia-Herzegovina reflects the aggressive policy of the Muslim countries, as well as (?incorrect) picture of the events in this region. The Federal Government has concluded that Yugoslavia should retain its membership in the movement as the withdrawal from the Nonaligned Movement would be a concession to some Islamic countries that are demanding it. The Federal Government has also adopted a special statement on the latest events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The international community, the United Nations, and the European Union have been warned about the general deterioration of the situation, primarily because of the attacks by the Muslim forces. The FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Government expects the Security Council to take all the necessary measures so that the peace chance is not missed. Otherwise, there could be unforeseeable consequences and the war could escalate. Journalists were informed that the Federal Government has adopted a decision on minting a gold coin to mark the 110th anniversary of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. These gold coins will be used to purchase agricultural products, above all, wheat. The National Bank of Yugoslavia will set the price of the gold coins. On one side, the coin portrays a dove of peace and an olive branch, while the other has the coat of arms of the FRY and the old building of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. Replying to journalists' questions, Prime Minister Kontic said that a sufficient amount of money would be secured to purchase wheat. The Federal Government also adopted a decision to adjust the salaries in state organs, the public sector, and all noneconomic activities to the salaries in the industry that are linked to the rise in production.
