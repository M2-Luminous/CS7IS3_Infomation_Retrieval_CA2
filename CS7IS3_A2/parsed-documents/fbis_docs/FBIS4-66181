No Stability and No Prosperity But For the PLA"] [Text] On lunar New Year's eve, Wang Dengming, a soldier stationed in Xinjiang, sustained severe injuries while valiantly trying to control a scared horse in the county seat of Bachu County. Gulishahan, a woman teacher of Uygur nationality in the county nationalities middle school, flagged down a vehicle to take him to the hospital where she removed her watch and gold ring as collateral for the hospital admittance fee and gave Young Wang a 300 ml blood transfusion. According to a briefing from the Xinjiang Military Region Mass Work Department, moving deeds in support of the army like Gulishanhan's are too numerous to cite among the minority nationality masses in Xinjiang. "Without the PLA, Xinjiang would not be stable or prosperous." All nationalities in Xinjiang personally feel the importance and role of the people's army. Enthusiasm for loving the country and supporting the armed forces is at an all-time high. A large number of minority nationality peasants and herdsmen, who became rich first in recent years, have used various means to express their feelings of gratitude to kindred soldiers. Yakufu, a Uygur individual entrepreneur in Urumqi City whom the army helped escape from poverty to become wealthy, enthusiastically provided the army with premium quality service when the first "support-the-army" restaurant opened in the autonomous region's capital. Thanks to his instigation, "support-the-army travel agencies," "support-the-army shops," and "support-the-army" bus stations spread very quickly throughout the urban area, becoming a major feature of the frontier city's "twin supports." Ten years ago, Uygur nationality peasant Kawuzi had been rescued by officers and men of the garrison army in Pishan County when struggling with outlaws. Afterward, he used pear, peach, apple, and grape nursery stock that he himself had cultivated to build an orchard for their unit, and he looked after it for them. During the past several years, a "support-the-army service team" voluntarily organized by minority nationality people has been active in cities and towns and farming and pastoral areas north and south of the Tian Shan, enthusiastically eliminating worries and solving difficulties for the garrison forces. At New Year's time in 1994, when garrison forces in Kuqa, Usu, and Turpan conducted winter bivouac training, wherever they went, they were warmly received by the masses of all nationalities. In the Xinjiang Military Region, guard duty is grueling and stremuous. Realizing that border patrols travel great distances, and that the terrain is steep and the climate ugly, the local minority peoples have set up "troop quartering places" in their yurts where they accept free of charge officers and men who trek long distances on patrol. At border defense stations like Hongshanzui, which is a "lonely island in a snowy sea," and Hongqilafu, which is a "forbidden zone for life" after heavy snows block the mountains each year, the local minority peoples use horse-drawn sledges to deliver newspapers, magazines, and mail to officers and men, and to pick up and send officers and men up and down the mountains. Many herdsmen deliver to sentry posts vegetables, grain and meat that they have stored in their own homes.
