[Irmer] Of course, the rightist danger in Russia cannot be combated with an entry ban for Germany. This problem must be tackled in Russia itself. But the decision made by Foreign Minister Kinkel is correct, because Zhirinovskiy obviously intends to make trouble in our country, too. [Wuchold] Is Zhirinovskiy a danger to Germany's internal security? [Irmer] He could be a danger. He says, for instance, that Poland must be divided and that Germany and Russia must have a common border. This is contrary to our constitution and completely in violation of international law. Such a dangerous braggart must not agitate in our country. [Wuchold] What can the West do to combat nationalism in Russia? [Irmer] We must give the Russians the feeling that our involvement in East Europe is certainly not aimed against them, by means of security pacts, for instance. We must also considerably strengthen economic cooperation. [Wuchold] The Russian Government says that the planned expansion of NATO and the European Union to the East would benefit the nationalists in that country. [Irmer] The Russian nationalists are trying to exploit the expansion of NATO and the European Union for propaganda means. However, for Russia's stability itself it is indispensable that the states between Russia and Germany become stable democracies. Russia is not to be isolated but to be integrated in a system of collective security.
