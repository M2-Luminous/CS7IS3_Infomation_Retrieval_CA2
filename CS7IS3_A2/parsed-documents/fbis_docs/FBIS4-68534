Millions of people are living in an epidemic and humiliating state of poverty after being robbed so ruthlessly by the "radical reformers" for the sake of yet another "bright future." Science is dying, and centuries-old spiritual traditions are being stifled by the pressure of the vulgar mass culture. The Russian people, who spent a thousand years building the greatest state in the world, have been separated by absurd boundaries and have regressed 400 years in their geopolitical development. The democratic values that are essential to healthy and civilized development in today's world have been distorted and deliberately discredited in the public mind. Industry is being ruined, and the unique Russian national economic complex, which was built by the heroic labor of several generations, is deteriorating. The society is on the verge of a social eruption. These are the pitiful results of the irresponsible and undemocratic policy line the ruling regime was pursuing when it managed to ruin one of the wealthiest countries and destroy its powerful state in just two years. "Our life has become unbelievably morbid, senseless, and false, all order has disappeared, there is no consistency in our development, and all of our mental, emotional, and moral discipline has grown weak. An immense set of lies, permeating all of our relationships, has accumulated in our society and has contaminated the very air that we breathe, the surroundings in which we move and act, the ideas directing our actions, and the words with which we express our thoughts. In the midst of all these lies, what can we expect but a puny existence and puny acts? Our very ideas about life and its purpose are false, our relationships are confused, and our life is devoid of the consistency that is necessary for peaceful development and normal activity." These are the words of one of the most prominent conservative Russian thinkers of the 19th century, Chief Procurator of the Holy Synod Konstantin Petrovich Pobedonostsev. Although he said these words just before the terrible revolutionary outburst many decades ago, they are just as relevant today, which forces us to realize that the ulcers of hypocrisy, cynical deception, and malicious lies, the infinite egotism, greed, and thirst for power that are tormenting us have reached such a frightening point of crisis that the ominous question--"Is Russia to be or not to be?"--has become a terrifying reality of our daily social, governmental, and political life! Between `Those' and `These' In the last few years, for several reasons, primarily my position as chairman of the Constitutional Court, I had the broadest opportunities to observe the development of events up close--or "from within," so to speak--because I received detailed reports on the state of the country and the processes occurring in the upper echelons of government. Because I was fully aware of the dangerous tendencies that were becoming more and more distinct on the Russian political stage with the passage of time, I tried--to the best of my ability--to keep our ship of state far from the whirlpools of the political adventurism that was threatening (and is still threatening) Russia with the chaos of turmoil and deterioration, the tragedy of governmental collapse, and the horrors of fratricide. Whenever I could, I refrained from intervening in political arguments and the struggle for power by Moscow "court" groups and clans. No conscientious critic could accuse me of any affiliation with "those" or "these": I was equally repelled by the greedy corruption of the most odious members of the president's team and by the obsessive and maniacal efforts of some of the "people's representatives" to conquer Russia's political Olympus at any cost. No one wanted to call attention to the constantly growing wave of irreconcilable differences between the "branches" of government. The results are well-known: The massacre in the center of Moscow, which cost the lives of hundreds of people--a crime that was monstrously cynical and senseless, because it is absolutely clear today that this did not solve a single one of Russia's acute problems. On the contrary, the tight bloody knot of fatal confrontations in "Black October" compounded the already critical state of the country. God knows that I did everything within my power to prevent the conflict and reconcile the opposing sides. This is probably why I was not trusted completely by either side, which was manifested in a particularly malicious and distinct manner when the "victors" decided in the hour of their triumph to get even with the "inconvenient" witness to their unprincipled and unethical actions. Nevertheless, I did not betray my own convictions. I am still categorically opposed to political extremism in any form, regardless of its origin, regardless of the demagogic clothing it wears as a disguise, and regardless of the high ideals and noble goals it uses to conceal its own contempt for the law and the standards of common human decency. I still believe that unless we restrain the opportunists and political plotters who are willing to involve the public in fratricidal conflicts for the sake of their own excessive ambition, until we curb the excesses of arbitrary behavior within the strong confines of legality and legal stability, we will not move a single step forward in the revitalization of our long-suffering Motherland. I still believe that national reconciliation and civic accord are not topics for populist speculation, but absolutely essential conditions for Russia's survival. Nevertheless, I do have some regrets, something to repent, and some serious lessons to learn. Sometimes I was too naive and indecisive, too trusting and too inclined to agree to compromises that had not been subjected to sufficient analysis and consideration. The burden of power is a heavy load to carry, and I frankly admit that, looking back, I cannot say that I was completely prepared to do this. Sometimes I overestimated my own ability to influence events, and sometimes I underestimated the danger of the situation and the growing strength of destructive processes in the country. I never, however, lost my conviction that we have a single motherland, that gambling with its future for the sake of personal advantage is criminal and base, that we are one people, one family with a common history and future, and that no one but us can revive Great Russia. Today I feel sick and ashamed when I see what we have done to the country and to each other. It is immoral and impermissible to remain silent, hiding behind the official pretext of "nonintervention in political affairs," when you are watching your country die under the strain of hatred, enmity, political intrigues, and cynicism. The Big Lie of Our Era Pablo Picasso once made the following remark in an attempt to underscore the value of art and his ability to create "autonomous" worlds, parallels to the real world: "I draw what I see with my mind, and not with my eyes." Today it appears that some politicians want to use this artistic method of creating "parallel realities" within the framework of social technology to turn our sick society into a "zombie." Any independent and unbiased analyst can see that the current political regime is resting on a lie. Today, after its crushing defeat in the elections to the State Duma proved that people knew that its earlier policies were leading us into a blind alley, we are witnessing something amazing: The regime is changing like a chameleon, adapting itself to the changes in the society. This has been accompanied by its persistent, constant, and deliberate attempts to plant several myths in the public mind to help it keep the situation under its own control and continue its manipulation of public opinion. Here are just a few of the most significant of these myths: --The myth that the present leaders of the country endorse the values of the contemporary civilized society (democracy, the rule-of-law state, the market economy, the separation of powers, human rights, and so forth). --The myth that the "totalitarian," "communist" past has been surmounted in the political, social, and governmental life of present-day Russia. --The myth of the irreproachable legitimacy of existing government institutions based on the "nationwide" mandate of confidence in the president and the Constitution (which is directly related to the myth of the supra-class nature of the present regime, whose members come from all social strata). --The myth of its contribution to the end of the "cold war" and ability to guarantee Russia a fitting place in the system of international relations on the basis of partnership with the leading nations of the world. --The myth that the regime is devoted to the national-state interests of our country and that it is evolving in the direction of "enlightened patriotism" and "national construction." Let us take a look at all of these in the proper sequence: The myth of the "civilized," "democratic" nature of the present regime. This is probably the favorite offspring and main concern of the reptilian news media. It was precisely their ruthless exploitation of this myth, their shameless attempts to foist it on public opinion within the country and abroad, that created the "smoke screen" behind which the outrageous political cynicism and monstrous corruption of our ruling elite were safely concealed from outsiders for several years. Every element of this myth is a shameless lie. When people who routed two parliaments in two years and put their leaders behind bars, first causing the collapse of a great world power and then driving the country to the verge of civil war, talk about democracy and the "separation of powers," it is difficult to see this as anything but a travesty. When the terms "law," "rule-of-law state," and "legitimacy" are used by politicians who literally wiped their feet on one Constitution and immediately composed another (which I am bound to uphold in the performance of my professional duties, just as I upheld the earlier one), enacting it with the approval of only one-fourth of the voters, it is frightening to contemplate what might happen in the future. How can we listen seriously to the discussions of a genuine market economy in Russia when the behavior of officials is becoming more and more arbitrary, bribes are the only reliable way of solving any problem, domestic industry is dying, peasants will soon have trouble even feeding themselves, and a handful of nouveaux riches, bloated with fraudulent privatization and financial intrigues, are getting richer and richer in a destitute and almost starving nation? How can anyone talk about the preeminence of human rights when the pervasive turmoil has dramatically undermined such fundamental rights as the rights to education, health care, and security for the elderly? I will not even mention the fact that even the right to life in our "civilized" country is frequently meaningless because of the unprecedented rise in the rate of crime and racketeering. As far as political rights are concerned, the last year and a half clearly demonstrated the value of the widely publicized declarations of their immutability--the "Lefortovo inmates," the editors of opposition newspapers, and the relatives of those who died in defense of the "White House" are the best judges of their value.... The myth of the victory over the totalitarian communist past. This myth and the preceding "democratic" myth are two sides of the same coin, and the anticommunist rhetoric serves two purposes in this case. First of all, it once served as a strong propaganda weapon, securing the rise of the present upper echelon to power on the wave of the constant and intrusive exposures of the horrors of Leninism, Stalinism, and the "era of stagnation." It may be difficult to imagine, but--Horrors!--this loud campaign had nothing in common with genuine concern about the future of the country and about the tragic decades that were full of infinite trials and grief and left indelible scars, which will keep them alive in our memory forever. Human suffering has become nothing more than a bargaining chip in the big political game of the governing bigwigs who were fighting for bureaucratic privileges and Kremlin offices. Second, the fueling of anticommunist hysteria was supposed to send the West a signal of the new Russian leadership's uncompromising rejection of the expansionist geopolitical practices of the USSR and guarantee the regime strong international support and the sympathy of the foreign public. In the race for these cherished goals, no one cared that the "baby had been thrown out with the bath water"--that the thoughtless campaign denigrating our recent past had turned into a fiendish dance "on the graves of our fathers" and had hurt the feelings of millions of honest people, was crippling our youth, and was warping the already distorted historical memory of our people. At the same time, it was clear that the political practices of the regime, in contrast to its propagandistic rhetoric, were still typically Bolshevik practices, distinguished by poorly concealed irritation with "inconvenient" legal standards, the cult of "political expediency," and the open reliance on confrontation and its resolution by force. Today's increasingly severe crisis is largely a direct result of this adventuristic Bolshevik mentality, in which class hatred has given way only to a hatred of political opponents, and legal nihilism is still easily justified by "special circumstances" and the "lack of an alternative"! The myth of the irreproachable legitimacy of present government institutions. I must stipulate that because I am still a Constitutional Court justice, I am absolutely loyal to existing legislation in all areas in the performance of my duties, but I can still see the outrageously unsatisfactory state of affairs in this sphere of such great importance in the life of society and the state. The Russian legal mind has traditionally had a keen and acute reaction to the moral and ethical aspects of an issue. The curious combination of the infinite Russian tolerance and respect for the law with the people's constant suspicion of the legal standards regulating the life of society, which was an enigma to foreign researchers in every century, is due precisely to the willingness to suffer deprivations and make sacrifices "for the sake of justice" on the one hand, and the rejection of legal scholasticism on the other. With a view to these features of our national identity, the Bolsheviks and their successors in the Kremlin today always obscured their political games with a smoke screen of demagogic slogans. The only difference is that the appeals for "the world brotherhood of workers" and "the bright future of social justice" have been replaced by incantations about the desire for the "triumph of freedom and democracy" and the ritualistic verbal offerings to the "ideals of democracy, civilization, and progress." The problem now is that the confusing reality is so vastly different from the official rhetoric that the regime has lost all credibility and the last vestiges of its earlier authority. This means that not one of the existing institutions of government is legal in the public mind. The constant manipulation of the mechanisms of the democratic state with referendums, elections, parties, and the news media and the total contempt for any "rules of play" the authorities displayed during the October crisis did their job: The people understood that "the lords are fighting again, and the serfs are getting a splitting headache." No law professor or legal scholar can change the people's mind now, because the legal nihilism of the state hopelessly undermined the public belief in its own legitimate roots. Is there any need to discuss the possible implications, especially now that the "class" nature of the regime, as the chief patron of the comprador bourgeoisie, is becoming increasingly evident in a society experiencing rapid social stratification. The myth of the end of the "cold war" and of friendship with the West. The socialist obsession of the Soviet Union, which made every effort to turn the whole world community into a single "socialist camp," was one of the main reasons for its overexertion and largely predetermined the sad results of 1991. The lower level of global armed confrontation and the end of the "cold war," the effort to move from confrontation and enmity to cooperation and partnership, constitute an indisputably positive development of recent years. All of this is true, but the main thing is that the present regime had nothing to do with these positive changes. As a matter of fact, the most important advances in surmounting the confrontational legacy of the "cold war" were made within the framework of the USSR long before the levers of governmental power fell into the hands of the country's present leaders. The success of those first moves was guaranteed, incidentally, largely by the fact that the Soviet delegations at all of the talks were backed up by the colossal combined strength of the single union superpower. Now the notorious "partnership" is often secured by the submission of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by unconcealed disregard for our national-state interests. In essence, a shameful trading session is going on in the sphere of foreign policy, during which the present regime is selling Russia's long-range strategic interests in exchange for immediate political support from abroad. Furthermore, it is no secret that extremely influential groups in the West are openly striving for the maximum debilitation of Russia, seeing it as their perennial geopolitical rival. That is why it is probably premature to start shouting the news that the era of confrontation is "finally and completely" over, and that the era of boundless peace and exhilarating unanimity has arrived. There should be no doubt that we want to be good neighbors and to cooperate with the leading world powers, but we still have to face the facts: It will be a long and arduous journey to this goal. Furthermore, the average Russian citizen finds himself wondering with increasing frequency whether we won or lost when we paid for the friendship with the West and the end of the "cold war" with the collapse of the USSR, and received in exchange a "hot" war along almost the whole perimeter of Russia's new borders. Will we be able to hold on to this friendship (which is quite necessary in itself) under the conditions of growing instability and the obvious threat to all Eurasia from the "hot spots" in the post-Soviet territory? Will the final result of the current regime's foreign policy "achievements" be a new escalation of international tension? The myth of the "enlightened patriotism" of the Russian leadership. Like a rabbit from a magician's hat, it made its appearance and is growing before the eyes of the "esteemed public," watching in shock as the belligerent cosmopolitans turn into national patriots in the middle of a sentence, and as the political lexicon of the Kremlin's inhabitants acquires more and more exotic phrases like "national interest," "the national traditions of the centuries of Russian history," "the defense of fellow countrymen abroad," and so forth. There has even been a rumor that some members of the president's team are secretly learning how to make speeches about Russian patriotism in the tones of "Pamyat" and "Russian National Unity." This sad sight looks even more pitiful when we can see clearly that the principal players in the quasi-patriotic performance are the politicians who played a decisive role in the collapse of the USSR, abandoning 25 million Russians to the mercy of fate when these were suddenly living "across the border" without their consent, and who scattered handfuls of "sovereignties" within Russia itself. But the most unpleasant thing is that all of this commotion actually has nothing to do with Russia's true and genuine interests. These interests consist primarily in the complete and final cessation of the exhausting domestic political confrontations, which could lead to new outbreaks of violence, the restoration of the single integrated economy of the post-Soviet territory in accordance with actual conditions, the reconstitution of the dismembered body of the Russian people, and the reinstatement of the thousand-year-old Russian state as a responsible and predictable member of the international community and a major guarantor of geopolitical equilibrium on the planet. It is important to realize that the objective progression of events is moving in this direction, and that anyone who dares to ignore this will soon be swept off the political stage. What should we do? How should we begin releasing ourselves from the obtrusive and harmful myths in which Russia has become entangled, distorting the truth, misleading the public, and delaying the recovery of our national identity? Should we look at our own history? "However colossal the power of the state might be," Pobedonostsev warned at the beginning of the century, "it rests on nothing other than the unity of the spiritual consciousness of the people and the government, on the trust of the people. Power begins to be undermined when this consciousness based on trust starts to split into two separate entities." Today no one trusts anyone in Russia. The government exists on its own, and the people exist on their own. That is why we should start by using all of the democratic institutions and mechanisms of government remaining at our disposal and find ways of uniting the public, restoring mutual trust, and resolutely ridding ourselves of those who will interfere with the normalization of the situation. We are not entitled to any more mistakes. Russia has reached its limit for social cataclysms. The continuation of irresponsible experimentation will be fatal for the country. We have had enough of destruction, and now it is finally time to start creating!
