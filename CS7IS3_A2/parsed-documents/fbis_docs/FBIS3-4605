David D. Ussery, representative director and president of detergent retailer Amway Korea; Jason Li, general manager of health food seller Sunrider International Korea; and nine other persons working for the firms are on trial for alleged illegal retailing in the form of so-called multi-layer home-visit sales. This is pressure on the Korean government and its aim is to rescue the U.S. businessmen from the lawsuit although the courts are independent of the administration, a businessman said. It follows an earlier American attempt by Defense Secretary William Perry to put pressure on his Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae to buy airborne radar jamming device manufactured by a U.S. firm, he said. Late in December last year, Perry sent a letter to Minister Yi and the letter was disclosed early this month, causing public criticism against the United States. An official of the Trade-Industry-Energy Ministry confirmed the reception of the letter, refusing to disclose details. He said, "The letter came late last month. But we cannot disclose the contents of the letter as it involves a sensitive trade issue." Prosecutors arrested Ussery, Li and five other persons working for the two firms charging them with illegal retailing on July 1 last year. This was the first arrest of foreigners in violation of the law on home-visit sales. U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed "concern" about the issue during his visit to Seoul July 10-11 last year. Prosecutors filed a summary suit against the top managers of the two firms and nine others Nov. 16 to wind up the sensitive case quickly with a mere cash penalty. But the Nambu (southern) branch of the Seoul District Criminal Court ordered a formal rather than summary trial Dec. 9, refusing the summary indictment requested by the prosecutors. Stating his reasons for ordering the formal trial, Judge Min Pyong-hun of the court said, "There has been a dispute about the legal interpretation of the law on home-visit sales. It also would have been hard to make a ruling based on the investigation records produced by prosecutors. As a result, a formal trial was needed where evidence and arguments can be brought forward." The first trial will reportedly be held next month.
