The minister came here on Thursday afternnon to discuss the issue with the region's military officers. "The Kaliningrad region is different from all other Russian regions because of its geographic and enclave position", Grachev noted. "And the mobile grouping to be formed here is designed to ensure reliable protection of this territory against military threats from both the sea and land", he stressed. However, there will be no sweeping reductions in the officers' corps, the minister promised, therefore there are no grounds for concern. Grachev informed officers about the progress of military reform. He also reported that some 20 new laws on armed forces were being drafted at the moment, "since many provisions of the laws passed by the former Supreme Soviet do no meet the Army's interests". Among the most important laws, the minister cited those on martial law, on military police, on courts martial. The defence minister answered questions from the audience. After the meeting, well-known variety actors, who came from Moscow together with Grachev, gave a performance.
