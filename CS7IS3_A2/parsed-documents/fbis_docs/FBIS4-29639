Howe, also minister for housing and regional development, made the call in a 20-minute meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. Giving high marks to Japan's contributions in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Howe said he hopes Japan would participate in the "International Conference on Cities and New Global Economies," to be co-hosted by Australia and the OECD in Melbourne in November. He also expressed hope that Australia and Japan could cooperate at another international conference on social development scheduled for next March in Denmark, they said. Kakizawa told Howe he is interested in problems concerning housing and city development and said Japan would like to take part in the conference, according to the officials. Kakizawa said he hopes Japan and Australia could continue to cooperate in the Asia-Pacific region and coordinate aid policies for the South Pacific islands. He also voiced hope that summit meetings of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will continue to be held in the future, they said. An informal summit of APEC leaders was held in Seattle last November and another summit is to be held this year in Indonesia. Howe arrived in Japan last Friday to hold talks with Japanese Government officials on regional development and ask for Japan's participation in the conference. He is to meet Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata later Monday.
