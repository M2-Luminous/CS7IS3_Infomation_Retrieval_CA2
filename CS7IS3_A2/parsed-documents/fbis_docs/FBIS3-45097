The M60-A3 tanks that some Army leaders want to purchase are currently serving the U.S. detachment in South Korea. They will be retired soon and Washington has offered them for sale to Taiwan, according to the UNITED EVENING NEWS. The M60-A3 offers no significant advantages over Taiwan's existing M48-series in terms of fire power. Both the M60-A3 and M48-A5 have a 105 mm main gun. But with a 51,500 kg combat weight, an M60-A3 is more than 2,500 kg heavier than an M48-A5, the heaviest main battle tank currently serving the ROC's armed forces. The heavier weight will reduce the M60-A3's maneuverability in Taiwan, which is already a difficult operating ground because most of the island is covered by steep slopes and river deltas inaccessible to tanks, according to the tank's critics. However, those who want to purchase the tank argued the M60-A3s can effectively serve as mobile land batteries against an invading force from mainland China. And at NT$20 million a piece, they asserted they were a great bargain for the army. But those who oppose the purchase stated that the used tanks will be sitting ducks for the enemy's air force during an invasion because by the time troops begin an amphibious assault, the island's air force will have already been depleted and the tanks will be left without air cover -- leading to a disaster similar to those faced by the Egyptians in the Six-Day War, and more recently by the Iraqis in the Gulf War. In addition, the list price does not include maintenance costs, which for tanks can be very expensive, and in any case the Army would have difficulty finding qualified technicians to maintain them due to a shortage of qualified personnel, the dissenters added. Military officers opposed to the deal pointed out that the Army had already considered purchasing the tanks three years ago, but opted to buy AH-lW Cobra gunships instead because the military had decided that the M60s did not fulfill combat needs. They added the M60s are still unsuitable today. Despite opposition from within the military, armed forces observers said the purchase will probably go through for political considerations. The project would please both Washington and ROC [Republic of China] President Li Teng-hui. Li has taken a personal interest in armored units after a group of Army commanders complained of bad equipment when he visited an Army base in August last year, according to local press. The M60-A3 tank, measuring 9.4 meters with its gun and 6.9 meters without the gun, is manned by four crews. It is 3.63 meters wide and 3.27 meters tall. The tank can reach 48 kph on roads and has a maximum range of 480 km. It is capable of breaching a vertical obstacle of 0.914 meters and can cross a trench 2.59 meters wide. The M60-A3 is powered by a 750 horsepower 12-cylinder air-cooled engine. Sixty-three shells are stored in the tank for the tank's main 105 mm gun. A well-trained crew can fire between six to eight rounds per minute. Certain shells have an effective range in excess of 9,000 meters.
