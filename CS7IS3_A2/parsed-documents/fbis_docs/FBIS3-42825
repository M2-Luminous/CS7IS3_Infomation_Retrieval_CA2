Yeltsin is going to a country whose public opinion considers Russia to blame for its biggest national defeat," Emil Pain, member of the Presidential Council, told your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent on the eve of the visit. "The psychological atmosphere in Georgian society is anti-Russian Federation and anti-Russian. All parties have decisively protested Russia's policy. Were Russian-Georgian relations already 'full' interstate relations, the president would hardly be going to a country whose political climate is so manifestly inauspicious for an official visit. There is a great danger that there will be in such a situation, instead of interstate negotiations, simply a meeting of two people. "There were for a long time many inhibitory factors, and the date of the visit had been postponed several times. It was primarily the state of war with Abkhazia which was getting in the way. Politically, the problem has yet to be resolved, but the hostilities have ceased, and this creates the minimum prerequisites for the visit. The second aspect is the position of the North Caucasus republics opposed to a rapprochement of Russia and Georgia. Since the October events relations between the president and the republics have changed quite radically compared with what they were like under the conditions of diarchy, which made the trip to Tbilisi possible. I assume that the Russian-American summit also exerted an influence to some extent. America is very concerned by Russia's position in relation to Georgia, and the question of a reconciliation and of Russia's more benevolent attitude toward Georgia was, evidently, studied during the preparation for Clinton's visit and during his time in Moscow. Georgia had been seeking the conclusion of a treaty with Russia throughout the past year. Tbilisi had an interest primarily in the regulation and establishment of the borders of the Georgian state and recognition of its integrity. The signing of such a treaty would signify that Russia--officially, at least--is not an ally of Abkhazia. Hopes for some economic assistance are also linked with the treaty for, after all, the population of Georgia is receiving a blockade bread ration. Russia's first geopolitical interest in such a treaty consists of the firmness of its borders. It is not at all a matter of indifference to us whom Chechnya borders and how friendly toward us the regime of the neighboring country is. The second: Russia aspires to support democratic regimes, and any subsequent regime in Georgia will be, from Russia's viewpoint, worse for it than the present one. And the third: a general regulation of mutual relations in the post-Soviet world.
