A group of former "contras" led by Luis Arguello, alias "002," entered the diplomatic mission at 0945 (1545 GMT) and immediately requested political asylum because they fear for their lives. Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, through a press release, said that in this country "there is no need for political asylum," adding that this incident displays a misguided position (on the part of the former "contras"). Leal stressed: "During Violeta Chamorro's government, in our country there are no, nor will there ever be, politically persecuted individuals." In addition, the head of Nicaraguan diplomacy said the occupants of the Colombian Embassy "can perfectly well leave" the site and make use of all media and every legal means to present their demands. It was reported today from Colombia that the Foreign Ministry of that South American nation is studying the political asylum request by the six former "contras" who are inside their embassy in Managua. With regard to the occupation of the headquarters of the International Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS (CIAV-OAS) by 17 former "contras," who also claim they fear for their lives, the Chamorro government still has not made any official statements. The Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS headquarters are each guarded by two patrol cars and five police officers. At the CIAV-OAS headquarters, located near the Government Ministry Building, an unspecified number of CIAV-OAS personnel continue to be detained by former Nicaraguan resistance members who in the 1980's combated the Sandinist regime. According to a Government Ministry official, talks are continuing with leaders of the groups occupying the buildings to find a negotiated solution to this new problem in Nicaragua. In recent months, former "contras" and former Sandinist soldiers have engaged in a number of occupations and protests to demand the government's compliance with agreements on their reinsertion into civilian life. Venezuelan, Italian, and United Nations diplomatic facilities, as well as the Managua and Esteli cathedrals, have been occupied on previous occasions by these groups as part of their attempts to call the government's attention to their demands.
