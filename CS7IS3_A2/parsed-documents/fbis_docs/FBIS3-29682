The Korea Auto Industrial Cooperative Association said Saturday that 17,247 vehicles were shipped to the United States in January, a rise of 111.7 percent over the same month last year. Automobile exports to the United States registered a decline of 7.5 percent in 1993 from the previous year. Shipments to West Europe reached 12,652 vehicles in January, up 32.7 percent over the same month in 1993 and far higher than last whole year's growth rate of 12.5 percent. Up until 1991, the United States and West Europe together took more than 50 percent of South Korea's exports of finished vehicles. Last year, however, the share slumped to 37 percent due to reduced market demand and realigned sales networks in the two areas. Beginning around the end of last year, demand for South Korean-made cars, especially the Sonata II of Hyundai Motor and Shepia of KIA, has been rising fast in Germany, France and Italy as well as in the United States. "Now the two major regional markets represent 62.6 percent of our total auto exports," an official at the association said. Contrary to brisk shipments to these areas, auto exports to other markets have declined visibly since the turn of the year. Vehicles exported to other Asian countries in January numbered no more than 1,421, down 72.6 percent from January last year and off 89.2 percent from last December. Shipments to Latin America declined 20 percent and to East Europe 63.6 percent in the first month of this year. The official said the slump in exports to these areas was due primarily to large stocks held by local dealers caused by brisk shipments late last year. The country's automobile exports in January totaled 47,714, up 20.2 percent over the like period of last year.
