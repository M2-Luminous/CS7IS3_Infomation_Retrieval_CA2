[Begin reporter Kim recording] I warmly welcome you who have arrived in Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution. Will you speak a few words about your impression on arriving in Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution? [Begin Deputy So recording] I am indeed pleased to come to Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution. From the moment of boarding the train, my heart dashed toward Pyongyang where the great leader and dear comrade leader are. As I am warmly welcomed after arriving in Pyongyang as a deputy of the conference of cell secretaries of the whole party, I am overflowing with the pride in being the core of our glorious party and a responsible figure for the basic party organization [kichungdang chojik]. I cannot suppress deep emotion fraught with thanks to the great General Kim Chong-il who provided us with a conference of cell secretaries of the whole party, which is the first occasion in history of our party, and who extended all benevolence and love to us after calling us as deputies. [end So recording] [Begin Deputy Kil recording] The cell secretaries of the party in our South Pyongan Province who will attend the upcoming conference rushed to Pyongyang with deep emotion for benevolence of the great leader who called on women party members in (Tangsan) and party members in Nagwon during the days of war and led the party cell youth. The respected leader's lofty intention and effort to strengthen and develop the party cell have been brilliantly inherited by energetic activities of the great General Kim Chong-il. Even in the midst of a busy time, the dear comrade leader personally read the letters sent from the cell members of the Fifth Bureau of the Korean Central News Agency and from the mining workers' cell in Toksong Mine, and sent reply letters to them. Thus, he saw to it that all cells throughout the country be firmly consolidated into that of loyalty. Even if the world may change a thousand times, I will loudly sing the song of faith, "Without You, There Is No Fatherland, With You, We Will Win!" I will attend the conference with loyalty cherished by our party cell members who trust and follow only the respected general Kim Chong-il forever. [end Kil recording] [Begin deputy So recording] Deeply cherishing the lofty intentions of the great leader and the dear comrade leader who made efforts to strengthen and develop the party cells, I will actively contribute to glorifying the upcoming conference held for the first time in our party's history as a historic conference which will open a new turning point in carrying to accomplishment the chuche socialist cause. [end So recording] Thus, the deputies, who will attend a conference of cell secretaries of the whole party, have arrived in Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution.
