Radio Rebelde reports at 1700 GMT on 8 April that Cubana de Aviacion has initiated flights to Caracas with a stopover in Bogota in an effort to enhance tourism. Tour operators Sol y Sun [as heard] Agency from Cubana de Aviacion, Nirvana from Venezuela, and G.M. Tropical from Colombia are taking part in this operation. Rebelde also reports that during the recent Berlin International Tourism Conference, industry executives asserted that this year Cuba is one of the prime tourist destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean. To handle the projected increased in visitors, Cuba's Gaviota tourism enterprise is planning to open two new four-star hotels, a 260-room hotel in Varadero and a 242-room hotel in Holguin, and plans to build more facilities. Cuba Vision Network at 2220 GMT on 8 April reports that the Sancti Spiritus paper factory has resumed activities upon the arrival in the country of the necessary raw materials. The factory will this month begin production of 2,000 tons of paper designated for that production facing paper deficits, such as cigarette boxes and school notebooks. Some 400 tons will be earmarked for a match factory. This year 19,000 tons will be earmarked for exports. Only one-third of the factory's capacity will be exploited, in joint operations with Latin American and European nations. Sugarcane bagasse is also used as raw material. In the same newscast, Cuba Vision reports that the operator of a sugarcane harvesting machine has cut 1 million arrobas of cane during this harvest. The operator is the first woman in the country to cut 1 million arrobas; she averaged 10,000 arrobas daily despite continuous mechanical problems. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 9 April report that the steam-driven trains of the Orlando Gonzalez industrial complex in Ciego de Avila are the first of their type in the country to run on emulsified fuel and magnetized water. This experimental mixture has been used in the boilers of an asphalt plant in this province. Use of the emulsion has saved 43 tons of fuel. After 100 days of harvest, all locomotive engine parts are perfectly clean, which will result in great savings both in fuel and in labor. The report adds that the Sugar Industry Ministry has 200 of these locomotives. Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 9 April reports that the workers of the Hotel Caracol in Santa Lucia have decided to give health institutions all the hard currency they receive in tips during the month of April.

LTU expects to double the number of tourists -- currently 26,000 a year -- and plans to establish flights to Ciego de Avila in the near future. Radio Rebelde adds that farmers in Matanzas have planted 109 caballerias of miscellaneous crops during March. The spring planting program comprises 900 caballerias of corn, pumpkin, cucumber, yucca, yams, and plantains. Specialists stress that fulfilling the planting program is vital to meeting the needs of the people. Radio Rebelde also reports that in San Cristobal Municipality in Pinar del Rio, the 93-94 sugar harvest is experiencing difficulties. A provincial expert adds that measures had to be taken to overcome delays, such as activating the Jose Marti Mill to help the 30 November Mill meet the sugar production goal, and mobilizing over 1,000 workers. Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 11 April reports that more than 120,000 poles of tobacco have been collected in Holguin, while peasants have already planted 23 caballerias of tobacco. This plantation is below its established goal because of bad weather. In San Juan y Martinez, Pinar del Rio Province, the municipal board has termed positive the results obtained in tobacco production by more than 100 producers who, for the first time, have received land to enlarge their plantations. Radio Reloj at 1942 GMT on 11 April reports that Mexican Ambassador Carlos Tello Macias has presented a humanitarian donation to Raul Taladrid, vice president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation.

Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 12 April reports that last year and during the first quarter of 1994, the Indalecio Monteco Metalworking Company in Ciego de Avila assembled 7,800 bicycles produced by the Caibarien Factory in Villa Clara.

Radio Progreso at 1100 GMT on 12 April reports that in Ciego de Avila the Agricultural Shops Enterprise has repaired 183 large and small irrigation pumps over the past 60 days.
