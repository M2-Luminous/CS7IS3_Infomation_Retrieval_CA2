The announcement comes after pressure on the organization by Tanzania and Zimbabwe to abide by the principles of peaceful negotiation. Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel has said it's high time that the PAC and its armed wing, APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army], realized that violence and democracy do not mix. ANC Spokesman, Carl Niehaus, welcomed the announcement, but said the organization's executive committee was studying it before making a full statement.
