Riverside Gas Storage Company Docket No. CP94&hyph;292&hyph;000 Take notice that on March 17, 1994, Riverside Gas Storage Company (Riverside), 3500 Park Lane, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15275, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;292&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, and part 157 and subpart G of part 284 of the Commission's Regulations for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to develop, construct, own and operate an underground gas storage field and related facilities in Greene and Fayette Counties, Pennsylvania and for a blanket certificate to render firm and interruptible storage services on a non-discriminatory open-access basis, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Riverside requests authorization to acquire, develop, own and operate an underground gas storage field and to provide a total of 3,100 MMcf annually of natural gas storage service. It is stated that the field will have a capacity of 5,100 MMcf of which 3,100 MMcf will represent working gas and 2,000 MMcf will represent cushion gas. It is further stated that Riverside will acquire or drill 21 injection/withdrawal wells, and install any necessary pipeline and compression facilities. In addition, it is stated that the Riverside storage field will be attached to the interstate pipeline system of Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation. Riverside proposes to offer two firm storage services: 90-day withdrawal service under Rate Schedule 90SS and 30-day withdrawal service under Rate Schedule 30SS. Riverside states that these services will permit year-round injections and withdrawal of gas subject to the requirement that customers must inject 100 percent of contract entitlements on one occasion during the summer period of each year and must withdraw at least 75 percent of contract entitlements on one occasion during the winter period of each year. Riverside proposes to operate under a part 284 blanket certificate, and in compliance with Order No. 636, Riverside's proposed FERC gas Tariff includes provisions regarding capacity release, and the right of first refusal for customers under expiring long-term contracts that wish to retain all or a portion of capacity rights. In addition, Riverside proposes initial certificate rates for firm storage service which are based on a straight fixed variable classification with fixed costs being recovered through the deliverability and capacity charges and variable costs recovered through the injection and withdrawal charges. It is stated that Riverside will allocate 40 percent of fixed costs to the deliverability rate component and 60 percent of fixed costs to the space component of firm storage rates. Riverside states that it will also offer interruptible storage service under Rate Schedule ISS&hyph;1. It is stated that the rates for interruptible storage service are designed on the 100 percent load factor derivation of the proposed firm storage rates. Riverside states that it will credit 90 percent of net interruptible revenues to firm storage customers. It is stated that Riverside held an open season in July 1993. Riverside states that based on the expressed level of customer demand, Riverside proposes to offer 2.54 Bcf of base-load storage service under Rate Schedule 90SS, with an aggregate Maximum Daily Injection Quantity of 29,210 Dth and an aggregate Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity of 29,210 Dth, and to offer 560 MMcf of peak storage service under Rate Schedule 30SS, with an aggregate Maximum Daily Injection Quantity of 19,320 Dth and an aggregate Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity of 19,320 Dth.
