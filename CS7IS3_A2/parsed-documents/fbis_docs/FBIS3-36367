According to Aliyev, last year formations of the Abkhaz and "confederate" forces were mightily armed thanks to captured Georgian armored vehicles and heavy artillery. Last year, Captain 1st Rank Aliyev said, we had the military and moral potential enough to advance through half of Georgia and to reach Kutaisi. The South Ossetian parliament asked the Russian Federation Council not to ratify the agreement until the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict is resolved.
