He reminded Sinn Fein that a future British Government "would be quite free to adopt a united Ireland" as its long-term policy under the Downing Street Declaration and the Anglo-Irish Agreement, provided it adhered to the requirement of majority consent. While welcoming this week's speech by the Northern Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, favouring a role for new North-South institutions, the Taoiseach insisted that now was the time when "the republican movement needs to clarify more fully its own attitudes to Northern Protestants and unionists." He said he did not expect Sinn Fein to renounce violence and make a definitive response to the Downing Street Declaration at the ard-fheis but "it would be very welcome if they do." If Sinn Fein could "clear up" where it stood on the right of the protestant population in Northern Ireland not to have to accept Irish unity, then "this would be a vital step...to trying to get everybody into the political process...." In a speech to the Association of European Journalists in Dublin, the Taoiseach quoted from an article in the Republican magazine, the Starry Plough, in January 1992, by Mr Mitchel Mclaughlin of Sinn Fein where he stated: "The truth is that we cannot and should not ever try to coerce the Protestant people into a united Ireland." But Mr McLaughlin had also acknowledged "an element among republicans and others who secretly believed the Protestant population could be coerced into accepting Irish unity and independence." Mr McLaughlin had said that was "not acceptable, and it was not possible, as Republicans should know better than anyone...." The Taoiseach said: "If that is Sinn Fein's policy, and I believe it is, the implications of it need to be thought through and debated.... A clear endorsement of a policy of non-coercion vis-a-vis those they regard as a national minority at the ard-fheis would represent an immense step forward." In an attempt to rebut republican critics of the declaration, the Taoiseach said there were still misunderstandings that needed to be cleared up. "It is wrongly claimed that the unionists have been given a veto on British Government policy in the Joint Declaration. A future British Government would be quite free to adopt a united Ireland as its long-term policy aim, provided they adhered to the requirement of consent," which was an obligation under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. In answer to questions, the Taoiseach pointed out that the one-time unionist veto on British policy had been "diluted along the way. That kind of veto does not exist any more." Mr Reynolds said it was "nonsense to suggest that in embracing the peace process only republicans are being asked to make sacrifices for peace. Unionists have to accept that the constitutional future of Northern Ireland remains open and that if there is to be real peace there has to be an agreement between the people of Ireland, North and South, on one shared future on this island."
