Are they going in the right direction? What has already been done in this sphere, and what is planned in the very near future? These are not easy questions. Answers to them were given at a news conference held by the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Information and Press Directorate. It was addressed by Colonel General V. Zhurbenko, first deputy chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff; Lieutenant General G. Ivanov, chief of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Military Building and Reforms Directorate; Lieutenant General G. Bochayev, first deputy chief of the General Staff Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate; and representatives of other directorates of the General Staff and Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. The occasion for this was the Russian president's message to the Federal Assembly "On Strengthening the Russian State." As is known, one of its sections is devoted to an analysis and assessment of the reforms in the Army and to what the Russian Armed Forces should be like in the very near future. "The Armed Forces are going through a very complex stage in their development today," Col. Gen. Zhurbenko pointed out. "It is necessary simultaneously to implement measures to create the Russian Army and to withdraw troops from East and Central European countries and also the Baltic countries." Naturally, all this cannot fail to leave its mark on the processes taking place in the Army. Not a single army in the world is thought to have tackled such large-scale and complex tasks. And yet not so much time has elapsed since it started to be reformed. The building of the Russian Armed Forces began 7 May 1992 -- with the promulgation of the president's edict on the creation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. During this time the Ministry of Defense has been formed, the actual state of the Armed Forces has been analyzed, the concept of their building has been elaborated and approved by the president, directive instructions on combat and mobilization readiness and on operational and strategic planning have been drawn up, a number of legislative acts on military questions have been prepared.... Nevertheless, as the president's message pointed out, the set tasks have been fulfilled in the Armed Forces. The reforms in the Armed Forces are going according to plan. If they had also been backed up with the necessary funding, I believe that many questions would have been resolved far more quickly. In conclusion, one more figure: Since 7 May 1992 the authorized strength of the Armed Forces has been reduced by 457,000 men.
