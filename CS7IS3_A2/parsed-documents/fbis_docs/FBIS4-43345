The goal is to make it less vulnerable to electronic jamming and to facilitate its maintenance, said the Federal Military Department (DMF). The cost of the operation is expected to be 18 million [Swiss] francs [SFr]. The Armament Group (GDA) has signed a contract with British Aerospace, which designed the system. The GDA has placed a SFr4 million order so far. This modernization process will be presented to parliament in the framework of one of the armament programs of the second half of the decade. The Rapier system was purchased in the early eighties. At the time, parliament voted an overall SFr1.39 billion credit. The system has been used in the Swiss Air Force since 1985. It makes it possible to fight targets flying at average altitudes, day or night, even in bad weather.
