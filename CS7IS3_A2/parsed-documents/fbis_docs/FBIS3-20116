A criminal court session in the Ucciardone prison in this Sicilian town was set to try Riina Saturday morning on charges of arranging the murder of Gerlando Alberti, a former member of the Mafia. Riina and other suspected Mafia leaders are accused of hiring five men who tried to poison Alberti while he was serving a sentence in Ucciardone. Alberti was able to alert prison guards in time to save his life. The prosecutor's office will question the jurors to determine the cause of their refusal. It is not unusual for jurors in Italy to refuse to serve in Mafia trials because of potential danger to themselves or their families.
