The rare cutting restriction enzyme and pulsed field electrophoresis were used for long range physical mapping of YACs. A YAC containing 2bA3 DNA locus with the length of 800 kb was analysed with four different restriction enzyme to obtain the long range physical map. Key words: YAC, pulsed field electrophoresis, 2bA3, long range physical map.
