An organ of the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory body to the international trade and industry minister, held its first meeting to prepare a set of industrial rules for protecting the earth's environment in such areas as industrial wastes and chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide emissions. A report to be announced in early June will address the importance of sector-by-sector responsibility by Japanese businesses for the disposal of harmful chemicals and byproducts throughout all stages of business activities from materials purchases to manufacturing, distribution and the end-use of products, ministry officials said. The report will also call for businesses to establish technologies to enable secondary use of both industrial and household waste. The panel will hold three more meetings before releasing the report entitled, ``An Industrial Vision of the Environment,'' on 8 June.
