For over 10 years this has been used in addition to silicon in the constant search for new and more efficient solutions to the production of electricity using solar energy. This step has been made by the new generation germanium substrate GaAs cells developed by researchers at CISE [Center for Data, Studies, and Experimentation] in Milan (an ENEL [National Electric Power Company] research company] and successfully tested for 11 months on the EURECA [European Retrievable Carrier] platform in space from which they have now returned for further laboratory tests. The results furnished by these cells as well as definitively confirming their higher performance with respect to silicon cells, now open interesting prospects for further development since their costs are now the same as those of their competitors, silicon cells. As has been noted, the development of the two technologies has always been accompanied by advantages and disadvantages: reduced costs but low conversion factors (10-14 percent) in the case of silicon solar cells; in the case of gallium arsenide cells however, the performance is doubled but with costs up to four times higher. These differences have obviously induced researchers all over the world to concentrate their efforts on silicon cells because of their possible ground applications for photovoltaic energy (panels for domestic use, experimental centers etc.), but placing great emphasis on gallium arsenide cells because of their higher performance levels, the increased resistance of GaAs to cosmic radiation, and high performance at low temperatures. That is, to make them more suitable for military and space applications. Here, increased performance, reliability, the reduced size and weight of the panels at equivalent power levels and consequently an increased scientific payload, not the costs, are the determining factors when choosing the optimal solution. Now that the cost difference between GaAs and silicon cells has been overcome, the new generation GaAs cells tested aboard EURECA have become more appealing because performance levels are doubled and because of the other advantages already mentioned (size, weight, reliability, etc.). A success that CISE researchers have achieved by replacing the substrate, which was previously made of the same material, with a thinner but stronger and much less expensive germanium substrate; and using a new deposition technology for the fine superficial GaAs layer on the new substrate. That is, passing from the previous "liquid phase" deposition technique to the "vapor phase" technique. The process is based on the natural phenomenon of epitaxy (under which crystals of different kinds become associated according to well-determined laws), normally used in microelectronics to produce crystals in semiconducting materials. This has now been developed by CISE after an initial collaboration with Bell Laboratories and almost 10 years of testing, by depositing GaAs on various substrates (germanium, silicon) and making other important achievements: uniform deposition, increased purity of the layers, low-cost processes. Consequently, this opens up wide-ranging market prospects for new generation GaAs solar cells in Europe, both for CISE and the national aerospace industry, which has to date been conditioned by strong competition from German silicon technology. In addition to providing electricity for scientific satellites, the new technology should also meet with increased approval, with respect to silicon, in the vast and growing sector of mini-satellites for telecommunications, remote-sensing and environmental observation, industrial services because of the abovementioned advantages of reduced size and weight at the same price, higher performance levels, more reliability. Though still at the early stages, this technology could also start being tested (as already happens in the United States) in applications on earth. The performance levels, which are double those of silicon, could promote research and new developments in single equipment for domestic use, the testing of concentration devices from current photovoltaic centers on new types of cells, or attract the interest of the Nordic countries, which receive less sunlight, in the new solar panels, given the increased performance of new GaAs cells in interplanetary spaces even at temperatures of minus 150 degrees Celsius and in the absence of light. It cannot be excluded therefore that thanks to GaAs, photovoltaic energy may still hold some good surprises in store.
