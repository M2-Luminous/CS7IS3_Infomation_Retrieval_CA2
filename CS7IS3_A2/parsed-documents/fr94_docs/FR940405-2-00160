The Canada Life Account will invest in shares of the investment portfolios of the Canada Life of America Series Fund, Inc., as well as portfolios of other specified registered open-end management investment companies (collectively, the ``Funds'').

As a result, each portfolio operates as a separate investment fund, and the investment performance of one portfolio has no effect on the investment performance of any other portfolio. The Canada Life Account has a number of subaccounts, each of which invests solely in a specific corresponding portfolio of one of the Funds. 4.

The Contracts are individual flexible premium variable deferred annuity contracts. The Contracts may be purchased on a non-tax-qualified basis, or they may be purchased and used in connection with retirement plans or individual retirement accounts that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment. Generally, the Contracts may be purchased with an initial purchase payment of at least $5,000. However, the initial purchase payment may be reduced to: $100 if the Contract owner has executed a preauthorized check agreement for additional purchase payments to be automatically withdrawn monthly from the Contract owner's bank account (a ``PAC agreement''); or $2,000 if the Contract is to fund an Individual Retirement Annuity (``IRA''). (The Companies reserve the right to lower or raise the minimum premium for IRAs.) Generally, subsequent purchase payments must be at least $1,000. However, such purchase payments may be reduced to: $100 or more if the purchase payment is made by preauthorized check pursuant to a PAC agreement; or $50 or more per month if an IRA Rider is in effect, and provided that no purchase payment, together with the total of other purchase payments, would exceed $1,000,000 unless the applicable Company consents to a larger amount. 9. A Contract owner may allocate net purchase payments to one or more subaccounts of the applicable Account, each of which will invest in a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. (Net purchase payments equal purchase payments less any premium taxes deducted.) Purchase payments will be credited with the investment experience of the selected subaccount(s). A Contract owner also may allocate net purchase payments to the applicable Company's general account. 10. Prior to the annuity date, a Contract owner may transfer Contract value among subaccounts of the applicable Account, or surrender a Contract or withdraw a portion of the cash surrender value. The amount payable upon surrender, the cash surrender value, is the Contract value less any applicable contingent deferred sales charge. 11. The Contracts provide for a series of annuity payments beginning on the annuity date. A Contract owner may select from several annuity payment options, all of which are fixed options that provide for payments out of the applicable Company's general account.
