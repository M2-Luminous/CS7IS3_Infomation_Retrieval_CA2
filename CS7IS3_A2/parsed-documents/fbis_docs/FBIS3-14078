However, he said, the question of whether or not to continue the closure hinged solely on security considerations and the need to prevent any Jewish bloodshed. Rabin told the Labor Knesset faction that the government would reach a decision regarding the evacuation of the Jewish settlers from central Hebron on the basis of security considerations, not public opinion polls. Rabin added that the support voiced by right-wing elements for Dr. Goldstein's crime had been widely reported in the international media. Today, Mr. Rabin said, we do not look as nice as we thought in the eyes of the world. The prime minister stressed that Israel had no other negotiating partner among the Palestinians except Yasir 'Arafat and the PLO. As for the situation in Lebanon, Prime Minister Rabin said that yesterday's ambush in the security zone was laid by members of Ahmad Jibril's PFLP-GC [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command] and not by the Hizballah. The identity of those who launched the katyusha rockets that landed in the western Galilee yesterday, however, remained unknown. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir added that during the session, it was reported that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] was currently completing its plans for new security arrangements in Hebron and in the Cave of the Patriarchs. When these plans are completed they will brought before the political echelon for approval. One of the aims is to prevent Jewish extremists in Hebron and Qiryat Arba' from harassing Arabs, as has been the case in the past.
