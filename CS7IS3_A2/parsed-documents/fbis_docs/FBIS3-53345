In an interview with the UAE paper AL-ITTIHAD today, Musa affirmed that there are no differences among the Damascus Declaration member countries. He said: Efforts and political views are unified and everyone supports the peace process. We all are against extremism and want economic reform and our stances on all problems and crises are unified. He added that turning the Damascus Declaration into an economic bloc is a good idea and that it is important that we should ensure the success of this idea. He said that there is an enormous opportunity to revive the Damascus Declaration because there is a consensus on the need to support it in the face of regional developments. Musa expected the Syrian-U.S. summit to give momentum to the Syrian-Israeli track of the peace negotiations and said that the situation will become extremely dangerous if the summit yields nothing. He noted that Syrian-Egyptian coordination in economics and development has accomplished a great deal, and that this is an age of cooperation and interests and not one of slogans. On Egypt's view of reviving Arab solidarity, the Egyptian foreign minister said that there are some impediments, especially after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, that should be addressed. He added that contradictions still exist and that there are foreign currents that are trying to subvert the Arab region under various themes to undermine stability in the Arab world. Our task, he said, is to create stability in the Arab world, but this will not work without economic reform and genuine solidarity. He said that the issue should be discussed quietly and that we must be ready for change and deal with it united.
