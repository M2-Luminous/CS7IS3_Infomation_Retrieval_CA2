This agreement has undoubtedly given both China and the United States -- and even Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles -- a breathing spell and has also raised the hope that China's MFN trading status will be renewed for another year. Yet, the more important message conveyed by the agreement is that economic and trade exchanges should be carried out on the basis of the principle of mutual benefit; otherwise, both parties will suffer losses. Over the past year and more, the United States has added a great number of non-economic factors to economic and trade dealings with China, thus creating many obstacles for industrial and commercial ties between the two countries. During its talks with China on a new textile agreement, the United States filed groundless charges against China's U.S.-bound textile exports and unilaterally imposed sanctions against China. As a result, the two sides were unable to reach a consensus before the deadline of the old agreement and have had to speed up the pace of their negotiations in order to enter a new one. It is beyond any doubt that the new agreement has served to eliminate one of the unclear factors currently exiting in Sino- U.S. trade, yet people are still closely following the issue of the United States' renewal of China's MFN trading status. No matter whether it is under the newly reached Sino-U.S. textile agreement or when engaged in other bilateral economic and trade relations, China has always acted in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit. Over the past several years, in light of its own realistic conditions, China has done a great deal of work in opening the domestic market, reducing tariffs, protecting intellectual property rights, and even improving the human rights record. Yet, due to differences in social, historical, cultural, and economic backgrounds and conditions, it is obvious that foreign countries should not force their own standards on China or demand that China make impractical changes. If the United States can renew or even change its improper practice of making an annual appraisal on China's MFN trading status, I believe that both countries will be able to enjoy considerable social and economic benefits. The reasonable prices and constantly improving quality of China's exported products favor to American consumers at the middle and lower social strata. On the other hand, American manufacturers and businessmen can also benefit from the normalization of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations. A great number of American businessmen and even transnational enterprises have already set up factories and representative offices in China in an attempt to open up this huge market which has great potential. China's demand for imports has grown rapidly over that of recent years. According to statistics released by the Chinese customs authority, the value of China's imports of all kinds of materials in 1993 totalled $103.9 billion, representing a 29-percent increase over that of 1992. During the same period, however, export growth stood at only 9 percent; as a result, China's trade deficits have gone as high as $12.18 billion. China's persistence in upholding the policy of reform and opening up and in speeding up the pace of economic development needs to be backed by investment in various types of capital and basic construction projects. Therefore, it can be predicted that China needs to import $700 billion worth of relevant materials in stages over the coming several years. This undoubtedly holds great appeal for foreign investors. China will nevertheless continue to carry out economic and trade exchanges with foreign countries in accordance with the time-tested principle and policies of mutual benefit and hopes that all its economic and trade partners can also show respect for this spirit. China apparently wishes to bring a continued favorable turn to its economic and trade relations with the United States, including to renewal of its MFN trading status. However, such a relationship needs to be a long-lasting one, not simply one that is extended annually.
