Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas Ng told legislators they should aim to adopt the reforms before July in order to prepare for 1995 legislative polls -- the last before Hong Kong reverts to China in 1997. "The timetable is very tight... We must press ahead as quickly as we possibly can," he said. China ruled out any more talks with Britain on Hong Kong's political development after the Legislative Council, ignoring its fierce protests, adopted the first stage of Patten's reforms on February 23. Stage two calls for broadening the voting franchise in 1995 so that all 2.7 million workers in Hong Kong will be able to cast ballots for 30 seats reserved for special interest groups and industrial sectors. It would also make directly-elected district board members responsible for filling another 10 seats in the 60-seat legislature -- in which only 20 seats will be filled by direct election. Shortly before Wednesday's tabling, China's de facto consul-general in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, said they would make no difference to the way China will govern the thriving territory after 1997. "The Hong Kong British government can do whatever it likes... It's not at all surprising," he said in Beijing. Britain's ambassador to Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren, currently visiting Hong Kong, said he wished the row over Hong Kong's political future would not overshadow other 1997 issues. "Our wish is to resume cooperation in other areas," he said. The reforms' first stage, intended for local-level polls later this year, abolished appointed seats on municipal councils and district boards, lowered the minimum voting age from 21 to 18, and enshrined the principle of British-style, single-seat constituencies. Political analysts say Patten's reforms would tend to favor liberal politicians who are openly critical of communist-party rule in Beijing. Wednesday's tabling came a day before the opening in the Chinese capital of the annual National People's Congress, which last year mounted fierce attacks on Patten's policies.
