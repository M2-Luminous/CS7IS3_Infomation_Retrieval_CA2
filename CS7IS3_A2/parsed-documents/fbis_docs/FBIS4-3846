In an interview with the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY, the Russian minister stressed that the decision, made by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Thursday [21 April] on imposing ultimatum on Bosnian Serbs, accords with the U.N. demands. He said that the military leadership of the Bosnian Serbs has thrown down an criminal gauntlet to elementary norms of humanity, demands of the U.N. Security Council and Russia. However, Kozyrev pointed out that NATO should coordinate with U.N. Peacekeeping Forces and should not overstep the limits of the tasks aimed at protecting security in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
