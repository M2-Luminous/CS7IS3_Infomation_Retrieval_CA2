As a result, the assembly's plenary session opened one hour later than scheduled. Chairman of the assembly's council Vladimir Shumeyko reported that the delegations "could not achieve a consensus concerning one of the items in the agenda," noting that he "would not want to spread any information about the reasons for the disagreement." The representatives of the delegations from Armenia and Azerbaijan had entirely opposite opinions concerning the proposal. Therefore, the participants of the plenary meeting decided to ask the delegation heads to converse with their colleagues during the break and decide if it is worthwhile to leave the blockade issue in the agenda for the assembly's current session. Shumeyko expressed his opinion that everybody understands how difficult it is to resolve such questions. He said the assembly members had agreed to continue work on the blockade proposal and introduce it during the assembly's next meeting.
