Loboda, member of the CPSU since 1942: "People View Him as a Leader: A Few Words About Kim Chong-il"] [Text] A great deal of information is published all over the world these days about Kim Chong-il. Certain circles do not stint on throwing a dark cloud over him and attributing to him characteristics that do not evoke anything likeable. Who is he really, this person who has been placed in the highest positions in the Republic by the Korean Workers Party? Why do real communists look at him with hope and favor, and renegades with fear and loathing? Enemies of socialism are frightened because Kim Chong-il, a strong person with principles, embodies socialist strivings and the decisiveness of the Korean people, and he is a true son of the Korean people. They are frightened that every practical activity and theoretical work by Kim Chong-il expresses socialist ideas and the greatest strength of the Korean nation. His image has imbedded itself deeply into the consciousness of Koreans and has become as beloved to them as the image of his father. Foes are scared because in less than half a century the country, led by Kim Il-song, and in the last decades by Kim Chong-il, has become a reliable stronghold of socialism in our world. The invincible socialist system in the DPRK, a party that is true to communism, powerful armed forces, an impressive economy, and nationwide popular support of its leaders and a deep and sincere respect for them, have all become obvious facts. We see in the DPRK a new form of socialist organization for society and a country that has found its own road to socialism. Imperialists and their accomplices--renegades of every sort--are afraid of socialist Korea's influence on millions of people in this world. Together with Kim Chong-il, a new generation is taking over the leadership of the party and the country. Kim Chong-il has devoted a great deal of effort in bringing up and educating this generation. This generation has a passion for action and a zeal for new undertakings. It is against routine, sluggishness, inertia, and indecisiveness. The energy and initiative of this new generation are blended with the rich experience, knowledge, and prudence of its predecessors. History has given Kim Chong-il an enormous role, and at the same time a great responsibility, but not just for the future of his country. Pyongyang has become the center of unity for the world's socialist forces. The Pyongyang Declaration, which has already been accepted by over 200 political parties of the world, is having an ever greater influence over mankind. Everyone who has eyes can see how the forces of socialism are getting over the shock caused by the treachery of renegades, and how these socialist forces are growing in strength. Socialism now does not simply exist, but is fighting and winning. All this explains the increased interest in Kim Chong-il. Neither blockades nor outright bans can hide the truth about this leader and his written works. Every honest person sees the image of a man for whom the happiness and well-being of his people are more important than anything else in the world. From a very early age he devoted his life entirely to the cause of the revolution. In the quarter of a century since he finished his university studies, he has gone through all the stages of party organizational work and executive duties. He had started as a rank-and-file instructor in one of the departments of the Central Committee of the WPK [Workers' Party of Korea]. During these years he acquired a great deal of political experience. His family environment also facilitated his gaining this experience. Kim Chong-il did not become simply a successor to his father, Kim Il-song, but the continuator of his father's deeds. He kept up the creative development of communist theory in accordance with the new conditions that came about as a result of changes in society and society's scientific achievements, including the achievements of the Korean people, who belong to one of the oldest civilizations. This is why it is unthinkable to separate Kim Il-songism, as a science, from its continuator, Kim Chong-il. From the very beginning, Kim Chong-il attached great significance to moral education and to transforming all of society on the basis of the ideas of chuche. This was timely, not only because new tasks were arising in the process of building socialism but also because world imperialism was increasing its subversive work against the DPRK. In addition, it was necessary to make fundamental assessments of the activities of the renegades in the worldwide communist movement and to mercilessly expose the roots of this most harmful phenomenon. Efforts made in political-educational work, and the consolidation of a united ideological system in the party and among the people brought tangible results. Communist consciousness was raised and the productive initiative of the workers increased. Kim Chong-il has devoted many works to problems of ideology and the leading role of the WPK in ideology. It can be said about these works and their contents that they constitute a powerful attack against all forces of reaction, no matter under what false colors they are hiding. The correctness of the assessments and prognoses in these works has been confirmed by the entire course of development of both the DPRK and other countries. As a writer, I understand and embrace Kim Chong-il's contribution of every art form to leadership. It is difficult to even enumerate all his important theses presented during meetings with employees of motion pictures, writers, musicians, and artists. Kim Chong-il comprehensively enlightened the roles of these people and the intelligentsia in general in the building of socialism. He charted an original course for completing a radical revolution that guaranteed the present flowering of artistry in motion pictures, literature, the stage, and concert halls. In Kim Chong-il's pronouncements, especially those given to motion picture employees, the following theses can be noted: Art should not fear an exaggeration of the good, so that this good can become even better. Also, art should not fear an exaggeration of a bad, depraved person, so that this exaggeration can evoke repulsion and ignite a striving to eliminate everything hateful and shameful. Readers of Kim Chong-il's works are favorably impressed by the author's deep belief that by virtue of the objective laws of historical development, socialism cannot be destroyed by any alliances or blocs between renegades and imperialists. Day always triumphs over night. Kim Chong-il is convinced that gigantic forces are concealed within socialism, and that socialism is capable of creating the most just society about which the best minds of man have always dreamed. Kim Chong-il's works also clearly demonstrate comprehensive understanding that in given circumstances certain things for which there is enough strength can be done and should be done. The leader of the Korean people has proclaimed himself uncompromising, he will not make concessions concerning principles and problems on which the fate of the nation and the success of socialism depend. It is not in his character to turn down plans that had been approved, no matter how difficult they may be. Kim Chong-il is convinced that every person, even one who believes himself to be weak, has hidden strength and potential. In order to bring them out, it is necessary for a person to understand that he has them, and it is necessary to motivate him with the all-conquering ideas of chuche. Kim Chong-il is characterized by the strength of his mind and his penetrating knowledge that allows him to quickly and faultlessly analyze events, tell the difference between people, and to assess everyone and use everyone in accordance with his abilities. He openly talks about shortcomings and errors, being convinced that the right way does not need to hide anything and does not need to distort facts. And there is something else: Kim Chong-il expresses his thoughts in speaking and writing always in the most precise, direct, clear, and short form. His analyses are penetrating. His conclusions are based on facts. He expresses his thoughts simply, convincingly, and spiritedly. This is because Kim Chong-il frequently mixes with people from very different professions, acquiring from them the habit for this style. Notwithstanding his immense popularity among his people and the respect given him in the DPRK, he has remained a modest and unpretentious man, fierce and implacable towards his foes, but touchingly attentive to his comrades and to working people. Kim Chong-il presents identical moral criteria to himself and to the rank-and-file. He believes that there should be no privileges or exceptions for anyone with regard to morality. Kim Chong-il's theory and practice, based on the great ideas of chuche, are highly valued and approved by the world communist movement. He is seen as a true communist leader who is firm and independent, and who can resolve the most revolutionary problems out of all the problems that now face the revolutionaries of the world. Kim Chong-il is the hope not only of Koreans, but all other progressive peoples of this world.
