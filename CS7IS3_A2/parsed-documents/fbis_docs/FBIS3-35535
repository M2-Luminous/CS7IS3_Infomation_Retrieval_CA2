The Islamic Resistance Movement put all its militants "on a maximum state of alert" and called on them "to retaliate as hard as possible to avenge the slaughter in Hebron." In a statement to AFP here, Hamas said that "emergency military plans were put in place to strike at Zionist targets, occupation soldiers and settlers." It also declared that the massacre had dealt a "fatal blow" to the peace process. Hamas has been at the forefront of attacks on Jews in the occupied territories since the PLO signed its peace deal with Israel in Washington in September.
