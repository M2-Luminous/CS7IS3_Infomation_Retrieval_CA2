He added: The government's dialogue with political parties and youth of various tendencies as well as with any group or individual, regardless of their inclination, is a good thing. It is required for each side to listen to the views of the others in the interest of the country, presuming that the intentions are sincere. Asked how the youth branded as "extremists" could be represented in the national dialogue, the mufti said: The important thing is to start the dialogue. As for the question of how, this could be judged by the competent experts who will send the invitation. It is worth noting that the mufti took part in a seminar held at Cairo University on Wednesday. He stressed that all religions oppose injustice, whether it is done by the ruler or the ruled, noting that corruption cases are widespread in society.
