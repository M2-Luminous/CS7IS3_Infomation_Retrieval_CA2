According to him, the human rights of Muslims are being violated in Kashmir. His advisors are apparently giving him inaccurate reports. The fact is that Pakistani terrorists are destroying democracy in Kashmir and are committing horrible atrocities against Hindus to establish an Islamic feudal government. Even Hitler did not commit such atrocities against the Jews. The truth is that Hindus are being totally obliterated in Kashmir. When the terrorists take hold of an Indian soldier, they take out his eyes, amputate his hands, feet, nose, and ears, and leave him to die. Some Indian soldiers acted in retaliation. If such atrocities were committed against U. S. soldiers, would the U.S. President remain quiet in the name of human rights? Mr. Clinton should help the world's largest democracy and peace-loving country, India, stop terrorism instead of helping a country that is increasing terrorism and the drug trade all over the world. It is important to let Mr. Clinton know that after independence, India appointed a Muslim president, governors, and chief ministers. Pakistan and Bangladesh, however, have not even given Hindus the right to vote. They are not even permitted to worship. Their democratic and human rights are being violated. In India, we grant special privileges to Muslims, which the Hindus here do not have. We have passed minority protection laws. In order to help Muslims get education and employment, the government is sending millions of rupees. The Shankaracharya of Shringeri said in an interview that it is the blood of Hindus that runs in the veins of Muslims. The Indian Government spent about 750 billion rupees on the Kashmiri people over the last 45 years. Because of the hundreds of privileges, the population of Muslims in India has increased from 30 million to 120 million since independence. In Pakistan, however, because of the atrocious rule there, the number of Hindus has fallen from 10 million to only 1 million. Hindus are also disappearing from Kashmir and Bangladesh. Such genocide has never happened anywhere else in the world. The Hindu society, because of its love for peace and tolerance, has suffered atrocities for thousands of years. In this context, we are appealing to the president of the most powerful country in the world to take the initiative of protecting India, which has done so much work to increase peace and spirituality in the world. Former U. S. Presidents Kennedy and Carter understood this very well. In order to stop terrorism in Kashmir, the whole world will have to speak out against it. Therefore, we are requesting that the Pope and Mother Teresa speak against it, so that truth and non-violence will win. *
