The demands by Unionist MPs followed Foreign Office disclosures that the Iranian intelligence service had been assisting the terrorists. But Iran's charge d'affaires in London strongly denied his country supplied either money or weapons. "There is absolutely no contact between the intelligence services of our country and the IRA," Gholam Reza Ansari told a news conference. He was summoned to the Foreign Office earlier today for a 10-minute dressing down from Minister of State Douglas Hogg, in which it was made clear the flow of cash to terrorist coffers must cease. A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are convinced that there have been contacts between Iranian intelligence and the IRA. We take the gravest view of any contact which might assist or encourage terrorism." The row marked a downturn in Anglo-Iranian relations already soured by the long-running dispute over Ayatollah Khomeyni's "fatwa" calling for the death of Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie. It also raised disturbing questions about the IRA's continuing ability to attract support for its campaign of violence from overseas backers. The Foreign Office's analysis was greeted with scepticism in Dublin, where Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he knew nothing of reported links between Iran and the IRA. "I do not accept any part of the allegations until they are established." In London, furious Unionist MPs called for tough measures against Tehran. The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said: "I have no doubt that international terrorists and these countries that are really led by terrorists are all in cahoots." He added: "If the Iranian Government doesn't break off its relations and show true repentance, sanctions should be imposed on Iran. There is no difference between a government like Iraq killing people and Iran supplying arms to terrorists to kill people. They are both equally guilty." David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said: "Merely slapping their wrists isn't going to be enough. They should be looking at economic and diplomatic measures to make life uncomfortable for the Iranian regime." The matter was also raised by Popular Unionist Sir James Kilfedder (Down N) in the Commons during Northern Ireland questions. The decision to publicly upbraid the Iranians followed publication of reports in Greek and Middle Eastern newspapers, although officials said they had had "conclusive" evidence of the links for some time. A Government spokesman said in what was thought to be a reference to the intelligence services MI5 and MI6: "The Government has reason to believe from independent information that these reports were accurate." According to one Greek press report, Iranian representatives met the IRA in a number of European countries. Cash was handed over and arms were said to have been promised. The report named an Iranian official, Amir Hoseyn Taghavi, said to be the head of the Western European Department of the Iranian Intelligence Ministry, as being involved in the discussions. Mr. Ansari said Mr. Taghavi's name was raised by Mr. Hogg during their meeting today. The disclosures came at a time of intensified terrorist violence in Northern Ireland, with eight killings in the province in the last eight days. They also followed a crackdown on the IRA's racketeering activities, which provide much of the funding for its campaign. In the past the IRA has looked to sympathisers in the United States and Libya for cash and weapons, so there was little surprise among terrorism experts that it had reportedly extended its links to Tehran. Paul Wilkinson, professor of international relations at St. Andrew's University, said: "The IRA is always looking around for arms and cash from a state like Iran that has been involved in terrorism." Dr. Conor Gearty, a reader of law at King's College, London, said there was a long history of commercial links between Iran and the Irish Republic. "This is not a great surprise. This link with Iran must have come from intelligence," he said. "It would have been logical for the IRA to have sought help from Iran. Look how well they did out of their links with Libya. It would be a case of `England's enemy is the IRA's friend.'"
