Those who are perpetrating this criminal act know long-range missile attacks will never affect the current military situation or the outcome of the military operations raging only a few kilometers from Aden, where the gang of secession and apostasy is standing in trenches. The only option for this gang is to surrender, leave the homeland and enjoy the public funds it has looted, or commit suicide. Despite the fact that the missiles have harmed a number of citizens, martyring some of them in the capital, Sanaa, and in the city of Ta'izz, they have not adversely affected the psyche of the forces struggling to protect unity and defend constitutional legitimacy. This is because the forces of unity have a human and geographic depth, thus making them more steadfast and stronger. Moreover, all members of these forces enjoy resolve and unwavering faith in victory. We say without exaggeration that the cowardly missile attacks on the capital, Sanaa, and on Ta'izz will only increase the determination of the sons of our proud Armed Forces to move forward until they arrest the rebellious gang of apostasy and secession. These forces are struggling for unity and for defending Constitutional legitimacy. The people's sons are waiting to hold this gang to account for what it deserves for the crimes it has committed against the people and their resources. The missile attacks on the capital, Sanaa, and on Ta'izz have revealed both the impotence and the grudge of the gang of apostasy and secession. This gang knows well that these missiles cannot affect the course and results of the military operations whose theaters have approached the outskirts of Aden. [passage omitted]
