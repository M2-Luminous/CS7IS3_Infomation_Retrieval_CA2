The agreement to build partnership relations with Russia, which has now been made, is an important building block in the efforts to establish cooperative security structures for all of Europe, Kinkel said in Bonn. The goal is to interlace closely the existing institutions and structures. In a network of relations, all institutions -- NATO just as the CSCE, Western European Union, and European Union -- can contribute their respective, very own advantages, the minister said.
