According to a letter circulated by the presidential office, it is being done because Russian President Boris Yeltsin's order on military bases has not been repealed at a level requested by Latvia. Ulmanis points out in the letter that because of this, his meeting with the Russian president is impossible in the nearest future. At the moment the signing of the initialled agreements in their present form is not possible either. The Latvian president considers that discussions with the governing coalition are evidence that there is no unanimity among the deputies on the issue of the initialled agreements. I consider that the above-mentioned circumstances are substantial for the Saeima presidium to satisfy my request, the end of the letter reads. In connection with the fact that the state president has revoked, and the prime minister cancelled the request to convene the Saeima extraordinary session on 15 April this year, the Saeima presidium has stated that there is no longer a legal basis for the convention of such an extraordinary session.
