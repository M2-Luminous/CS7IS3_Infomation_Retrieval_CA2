The parties have yet to designate Cardoso's running mate, on the grounds that the alliance does not focus on specific names but on a program of government. The presidents of the three parties reiterated that the alliance focuses on a program of government, not on names, adding that the starting point is the program of the PSDB. The PFL, however, made suggestions that will be included in the government proposal. PSDB President Tasso Jereissati said the three parties have formed an alliance to provide conditions for governing the country. Senator Cardoso said the alliance does not just seek to win elections but to implement a joint government, adding that he expects other parties to join the alliance. He said: [Begin Cardoso recording] I have talked a lot with [Social Workers Party President] Alvaro Dias and we might reach agreement, if not at a national level at least in several states -- like in Brasilia, where talks are on an advanced stage. I believe we will be able to do the same thing in other regions too. Alvaro Dias will run for the post of governor in Parana. I told him that my party has joined other parties that have their own candidates, thus I can continue to communicate and personally support him. [end recording] After formalizing the alliance, the presidents of the PTB, PSDB, and PFL met at Senator Jose Eduardo Vieira's office to discuss the campaign strategy.
