(10) REA intends that the optical fibers contained in the cables manufactured in accordance with this section have characteristics that will allow signals, having a range of wavelengths, to be carried simultaneously. (b) Optical fibers. (1) The solid glass optical fibers must consist of a cylindrical core and cladding covered by either an ultraviolet-cured acrylate or other suitable coating. (2) The optical fiber types must be one of the following: (i) Dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber EIA Class IVa; (ii) Dispersion-shifted single mode fiber EIA Class IVb; (iii) 50/125 micrometer multimode fiber EIA Class Ia; or (iv) 62.5/125 micrometer multimode fiber EIA Class Ia. (3) The dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber core must have either a matched or depressed clad step refractive index profile with a mode-field diameter of 9.0 # 1.0 micrometers when measured at 1300 nanometers and 10.5+1.0 micrometers/^1.5 micrometers when measured at 1550 nanometers in accordance with any one of the following test methods: (i) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;164A; (ii) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;165A; (iii) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;167A; or (iv) EIA&hyph;455&hyph;174. (4) The dispersion-shifted single mode fiber core must have either a segmented core design or depressed clad step refractive index profile with a mode-field diameter of 7.5+1.5 micrometers/^1.3 micrometers when measured at 1550 nanometers in accordance with any one of the test procedures specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (5) The core clad off-set of the dispersion-unshifted and dispersion-shifted single mode fibers must not be greater than 1.0 micrometer when measured in accordance with either EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;45B or EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;176. (6) The multimode fiber cores must have graded (parabolic) refractive index profiles with core diameters of 50.0 # 3.0 micrometers or 62.5 # 3.0 micrometers when measured in accordance with either EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;58A, or EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;176. (7) The core noncircularity of multimode fibers must not exceed 6 percent when measured in accordance with either EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;45B or EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;176. (8) The outside diameter of the glass fiber for both single mode and multimode fibers must be 125 # 2.0 micrometers when measured in accordance with any one of the following test methods: (i) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;45B; (ii) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;176; or (iii) EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;48B, Methods A or B. (9) The outside diameter of the glass fiber must be nominally concentric with the fiber core as is consistent with the best commercial practice. (10) The individual fibers must be proof tested at a minimum tensile stress of 0.35 gigapascal for approximately one second when measured in accordance with EIA/TIA&hyph;455&hyph;31B.
