The task of deploying the Russian blue helmets along the demarcation lines has been drawn to a close, and the remaining Serbian heavy weaponry has been moved. Obviously, the moments of high tension are over. The media event of the day was the news conference of the Srpska republic's political leadership. Numerous correspondents asked some 20 questions, most of which were addressed to president Karadzic. The situation around Sarajevo was the center of attention, primarily as the first step, the future model for solving the remaining crisis points. Commenting on this, Radovan Karadzic stressed that the Serbian side has proposed to Akashi to continue this peace process -- particularly in the case of Tuzla -- which was a subject that interested many foreign correspondents. In reply to a question about Russia's return to the great diplomatic scene, Radovan Karadzic said: [Begin Karadzic recording] I believe that it was completely unnatural that Russia had been absent from all these tasks, and I think that the West had forgotten that Russia is a great country and a great power, and now it was reminded of this fact in the best possible way. We are ready to swiftly continue -- in cooperation with primarily Russia, followed by Greece and Great Britain -- and we are ready to include or accept France and the United States into this cooperation. [sentence as heard] [end recording] Serbian heavy artillery and information on how much has been done regarding its withdrawal elicited a brief but precise answer from president Karadzic. Over 50 percent of the weaponry has been withdrawn to outside the 20-km exclusion zone, while the rest has been placed under UN control. As soon as weather conditions permit, we will withdraw these weapons as well, replied Karadzic. As far as the continuation of the Geneva negotiations is concerned, the president of the Srpska republic said that the negotiations now depend on the cochairmen's ambitions and the readiness of the other two warring sides. We shall discuss exchange of territory, but Sarajevo will remain divided into two neighboring cities, said Radovan Karadzic at a news conference held this afternoon. We have also noted a significant assessment by the Srpska republic military leadership regarding the ultimatum. General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of the Srpska republic army's general staff, said today that the Serbs had carried out their part of the bargain. What has been done around Sarajevo has been done in the best possible way. The combat readiness of the Sarajevo Corps has not been endangered by this, said General Milovanovic.
