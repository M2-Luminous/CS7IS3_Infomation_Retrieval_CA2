At least those who followed along with the activities of the Latvia Committee of the Citizen's Congress noticed him. That is why it is unusual to acknowledge that very little is known about Janis Straume. The day that I understood why that was so I decided to reveal it to him. [Egle] You smile so rarely and often appear a bit angry. You should not do that, otherwise journalists will be afraid to address you. [Straume] That is true. I have often been criticized for being gloomy. Some people in the faction have said that a politician must be more loose. But I am by nature rather closed and truly smile only rarely. I do not like loud and bravura-like conversations. Changing my nature now is difficult. It would be a question of training. [Egle] Synthesizing your open essence with the ideas you started out with, one might guess about your past. You, of course, have never been, for instance, a Komsomol member? [Straume] I really have never been that. [Egle] A dissident? [Straume] No, a hooligan. [Egle] That, too, might be interesting. Tell us about it! [Straume] That was in 1978 in Sigulda, where we, three like-minded fellows, established a nationally-oriented little group, which occupied itself with preparing various proclamations to inform the inhabitants of Sigulda about those things that everyone today knows about. [Egle] Who were your like-minded friends and what are they doing now? [Straume] One was my friend from childhood and Klavs Elsbergs prize winner, the poet Edvins Raups. I do not know anything about the further course of the other, Juris Vaiders. [Egle] How old were you then? [Straume] Fifteen. For half a year we worked successfully, not getting caught either with the "dictation" of school administrators, for in those leaflets each one of us wrote one letter and the Chekha could not make anything out from our handwriting. Later we became careless and began writing out leaflets in our own handwriting. Then there was another dictation and within a week we all were taken in. [Egle] But you said that you were a hooligan? [Straume] With the leaflets we were able to educate people, not draw attention to ourselves. That is why we rather childishly occupied ourselves with breaking windows. [Egle] What system determined which windows you chose? [Straume] We were breaking those in the apartments of party functionaries. And to a large degree that saved us. All three of us were tried for hooliganism with a prison sentence of one year, suspended. No political leaflets figured into this matter. [Egle] Do you remember the name of the judge? How would you proceed if you had to vote in the Saeima to confirm him? [Straume] The judge was Voldemars Subrovskis, currently the chairman of the judges' association. The Saeima has already voted on him. I do not regard it as possible to vote to confirm for life tenure any judge, with the current judicial system and the associated legal disorder. [Egle] How did you know the truth that needed to be told to people when you were fifteen years old? [Straume] It is in my genes. All of my closest relations, mother, her brothers, grandmother and grandfather, were exiled to Siberia. When I was three years old my father perished under mysterious circumstances which are still unclear, while he was a draftee in the Soviet army. I was often told that this regime is unbreakable, that I should not resist. Those close to me wanted to shield me, but that only gave rise to the opposite effect. At night I read the real books and I knew what I had to fight for. [Egle] Did holding consistant ideas cause difficulties after finishing school? [Straume] Thanks to school principal, Valdis Jekabsons, my record did not include the fact that I was tried and after high school I enrolled in the Riga Institute of Medicine. In my first course, in the first semester I was the only non-Komsomolist and the only honors student. And then certain problems did indeed arise. [Egle] What sort? [Straume] Attempts to recruit me as a Chekha informer began. I was summoned seemingly to see the Rector, then the responsible official reminded me of my past and said that in my road to advancement I was accepted to the institute and now I ought not abuse the hospitality. That very night I called together my group members, those closest friends at the institute, and told them everything so that they would know, if anything happened to me, if I was thrown out of school, why it was done. And with that it all ended, for the information obviously was broadcast back. [Egle] So you graduated from the institute? [Straume] Yes, and with a clear conscience. I have worked for ten years in medicine. When the Awakening began and I started to look for contacts among people who were working in the "Helsinki" group and the LNIM [Latvian National Independence Movement], then I worked at Riga Municipal Clinical Hospital No. 3 as a functional diagnostic doctor and later at the Republic of Latvia's Diagnostic Center I specialized as an endoscopic doctor. Until the elections I worked in medicine and now I am surprised that it is rather easy to survive the interruption of medical practice. [Egle] Was it easy to mix it with political activity earlier? [Straume] I would not want to connect my life with politics completely and I hope to return to medicine. My political biography begins with activity in the LNIM, when I was the movement's Sigulda area chairman. To bring together people who stood against Soviet power, both the "Helsinki-ists" and the the LNIM, it was acknowledged: It was necessary to organize a political party. Thus was born the Republican party of Latvia, which in the Citizens Congress elections won quite a few mandates, although it had only a small organization. The next fact worthy of mention was connected to the establishment of the 18 November Union, which united part of the Republican party and the radical wing of the PFL [Popular Front of Latvia], which left the Front. [Egle] Until the second congress you were the chairman of the 18 November Union? [Straume] Yes. Now we elected Maris Grinblats. Among other things we and Maris are helped in the parliament by the experience we gained in the Citizens Congress. That provided the opportunity also to understand the parliamentary work style, which was well organized in the Citizens Congress. It is interesting that there in the beginning I was in the opposition, as a member of the Republican party, but later I was in a leadership post. Along with that it is clear that one must function in one instance, as in the other and the process in the parliament does not cause alarm. [Egle] You do not make speeches in the Saeima very often, but when you do the speeches are well prepared. Is it true that they are written by your assistant, Aigars Jirgens? [Straume] That is a provocative question. We all write our own speeches, but I would not want to deny that Aigars Jirgens helps to prepare them, for the faction practices collective work, that before any speeches are made, bills proposed to [Saeima] commissions, etc, they are carefully prepared and discussed, including my speeches. I must also remind you that Maris Grinblats and Aigars Jirgens have had authority already since the time of the Citizens Congress. [Egle] Why did you decide to work in the Saeima's State Administration and Local Government Commission? [Straume] There are only six deputies in our faction and we selected the six most important commissions. [Egle] So, you do not have any experience in local government work? [Straume] I have experience with the Citizens Congress internal affairs commission. I must add that "For Fatherland and Freedom" already had many proposed laws already drafted, with which we arrived at the Saeima, and many of them must be reviewed in the State Administration and Local Government Commission, which is why it is good that someone from the faction participates in its work. [Egle] Was the commission also given the "Fatherlanders'" project regarding limitations on appointments to posts? [Straume] The State Administration and Local Government Commission, it seems, was the only one that voted that this kind of law limiting posts is necessary. The Saeima majority, as is known, had other ideas. But we will return again to this question, when the Saeima begins reviewing the proposed law on State Civil Service on its second reading. If there are no such limitations and a mechanism prepared for implementation, the state administration reform, about which much is being said, is also impossible. [Egle] "For Fatherland and Freedom" is criticized for getting carried away with political "limitations" at a time when people are concerned with economic and social questions. [Straume] The basis of state development is, after all, political issues. But our faction is also concerned with economic problems. Recently Roberts Zile returned from an assignment in Australia; he is a non-voting member of our faction's Economic Commission. There is a work group that is working also on the question of taxes. But we cannot come forward with our ideas right now because we have already experienced the governing coalition stealing the ideas of others and offering them as their own. [Egle] Could you tell us specifically what you have accomplished in the legislative process? [Straume] No one is permitted to loaf in our faction, everyone must do something. I could mention that I submitted about 20 proposals pertaining to the proposed law on city council, district council and township council elections, many of which were adopted. Thus, for example, the number of deputies in the Riga council was increased from 45 (as found in the proposed law) to 60. [Egle] They say that your faction is almost the only one in the Saeima that does not have internal discord. Do you really not argue in your closed sessions? [Straume] But that is why those are closed sessions, so that we can argue it out and afterwords come forward with one position. We truly strive to announce ourselves as a collective, and, if that succeeds, then we will be able to thank mainly Maris Grinblats, our faction chairman. [Egle] You yourself feel good in the Saeima? [Straume] Yes, and why not? But I hope that I never "get glued" to this chair. I have adapted to the environment, but I strive to mobilize myself, so that the routine does not become too pleasant. In my free moments I think about what has happened in the Saeima and I always remind myself why I came here.
