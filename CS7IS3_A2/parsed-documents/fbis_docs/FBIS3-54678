The Azerbaijani Army used insolent force against the representatives of the Armenian leadership, the Georgian experts, and the security forces who had gone to repair the gas pipeline that was blown up on 24 December in the Azeri-inhabited region in Georgia's Marneulinskiy Rayon, north of Armenia. In this way, the Azerbaijani Army virtually prevented the start of repair work on the gas pipeline. The Armenian Government views this action as a gross interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. Such interference creates tension that is fraught with new and unpredictable consequences for the region. The Government of the Armenian Republic hopes that the Georgian authorities will take the appropriate measures to prevent infringements by the Azerbaijani side and that the Azerbaijani leadership will refrain from carrying out acts of sabotage in another country that directly affect Armenia's vital interests.
