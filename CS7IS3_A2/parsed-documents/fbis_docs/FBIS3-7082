Laos' economic foundations have made impressive advancement, while the living conditions of the multiethnic people have improved. The political stability of the country has been steadily maintained and the national defense and public security maintenance work has been further consolidated. As a result, the influence of the Lao People's Democratic Republic has been further elevated in this region and the world over. These successes have made noble contributions to the common struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and social progress of the world's people.

For this exuberant celebration, we hope that the Lao people will further expand their glorious revolutionary traditions by uniting with one another to carry out the comprehensive restructuring in accordance with the resolution adopted at the Fifth LPRP Congress, thereby fulfilling the task of building Laos with peace, independence, democracy, unification, and prosperity.
