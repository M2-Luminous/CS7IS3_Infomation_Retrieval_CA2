Spread over two phases, the exercises involve Pakistan Navy destroyers, submarines, missile carriers, oil and supply vessels, military aircraft, helicopters, and ground units. Following the first phase, exercises will be held in the open sea. These types of exercises are essential in assessing the performance of the armed forces during peacetime, especially in a situation where the future intentions of our neighbor India -- which has embarked on aggression against Pakistan twice in the past -- do not seem that good. India is persistently pursuing a naval buildup. Not only is the Indian Navy several times bigger than the Pakistan Navy, it also possess a nuclear submarine force. India dreams of becoming a regional superpower. Therefore, the Pakistan Navy needs to be equipped with more powerful and modern weapons so we will not have to hope for the arrival of any fleet in the Indian Ocean, as we did during the 1971 war. Chinese, Swedish, and French offers for the sale of three new submarines are now under consideration by the Pakistani Government, but the Defense Ministry has yet to make any decision on them. A delegation of Swedish military authorities is currently visiting Pakistan along with a naval ship. The delegation will brief Pakistan Navy authorities on the new Swedish T-96 submarines. The Swedish offer includes full funding and complete transfer of technology. France also wants to transfer technology. Its submarines also possess destructive power. China is a friendly country, but it does not have modern technology. It is hoped that the Defense Ministry will keep national interests in view and make a decision, so that the goal of equipping the Navy with the most modern weapons and equipment can be achieved in the shortest possible time. The military buildup currently being pursued by India is definitely a matter of concern for Pakistan and other small countries in the region. Poverty in India is more intense than in Pakistan. Its population, already 10 times bigger than that of Pakistan, is growing rapidly. What is strange is that instead of taking steps to alleviate the suffering and poverty of its masses, the Indian leadership is spending more money on military preparations. In fact, the Indian leaders consider themselves the successors to British rule. Not only do they want to establish their hegemony in this region, they want to maintain it by increasing their weaponry and military might. Pakistan is undoubtedly a developing country. Its people are backward; therefore more funds need to be spent on their economic development. It is a fact, however, that Pakistan spends comparatively less on defense than India. Pakistan cannot disregard its defense. India's aggressive seizure of Kashmir and its atrocities against unarmed Kashmiris pose a great danger to peace in South Asia. The big powers should realize the threat posed by India's increasing military might and the danger the countries of the region are facing, including Pakistan. The Indian threat to peace in South Asia is always increasing. Given India's already formidable military power and its ever-increasing additions to it, Pakistan cannot curtail its defense budget. India's military strength is a permanent threat to Pakistan's security and defense. The Pakistan Government has justifiably decided to increase its defense budget, matching the increase in India's defense budget and buildup. In this context, the government has also decided to curtail governmental expenditures. Authorities say that taxes and revenues amounting to 180 billion rupees will be collected before the budget so as to reduce the budget deficit. The government has also directed that few taxes be imposed in the budget. It is hoped that the government's steps will yield gratifying results.
