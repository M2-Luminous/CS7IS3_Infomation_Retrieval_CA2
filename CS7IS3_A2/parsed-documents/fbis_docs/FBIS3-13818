In a letter to President Bill Clinton, Olmert said he was disappointed that the U.S. did not veto the Security Council resolution, which contains references to East Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories. The United States voted in support of the resolution, but abstained on citations referring to the status of Jerusalem.
