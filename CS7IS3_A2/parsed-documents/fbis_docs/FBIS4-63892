The expert is now attending the U.N. disarmament conference in Hiroshima. He explained his point of view by the specifics of the nuclear technology used by North Korea. Even if IAEA inspectors get access to the nuclear wastes and to the rods of the reactors supposedly used for the development of atomic weapons, even if they get a chance to analyse these materials, they will not be able to decide for sure whether Pyongyang is developing a nuclear bomb or not," the expert stated. In his opinion, this explains North Korea's stand on the inspection of its nuclear facilities. "If North Korea allows the IAEA to carry out a thorough inspection," he said, "this will only increase suspicions that Pyongyang is hiding something from the international community, because IAEA experts will not be able to arrive at any definite conclusion." The Russian expert believes that suspicions about North Korea's efforts to develop nuclear weapons could be fully dispelled or, on the contrary, confirmed only if a representative international team of experts would carry out a lasting and broad examination of North Korean nuclear facilities, tantamount to permanent control over them, which should continue for several months. "The several days, during which a IAEA inspection will last, cannot resolve the problem of North Korea's nuclear programme," he noted. Stressing that this was merely his personal opinion, the expert said that he doubted very much the existence of nuclear weapons in North Korea today. "This is why it is necessary to continue the efforts to solve this problem through a dialogue with Pyongyang, and not by means of punitive sanctions against the Korean People's Democratic Republic," he stated.
