Even Altero Matteoli, [National Alliance leader] Fini's political arm in the Berlusconi government had to pay the score of being right-wing in a Europe that was left-wing before 12 June. However, the pre-election controversy, unleashed from abroad by the socialists, ended up in a celebration as the current holder of the Environment Ministry tells IL GIORNALE for the first time. "It was the Belgian colleague, but not the usual Di Rupo, to state his concern over the safeguarding of democracy in a `Community country' during the meeting in Luxembourg," reminded Matteoli. "When my turn came, I answered as I should have answered him. All the more that U.S. President Clinton had just met with leading exponents of National Alliance. The British minister gave me his solidarity immediately. Then we all went to lunch, including the `contester'..." [Guiglia] How can somebody who is against the Greens be an environment minister? [Matteoli] He can, of course he can. I have nothing against the Greens. Rather, I have good relations with some of them because I have been a parliamentarian for four legislatures and we have often worked shoulder to shoulder. What I do criticize instead is their purely ideological way of facing environmental problems. Some see my ministry as being like a bunker, inside which I must defend myself in order to say no to everything. But how can you do this? The Greens have brought the ecological issue to the attention of everybody. This is an undeniable historical merit. Today they seem to be like the Northern League: They have lost their "propulsive thrust" to change after having given an important pushover to the First Republic. [Guiglia] Which are the environmental emergencies of the Second Republic? [Matteoli] Coastal erosion, the pollution of the sea and rivers. My great bet is making the fish return to the Tiber River. The British succeeded with the Thames; we will succeed as well. [Guiglia] And what about the Right's challenge to the progressive mayor of Italy's capital city? [Matteoli] Let us put it this way, I think that [Rome Mayor] Rutelli himself will willingly accept the challenge. You see, however, in the past I had already attempted to create a parliamentary commission of investigation into the Arno river. There was nothing to be done. Now, however, I will return to the charge. I am strengthening the NOC. [Guiglia] The what? [Matteoli] NOC, the Operational Nucleus of the Military Police. We have about 80 in Rome and seven -- I repeat, seven -- in Milan and Naples. I want to upgrade them. I want to discover who pollutes the small and larger rivers in Italy and how, where, and when they do it. [Guiglia] When there was too much smog the mayors stopped the traffic circulating on Sundays. Does the minister agree? [Matteoli] It is a fanciful measure. After having induced the Italians to buy one or two automobiles per person, we are now exhorting them not to use them. The problem lies at the source: We need car parks. At least in part, and with other measures, they could resolve the matter. [Guiglia] Can nuclear energy return in Italy? [Matteoli] There are contrasting positions in Europe. The United Kingdom wants more nuclear power plants, Spain wants less. We missed the nuclear energy train 15 years ago. Reproposing it today would be useless and outdated, despite the merits. However, Italy would do well to continue studies on the topic. We spent 17 trillion lire for Montaldo di Castro [nuclear power plant].
