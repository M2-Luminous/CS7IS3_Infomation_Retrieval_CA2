SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By a decision served February 11, 1993, the Commission instituted an oversight plan that allows us to monitor effectively the competitive results of Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation's (WCTC) continuance in control of Fox Valley and Western Ltd. (FV&W). 1 As detailed in the decision, the oversight covers 5 years and contains five elements: Notification of shippers, reporting by applicants, discussion with selected parties, proceeding, and staff report. Commission staff has been actively monitoring the transaction since its consummation on August 28, 1993. 1 This transaction was approved by decision served December 10, 1992, which was corrected by a decision served December 22, 1992. See Wisc. Central Transportation Corporation, et al., 9 I.C.C.2d 233 (1992). On December 30, 1992, Chicago and North Western Transportation Company (CNW) petitioned the Commission to reopen the proceeding. CNW argued that the Commission materially erred in its competitive impact analysis and in its failure to impose any of CNW's proposed remedial conditions. By decision served July 23, 1993, the petition to reopen was denied. See Wisc. Central Transportation Corporation, et al., 9 I.C.C.2d 730 (1993). This notice announces the decision to initiate the fourth element of this year's oversight function_the proceeding. In the February 11 decision, the Commission stated that a proceeding would be conducted annually during which applicants, shippers, and other interested parties may express their views on the competitive impacts of the transaction and on appropriate conditions to remedy any substantial anticompetitive effects. This proceeding is a fact-finding mechanism and will not necessarily result in a formal ruling. This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. The decision is being served on all persons appearing on the service list in Finance Docket No. 32036. Decided: April 28, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, Commissioners Simmons and Philbin. Commissioner Philbin was absent and did not participate in the disposition of this proceeding.
