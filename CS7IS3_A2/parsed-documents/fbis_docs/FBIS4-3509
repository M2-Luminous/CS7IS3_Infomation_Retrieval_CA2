Only one day after the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) and Meeting Point announced their merger to form a new prodemocracy flagship, several parties have shown interest in at least cooperating with the new party. The vice-chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL), Leung Kwong-cheung, said his group informed Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung yesterday that they would be interested in taking part in the preparation for the Democratic Party. Mr Leung quoted Mr Cheung as saying he would consider the ADPL's proposal but did not say when he would give a reply. He said the ADPL had started consulting its members about a possible move to join the new party. The Hong Kong Democratic Foundation (HKDF) chairman Patrick Shiu Kin-ying said he had also started consulting members about joining the new party. He said the idea of merging with other democratic parties had been been raised a few months ago but was shelved because there had been divergent voices within the group. Admitting that some members preferred to join the pro-China Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, rather than the "subversive" UDHK, Mr Shiu expected that their worries in cooperating with the new party would be eased. "The composition of the new party will successfully break Chinese isolation to the pro- democracy bloc. I am very optimistic that members will receive it with great interest," he said. However, he said the HKDF would have to decide in what form it would join the Democratic Party. He said it was possible that the HKDF would remain as a separate entity and take the role of a think tank and a support group for the new party. The newly formed 123 Democratic Alliance has not decided whether to join the Democratic Party, but will continue to look at the development of the local political scene. Vice-chairman Willy Ng Wai-cho said the alliance however, did not rule out the possibility of joining the Democratic Party. The Hong Kong Affairs Society chairman Gerry Wai Ka-cheung said he would support its members joining the Democratic Party.
