The Presidential Team Is Unhappy That the October Prisoners Were Released at the Onset of Spring"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Apparently the president, who Monday evening was planing to speak on TV, promulgating a certain edict, mothballed himself and some of his aides in the October environment. According to some reports, the proposed edict did not contain any specific tough measures, but its very tone was fairly menacing. According to one account, it was the unspecific and menacing verbiage of the edict that disappointed the president and resulted in cancellation of his TV appearance. There is also another version. Boris Yeltsin's readiness to make a speech and the draft edict were used to bring pressure to bear on the Duma chairman and consequently on its deputies in the course of his evening meeting with Filatov, Satarov, Ilyushenko, and Yakovlev. Rybkin, however, apparently managed to propose to his guests a certain option, even if not very radical, to defuse the situation: that all power bodies, politicians, and political movements sign a joint memorandum on responsibility for the breach of civic peace in the country. Such a document was to be prepared by a working group including representatives of the Duma, the Prosecutor's Office, and the president. So far it is not known which credible guarantees that the Duma will assume part of its responsibility, including for the political conduct of the amnestied, that Ivan Rybkin managed to provide to the president's "right- and left-hand men." The fact that some guarantees were given, however, is confirmed indirectly by the words by a Duma apparatus officer who stated that the guests "came with one opinion but left with quite another." Yet there is no certainty whatsoever that the lower chamber will want to vote for a memorandum on responsibility. First, this is not so essential now that the objective -- freeing the "Lefortovo inmates" -- has been accomplished. Second, to assume political responsibility for the actions, say, of Aleksandr Rutskoy is absolutely not in the interests of the communists or their allies, who are suspicious of the former vice president. Finally, even if the Duma does vote to assume responsibility -- within its jurisdiction of course -- for observance of civic peace in Russia, this still leaves the president, whose commitment to any memoranda cannot be guaranteed in any way. The greater part of the Duma deputies understands this very well and therefore one should expect prolonged debates on the expediency of adopting any document imposing on it any greater responsibility than stipulated by the constitution.
