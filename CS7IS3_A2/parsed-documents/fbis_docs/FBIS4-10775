FBIS4-10775 "drlat073_m_94014" FBIS-LAT-94-073 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Brazil Rio de Janeiro Fiber Optics Network Detailed Rio de Janeiro Fiber Optics Network Detailed PY1204201694 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 8 Apr 94 p 13 PY1204201694 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL Portuguese BFN [Article by Heloisa Magalhaes] [Text] In order to facilitate the installation of fiber optics cables in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Embratel [Brazilian Telecommunications Company] will use the ducts of the underground electric power network of the Light Company. There are 21.88 km of links making up the national fiber optics network, which Embratel is installing to interconnect the main Brazilian capitals. This kind of installation will prevent not only the problems caused by work in very busy areas like downtown Rio de Janeiro, but will also reduce the cost of installing the fiber optics links, Embratel has reported. The cables will supplement the distribution work that the Rio de Janeiro Telephone Company (Telerj) is doing with the national network. According to Embratel President Renato Archer, Eletrosul [Southern Electric Power Plants] electric power towers are being used for the Florianopolis-Curitiba-Porto Alegre connection. The interconnection with Curitiba and Sao Paulo follows the railway network. The work toward awarding the contracts for the work in these two cities is in its final stage. The connection between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo is ready. It has operated since August 1993, following the Via Dutra highway. Through this connection it will be possible to gradually increase the capacity for simultaneous phone calls between the two cities to 123,000, whereas today that capacity lies at 39,000. Archer added that a "fiber optics triangle" joining Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Belo Horizonte is about to be completed. "This triangle is larger than the entire Spanish fiber optics network," he said. He expects that by the end of the year the contracts for all the connections to the northeastern region will already have been awarded, taking cables from Rio de Janeiro to Fortaleza. In the area between Salvador and Fortaleza the electric power network will be used for the cables, thanks to an agreement with CHESF [Sao Francisco Hydroelectric Company]. According to Embratel reports, the use of electric power company ducts permits a substantial reduction of the cost of installing the national network, which provides for investments of up to $1.5 billion until 1996. The network reaches Europe through the Columbus underwater cable, which is being installed. Connection with the United States will be done through the Americas II system, while Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries will be connected with Brazil and with the northern hemisphere through the Unisur cable.
