Addressing a crowded news conference in Muscat before her departure for home at the conclusion of her three-day visit to Oman, she said the problem should be resolved in accordance with international law and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. Bhutto said she also briefed Sultan Qabus on the situation that has arisen on the Indian subcontinent as a result of the Jammu and Kashmir problem. She also informed Sultan Qabus of the selective tyranny and oppression carried out against the people during the struggle in occupied Kashmir. The prime minister thanked Oman for its support to Pakistan on the Kashmir problem and also requested Sultan Qabus to assist in lessening tension in the subcontinent because Oman has good relations with India. She urged the Sultan to persuade India to stop human rights violations and strive for a political settlement of this issue. Bhutto added it is regrettable that India is not only criticizing her government but also attacking her personally, which reflects that the present government has perturbed India on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, which was not done by any previous Government of Pakistan. The prime minister said she held negotiations on Jammu and Kashmir with complete firmness, because Pakistan is really interested in the establishment of peace and stability in Jammu and Kashmir and believes that the time is ripe for settling this issue in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. She said we have struggled for human rights in Pakistan, and, hence, we cannot overlook the developments taking place in Jammu and Kashmir. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that 600,000 Indian troops are stationed in Jammu and Kashmir. India has increased its defense budget by 20 percent within a span of one year, which is directly related to the attempts to crush the struggle going on in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan cannot also ignore the fact that women are being molested in occupied Kashmir. The prime minister described her visit to Oman as very fruitful and expressed the hope that her visit will lead to exchange of visits at the ministerial levels. The two countries have the potential to work together to meet the requirements of the Pakistani markets and of the Gulf and Central Asian markets. Benazir Bhutto apprised the Omani Sultan of Pakistan's defense capabilities and said the two countries can find new avenues of cooperation in this field. She announced a gift of three Mashshaq trainer aircraft to Oman as an expression of the gesture of friendship. Later, addressing a large number of leading businessmen, the prime minister said Oman is the closest neighbor of Pakistan which offers vast opportunities for investment. [passage omitted]
