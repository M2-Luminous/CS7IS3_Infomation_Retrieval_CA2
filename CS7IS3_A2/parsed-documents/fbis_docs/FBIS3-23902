Speaking at a press conference at the Petergof Hotel, they emphasized that "All St. Petersburg" is not a political association. "We are democrats by conviction, rather than by profession," Yuriy Derevyanko, Astrobank vice-president and former deputy to the city soviet, explained. In his opinion, the City Assembly, first of all, should decide the problem of increasing the income part of the budget, but this necessitates supporting in an organized manner small-sized and medium-sized business and state enterprises. "All St. Petersburg" assumes that the assembly will succeed in refining its rights, but the Statute that is currently in effect provides it with a sufficient amount of powers to begin work. The bloc is in favor of having the deputies carry out their activities on an unprofessional basis. According to Derevyanko, any employed individual who has organized his job normally will be able to set aside two days a week for deputy activities. At the press conference it was noted that the association will nominate candidates, each of whom is a professional in his area and who can analyze the consequences of the decisions to be made. On the whole, however, the bloc leaders say that they will view the results of the voting as a victory if 75 percent of the mandates are given to intelligent persons -- not necessarily from "All St. Petersburg."
