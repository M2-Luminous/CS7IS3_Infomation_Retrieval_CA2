FR941004-0-00020 FR941004-0-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MN17&hyph;3&hyph;6325; [FRL&hyph;5077&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Carbon Monoxide; Oxygenated Gasoline Program; Minnesota AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The USEPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Minnesota. This revision requires an oxygenated gasoline program in the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Two areas were originally required to implement an oxygenated gasoline program because of past violations of the carbon monoxide standard, but on April 14, 1994, the Duluth area was redesignated to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for carbon monoxide (CO). This SIP revision was submitted to satisfy the requirement for Minnesota of section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act), which requires all CO nonattainment areas with a design value of 9.5 parts per million (ppm) or above based on 1988 and 1989 air quality monitoring data to implement an oxygenated gasoline program. USEPA is approving the oxygenated gasoline program. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule becomes effective on November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the SIP revision, public comments, and other materials relating to this rulemaking are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone Maggie Greene, at (312) 886&hyph;6088 before visiting the Region 5 Office.)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Summary of State Submittal The Minneapolis-St. Paul area and St. Louis County (Duluth) in the State of Minnesota (the control area) were designated nonattainment for CO and classified as moderate with a design value of 11.4 and 9.9 parts per million respectively, based on 1988 and 1989 data. USEPA redesignated the Duluth area to attainment on April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17706) in the Federal Register . Under section 211(m) of the Act, Minnesota was required to submit a revised SIP under section 110 and part D of the Act which includes an oxygenated gasoline program for Minneapolis-St. Paul and Duluth-Superior by November 15, 1992. On November 9, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted to USEPA a revised SIP including the oxygenated gasoline program containing legislation that was signed by the Governor on April 29, 1992, and became effective on August 1, 1992. The USEPA issued a completeness letter to the State on January 20, 1993. The notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the January 20, 1994 (59 FR 3047) Federal Register . II. Public Comment/USEPA Response A thirty-day public comment period was provided to allow interested parties the opportunity to comment on USEPA's proposed action. USEPA received three comments from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), the Koch Refining Company, and the MPCA. The comments and USEPA's responses are addressed below. Comment: The American Institute of CPAs objected to the use of the word ``Account'' when the word should be ``Accountant'' which is used to denote a CPA. This appeared in the section entitled ``Registration Requirements.'' Response: USEPA agrees that the sentence should have read, ``The USEPA guidelines also require that CARs commission an annual attest engagement, performed by either an internal auditor or independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA).'' Comment: The Koch Refining Company supported the oxygenated gasoline program in Minnesota, but only within the control area and during the control period. On November 12, 1993, the MPCA submitted a contingency plan to require year-round oxygenated fuel beginning in 1995. Koch opposed this contingency plan. While Koch understood that the USEPA's proposed rule did not address the contingency plan and addressed only the oxygenated gasoline program within the control area and during the control period, Koch opposed any use of oxygenated gasoline outside of the control period. Koch will submit additional comments on the contingency plan when that plan is proposed for Federal rulemaking.
