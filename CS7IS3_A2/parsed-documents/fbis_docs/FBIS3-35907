Maje Preem, the Estonian Defense Ministry press secretary, told Interfax Monday that the weapons, in particular rapid-firing 23 mm guns, machine guns and other captured Soviet-made automatic weaponry, had arrived in Estonia last week. In the press secretary's words, the gift was "a bit of a surprise" and no decision has been made as to who will receive it. It arrived with a second lot of the Kr 40 Mn worth of weaponry that Estonia had earlier bought from the same company. (The first lot arrived in May 1993 - IF). Estonia had signed a $49 Mn deal with the company on delivery of machine guns, assault rifles, rocket launchers and other weapons for the country's armed forces, border guards and police. Some State Assembly deputies had criticized the deal, saying the government acted incompetently in making it and that the weapons were too expensive and did not meet NATO standards. (Estonia had officially announced before the deal was made that it would use those standards - IF). The deal was discussed in parliament and ratified by it.
