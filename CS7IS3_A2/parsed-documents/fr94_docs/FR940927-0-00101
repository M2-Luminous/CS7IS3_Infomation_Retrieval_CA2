ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rulemaking establishes Coast Guard regulations which implement the provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) that require certificates of registry (CORs) and merchant mariner's documents (MMDs) to be renewed every 5 years. A 5-year renewal period allows the Coast Guard to ensure that vessel personnel continue to be qualified to safely serve aboard a vessel. This rulemaking includes requirements for renewing CORs and MMDs, a schedule for renewing existing CORs and MMDs, and the associated user fees. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective October 27, 1994, except for 46 CFR 10.811 and 46 CFR 12.02&hyph;29 which are effective January 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Unless otherwise indicated, documents referenced in this preamble are available for inspection or copying at the office of the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA/3406), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001 between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. James W. Cratty, Project Manager, and Ms. Jacqueline L. Sullivan, Project Counsel, OPA 90 Staff. Regulatory History On September 16, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled Five-Year Term of Validity for Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents in the Federal Register (58 FR 48572). The 60-day comment period closed on November 15, 1993. The NPRM discussed the background and statutory requirements of section 4102 (b) and (c) of OPA 90 which amended 46 U.S.C. 7107 and 7302. It also discussed the requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 which amended 46 U.S.C. 2110. The Coast Guard received 13 letters commenting on the proposal from mariners, unions, and marine industry representatives. A public hearing was not requested, and one was not held. After careful review of these comments and the NPRM, the Coast Guard has finalized the requirements for renewal of Certificates of Registry and Merchant Mariner's Documents. The Coast Guard finds that the regulations provide the maximum flexibility practicable in establishing requirements for a 5-year term of validity for CORs and MMDs. Background and Purpose The Coast Guard issues certificates of registry (CORs) under the authority of 46 U.S.C. chapters 71 and 75. CORs are issued to provide registry of staff officers for service in positions such as purser, medical doctor, and professional nurse. The Coast Guard issues merchant mariner's documents (MMDs) under the authority of 46 U.S.C. chapters 73 and 75. MMDs authorize individuals to work in different capacities on deck, and in the engine and steward's departments, on seagoing vessels over 100 gross tons. MMDs, with an appropriate endorsement, also identify qualified tankermen. Section 4102(b) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) amended 46 U.S.C. 7107 by limiting the term of a COR to 5 years. Section 4102(c) of OPA 90 amended 46 U.S.C. 7302 by establishing the same limited term for MMDs. The Conference Report on OPA 90 (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101&hyph;653) explains that a 5-year renewal period will allow the Coast Guard to ensure that vessel personnel continue to be qualified to operate a vessel safely. Section 4102(d) of OPA 90 limits the term of validity of all existing CORs and MMDs and provides for staggered expirations over a 5-year span. The statutory language provides that CORs and MMDs issued before August 18, 1990 expire on the day they would have expired if they had been issued for a term of 5 years and been renewed at the end of each succeeding 5-year period. This avoids the problems that would have been encountered if all CORs and MMDs expired at the same time. If this language is interpreted so that the 5-year period began on August 18, 1990, the date OPA 90 was enacted, documents would have expired at a time when no review and renewal procedures were in place. Mariners with such an expired document could not continue working, placing a tremendous burden on both individual mariners and the maritime industry. The Coast Guard interprets the statutory language to include an additional 5-year renewal cycle to avoid such a harsh result. The Coast Guard has modified the tables in 46 CFR 10.811 and 12.02&hyph;29 to commence the mandatory 5-year renewal period beginning on January 1, 1995. This will allow merchant mariners sufficient time to comply with the regulation's requirements. Pending the development of these proposed procedures for renewal of CORs and MMDs, the Coast Guard has been issuing CORs and MMDs that are valid for a period of 5 years since March 1991. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended 46 U.S.C. 2110 to require the Coast Guard to establish and collect user fees for services it provides under subtitle II of 46 U.S.C., including the issuance and renewal of CORs and MMDs.
