FBIS4-27378 "dreas105_d_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 South Korea Renewal of China's MFN Status Assessed Renewal of China's MFN Status Assessed SK2805135094 SK2805135094 BFN [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 May publish editorials, reports, and articles on President Clinton's decision to renew China's MFN status. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "The Recovery of U.S.-PRC Relations." Noting that the United States decided to seek "practical interests" instead of "moral obligations" on the human rights issue by renewing China's MFN status, the editorial says that the solution of this problem, which might possibly have caused not only "tension" in relations between the United States and China, but also a "negative impact" in the Northeast Asian situation, is very "fortunate." Explaining the background of granting MFN trading status to China, the editorial stresses that if U.S.-China relations were to be strained by the withdrawal of MFN status, "dark clouds" would be cast on the overall situation in East Asia. The editorial points to China's "important role" in the region, including a role as "mediator" for a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue. The editorial assesses that President Clinton's recent decision is a "positive step" for U.S.- China relations and for the overall situation in the region. The editorial adds that U.S. human rights diplomacy "has not retreated" because China itself is showing "gradual improvement" on the issue and is being watched not only by the United States but also by the entire world. The editorial predicts, however, that with the United States' "invigorated advance" into Chinese markets, ROK exports to China would accordingly suffer a blow. Nevertheless, the editorial predicts that in the long term, "stability" in East Asia and the promotion of ROK-PRC relations will even "broaden" Chinese markets for ROK commodities. In conclusion, the editorial expresses hope that since China has acquired a "concession" from the United States, China will play a role in resolving the North Korean nuclear problem as demanded by the international community. TONG-A ILBO also publishes on page 7 a 1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun under the headline, "Human Rights Policy Pushed Aside by Seeking Practical Interest." Describing the U.S. decision to renew China's MFN status as "the last resort," the article points out that the United States can no longer "ignore" the political and economic "influence" exerted by China and that "economic retaliation" against the United States by China if the MFN status had not been renewed would have a serious impact on the U.S. economy. The article notes, however, that with the recent decision to renew MFN status, domestic criticism of the U.S. administration's "appeasement foreign policy" will certainly "expand." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Chong-yon, entitled "The Choice of Practical 'Economic Profits' Rather than 'Human Rights.'" Explaining the background of granting MFN status to China, the article points out that various "interested organizations" in the United States, including large U.S. business groups that advanced into China, demanded that President Clinton put an end to "diplomatic friction" with China over human rights because it is believed that heightened U.S.-China "diplomatic tensions" will be "more unfavorable" for the United States than for China. The article views that the U.S. decision for renewal was prompted by the Chinese Government's "hardline" position on opposing U.S. policy to link China's human rights with the renewal of MFN status, and by the "inevitability" of the U.S. "appeasement diplomatic policy" toward China in its efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which is the greatest "diplomatic headache" facing the Clinton Administration, by asking China to exercise influence on North Korea for a solution to the nuclear issue. Pointing to "strong criticism" raised by "progressive pressure organizations" within the United States on the Clinton Administration's "inconsistent human rights policy," the article says that President Clinton may have to revise his human rights policy toward Asia, and concludes that the recent MFN renewal step for China has certainly caused "damage" to U.S. "diplomatic prestige." The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO on page 6 publishes articles by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok and by Beijing-based correspondent Yu Tong-hui on "impressions" in the United States and China seen after the decision to renew China's MFN status. Concerning the U.S. "impressions", the article points out that this decision has caused an "enormous shock" in both official and civilian quarters within the United States, because this decision is not merely for the "extension" of the status, but signifies an "epoch-making" step in U.S. Government policy not to link human rights with trade any longer. The article explains in detail a few points that made President Clinton change the policy, including the U.S. "economy first-policy" and the inevitability of regarding China as a "regional partner" for maintaining stability in Asia. Pointing to the "immediate criticism" of President Clinton's decision by U.S. human rights organizations and some U.S. congressmen, the article notes that contrary to this, U.S. business circles "heaved a sigh of relief" and expressed satisfaction with the possibility of increasing exports to the Chinese markets. Concerning the Chinese side's "impressions", the article notes that China "welcomed" the U.S. decision and accepted it as a "wise decision." The article writes, however, that China predicts that in an attempt to appease criticism within the United States for President Clinton's "violation of his election pledges," the President will demand "greater economic concessions" from the Chinese side. The moderate SEOUL MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN on page 6 publishes a 1,300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim Kyong-su entitled "U.S. Choice of Practical Interest--the Background of U.S. Renewal of MFN Status for China." Explaining the background of the U.S. decision, the article views that "trade relations" between the two countries was "a decisive factor" for drawing this conclusion, and notes that U.S. exports to China have tripled over the past 10 years and China has become the seventh largest trade partner of the United States. Another factor leading to this decision was the Clinton Administration's view of China as "the only neighbor" who can persuade North Korea for a solution to its nuclear problem. The article, however, points to "a certain degree of criticism" of President Clinton's decision within the United States for the "result of completely ignoring the human rights issue," and to "differences in views" even between diplomatic teams and economic teams within the government in connection with the linkage of human rights with the renewal of China's MFN status. The article writes that the Clinton Administration's decision clearly shows its "trade- first" policy as seen in recent economic negotiations with Japan and Vietnam. The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 4 a 1,400-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong entitled "U.S. Choice of Practical Interest Rather than Moral Obligations for the Human Rights Issue." The article notes that this decision was prompted, in part, by President Clinton's assessment that the policy of linking human rights with trade is "no longer effective," and by "pressure from interested organizations" within the United States which are striving to promote trade relations with China. Pointing to the increase in U.S. exports to China and to new employment generated by trade with China, the article writes that President Clinton stressed that China shares "common interests" with the United States for attaining "stability" in the Northeast Asia, including the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The Clinton Administration's withdrawal of the policy of linking human rights with trade does not necessarily mean the "abandonment" of its foreign policy on human rights, and its decision to ban the import of Chinese-made weapons and ammunition is a "symbolic pursuance of moral obligations" to human rights diplomacy. The article predicts that the U.S. human rights policy will turn from a "linkage strategy" to a "broad-range interference strategy," including support for Chinese organizations which are devoted to human rights and democracy, and strengthening the activities of "Voice of Free Asia" and "Voice of America." The article adds that the recent step, on the other hand, will also negatively affect Americans' trust in President Clinton's leadership and policy. The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 1,400-word article by reporter O Yong, entitled "The U.S. Choice of Practical Interest Suggests Great Change in U.S. Policy on Asia." Noting that U.S.-China negotiations over MFN status have ended with "China's victory," the article says the current step by the Clinton Administration can be regarded as a "change in policy" having "impact" on overall U.S. policy toward Asia. Analyzing a few factors that led to this decision, including "enormous market potentials" in China and "fierce criticism" at home and abroad of the policy of linking human rights with trade, the article notes that with the current decision, the United States is assigned a task to "amend" its Asian policy, and its "rough relations" with China in the past will "heave a sigh of relief." This step will, the article says, also exert "positive influence" on China's joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with the human rights issue being excluded as a separated issue.
