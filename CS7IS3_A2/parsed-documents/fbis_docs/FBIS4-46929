Rakhmanov: "Military Commissariats Appeal to Patriotism"] [Text] Yesterday, a conference concerning the issues of the draft into military service was held at the mayoralty. The conference was attended by representatives of the military commissariats of the city, law enforcement organs, and heads of rayon administrations. Despite the 1993 quota for the draft into the Army having been met, concern about the "unpatriotic sentiment" of the young people of St. Petersburg was voiced at the conference. This phenomenon has been registered among both the draftees and their parents, who sometimes try to spare their children military service by hook or by crook. The number of persons without a secondary education has sharply increased among the draftees. Such persons account for 40 percent at present. Besides, the number of those unfit for military service continues to increase. During the fall draft, 8,300 such persons were registered; in 1993 as a whole, one in three was "rejected." Many of the diseases are of the kind caused by drug abuse. The "evaders" are a special headache for the military commissariats. In 1993, there were several thousand of them; among them are both those who failed to report to military commissariats and those who have changed their place of residence. Search teams were organized, which succeeded in bringing 14,500 [as published] people to the premises of military commissariats. They did not succeed in locating 500 "evaders." The staff of the district has now given the assignment to draft 6,800 persons. Some of them have already reported to induction centers. However, participants in the conference noted that problems might recur during the spring draft in the absence of cooperation between the organs of government, the military, and the law enforcement organs. In particular, it is necessary to computerize the operation of passport desks so that the military commissariats will be able to promptly track changes in the registered residence of draftees, as well as to revisit the patriotic conditioning of young people. It should be added that effective 25 May, the draft of military reservists for active-duty training was suspended in both St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast. This happened because the Ministry of Defense of Russia is currently unable to finance this training.
