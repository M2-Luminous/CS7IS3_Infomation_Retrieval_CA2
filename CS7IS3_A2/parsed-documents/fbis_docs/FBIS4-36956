The source told AL-HAYAH that Jordan's demands for the return of its occupied territory and for the definition and demarcation of its international borders are "equal to the Sryian call for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan in return for peace with Israel." The source noted that Damascus "called for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for peace, not withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories including the Jordanian, Palestinian, and Lebanese territories." He added that a definition and demarcation of the Jordanian borders "would help in the demarcation of the border of the future Palestinian state...east of the West Bank." The informed source stressed that "when the question of the Palestinian Golan was mentioned, Jordan's aim in talking about it was to support the Syrian position that that territory is Syrian...certainly not Israeli." Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali had said at a closed session of the House of Representatives last week that a dispute over the ownership of al-Himmah triangle known as the "Palestinian Golan" was one of the most important obstacles standing in the way of a draft agreement with Israel on the Syrian Golan Heights.
