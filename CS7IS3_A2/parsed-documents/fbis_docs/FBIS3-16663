Lieutenant General Viktor Zemtsov, commander of the district, told the journalists that the redeployment was of a planned nature. Being moved together with the directorate are some of the district's subunits. Zemtsov underscored at the same time that all the groups of forces necessary for guarding the state border with Turkey will stay on the territory of Georgia. "We are not leaving Georgia and Armenia, our directorate is simply moving over to Stavropol," said Zemtsov, adding that the district is in charge, first, of the former USSR borders guarded by Russian Federation border guards; second, of the Russian Federation state border in the Northern Caucasus. Along this border, the guards will keep tabs on the movement of weapons, contraband, and drugs from Russia to other countries and vice versa. The district was created in line with the Russian Federation president's edict of 1 March 1994. Before that there existed, for one year, a Northern Caucasus border district, which was known as the Transcaucasus border district until 1 March 1993. On the morning of 17 March the commander met with Georgian leaders, in particular with Prime Minister Otari Patsatsiya, and expressed thanks to the Government of Georgia for understanding and support, for kind relationships. "We don't say 'goodbye,' we say 'see you again,' and we will continue guarding the state border." Talking to journalists, Viktor Zemtsov remarked that residents of the Republic of Georgia will also serve in the Russian Federation border troops beginning this year. As early as this April or May, they will be first drafted for service in the Russian Federation border troops to guard the state border with Turkey. The number of draftees will be between 500 and 600 men. In the future, he said, nearly 30 percent of the entire personnel of the Russian Federation border troops stationed in Georgia will be the republic's residents. Among them, there will be enlisted men, warrant officers, and officers. Drafting will be effected irrespective of the men's nationality: Georgians, Russians, Abkhaz, and others will be eligible. Responding to questions relating to border control between Russia and Georgia, Zemtsov said that subunits and units of Russian Federation border troops are being deployed along the Psou River. Their missions in guarding the state border, in preventing the crossing from the Russian Federation into Georgia and vice versa of any groups of people and arms, have already been defined for them. He said he has some experience in checking up on and detaining groups that carried weapons from Russia to Abkhazia and back. Thus, the district continues to perform its duties, and one should not create a stir about the district directorate's redeployment from Tbilisi to Stavropol.
