From what he said, because of the great probability of a second or even third round of parliamentary elections and the unformed state of the government, even if he does participate in the elections, anarchy is inevitable. "I have been driven into a corner: I have either to throw everything away and enter the elections, or display responsibility and not take this step," he said. "There is also another moral aspect. Like all of us, at school and after school I studied the lives of other presidents, but I have never come across such sordid, uncultured, and overt campaign of persecution of a head of state as many people both inside and outside parliament, as well as in the Ukrainian mass media, are taking the liberty of conducting. It is a historic phenomenon for such a boorish attitude toward the first president to become established in the consciousness of generations: In human terms I cannot and do not want to understand it." The first wave of impartial comments about the president's step -- from "Has Kravchuk Gotten Cold Feet?" to "The Main Thing Is Getting Out at the Right Time" (I cite the republic press headlines) -- has already poured forth. Socialist Party chief Aleksandr Moroz deemed Kravchuk's decision politically correct -- inasmuch as, according to him, the president has practically no chance of success at the elections. Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil has described Kravchuk's step as a tactical one aimed at disrupting the presidential elections for the sake of prolonging his own powers. "I don't know why the president's nerve has failed him: Even if he was not thinking of running, he should have announced this a month or two before the elections, and not now, on the eve of his trip to the United States. How will he speak with Clinton?" -- the question posed by Democratic Party chief Vladimir Yavorivskiy remains rhetorical at the moment. However, the possibility of an imminent change of head of state was not envisaged during preparations for Kravchuk's 3-7 March visit to the United States. At an advance meeting with the Ukrainian diaspora, Bill Clinton said that the program of the visit should be put together in such a way as to promote the strengthening of Kravchuk's prestige at home to the maximum degree. "Whereas before the United States was only interested in the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine, now it is also interested in full-scale cooperation and aid in the face of the economic crisis," Anton Buteyko, the Ukrainian president's adviser on international questions, said. Therefore, the main aim of the present visit is specifically to move relations between our countries to a new level and to sign agreements on investment, trade, and economic relations, cooperation in the sphere of conversion and space research, and on a specific mechanism for granting disarmament assistance. Ukraine and the United States can and should develop their ties independently of relations with Russia. However desirable it may be not to depend on these relations, such attention to Ukraine on the part of a Bill Clinton who just two months ago did not want to visit Kiev can be explained by the good intentions of obtaining a strong, peaceful, and obedient Ukraine as a counterbalance to the unstable and unpredictable Russia -- especially after the amnesty and the hijacking of the U.S. initiative in settling the Bosnian conflict. As for the Ukrainian president, the problem of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which remains unsigned by Ukraine, will inevitably arise during his visit to the United States -- the last session of the present parliament is already over, while the new elections are being called into question, as Kravchuk has already convinced us. Perhaps the only thing that remains for the president to do in the United States is to declare himself the guarantor of the implementation of earlier promises -- inasmuch as during the above-described period of autocracy in Ukraine (roughly April-June) it will be possible both to sign the treaty and start the removal of weapons in accordance with the agreed plan for reducing offensive armaments. Then it will be possible not to renounce participation in the presidential elections -- the voice of Bill Clinton, who has taken the Ukrainian citizens' fancy, will be able to decide their outcome. Particularly since the reciprocal sympathy of the U.S. president is backed up in material terms: The most significant result of Kravchuk's visit will be credits and payments to Ukraine by the IMF and the World Bank.
