Itamaraty deemed "offensive" and "inelegant" Menem's initiative to request support for Mexican President Carlos Salinas' candidacy for the presidency of the future World Trade Organization, ignoring Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero's candidacy for the same position. Brazilian Ambassador to Buenos Aires Marcos Azambuja was instructed on the night of 16 June to tell the Argentine Government about the decision to cancel Cavallo's visit to Brasilia on 27 and 28 June. His visit would express support for the implementation of the real. Winston Fritsch from the Finance Ministry and Jose Denot Medeiros from Itamaraty left for Buenos Aires on 16 June at night to convey Brazil's perplexity about the Argentine president's haste to Argentine officials. Itamaraty deemed Menem's attitude unacceptable, particularly because the Argentine Government had been informed a week before about Ricupero's candidacy to the presidency of the organization that will replace GATT. In addition to overlooking this fact, Menem committed another blunder by asking the chiefs of state to acclaim Salinas' candidacy. President Itamar Franco's seat was empty because he had suddenly left Cartagena and returned to Brazil.
