This became possible after the Social Democrats accepted a motion on the government's proposal on NATO cooperation. [passage omitted] In NATO's Partnership program, each country decides how extensive the military cooperation will be, and every country pays for the cooperation in which it takes part. According to Pierre Schori, the foreign policy spokesman of the Social Democrats, we can never have Swedish soldiers fighting in a NATO [word indistinct]. [Begin recording] [Schori] No, we will not choose that. That is directed toward the East and Central Europeans, who want to join NATO, but cannot. They are offered something that looks like cooperation with NATO, but it is not. [Correspondent Herman Melzer] But is this not cooperation that we are prepared to begin, cooperation with NATO on several different points? [Schori] Well, the initiative came from NATO.... [Melzer, interrupting] Is it not false then that we say that we are free of alliances, when we are now going to cooperate with NATO? [Schori] Well, you are stuck on NATO. This is a proposal that comes from NATO, but this is not direct NATO activity. This is a manifestation that the world changes, and NATO actually also changes. NATO must find something else; otherwise, it has no justification for its existence. [Melzer] Still, there is no other military alliances with which we cooperate. [Schori] No, there is actually no other military alliance any more, so we will have to begin with what we have. The aim is joint security and, from our point of view, the basic choice in our activities is freedom from military alliances. [end recording]
