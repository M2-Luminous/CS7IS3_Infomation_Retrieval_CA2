Mark C. Schechter, Deputy Director of Operations. United States Response to Public Comments Pursuant to the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, (``APPA'' or ``Tunney Act'') 15 U.S.C. §16(b)&hyph;(h), the United States hereby responds to public comments it has received relating to the proposed Final Judgment in this civil antitrust proceeding. After careful consideration of these comments, the United States continues to believe that the proposed Final Judgment will provide an effective and appropriate remedy for the antitrust violations alleged in the Complaint. After the public comments and this response have been published in the Federal Register , pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §16(d), the United States will move the Court for entry of the proposed Final Judgment. This action began on July 15, 1994, when the United States filed a Complaint alleging that Microsoft Corporation had unlawfully maintained its monopoly of personal computer operating systems and had unreasonably restrained trade, in violation of sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1, 2. Simultaneously, with the filing of the Complaint, the United States filed a proposed Final Judgment and a Stipulation signed by the defendant consenting to the entry of the proposed Final Judgment after compliance with the requirements of the APPA. Pursuant to the APPA requirements, the United States filed a Competitive Impact Statement (``CIS'') on July 27, 1994. The defendant filed a description of certain written and oral communications on its behalf, as required by section 15(g) of the APPA, on August 8, 1994. A summary of the terms of the proposed Final Judgment and CIS, and directions for the submission of written comments relating to the proposal were published in the Washington Post for seven days in the period from August 7, 1994 through August 13, 1994. The proposed Final Judgment and the Competitive Impact Statement were published in the Federal Register on August 19, 1994. 59 Fed. Reg. 42845&hyph;42857 (1994). The 60-day period for public comments began on August 20, 1994 and expired on October 18, 1994. 1 The United States received five comments, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1&hyph;5. Three of these comments relate to alleged Microsoft practices that the government did not challenge as violations of the antitrust laws, and which are not addressed in the proposed Consent Decree. Only one comment relates directly to the proposed relief, and that comment suggests that an additional remedy should have been included. Finally, one brief comment argues that the government should not have taken any action against Microsoft. 1 The United States has treated as timely all comments that it received up to the time of the filing of this response.
