Yesterday morning's State of the Union was back to the basic pledge of health care reform -- back to the basic conundrum of welfare provision; back to the basic, visceral fear of crime. A driving domestic agenda from a leader who against a backcloth of burgeoning economic recovery, has staked his future on profound change to the U.S. body politic. The parallels with B to B British-style are there to be drawn. On crime, legislation that pours 15 billion pounds a year extra into tougher, broader policing (Michael Howard, eat your heart out) and catches headlines for its "three strikes for one" proposal to lock up violent offenders for life on their third conviction. (A frothy wheeze since, because it applies only to federal territory, is most likely only to affect reservation Indians and serially-violent sergeants on army bases). On welfare (eat your heart out Portillo) the blending of training and workfare grows ever closer, with the Michigan model of safety nets snipped away after a finite term ever more dominant. These are not the ways of J.K. Galbraith. Bill Clinton may be a Democrat, but he is not a liberal Democrat -- and the policies, mixing tough and tender in new ways, may turn to dust. Remember, for instance, that California already spends more on its prison system than it does on education. But Clinton cannot be conventionally described in the old categories of American politics, any more (much though John Smith might wish it) than he can be translated to a British context. His approaches to health care reform--the one, inescapable mountain he must climb to succeed on his own test--have scant ideological connection to his crime policies: one a complex revolution involving government expertise, the other an abdication of such philosophy. Yet, if there is incoherence, it stems directly from the America he leads. Clinton won the election, but on a minority of a split vote. He is having, in practice, to forge a new coalition: and that means building the interest blocs, the things that ordinary people say and want, together. Leadership by reconciliation, balance and distillation. That has all manner of weaknesses, if only because the policies ordinary people want sometimes don't work. But it is a process that engages enthusiasm rather than repels it. Something active rather than think-tank passive. Crucially, it looks to a better future rather than invoking a golden past. And when Clinton yesterday openly acknowledged the limits of government action, when he set "family, school, church and community" far ahead as agents of change, perhaps he defined why his B to B stands more chances than the Downing Street version. He knows American government is distrusted and often reviled. He preaches passionately--but not from personal example. The message is people-based, not politician- based: because those are the hearts and minds he must capture.
