The "hot line" conversation was at the American side's request. Pavel Grachev stressed that the use of military force, particularly from the air, is incapable of producing a positive result in resolving the conflict in the region. The Russian minister advocated sending additional peacekeeping ground forces to the confrontation zone. And, Pavel Grachev noted, the warring factions should retreat to their previous positions, which will make it possible to create a demilitarized zone in the Balkans. [passage omitted] "At the request of Serbian President Milosevic, I am currently heading for Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, to attempt to put back together [sobrat] the fragments of the Bosnian settlement process," Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special representative and Russian Federation deputy foreign minister, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent in Belgrade. Following the NATO air strikes, he continued in the interview, the Bosnian Serbs stated that they were ending all cooperation with the UN forces. Nonetheless, during today's meeting with President Milosevic we reached an understanding that the process should not be allowed to drift, and that it is necessary nonetheless to reach a cease-fire agreement -- which has not proved possible in the past few days. It is a question of a truce along the entire frontline, ideally starting with Gorazde. Since in recent hours there had again been alarming reports about the resumption of the shelling of this town, the Russian diplomat noted, I put this question to Milosevic, who contacted Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic, who subsequently ordered that the shelling of Gorazde be stopped. In my assessment, V. Churkin said, in the case of Gorazde there is a strong element of uncontrolled military action on the part of both the Serb and Muslim sides. It should not be forgotten that it was the Muslims who initiated hostilities in Gorazde, despite the fact that the region had been declared a "protected area" by the United Nations. But, on the whole, a very serious position has now come about and a qualitatively new element has arisen -- intervention in the Bosnian conflict by the United Nations and the international community. There is a tendency to slide into even greater confrontation. This is what we are now making every effort to avert, and we believe that the main way is to conclude a truce agreement. V. Churkin noted that nobody on the UN or NATO side consulted with Russian representatives before the air strikes, even though there had been enough time to do so. Unfortunately, the consultation mechanism failed to work. Admittedly, he added, the Bosnian Serbs did not consult us either. When we asked and warned about the dangerous development of the situation, they replied that they had no plans in respect of Gorazde and that the Russian side had no need to take any major action to normalize the situation in Gorazde. All parties could have made greater efforts to ensure that Russia provided mediation assistance, but this was not done. When asked about possible new NATO action against the Serb side in Bosnia, the Russian diplomat replied that "no possible action can now be ruled out."
