Forty bodies were recovered from the rubble left in India's largest military camp in occupied Kashmir which the freedom fighters had attacked recently. In addition to Major General Fernandes, five brigadiers and 10 colonels were among those killed. These military officers had come to Srinagar to participate in an important meeting to discuss plans to crush militant activities in Kashmir. Some bodies were badly disfigured from burning and were not recognizable. Major General Fernandes and several other officers had come to Srinagar for an emergency meeting called by Rajesh Pilot to plan a new strategy. During this meeting, there were some powerful blasts and these officers were buried under rubble. Important Indian sources and the New Delhi government have declared the deaths of military officers in occupied Kashmir to be the worst incident in recent months. According to Kashmir Media Service, it took a long time to put out the fire and find bodies. The Indian army had blockaded all the roads leading to Badami Bagh during this time and even the local workers were not allowed to travel. According to the spokesmen for the Kashmiri freedom fighters, this is the first step. If the Indian army continues its atrocities and does not end the siege of Hazratbal, more destructive and dangerous steps will be taken. The situation in the region has become more tense after the atrocious actions of the Indian military. The Indian military is patrolling all roads and many young men were shot to death during Indian troops' vicious activities. Most of the freedom fighters are being subjected to inhuman afflictions in torture chambers. The Jumiatul Mujaheddin and the Ikhwanul Musalmin have jointly accepted responsibility for attacking the Indian military camp in Badami Bagh in the vicinity of Srinagar. According to a correspondent of Islamic News International, the mujaheddin launched this attack at the time when the Indian military officers were looking at an exhibition of ammunition, that according to them was seized from the freedom fighters in the Badami Bagh camp. The freedom fighter targeted a patrol tanker parked near there with rockets. The fire from this tanker engulfed the whole camp. One major general and three colonels were killed in this mishap. General Abdulbari, the supreme commander of Jumiatul Mujaheddin of Jammu and Kashmir, has announced an award of 100,000 rupees and star of bravery medal to each of these brave fighters who took part in the devastation of Badami Bagh military camp and destruction of military vehicles and government buildings. The freedom fighters also attacked Galewar cantonment and killed dozens of Indian soldiers. In addition to damaging the cantonment, they totally destroyed the artillery building. Various militant groups seeing the vulnerable situation in occupied Kashmir have accelerated their activities. They have demanded that Hazratbal be opened to pilgrims now and to stop the present treatment of Kashmir people. These organizations have decided to carry out joint attacks at many places seeing the vulnerable situation. The Indian army is shaken up by these recent attacks and is considering increasing its activities against the freedom fighters. The curfew restrictions are being increased to make the lives of Kashmiri freedom fighters more difficult. Meanwhile the Kashmiri freedom fighters have expressed their determination to continue their efforts until Kashmir is fully liberated.
