But Will Life Become Safer?"] [Text] The Security Council Interdepartmental Commission for Combatting Crime and Corruption has elaborated a federal program to combat this evil. It will be presented for the scrutiny of the Security Council in the near future. In an exclusive interview with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, Major General of Justice Anatoliy Korotkov, leader of a Russian Federation Security Council Interdepartmental Commission for Combating Crime and Corruption working group, reported that whereas previously the fight against crime has been conducted in an uncoordinated manner by different departments, now the first attempt has been made to coordinate all these efforts and to resolve at state level the problem of protecting the life and health of Russian citizens. But how is it planned to combat crime -- whose scale and pace are increasing almost daily? In Korotkov's opinion, reorganization will be necessary in the spheres of both legislation and organization. It is planned to direct all law enforcement activities toward protecting the rights of the individual. Today, for example, if your car is stolen, in practice nobody bears responsibility for this. But now, according to the new program, it will not only be the thief who is responsible for the theft but also the staffers of the law enforcement agency on whose territory the theft took place and who were unable to guarantee the automobile's safety. Today, he says, we have for the first time come up against a new type of crime -- contract killing. In developed capitalist countries it is not ordinary policemen who fight hired killers but specially trained professionals. But here it is basically precinct cops who fight hired killers. We have proved unprepared both morally and legislatively for the struggle against this new type of crime. Hence the low rate of detection. The new program pays much attention to this new type of crime and envisages the creation of a special antiterrorist center.
