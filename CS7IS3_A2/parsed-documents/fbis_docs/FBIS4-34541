The purpose of his three-day visit is to increase trade between the two nations. The president arrived at the metropolitan airport's military section at 1915 -- shortly after the soccer game between Mexico and Norway -- on board a helicopter, and 10 minutes later boarded the plane without talking to the press. The list of the 32 passengers flying with the president in the Tango-1 plane was not revealed. But it was known that Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Air Force Commander Juan Paulik, Economic Relations Secretary Jorge Campbell, Agriculture Secretary Felipe Sola, presidential physician Alejandro Tfeli, hair dresser Antonio Cuozzo, and about 20 entrepreneurs traveled with him. An interesting note was the absence of Santa Cruz Governor Nestor Kirchner. "We have been waiting for him since early today, but he did not even call to tell us he was not coming," a presidential protocol department official complained. Menem will meet with economists and politicians in Canada. He and Prime Minister Jean Chretien will sign an agreement to avoid the double payment of taxes on private companies' incomes and capital and an agreement on cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But the main item on his agenda will undoubtedly be Argentina's entry into NAFTA -- much more because he knows the Latin American country that will most likely join NAFTA first is Chile. Both the Argentine president and Felipe Sola will not forget to discuss the national government's concern over the sale of subsidized grains to Brazil. The president will stay at the residence of Governor General Raymond Hatishin while in Ottawa.
