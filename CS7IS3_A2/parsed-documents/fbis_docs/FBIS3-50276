The Croatian foreign minister thanked Germany for its efforts in caring for thousands of Croat refugees but pointed out that one-third of Croatia's territory was still under occupation so that most of the refugees cannot return to their homes. In his letter Mr. Granic called on Germany to help in the return of refugees to their homes but urged it to keep in mind that this process should be carried out in phases in accordance with the normalization of relations and the reintegration of the UN-protected areas into Croatia's legal system.
