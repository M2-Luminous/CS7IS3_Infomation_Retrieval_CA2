FR940302-1-00022 FR940302-1-00009 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 9E3752 and 9E3791/P575; FRL&hyph;4751&hyph;4] RIN No. 2070&hyph;AC18 Pesticide Tolerances for Cyromazine AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to establish tolerances for combined residues of the insecticide cyromazine and its metabolite melamine in or on the raw agricultural commodities Chinese cabbage and Chinese mustard. The proposed regulation to establish maximum permissible levels for residues of the insecticide was requested in petitions submitted by the Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4). DATES: Comments, identified by the document control number [PP 9E3752 and 9E3791/P575], must be received on or before April 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit written comments to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1132, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202. Information submitted as a comment concerning this document may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain CBI must be submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132 at the address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Hoyt L. Jamerson, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petitions (PP) 9E3752 and 9E3791 on behalf of the Agricultural Experiment Station of Florida. These petitions requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), amend 40 CFR 180.414 by establishing tolerances for combined residues of the insecticide cyromazine ( N -cyclopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) and its metabolite melamine (1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine), calculated as cyromazine, in or on the raw agricultural commodities Chinese cabbage (PP 9E3752) and Chinese mustard (PP 9E3791) at 3.0 parts per million (ppm). The petitioner proposed that these uses of cyromazine be limited to Florida based on the geographical representation of the residue data submitted. Additional residue data will be required to expand the area of usage. Persons seeking geographically broader registration should contact the Agency's Registration Division at the address provided above. The scientific data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been evaluated. A discussion of the toxicological data considered in support of the proposed tolerances as well as a discussion of the risk of cyromazine and its metabolite melamine can be found in a rule (FAP 2H5355/P344) published in the Federal Register of April 27, 1984 (49 FR 18120); in the Notice of Conditional Registration for Larvadex 0.3% Premix, published in the Federal Register of May 15, 1985 (50 FR 20373); and in the proposed rule regarding the establishment of a tolerance for residues of cyromazine and its metabolite melamine, calculated as cyromazine, in or on mushrooms at 10.0 ppm in the Federal Register of June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34975). A dietary exposure/risk assessment was performed for cyromazine using a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.0075 mg/kg body weight/day. The RfD is based on a NOEL of 0.75 mg/kg/day from a 6-month feeding study in dogs, which demonstrated decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, and an uncertainty factor of 100. The Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) from established tolerances for cyromazine utilizes 60 percent of the RfD for the overall U.S. population and 66 percent of the RfD for children aged 1 through 6 years. This dietary exposure/risk assessment includes tolerances for cyromazine on the cucurbit vegetables and leafy vegetables (except Brassica) crop groupings, which are published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register (document control number PP 1F4016 and 2F4053/R2039). The proposed tolerances for Chinese cabbage and Chinese mustard would utilize less than 1 percent of the RfD for the overall U.S. population and approximately 1% of the RfD for children aged 1 through 6 years. Since the risk estimates are based on the TMRC, typically an overestimate of actual exposure, and do not exceed the Reference Dose, the chronic dietary risk of cyromazine does not appear to be of concern. The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood for the purposes of these tolerances. An adequate analytical method, high-pressure liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM II). There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in milk, eggs, or meat of livestock and poultry since there are no livestock or poultry feed items associated with this action. Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below. Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [PP 9E3752 and 9E3791/P575]. All written comments filed in response to these petitions will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
