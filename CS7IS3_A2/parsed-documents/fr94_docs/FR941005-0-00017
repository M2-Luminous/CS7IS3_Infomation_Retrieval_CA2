FR941005-0-00017 FR941005-0-00006 III. Final Action Today's final action is based on EPA's review of the material in Docket No. A&hyph;93&hyph;47. The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the definition revision should adverse or critical comments be filed or a request for a public hearing be made. The EPA hereby amends its definition of VOC at 40 CFR 51.100(s) to exclude PCBTF and VMS as VOC for ozone SIP and ozone control purposes. The revised definition will apply in the Chicago ozone nonattainment area pursuant to the 40 CFR 52.741(a)(3) definition of volatile organic material or volatile organic compound. States are not obligated to exclude from control as a VOC those compounds that EPA has found to be negligibly reactive. However, States should not include these compounds in their VOC emissions inventories for determining reasonable further progress under the Act (e.g., section 182(b)(1)) and may not take credit for controlling these compounds in their ozone control strategy. Further, these negligibly-reactive compounds may not be used for emissions netting (e.g., 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2)(c)), offsetting (40 CFR appendix S), or trading with reactive VOC (Emissions Trading Policy Statement, 51 FR 43814, December 4, 1986 and Economic Incentive Program Rules, 59 FR 16690, April 7, 1994). In addition, corrections are made to the names of three compounds which have previously been exempted from the definition of VOC: 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (CFC&hyph;113) is changed to 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (CFC&hyph;113); chlorodifluoromethane (CFC&hyph;22) is changed to chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC&hyph;22); and trifluoromethane (FC&hyph;23) is changed to trifluoromethane (HFC&hyph;23). These changes are corrections to nomenclature only and are not substantive. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it relaxes current regulatory requirements rather than imposing new ones. The EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is, therefore, not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review. This action does not contain any information collection requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Assuming this rulemaking is subject to section 317 of the Act, the Administrator concludes, weighing the Agency's limited resources and other duties, that it is not practicable to conduct an extensive economic impact assessment of today's action since the rule promulgated today will relax current regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the Administrator simply notes that any costs of complying with today's action, any inflationary or recessionary effects of the regulation, and any impact on the competitive standing of small businesses, on consumer costs, or on energy use, will be less than or at least not more than the impact that existed before today's action.
