FR941216-1-00170 FR941216-1-00015 B. Part D Requirements Before the moderate nonattainment area may be redesignated to attainment, the Commonwealth must have fulfilled the applicable requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O 3 nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area is classified as moderate (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.318). The Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted the request for redesignation of the moderate nonattainment area on November 12, 1993. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment, the Commonwealth of Kentucky must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c) and 176, and is also required to meet the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D, specifically sections 182(a) and (b). a. Subpart 1 of Part D Under section 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator, but no later than three years after an area has been designated to nonattainment. EPA had not determined that these requirements were applicable to classified ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1993, the date that the Commonwealth of Kentucky submitted a complete redesignation request for the Kentucky portion of the Ashland-Huntington nonattainment area. Therefore, the Commonwealth was not required to meet these requirements for purposes of redesignation. Upon the redesignation of this area to attainment, the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) provisions contained in part C of title I are applicable. On January 25, 1978, September 1, 1989, November 6, 1989, November 13, 1989, November 28, 1989, February 7, 1990, and June 23, 1994, the EPA approved revisions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky's PSD program (43 FR 3360, 54 FR 36307, 54 FR 46613, 54 FR 47211, 54 FR 488887, 55 FR 4169 and 59 FR 32343). Section 176(c) of the CAA requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable state SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by states must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the CAA required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the state revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the implementation of Title I informed states that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date [ see 57 FR 13498t 13557 (April 16, 1992)]. The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA Section 175A. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the Commonwealth of Kentucky is required to submit SIP revisions containing transportation and general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994 and December 1, 1994, respectively. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(V) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request. On July 21, 1994, the Commonwealth of Kentucky revised their maintenance plan to commit to revise the SIP by November 25, 1994, to be consistent with the final Federal regulations on conformity. In addition, the Division for Air Quality and the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet are cooperating in adopting regulations consistent with the final conformity regulation. b. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182 The CAA was amended on November 15, 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. EPA was required to classify O 3 nonattainment areas according to the severity of their problem. On November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694), the Ashland-Huntington metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was designated as moderate O 3 nonattainment. Because the Ashland-Huntington area is a moderate O 3 nonattainment area, it is required to have met the requirements of sections 182(a), (b) and (f) of the CAA. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined which requirements have been met and for which requirements further action is required. In the instances where further action is required, SIP revisions meeting those requirements must be fully approved in order for EPA to find that all the applicable requirements of the CAA have been met. Thus, final approval of this redesignation is contingent upon the final approval of the additional SIP submittals described below.
