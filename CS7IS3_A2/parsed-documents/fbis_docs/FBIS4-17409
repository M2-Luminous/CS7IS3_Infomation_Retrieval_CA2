Leading experts of the State Duma and of the Leningrad Oblast government, representatives of design bureaus, and environmental and financial organizations took part in these hearings on the construction of a major port complex in the Russian northeast. Speaking of the economic importance of the new port, experts recalled that due to the absence of communications networks allowing a quick access to wold markets, $16 billion that could be earned through exports are being "mothballed." Ilya Baskin, chairman of the bord of directors of the Ust-Luga joint-stock society, told ITAR-TASS that the project's total cost is $2 billion and that the port will be built within five to six years. He said that the society is now actively establishing the environmental monitoring system, building a complex of water- cleansing and environmentally safe installations, creating a network of mobile facilities for industrial waste disposal, and building housing for specialists. The deputies' corps approved, by and large, the project to build the port in the Ust-Luga firth of the Gulf of Finland. The joint- stock society Ust-Luga has been advised, however, to take notice of all possible environmental consequences of this human intervention into this region of Russia's maritime northwest.
