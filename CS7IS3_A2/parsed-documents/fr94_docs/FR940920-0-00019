Section 63.164 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: §63.164 Standards: Compressors. * * * * * (c) The barrier fluid shall not be in light liquid service. * * * * * 10. Section 63.165 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (d) and (e) as paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2), respectively, and revising them to read as follows: §63.165 Standards: Pressure relief devices in gas/vapor service. * * * * * (d)(1) Any pressure relief device that is equipped with a rupture disk upstream of the pressure relief device is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, provided the owner or operator complies with the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (2) After each pressure release, a rupture disk shall be installed upstream of the pressure relief device as soon as practicable, but no later than 5 calendar days after each pressure release, except as provided in §63.171 of this subpart. 11. Section 63.168 is amended by revising paragraph (e)(1) and by revising paragraph (h)(2) to read as follows: §63.168 Standards: Valves in gas/vapor service and in light liquid service. * * * * * (e)(1) Percent leaking valves at a process unit shall be determined by the following equation: %V L =(V L /(V T +V C ))×100 where: %V L =Percent leaking valves. V L =Number of valves found leaking excluding nonrepairables as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. V T =Total valves monitored, in a monitoring period excluding valves monitored as required by (f)(3) of this section. V C =Optional credit for removed valves=0.67 × net number (i.e., total removed^total added) of valves in organic HAP service removed from process unit after the date set forth in §63.100(k) of subpart F for existing process units, and after the date of initial start-up for new sources. If credits are not taken, then V C =0. * * * * * (h) *␣*␣* (2) The owner or operator of the valve has a written plan that requires monitoring of the valve as frequently as practicable during safe-to-monitor times, but not more frequently than the periodic monitoring schedule otherwise applicable. * * * * * 12. Section 63.169 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (c)(3), and (d) to read as follows: §63.169 Standards: Pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in heavy liquid service; instrumentation systems; and pressure relief devices in liquid service. (a) Pumps, valves, connectors, and agitators in heavy liquid service, pressure relief devices in light liquid or heavy liquid service, and instrumentation systems shall be monitored within 5 calendar days by the method specified in §63.180(b) of this subpart if evidence of a potential leak is found by visual, audible, olfactory, or any other detection method. If a potential leak is repaired as required in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, it is not necessary to monitor the system for leaks by the method specified in §63.180(b) of this subpart. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (3) For equipment identified in paragraph (a) of this section that is not monitored by the method specified in §63.180(b) of this subpart, repaired shall mean that the visual, audible, olfactory, or other indications of a leak have been eliminated; that no bubbles are observed at potential leak sites during a leak check using soap solution; or that the system will hold a test pressure. (d) First attempts at repair include, but are not limited to, the practices described under §§63.163(c)(2) and 63.168(g) of this subpart, for pumps and valves, respectively. 13. Section 63.171 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: §63.171 Standards: Delay of repair. * * * * * (e) Delay of repair beyond a process unit shutdown will be allowed for a valve if valve assembly replacement is necessary during the process unit shutdown, valve assembly supplies have been depleted, and valve assembly supplies had been sufficiently stocked before the supplies were depleted. Delay of repair beyond the second process unit shutdown will not be allowed unless the third process unit shutdown occurs sooner than 6 months after the first process unit shutdown. 14. Section 63.172 is amended by revising paragraphs (b) and (k)(2) to read as follows:
