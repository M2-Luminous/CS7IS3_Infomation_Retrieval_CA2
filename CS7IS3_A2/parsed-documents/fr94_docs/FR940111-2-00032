FR940111-2-00032 FR940111-2-00017 II. Penalty Authority Section 402(b)(2)(B) of the CWA requires an authorized state program to have authority to inspect, monitor, enter, and require reports to at least the same extent as required by section 308 of the CWA. Section 402(b)(7) of the CWA requires an authorized state program to have adequate authority to abate violations of permits or the permit program through penalties and other means of enforcement. EPA State NPDES program requirements at 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i) provide that an approved state program is to have the authority to recover civil penalties for the violation of ``any NPDES filing requirement'' and ``any duty to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities,'' as well as for the violation of any NPDES permit condition or any regulation or order issued by the state program director. As outlined in EPA's September 1, 1993, Federal Register notice and August 27, 1993 newspaper notices, South Dakota does not have direct statutory authority to collect civil penalties, or criminally enforce, a failure to comply with SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44 (record-keeping), 34A&hyph;2&hyph;45 and &hyph;46 (inspection authorities), due to a lack of citation to SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;75 (penalty provision) in these sections. However, because the Department [of Environment and Natural Resources] can prosecute (both civilly and criminally) violations of permit conditions and because it can set permit conditions for recording, reporting, monitoring, entry, and inspection under 34A&hyph;2&hyph;40, it can enforce these statutes for permitted facilities. The Department can, with regard to unpermitted facilities, obtain both the records and entry for inspections pursuant to search warrants issued on the basis of the criminal provisions of SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;75 and the violation of SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;36 (operating without the required permit). Civil penalties for failure to comply with SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46 by an unpermitted facility are available only through violation of an order issued by the Department pursuant to SDCL 34A&hyph;2&hyph;53. A. Comments Favoring Existing Penalty Authority The DENR and various members of the regulated community expressed opinions that the lack of a direct authority to impose penalties for violations of the cited statutes would have little affect on the ability of the State to exact penalties for failure to comply with the statutes. One commenter from the regulated community thought that no detrimental effects would be expected and, therefore, the system for collecting penalties was adequate until such time as the matter was corrected by the legislative process. The Secretary of the DENR noted that the Attorney General's Statement indicated that reporting requirements will be included in the permit, and are therefore enforceable for permitted facilities. As to unpermitted facilities, the Secretary of the DENR (who would be the party issuing orders) stated that the DENR could issue an enforcement order in a timely manner to require any necessary reporting or sampling and that the DENR could enforce these orders. The Secretary also cited a recent water pollution enforcement case settlement which included a penalty of $489,000 and was accomplished without the authority to enforce any NPDES condition or requirement. He stated that delegation would only increase the abilities of the DENR to enforce violations of the state's environmental laws. Another state agency noted that ``It appears␣*␣*␣* that the case where this EPA concern would be applicable is for facilities that are discharging without a permit and not keeping records. For these facilities, failure to have a permit would be a more severe violation than the failure to keep records.'' One commenter thought that penalties for items normally found in a permit should not begin to accrue for an unpermitted facility until after the state issues an order. B. Comments Criticizing Existing Penalty Authority Those who criticized the existing authority were the pretreatment coordinator for a municipal treatment facility and one environmental group. They questioned the ability of the authority to stand up to judicial review and the round-about means the DENR would have to use to exercise the authority in collecting penalties. One commenter expressed the opinion that the state's authority to collect penalties from unpermitted facilities is not clear, particularly in light of the Freeman v. South Dakota lawsuit. In that case, the court found that Mr. Freeman's civil rights were violated when, upon refusing State health inspectors entry, he was served with a closure order. The commenter stated that the finding was made because the citation under licensure statutes failed to cite an enforcement provision. An environmental group indicated that the State's roundabout legal reasoning to support its authority to obtain records and entry to inspect at unpermitted facilities may be overlooked by a judge faced with what appears to be a clear failure to provide for criminal and civil sanctions for record-keeping or inspection violations. Specific penalty provision language must be added to 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46 in order to comply with 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i). Another environmental organization stated that the state should have direct statutory authority to collect civil penalties and to criminally enforce a failure to comply with Sec. 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44. They also noted that the MOA should require South Dakota to adopt less round-about methods to obtain records and entry and to be able to do so without the DENR having to issue an order. They believed that formal issuance of orders and search warrants can take too much time. C. EPA's Response to Comments on Penalty Authority EPA's authorization regulations require civil penalties to be recoverable for the violation of any NPDES permit condition; any NPDES filing requirement; any duty to allow or carry out inspection, entry or monitoring activities; or any regulation or orders issued by the State Director. See 40 CFR 123.27(a)(3)(i). The State has demonstrated an adequate authority and methodology for collecting penalties from permitted and unpermitted facilities. However, EPA would recommend a legislative amendments to 34A&hyph;2&hyph;44, &hyph;45, and &hyph;46 to define failure to comply with each as a violation enforceable through 34A&hyph;2&hyph;53. These amendments would allow a more direct, and thereby more effective, implementation of the enforcement program.
