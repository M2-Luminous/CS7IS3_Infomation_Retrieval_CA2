Mediation spokesman former U.S. Secretary of State Dr Henry Kissinger told the conference, which was attended by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and ANC Natal Premier Jacob Zuma, the country was worth the trouble. "This is a country that's suffered like few others; been divided like few others...it's worth the dedication and effort." Mr Kissinger said that if anybody had told him when at the time of Zimbabwe's independence he would be in South Africa 18 years later, "with apartheid a memory," he would have thought the person crazy. He said he had met both ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Mr Buthelezi in previous years. Mr Mandela was "one of the great figures of the epoch...and I remember how passionately Mr Buthelezi criticised the government and the institutions of that time". With a nod also at Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha who attended the conference on behalf of the government, Mr Kissinger praised the "truly heroic effort by the chief actors to overcome their memories, their suffering and doubts". Mr Buthelezi said in his address his party was entering the mediation process with expectation but also with trepidation. The country was divided by a deep wound which had to be healed before elections. "The spirit of a miracle must emerge," he said.
