We have followed the gringos' steps in their everyday life. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Why did you come this weekend to Juanchaco? [Unidentified woman] Because I wanted to see what the gringos had done. I wanted to see them and to see whether it was true that they were here and what they had done. [end recording] Indeed, tourists to the area, whose numbers have increased by nearly 35 percent, are coming to see -- practically to supervise -- the work of these U.S. soldiers, which for the people is still a mystery. For the inhabitants, it represents a genuine invasion. The work under way in this lot, which is located approximately 2 km from the urban area of Juanchaco, begins at 0700. Tourists and inhabitants of the area are denied access to this place. Some soldiers operate machines, while others remain on the make-shift landing strip that will service small airplanes and helicopters. Supposedly, small aircraft will be able to land here to bring materials that might be needed for the little school and the health center. Even while the U.S. soldiers guard this place, they enjoy the exotic sights of Colombia. The North Americans only speak among themselves. They barely even speak to the Colombian soldiers. [Begin recording] [Reporter] What do you do here? [Unidentified Colombian soldier] I provide security for the gringos, follow them wherever they go, and check on them. [end recording] It is precisely these people -- the Colombian soldiers -- who paradoxically have to prevent the gringos from coming in contact with the Colombian press. [Begin recording] [Reporter in English] Where is the school? [Unidentified Colombian soldier, moving away from camera] Miss, please. [end recording] The North Americans' work ends at 1700, when they return to the dock to leave for Bahia Malaga. What these people are doing, or not doing, in Colombia is still a mystery. The only thing that is true is that what we have shown you is the daily routine they will carry out at least until the end of February, when they very well could still be in Colombia.
