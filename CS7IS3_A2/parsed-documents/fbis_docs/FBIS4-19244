Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has probably realized that "materiel aid" to Turkey (tanks and ammunition from the stocks of the GDR's National People's Army at a value of 1.5 billion marks) was a mistake. This mistake cannot be rectified, but one can avoid continuing it. This is, in short, the contents of yesterday's government statement. Turkey's promise not to use the weapons against the Kurds was worth little right from the very beginning. Even if it had been kept: These deliveries would have enabled the Turks to withdraw their own military equipment from other parts of the country and to use it in Kurdistan. Thus, German armament aid was not "Kurd-neutral" right from the start; by the way, this also applies to NATO defense aid to Turkey. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry should not try to save itself from the maelstrom of the conflict with silly hairsplitting: Photographs from Kurdistan do indeed show German tanks, it is admitted now, but the tanks are not shown shooting to kill.... As if this mattered! The arms deliveries were a mistake -- which, of course, provided economic profit: The export was much cheaper than scrapping the tanks in Germany. The Federal Government now has a special obligation: It must energetically advocate an acceptable minority policy in Turkey: The European Union should send a commissioner to the Kurdish area, and Turkey must understand that the association negotiations depend on concessions in this area.
