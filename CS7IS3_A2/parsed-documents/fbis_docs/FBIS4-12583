FBIS4-12583 "drnes069_l_94004" FBIS-NES-94-069 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Ministers Hint Closure Intended To Pressure 'Arafat Ministers Hint Closure Intended To Pressure 'Arafat TA1104051994 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 0400 GMT 11 Apr 94 TA1104051994 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Excerpts] Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet that the closure of the territories, ordered after last week's wave of terror attacks, will continue until further notice. The cabinet decided to bring in about 18,000 foreign workers to replace Palestinian laborers in Israel and to subsidize 4,000 Israeli workers in agriculture. Jack Katzenell gave us this report: [Begin recording] [Katzenell] All the cabinet ministers agree that the territories will be closed off at least until after Independence Day, and it takes place on Thursday [14 April]. It is on what happens after then that they disagree. Minister of Culture and Communications Shulamit Aloni said the acts of a few terrorists do not entitle the government to punish nearly 2 million Palestinians. [passage omitted] However, Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet his long-term aim is to reduce Israel's dependence on Palestinian workers not only until the agreement with the PLO is implemented but until it has proven itself -- in other words, until the number of Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israelis has dropped in the wake of the establishment of Palestinian autonomy. Economic Planning Minister Shim'on Shetrit later told reporters this could mean weeks or even years. Minister of Agriculture Ya'aqov Tzur said: I believe the closure is for a long time; Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer said: I believe there is an intention to leave it as it is, even after the implementation of the agreement. A number of ministers hinted that the closure would be used as a means of pressure against Yasir 'Arafat to get him to speed up the negotiations. This view was expressed both by hawks like Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer and doves like Labor and Welfare Minister Ora Namir. [Namir] I do believe that it will bring the PLO to come as soon as possible to Gaza and to Jericho and to take command of the security of the people that are living there. In Israel, the key to the process of peace is security. [Katzenell] And Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet that the closure will be accompanied by a diplomatic drive to complete the negotiations as soon as possible. [end recording]
