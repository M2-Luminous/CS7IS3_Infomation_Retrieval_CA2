In particular Bergman presented a copy of a document on service investigation into the case of Major Antyufeyev (Vadim Shevtsov's real name -- SEGODNYA) as an officer of the Riga OMON special police force. This document, signed by Shteynbrik, then head of the Latvian Internal Affairs Ministry, attributes a number of official misdemeanors to Antyufeyev. In addition, Colonel Bergman showed TV viewers a documentary film about the involvement of the Dniester Moldovan Republic's security officers, including Shevtsov, in the October 1993 events in Moscow. The reaction from the authorities of the unrecognized Dniester Moldovan Republic to the attack by Mr. Bergman, who is engaged in a protracted propaganda war with the "corrupt top" in Tiraspol, was like lightning. The local press published letters by Antyufeyev-Shevtsov's co-officers, including the above mentioned Gen. Shteynbrik and former Riga OMON commander Sergey Parfenov. Addressing Dniester Moldovan Republic President Igor Smirnov, they unanimously defended the honor and dignity of their colleague, who was awarded an order in 1990. Observers believe that a new peak of confrontation between the Dniester Moldovan Republic leadership and Mr. Bergman, who is seen to be a front man for 14th Army Commander Lieutenant General Lebed, is the result of a recent reorganization in the Dniester Moldovan Republic's power structures. The State Security Ministry and the Internal Affairs Ministry were merged into a single superstructure -- the Committee for Republican Security headed by Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeyev), former Riga OMON officer and chief of the Dniester state security service. Such an obvious consolidation in the positions of a person who is considered to be a personal enemy of Army commander Lebed and Col. Bergman (the latter have been working for the last year and a half to get Shevtsov removed from his post and put on trial -- SEGODNYA), could not but evoke corresponding reaction from the 14th Army. Mr. Shevtsov and his structure are the most solid base for the current Dniester Moldovan Republic leadership. Shevtsov's removal will create favorable conditions for a reshuffle in the Tiraspol top echelon and for its penetration by people amenable to General Lebed and those standing behind him.
