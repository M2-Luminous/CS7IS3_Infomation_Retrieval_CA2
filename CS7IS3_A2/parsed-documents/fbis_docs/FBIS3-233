Today, more than ever before, the news blackout was reinforced in Lusaka. The only information that our correspondent in Lusaka was able to obtain is that the negotiating teams continue to meet and in view of the time they took for discussions [words indistinct]. Pedro Manuel reports. Good evening! The press was not able to obtain any kind of information on the peace talks between the government and UNITA today. This is because, first, the morning session lasted more than usual and second, after this afternoon's session, the negotiating teams began to hold their own meetings, which are still going on. According to reports, the parties are expected to once and for all conclude discussions on specific principles and modalities of national reconciliation. The information that only two points remain to be discussed in this topic, has not been denied yet. What is more, in view of today's intense movement it is very probable that the mediators have set a deadline to reach an agreement on national reconciliation. Sources here say the parties have already reached agreements on issues such as administrative decentralization and UNITA's participation in the country's administration.
