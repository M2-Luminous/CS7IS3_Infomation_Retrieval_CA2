The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] subcouncil on defense yesterday said the 10,000-strong force would be deployed in election hot-spots by the end of March. The AVF leader has reiterated that his organization rejects all TEC structures as a waste of taxpayers' money and energy, because he says they try to solve South Africa's problems in a one-sided manner. Viljoen says the country's police and defense force's command structure should not be tampered with, because they stand [word indistinct]. Meanwhile, the Conservative Party [CP] says it won't recognize the authority of the command structure of the national peace-keeping force or joint defense force. CP deputy leader Willie Snyman says the peace-keeping force will fall under the complete control of the TEC's subcouncil on defense and Snyman says the TEC, which is the product of multiparty talks, is nothing but a seizure of power by communist terrorists. He says therefore the CP does not recognize the powers of the TEC and the powers and actions of the comnmand structure of the national peace keeping force.
