FBIS3-50698 "drlat004_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 Jan 1994 MEXICO Government Denies ETA `Mafia' Presence PA3112003293 Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 30 Dec 93 PA3112003293 Mexico City XEW Television Network Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN ["Text" of bulletin released by the Mexican Government Secretariat on 29 December; from the "24 Hours" newscast] [Text] The Government Secretariat rejects the charges published in the headlines of the 28 and 29 December issues of the Spanish newspaper ABC which say that the ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] mafia network is established in Mexico. The Secretariat rejects these charges, because there is no evidence, much less suspicion, to support these claims. On the contrary, what is evident is the disproportionate tone in which the matter is discussed in the report which seems to be a typical case of yellow journalism aimed at forcing the government to take forceful measures disregarding individual guarantees. With regard to the reports in question, the Government Secretariat wants to make it very clear that they are not based on facts or official statements. They are only based on the assumptions of the journalist who wrote the report, based on informal interviews with public officials during his visit to Mexico. The Government Secretariat does not acknowledge the truth of the headlines, headlines that assert that the ETA mafia has established itself in Mexico through business fronts for international terrorism or that ETA is establishing a sanctuary in Mexico to finance itself through kidnapping and extortion. Thus, it is also not true that the ETA has established an operations' base in the States of Mexico, Guanajuato, and Queretaro. These reports claim Mexican authorities possess important leads on businesses connected to the weapon's cache found in Managua, a few months ago. This is also false. It is true that we investigated a report which connected Mexican citizens who work at a consultant firm with the Managua arsenal. Based on this, the reporter assumes the existence of Mexican businesses connected not only with the ETA but with other international terrorist groups. It is true that Basque citizens have legally resided in Mexico since their admission in the early 1980's. However, one cannot surmise, as Mr. Jesus Maria Zuluaga does with exaggerated irresponsibility, that they are terrorists and much less ETA mafia members as he calls them. One must reiterate that concerning matters of legal residence, the Government Secretariat does not pass judgment on the basis of the political preferences of foreign residents in Mexico. It only asks them to meet legal requirements, and acts on the basis of irrefutable evidence and fully respects the human rights of its residents. Regarding Mexico's immigration policy, it is very conscientious and demands adherence to all legal regulations. At the same time, it is open to reciprocal agreements facilitating the exchange of persons, for tourism and commercial purposes. The benefits granted by these reciprocal agreements must not be confused with a lack of strictness in the admission of foreigners into Mexico. In conclusion, the Government Secretariat reiterates that the corresponding authorities scrupulously watch over the nation's security and that, under no circumstances, will illegal activities be permitted. In the case of accusations against foreigners, these must not be groundless, and no actions will be taken based on prejudice or political differences that are foreign to this country.
