Only integration within the framework of the Commonwealth can assuage the controversy around the problems of the Russian-speaking population in the "near abroad", the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's department for CIS affairs Leonid Drachevskiy stated in Moscow on Friday. He spoke at a seminar on the problems of the Russian-speaking population in "the near abroad" organized by the Russian Foreign Ministry. In the diplomat's opinion, "it is necessary to accelerate the implementation of the treaty on economic union." "Unfortunately, many of the agreements attached to that treaty are not working. The problem is that they were concluded sporadically. As a result, their implementation was not carried out in stages as required", he noted. Drachevskiy also spoke in favor of "intensifying" work on the creation of a collective security system. "Obviously, the borders within the Commonwealth should be transparent. Only outer frontiers of the CIS should be thoroughly guarded. So far we have signed such agreements only with Central Asian republics," he said. Drachevskiy particularly noted that negotiations with the CIS countries on dual citizenship "regularly get into impasse." "Many experts justifiably believe that in our conditions dual citizenship generates more questions, than answers. Obviously, it would be reasonable to consider some intermediate option envisaging "special regime of citizenship" within the CIS. This means that a citizen of one state would not be considered as a foreigner on the territory of other state, but would have all rights with small "exception", for example, the right to vote", the diplomat pointed out. He expressed confidence that these steps would "have a positive influence on the plight of Russians living in the near abroad." The strategic task of Russia is "to keep all Euroasian territory of the former Soviet Union if not under control, then under strong influence." This opinion was expressed by a representative of the association for ties with foreign compatriots "Russkiye Zoriy" Gennadiy Mozhayev who spoke at the seminar. In his view, the 21st century will be come "a century of fighting for energy sources." "That is why the preservation of its influence on the territory of the former Soviet Union is a vitally important task for Russia. From this point of view it's an advantage for us to have a big number of Russians in the near abroad", he said. Mozhayev also spoke in favor of setting up an All-Russian state foundation on support of Russians living in the CIS countries. Russia's senior adviser at the United Nations in New York Aleksandr Denisov, a spokesman for the Congress of Russian Communities has said that "not only CIS but the Baltic states are a zone of special political, military and strategic interests for Russia." There can be no talk "about any migration of ethnic Russians from CIS countries. The Russians must stay wherever they are historically strong and should be only economically supported", Denisov said. In his opinion, the emerging Russian business is "a rather effective means for Russia to gain a foothold in CIS states." As an example, Denisov cited the fact that about 80% of entrepreneurs in Lithuania are Russians. "In other countries, the situation is similar. This potential need to be tapped", he stressed. Whatever happens, Russia must not allow "politicizing of its communities in the CIS." Such an opinion has been voiced by Russia's ex Foreign Minister Shelov-Kovedyayev, a co-chairman of "The Russian Club", an international non-governmental organization. "To employ these people for gaining influence as a "fifth column" is not only corrupt and inhumane but dangerous for them, as we know from world history", he stressed. According to Shelov-Kovedyayev, one of the main problems, facing the Russians in the CIS is the economic one. So, they should be supported in every way to forestall their massive migration. That would be much cheaper than to accommodate millions of resettlers in Russia.
