The government's efforts were concentrated on pursuing a moderately tough monetary-credit policy, continuing the process of privatization, implementing a package of measures to provide the population with social support, broadening the autonomy of the regions, carrying out institutional transformations, developing relations with the CIS member states, and further liberalizing foreign economic activity. However, a number of important tasks in the socioeconomic sphere were not tackled. Last year negative trends persisted, manifesting themselves in a decline in industrial and agricultural production, stoppages at many enterprises, continuing financial crisis, a marked drop in investment activity, the preservation of an irrational national economic structure, and a drop in the standard of living of certain population groups. The situation did not improve in January and February 1994. The government is caused particular concern by problems linked with the untimely payment of wages, the drastic deterioration in enterprises' solvency, the continuing high level of inflation, and the increase in crime. The adoption of the Russian Federation [RF] Constitution by national ballot 12 December 1993 created the preconditions for the continuation and development of economic reform based on coordinated interaction between Russian legislative and executive bodies. The government sees its main task as being to ensure the fulfillment in 1994 of the RF Council of Ministers-Government Program for 1993-1995 "Developing Reforms and Stabilizing the Russian Economy."

The plan includes the drafting as soon as possible of concrete normative acts -- draft laws, RF presidential edicts, and government decrees designed to tackle social and regional problems, questions of monetary-credit policy, institutional and structural transformations, agrarian policy, foreign economic activity, defense of citizens' rights and freedoms, and the fight against crime.
