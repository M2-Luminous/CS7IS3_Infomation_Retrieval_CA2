We were not surprised by the dialogue, which involved the use of chairs, at this complex. The winds of democracy have not yet reached the ranks and the organization of these political forces. Democratic dialogue is lacking among them. Likewise, we will not be surprised by fresh dialogues using other tools, including, perhaps, bullets, exactly like what has frequently happened in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank, and also similar to what happened earlier in Lebanon. We frequently cautioned against the infiltration by external forces and organizations into our official, popular, and trade union institutions. These forces would pursue activities that have nothing to do with the Jordanian people's issues, problems, and concerns. Moreover, the rallies and interests of these forces have no room for Jordanian national occasions. We also frequently cautioned against turning Jordan into a hotbed of tension or a heated arena for conflicts and battles among non-Jordanian organizations and forces which are not interested in safeguarding this country's security and stability. We are very afraid that the phenomenon of quarreling by chair will escalate and become a fiercer fight using more dangerous tools. We are also very afraid that Fatah, which is now preparing to assume the self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho, will deliberately settle its accounts with the Palestinian opposition wherever it is present, including Jordan, so the opposition in Gaza and Jericho would not be able to undermine Fatah's authority, paralyze its capabilities, or upset it. We wish that a constructive democratic dialogue would have been initiated between the Palestinian leadership and its supporters on the one hand and all opposition factions and forces on the other in order to close the Palestinian ranks and unify the Palestinian position. Conflicts and settling of accounts by force and violence will weaken the Palestinian position and undermine the security and stability of the hosting states. When the spark of violence is triggered, it will not be easy to put it out or circumvent its repercussions.
