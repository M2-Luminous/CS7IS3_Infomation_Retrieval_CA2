Despite their promises, the Western countries refrained -- overtly and disastrously -- from supporting the uprising of the deprived people against Saddam, thus thwarting its success. If the opponents of the Iraqi regime were to seriously help them, Saddam's downfall would be very near. Commenting on the 'Id al-Fitr address by Saddam Husayn on Iraqi television, GUARDIAN correspondent David Hearst wrote that Saddam showed clear signs of weakness and exhaustion which, according to one of Saddam's advisers, had never been perceived before. This unnamed high-level adviser who has joined the enemy camp expressed concern that since Saddam can now see the end of his tenure approaching, he may well do something insane like his attack on Iran or the occupation of Kuwait. Saddam's demented and heretical actions and his sense of the approaching end of his power may motivate him to attack the Kurd-inhabited safe havens in the north, the oil-rich southern areas of Kuwait, or even sensitive regions, including Saudi territory. The first scenario would not prove very beneficial for him, because of the aerial and military protection by the Western countries for the Kurd-inhabited areas. In the event he attacks the southern areas, it is possible that he could use them as a lever to gain concessions from the Arab countries of the region, Kuwait in particular. [passage omitted] Saddam's personal health and poor morale aside, David Hearst believes that the UN embargoes against Iraq have undermined the administrative and political setup more than the financial and economic sectors, which will eventually result in this country's foundations degenerating from within. Saddam Husayn referred to the economic embargoes more than any other issue in his 'Id al-Fitr address. Saddam had hoped to forge better relations once Clinton was in power, considering his hostility to former U.S. President George Bush. He also hoped to gain U.S. consent for the economic sanctions to be reduced. He has failed in this and has been forced to look to Russia, the PRC, and France for trade and investments. As a result of the current economic pressure the exchange rate of the Iraqi dinar, which is officially three dinars to the dollar, rose from 80 dinars to the dollar in the open market last year to the present 350-to-one. Even the newspaper BABIL, which is run by Saddam's son 'Udayy, has predicted that soon the dollar will rise to 500 dinars. On the other hand, more than $7.540 billion is being spent by the Iraqi government for essential goods and foodstuffs for the people, and then doled out in meager rations. Iraq gets $1.25 billion per annum from illegal and covert exports, which it uses mainly to buy weapons and advanced military equipment. It is said that Iraq has built up its military capability to 80 percent of what it was before the occupation of Kuwait. In his report, David Hearst concludes that if the city of al-Basrah were to be transformed into a safe haven similar to the Kurdish-inhabited areas in northern Iraq, Saddam's rule would end much sooner. Referring to the deployment of the Presidential Guard to the southern areas of Iraq, Hearst predicts that an attack on the south and the Persian Gulf region is a possibility which Saddam might insanely embark upon as his regime approaches its end.
