Jean Francois Girard, director general of health in the French Ministry of Social Affairs, Health and City, told a news conference that the one-day summit will bring together heads of at least 17 nations to consider ways to fight the AIDS epidemic on a global level. "Till now, health problems have been treated by doctors, but AIDS is too serious to be treated only by doctors," Girard said. "For the first time in the history of the world, heads of government will be considering a health problem. It will be a historic turning point." Girard visited the Health and Welfare Ministry on Monday and the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday to explain the goals and solicit participation. He said the 17 countries to be invited include those whose contribution to the international fight against AIDS is the greatest. Among them are Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Russia, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. He said United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has indicated he would like to attend. Girard said several international organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the World Bank will have input into planning the summit agenda. He said experts in many other AIDS-affected countries who are not invited will be consulted at the preparatory stage. French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will chair the summit, for which no final date has been set. The gathering was originally scheduled for June, but Girard said it was postponed because many heads of state could not come in June and because Japan will host an international meeting of AIDS experts, including doctors, researchers, and AIDS sufferers, in Yokohama in August. About 10,000 people from more than 140 countries, including some 1,000 AIDS patients and carriers of the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus, are expected to attend the Yokohama meeting. Girard said the Paris AIDS summit will be able to capitalize on decisions made at the Yokohama conference.
