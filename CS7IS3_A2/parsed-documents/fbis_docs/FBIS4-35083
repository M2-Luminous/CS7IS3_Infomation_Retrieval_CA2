Interior Secretary General Rodolfo Ulloa announced that this was a pledge made to cattlemen and ranch owners, who, last Friday, began demonstrations in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state capital. The pledge supercedes the request made to the Mexican Army to intervene and clear the properties, Ulloa Flores stated, referring to the occupation of lands in the Chiapas conflict zone since 1 January. The state government turned down the request to investigate the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC) for the occupations "because it felt this action should be conducted through a direct request by the persons affected", he noted. The official added that the response to a list of demands submitted by cattlemen and ranch owners includes the continuation of negotiations in "appropriate" cases involving farms that were taken over before 14 April. The negotiations, he said, involve sales, relocations, or evictions from lands occupied before 14 April, which is when the government, cattlemen, ranch owners, and CEOIC, signed an agreement banning occupations as of that date. Evictions will occur if relocation agreements are not reached with squatters on properties that were occupied before that date and have not been put up for sale. He explained that these operations will conclude on 31 August. Ulloa Flores said that on Monday, the payment of compensatory rent was agreed upon to cover damages caused between the date of the occupation and the date of the eviction or sale of the property. The official said the Chiapas Attorney General's Office was also instructed to review prior investigations of evictions, damages, thefts, and cattle rustling, and to hand out indictments. The secretary general added that the Chiapas government's response requests banking institutions to pay special attention to the owners of occupied lands. Last Friday, approximately 4,000 cattlemen and small-scale ranch owners began demonstrating outside the local town hall to demand a solution to the invasion of some 500 properties in the conflict zone and to overdue debts. The conflict began on 1 January when the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) took over towns to press Indian demands and fought the Mexican Army for 11 days in clashes that left 150 people dead. In late February and early March, the EZLN held a nine-day meeting with Manuel Camacho Solis, the then commissioner for peace and reconcilation in Chiapas, and on 12 June, reiterated its willingness to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict. The police have carried out evictions from dozens of properties this year in operations resulting in at least 100 arrests.
