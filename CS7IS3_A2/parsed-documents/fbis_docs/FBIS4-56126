It emerged in 1844 with the coming out of the Lyuboslovie journal of Renaissance man Konstantin Fotinov, published in Bulgarian while this country was still under Ottoman oppression. [passage omitted] Today, four years after the outset of the democratic changes in this country, politicians are unanimous that the press and speech now enjoy the freedom they have a right to. Last year saw over 800 periodicals which circulated a total of 600,000 to 700,000 copies, according to figures of the Rodina publishers, which prints the bulk of the periodicals in this country. A national representative survey of Gallup International found that the press now has a daily readership of some 2-3 million Bulgarians (of an 8 million population). The control over media is now in the limelight of Bulgarian journalism. The three national media -- the National Radio, the National TV and the Bulgarian News Agency (BTA) -- are now under the control of a parliamentary committee. For two years now radio and television have been working under a parliament-approved interim statute which places certain restrictions on the coverage of political processes and events in this country. The radio and TV bosses, too, are appointed by parliament. Sometimes, this stirs up heated controversies pertaining to the freedom of these institutions, as was the case with the dismissal of National TV boss Asen Agov and BTA Director General Ivo Indzhev by a restructured parliament. The rivalry between the political forces for control over the electronic media is most manifest during pre-election campaigns, when a special scheme for covering the activities of the different parties enters into effect. According to researchers, the electronic media shapes the public opinion more easily than the press and the public confidence it enjoys is greater. Private radio stations hit Bulgaria's airwaves more than an year ago but they broadcast in the FM frequency range and do not cover the whole of this country's territory. The 24 CHASA daily boasts the highest press run. This daily is published by the 168 Chasa Press Group, which is close to businessman Valentin Mollov's economic grouping. With its first issue that came out four years ago, it claimed its market niche and its circulation now is way ahead of the other dailies. The March 1994 figures of the Rodina publishers show it comes out in 250,000 copies per day. The second most read daily is DUMA, the daily of the Socialist Party and heir to the ex-Communists' RABOTNICHESKO DELO, which runs in about 110,000 copies a day. The DEMOKRATSIYA daily of the anti-communist Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS), which circulates a total of about 80,000 copies a day, comes immediately after. The past couple of years saw a number of new periodicals, most of which claim to be independent while being financed by influential economic and financial formations. One of them is STANDART NEWS, fourth in the list of dailies with a press-run of about 70,000 copies, which is financed by the Tron economic group. NOVINAR ranks sixth with about 63,000 copies a day, and KONTINENT ninth with 16,000 copies. These dailies, as well as the 168 CHASA publications, often come under fire of the SDS which attack them for their links with financial groupings running on capital with suspicious origin. SDS leader Filip Dimitrov labels them as "yellow," for carrying information only to be later disproved, and "pink," for their subscription to the stance of the former Communists. TRUD and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK were the only old-times dailies that survived the collapse of the communist regime. The former, once the daily of the official trade unions, is now private and close to one of Bulgaria's major labour organization, the Confederation of the Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. TRUD comes out in about 70,000 copies, and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK in 20,000.
