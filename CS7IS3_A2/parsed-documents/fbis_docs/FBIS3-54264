Our correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi has compiled the following report on the issue: [Begin recording] [Mu'addi] The U.S. economic delegation headed by Massachusetts Governor William Weld met with Faysal al-Husayni, economist Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, and Dr. Hazim al-Shunnar in east Jerusalem at noon today. The talks addressed economic issues, the means of developing the territories economically, and possible financial investment by U.S. firms in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This delegation is made up of representatives from 22 U.S. firms in various areas. At the conclusion of the meeting, Weld said that his visit is aimed at exploring investment opportunities in the region, particularly in the areas of tourism, financial investment, infrastructure development, and construction projects, such as hotels, communications facilities, and modern technologies. The delegation is comprised of representatives from 22 firms, he added. Weld noted that these firms are interested in developing the territories economically. [Weld, in English] We are looking for opportunities in areas, such as tourism, such as financial investments, possibly construction, either of infrastructure or hotels, telecommunications, and information technology. [Mu'addi] During the meeting, no agreements were signed between the two sides. Weld said he hoped that the U.S. firms will be able to make financial investments in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. [Weld, in English] We didn't sign any agreement in there. But we are hopeful that we will be able to participate in investments in the area, in the territories, in the West Bank and Gaza. [Mu'addi] During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on current issues, particularly the peace process. [Al-Husayni] As the governor has just said, this session of talks addressed political issues. Several questions and inquiries have been made about economic issues. Consequently, the talks were couched in generalities. I believe that it was positive. The delegation demonstrated a good understanding of the situation in the territories. [Mu'addi] Has the issue of investment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Massachusetts been raised? [Al-Husayni] Such details have not been discussed. I believe that such issues can be discussed in subsequent talks with businessmen and firms. [Mu'addi] Since you have recently returned from a visit to Saudi Arabia, could you tell us about the outcome of your visit? [Al-Husayni] I believe that the outcome is good and positive. Undoubtedly, it has helped improve and enhance the ties between Saudi Arabia and the PLO. We hope that the visit by brother President Yasir 'Arafat to Saudi Arabia will consummate the outcome reached during my visit. [Mu'addi] What about Saudi aid to citizens in the West Bank and Gaza Strip? [Al-Husayni] As a matter of fact, Saudi Arabia has always been concerned for aiding the Palestinians. I believe that now an opportunity has been created for greater and firmer support in light of the current developments we are experiencing, particularly with regard to Jerusalem. [Mu'addi] Faysal al-Husayni said he hoped that an agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians will be reached, and that both sides will embark on the implementation of the joint Declaration of Principles in the Gaza-Jericho First accord. [Al-Husayni] We hope that these talks will come to a successful conclusion so that we may embark on the implementation of the provisions pertaining to the interim phase, and so that we may have the opportunity to begin talks on the final status.
