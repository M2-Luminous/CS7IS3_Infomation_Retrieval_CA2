FR941020-2-00055 FR941020-2-00037 Office of Inspector General Program Exclusions: September 1994 AGENCY: Office of Inspector General, HHS. ACTION: Notice of program exclusions. During the month of September 1994, the HHS Office of Inspector General imposed exclusions in the cases set forth below. When an exclusion is imposed, no program payment is made to anyone for any items or services (other than an emergency item or service not provided in a hospital emergency room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an excluded party under the Medicare, Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and Block Grants to States for Social Services programs. In addition, no program payment is made to any business or facility, e.g., a hospital, that submits bills for payment for items or services provided by an excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain free to decide for themselves whether they will continue to use the services of an excluded party even though no program payments will be made for items and services provided by that excluded party. The exclusions have national effect and also apply to all other Federal non-procurement programs.
