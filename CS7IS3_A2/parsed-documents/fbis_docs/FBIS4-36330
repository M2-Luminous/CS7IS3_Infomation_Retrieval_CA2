The three men gunned down were all guests at the El Andalous hotel in the Eucalyptus district, a Moslem fundamentalist bastion of the capital, which was targetted on Monday night. The bomb placed in the boot of the vehicle then exploded, badly injuring three people and causing major damage, the newspaper reported. The blast was the third car bomb attack since Islamic extremists began a guerrilla war against the Algerian authorities early in 1992 and subsequently began targetting civilians as part of their campaign. More than 3,000 people are estimated to have been killed in battles between armed gangs and security forces and in terrorist attacks, which began after the army in January 1992 cancelled a general election the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
