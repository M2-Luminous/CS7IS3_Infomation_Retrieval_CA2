Looking at developments since then, I think there are two issues. The first is: Following conclusion of the U.S.-Japan summit on 11 February this year, I feel as if some of the Uruguay Round's results have been blown away. Why has the world trade atmosphere not improved, even though the Uruguay Round reached agreement? Is the United States not fully satisfied? Could it be that, because the results on "multi" (multilateral) issues were insufficient, domestic pressure was brought to bear on the "bi" [bilateral relationship with Japan.] The second issue: In contrast to meetings with global objectives such as the Uruguay Round, there are movements such as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) and the EU (European Union). The question is, in particular, how the Clinton administration will strategically tackle regional groupings such as NAFTA and, at the same time, tie them to APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation). What is your opinion? [Matsuura] I do not think the results of the Uruguay Round were blown away. The Uruguay Round has determined establishment of a new multifaceted trading system for goods and services. The decision to establish the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a part of it was a very significant result. As for the agreement establishing the WTO, which consolidated the results of the Uruguay Round, the target for implementation is 1 July 1995. But voices are becoming stronger urging a quickening of the pace. I hope each country will finish the necessary domestic procedures quickly so this agreement will come into effect; the WTO will start functioning from 1 July next year (sooner if possible); and disputes will be handled multilaterally. As for the situation surrounding the current U.S.-Japan framework talks, this is occuring during the interim between the Uruguay Round and initiation of the WTO. If the Uruguay Round had not been concluded it would have been much worse. It is regrettable that the negotiations centering on priority areas such as government procurement, insurance, and automobiles and automobile parts were not concluded by 11 February. But it does not mean the negotiations broke down. Although the United States came up with such tactics as the resurrection of the Super 301 clause, it has not yet decided what it will do to implement it. Japan is also trying independently to come up with a market-opening policy by the end of March. So, through these market opening measures, we need to do everything we can. [Okamatsu] As I look back at the seven years and three months since the start of the Uruguay Round negotiations, I think that, because GATT was set up to maintain the free economic sphere's unity, there was a period of stagnation because of the socialist sphere's disintegration. What made GATT go forward, however, was the increased regionalism in various places. There are NAFTA, the EC, and APEC, and if these had been left unchecked, there was the possibility that they would have formed blocs. I wonder if the centripetal force toward the Uruguay Round was revived because of apprehension about the formation of blocs. At the same time, developed countries, with limited financial and monetary resources for rebuilding the stagnant world economy, had great expectations for economic expansion which would be derived from establishment of this free trade structure. I think this is the first point we must keep in mind when we evaluate the Uruguay Round. [Kaji] I thought the Uruguay Round, rather than the U.S.-Japan framework talks, would not reach agreement. I think it was a very positive thing that the Uruguay Round reached agreement, not only for Japan, but also for the entire world economy. At a time when GATT was promoting free and nondiscriminatory multilateral economic relationships, the United States took the lead during the 1960's. But since the Tokyo Round in the 1970's, the United States has come to act in a not necessarily positive manner. As for the Uruguay Round, especially since the Clinton administration began, even among economists the theoretical argument has emerged that the benefit of free and non-discriminatory multi- lateralism need not be guaranteed under all circumstances. As such, there was a fear that the United States might stop supporting free trade principles. But this did not happen, so the scope for the future has opened up. GATT Going Through Changes [Nukazawa] I see that in the Uruguay Round, agreements were made with limited participants. It appears to me that the principle of MFN (most favored nation) has been lost. Does this mean that GATT has changed? [Matsuura] The GATT was an agreement that had a homogeneous economic structure and which was created with the advanced industrialized countries at its center. So if I may exaggerate, there was essentially no difference between reciprocity and MFN. But as developing countries and former communist countries began to join GATT, the homogeneous economy could no longer control it. In such a situation the use of MFN would have been excessive. So regrettably, reciprocity began to be favored. Theoretically, it is obvious the use of MFN would definitely be better, and with this leverage the United States could have utilized all the power it possessed. But U.S. power has relatively decreased, and reciprocity began to emerge when the United States adopted the idea of "give and take." But I do not think it is a good idea to give reciprocity too central a role. So in the Uruguay Round this time, we tried to restrain reciprocity, especially for the service trade and such, and tried to make use of MFN as much as possible. [Okamatsu] That is the fundamental issue concerning GATT. I was in Geneva for a week before the final stage of the negotiations. I remember that when I met Secretary General Sutherland, he asked me: "What do you think of financial reciprocity, which the United States is advocating?" I replied: "If we accept, it will be the death of GATT itself. Could such an idea exist in GATT? If we permit the existence of reciprocity which is discriminatory, it will be the end of GATT." He said: "I think so, too. I will never accept it." I think agreement was reached in the Uruguay Round this time because of the determination, in such a crisis, to try to make one more effort for a liberal system. As you pointed out, this time quite a few developing countries actively participated. As for the lowering of tariffs, which was GATT's original function, such countries as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, which in the past were not bound, have agreed to be. As for Indonesia, it will bind its tariff rates at 91 percent. This is a sign of their commitment to the liberal trade system. [Kaji] As Mr. Nukazawa said, the nature of GATT is clearly changing. But I feel its fundamental direction as an international organization has been maintained and this was guaranteed by the agreement. One reason the framework negotiations have turned out the way they have is that President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa are both different from past presidents and prime ministers in terms of their position in their respective nation's domestic political situation. In the United States Clinton is the first president born in the postwar era. Moreover, the international economy and the entire range of international relationships have changed drastically; all of this contributes to the impulse for change. As for the Japanese, the representatives differed from those who had been supported by the LDP majority. Such points might have been contributing factors for bringing about a very unusual situation. Where the Framework Talks Will Go -- Objective Criteria Have Taken Off on Their Own [Nukazawa] About the framework talks: Mr. Kaji, do you also take the position that we should not set numerical macroeconomic targets? [Kaji] On that point, first, I think that terms such as objective criteria and numerical targets took off on their own this time. Let us consider the macro indicators and micro indicators separately. As for the macro, assume for example, the United States were to recall the case of semiconductors and argue "we can do something similar again." The Japanese should take the position that the semiconductor case was one we should never repeat. From the start we thought it was a bad idea to consult on the market share of individual products between governments. As for macro indicators, when making earlier long-term economic plans, in some cases the Japanese Government published a numerical projection for the way the international balance should be. But since the early 1970's, setting the number has become very difficult. One reason is that, because foreign exchange has been changed to a floating system, to project exports and imports in dollar terms in three to five years has become difficult. Another reason is that when the U.S. balance-of-trade deficit became extremely large and Japan's proportion in it great, the reality was that half the deficit was with Japan. This made it impossible for Japan to determine the numerical figure by itself. I certainly think the Japanese surplus today is too large. It is too large in macroeconomic terms and too large with the United States. But it is not good simply to decide quantitatively to what extent we should reduce it. That is my position. [Matsuura] It is true that when we discuss numerical targets, we need to separate macro from micro. As for macro, so far as the U.S.-Japan negotiations are concerned, it was settled in July 1993. At that time, the United States was also seeking numerical indicators for macro--in other words, it wanted our global surplus in the current account balance to be reduced by half in terms of GDP ratio within three years (3.2 percent for 1992), or held below 2 percent of GDP. But Japan could not make such a commitment, and in the end, we agreed in the medium term to reduce the balance of our current account surplus in a meaningful way. What is important is that we make steady progress toward such a goal. Concrete policy measures should be implemented to stimulate domestic demand-oriented economic growth, and we should make steady progress toward such a medium-term goal by adopting a policy to further open markets. The issue is how to handle numerical targets for the micro area. At the beginning, the United States sought goals which had the characteristics of numerical targets. But its attitude changed in midcourse so as not to seek such targets. In fact, in his 11 February news conference, President Clinton declared the United States would not seek numerical goals. But the problem is the United States wants to establish objective criteria. In the negotiations, U.S. officials began mentioning that quantitative criteria were to be set up within the objective criteria to measure progress. But to measure results after-the-fact would not work. It meant, from our perspective, setting numerical targets first and measuring the state of progress accordingly. That was a difference we could not overcome until the end. [Nukazawa] When the negotiations began, it was to discuss issues limited to areas where government had responsibility ("government reach"). The opinion of the Japanese private sector was that the government had various means available to it, such as public investment and so on. But the current account balance surplus and GNP movement were not within the realm of government responsibility, though this was a fairly close call. If we were to make concessions, it should have been in the macro area. Public finance authorities, however, would not take any action. Things moved no further than their front door, where they stopped, so far as they were concerned. But, as a result, demands kept being made on the private sector. And the emphasis ended up on the micro area, which is far from the realm of government responsibility. This is the candid view of the private sector. What do you think? [Okamatsu] There are three principles in the framework talks. One is that discussion must run in both directions; second is that of "government reach"; and third is the principle that the results of these talks be mutually and equally beneficial under MFN principles. As for objective criteria, there was a question if this was in the realm of government responsibility. Since government procurement, insurance, and automobiles and auto parts were priority areas, we gave priority to discussions of these issues. In discussions of these three principles, the argument on "government reach" came very much into the open. As for government procurement in particular, we agreed that making procedures transparent is a government issue. As for insurance, deregulation is a government issue. Therefore, we discussed how to do these things in a reciprocal manner. As for automobiles and auto parts, which were private sector business activities, discussions took place on areas where government could have a role. The United States also agreed that automobiles and auto parts were in the private realm. But there was a different recognition of the arm length of government reach. This was in the background of discussions. On this subject, discussion focused on the sphere where government could have a role. As a result of this debate, the United States stopped mentioning the government's setting numerical targets on completed automobiles. As for the private sector setting targets, many scholars, both in the United States and Japan, oppose the idea. Moreover, there is the question of what this has to do with free trade principles in the first place. Also, once a number is set, it takes on a life of its own. As a result, it will be viewed as a government commitment. As for the presence of a stated number in a U.S.-Japan agreement, there is the purchase of auto parts--$19 billion (fiscal year 1994). But this number was drawn up with utmost caution and given as the numerical target for efforts by the private sector. Yet, after one year, the United States interpreted this as a government commitment and started making arguments accordingly. [Kaji] It is a fact that a great imbalance still exists. I understand that, on this point, Japan does not think the status quo is good. Therefore, if there is an opportunity, I think the relationship can be improved on both sides. Is the Japanese Market Really Closed? [Nukazawa] As for objective criteria, some people in the Japanese business sector argue that, since President Clinton declared he would not demand a set market share as was the case with semiconductors, based on his words, we should take the initiative to reopen dialogue. On the other hand, as I read the contents of the President's news conference, he touched on some five areas, such as import levels, comparison with the other six G-7 nations, exchange rate fluctuations, the state of Japanese domestic demand, and American business efforts. Two or three of these can easily be quantified. So, the United States may not demand a market share, but I am apprehensive it will want something very close to numerical targets. What do you think? [Matsuura] The United States keeps saying it will not demand market share. But it cites objective criteria in concrete terms: One is the average market share of the G-7 nations, other than Japan, and another is continuation of past trends into the future, in connection with which medical equipment, auto parts, and so on are mentioned. The idea is to carry the increase in past trends up to 25 or 30 percent in the future as one of the criteria. Such are the two ideas. Thus, if what President Clinton said was true, Japan has also made concrete proposals concerning government procurement and even made amended proposals at the final stage. I think President Clinton's comments at the news conference by and large matched our proposals on government procurement. We need to refine them further in the future. [Okamatsu] Their theory goes as follows: Japan has a $120 billion trade surplus. Compared to Europe, the market share for American products in Japan is low; that is because the Japanese market is closed. Looking at past agreements, with some exceptions, positive results are not in evidence. The reason why results were not achieved is because only a process was prescribed and results were not. The whole setup is designed to deter progress. Therefore, in light of the foregoing theory, this time around we must establish some mechanism to measure progress and pry open the Japanese market. In rebuttal, we say: First, the global imbalance is derived from the investment-savings imbalance. Japan will certainly try to improve on this point, but the United States must also try to reduce its fiscal deficit. Concerning the comparison of market share for some specific products, the argument that, compared to other markets, the Japanese market is closed is not based on sound theory, because the supply structure and demand structure are totally different for each market. Second, about past agreements. These are classified into three types: The first is deregulation. We have complied with the agreements, the market has been opened, and imports have increased. The second is our attempts on open procedures. This is for government procurements. We have pledged we would simplify procedures on items such as supercomputers and computers; we are enforcing this. The market will determine what the outcome is. The third is cooperation in the private sector. This must be settled in the future through the efforts of both sides. It is not rational to say that, because success is not visible now, results have not been obtained. I am rebutting the structure of the argument, but the question is how we overcome such fundamental misconceptions. Will the way be opened by comments such as those President Clinton made? But U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Kantor's comments at negotiations had a different nuance. I wonder if they have an unambiguous policy within that administration. During the negotiations, we had repeated difficulties because of this. [Kaji] It is natural that in past negotiations, processes were agreed on but results not obtained. Results would emerge as the consequence of market movement and economic rationality, and the economic mechanism would not guarantee that the results would be the same as the G-7 average. Here, the American thinking is wrong. But still, I cannot help but admit there are various regulations in Japan. I think there are many products which could enter if we relaxed regulations. Many people also fervently advocate deregulation for the sake of the domestic economy. I think it would be best if we take bold steps on deregulation. [Nukazawa] It would also be good if domestic demand were expanded. About the summit meeting: The evaluation of the Europeans was that it was natural for Japan to say no to numerical targets. But the Japanese surplus was a problem, so domestic demand should be expanded. That is my reading. GATT Secretary General Sutherland said he was opposed to numerical targets and the use of Super 301. What is the reaction in Asia? [Matsuura] The reaction in Asia is basically the same as in Europe, but the nuances are different. In Europe, when I met with the EC Committee members headed by Committee Chairman Delors on 14 February, they said they evaluated Japan positively, first of all for not going along with bilateralism. However, they did not want the United States and Japan to start a trade war and wanted us to avoid this by any means. Also, they wanted Japan, which holds such a large current account surplus, to do better in the macro area. The Asian countries have similar feelings, and they too evaluate the first point highly. But at the same time, they feel that if Japan and the United States got into a full-scale trade war, Asian countries would become entangled, and this would have a very negative effect. So they want this to be avoided by any means. Theory of Japanese Differentness [Nukazawa] Representative Kantor says: "Japan is a very unique and different country," and "the market is the most closed." Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten also gave a speech at Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] (3 March) saying: "I have visited Asian countries where I have told each of them Japan is the most closed country in Asia. Therefore, we have assumed the kind of policy we have toward Japan, but we will not assume such a policy toward other countries in Asia." Is Japan really that different? [Okamatsu] I think they are judging Japan to be so different based on statistics. It is true that, when I look at market shares, some individual products have gained no share in the Japanese market. But this is determined by each country's supply and demand structure. And moreover, even if the volume of all import products is small, we must consider systems and geography. The United States shares land borders with Canada, which is an almost equally industrialized country. Europe has a system called the EU, and moreover, it is all connected by land borders. Such a system does not exist for Japan. And another factor is that Japan is an island nation. We must keep this in mind. Therefore, when we include all these factors in our calculations, the ratio of imports compared to GNP is not all that different from other countries. Other countries' citing such indicators and declaring that we are different rubs us the wrong way. But does it mean that we can maintain the present situation? That is not the case. There are some aspects on which we must frankly reflect and reexamine ourselves. As for the industrial sector, considering the recent high yen, we must work to expand new dealings which would exceed old transaction relationships. In other words, if we find products which are cheap and useful, we should also include them in the process of sorting out Japanese products. Or enterprises will start to think about export projects. These efforts and deregulation of the system by the government will gradually change the environment. [Nukazawa] Dornbusch (Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor) and some revisionists have been saying that the ratio of imported products to Japanese GNP is extremely low compared to that of other G-7 countries. Can the fact that the so-called intra-industry trade index is extremely low be evidence the market is closed? [Kaji] I do not think that is the case, since each country has its own demand and supply structure. If countries become united as Europe is, the trade ratio will naturally go up. And the argument that a country is different based on differences in numerical results is not the same as the original theory of difference which Chalmers Johnson and others put forward. The original theory of difference was a theory that noted the difference in the connection of political and economic relationships or differences in social arrangements. The Dornbusch argument says we are different because results are different. [Matsuura] The United States has been saying the Japanese market is the most closed of G-7 members. On this, two measures are cited: The ratio of imports to GNP and the rate of investment in foreign countries. The United States says that those indicators for Japan are extremely low. In Asia, with the exception of Hong Kong and Singapore, it is obvious Japan is far more open than other countries. The problem is that it is very difficult to make a comparison to the degree of openness within the G-7. But it does not make sense to make comparisons using only these two indexes. So, if we are compared to the United States, it is true that overall it is far more open. But I cannot agree that we are the most closed of the G-7 members. [Okamatsu] As for investment, arguments have been raised about that recently, so I investigated it. When the amount of U.S. investment in major manufacturing industries is compared to that of Japan and the major European countries, there is no substantial difference in the actual amount. Therefore, we can say that there may be a gap developing in the other areas, but as for the major manufacturing industries, U.S. investment is similar to ours. [Nukazawa] Because Japan keeps saying "market opening, market opening," others think the protected market remains in place, is that not it? [Matsuura] Still, it is true that there remain further measures which we must take. Those are the so-called traditional trade barriers. The number of nontariff barriers has come down, but the number of items still requiring a permit is said to be 11,000. We need to examine how much impact these have on trade. How Will a Multinational Trade Framework and Bilateral Negotiations Be Harmonized? [Nukazawa] When a dispute-handling mechanism in GATT already exists--and is being further improved--why are so many bilateral negotiations taking place? Is it not better to strengthen organizations such as GATT which deal with multiple nations? Some people offer the criticism that bilateral negotiations between the United States and Japan will have a hollowing effect on GATT. [Matsuura] I think we should basically manage trade with multilateral organizations; we should utilize GATT and then the WTO [World Trade Organization] as much as possible. But when the other side approaches us bilaterally, we cannot flatly refuse to respond, especially since at the bottom of U.S. frustration with us is the huge trade deficit. But the Japanese response should persistently stick by principles, and complete bilateralism must be eliminated. [Okamatsu] I think that when there is some dispute between two countries they should move their case onto the multilateral stage. When the United States unilaterally applied Super 301 in connection with the semiconductor issue, we heatedly discussed whether or not we should go to GATT. But at that time, the situation in Japan was such that we were not ready to go to GATT. I think the time has come that, when an issue arises, we should manage it at the multilateral level rather than in a bilateral context--that should be regarded as the basic response. When the parties appeal to GATT, first, a bilateral conference takes place. There is a rule that when no agreement is reached, a neutral third party will pass judgment. I think one way of responding would be to utilize such a solution for future disputes. [Kaji] You are right. The principle is that we talk bilaterally while keeping in mind the global implications or the effect on the entire world. I think it would be sensible for us not to stubbornly insist only on the multilateral level, and that we seek a solution bilaterally when the bilateral significance is very important. [Nukazawa] Some people offer criticism that the United States will act both as prosecutor and judge when we negotiate with sanctions in the background, because there are no set rules to begin with. [Matsuura] You are correct that there are people who criticize unilateral measures taken by the United States, such as application of Super 301. But does it mean multilateral action such as GATT's is enough? As I witnessed the U.S.-Japan negotiations on electronic communications and medical technology, I think it is understandable why the United States does not feel that regulatory actions by GATT are sufficient and seeks something additional. That is why we had detailed negotiations. GATT's action is quite elastic. It says that the approach A is taking is all right and so are those by B and C. It is understandable that the United States wants something with a somewhat more strict direction. [Nukazawa] But as other countries see it, they must want the United States to correct matters such as the protection of maritime transportation and the grandfather clause (agriculture protection). [Mtsuura] Exactly. From the outset, the United States held back on maritime transportation in the negotiations on services. So Japan and other countries were very unhappy about this point. The United States also has its own problems. [Nukazawa] In that case, in world trade, everything that inconveniences the United States is quickly improved, but even if something is caused by a deficiency of GATT, improvements are hardly made on issues where the United States does not suffer much. I feel it is so unfair. [Okamatsu] The WTO has been created, but still, we cannot solve everything there. First, as to dispute contents, we can appeal an infringement of interest which falls under the competence of the WTO. As for elements which do not fall into this category, the situation is different. For instance, if Japan makes some special pledge during future U.S.-Japan negotiations, then the special regulation or some individual contract rather than general regulations will take precedence, even when we take the case to GATT. Moreover, from now on among the cases brought, a determination will have to be made on whether the retaliatory measure being challenged comes under WTO regulations or is outside of it. So, if we are hit with retaliatory measures outside the competence of the WTO, there would be nothing we could do. Therefore, the WTO is not all mighty. So in that sense, we must uphold the abovementioned great principles. But, at the same time, bilateral issues will remain in the future, and naturally we must adhere to bilateral agreements which decide the trade relationship of two countries. Where Will the Free Trade System Go--Prospects for Post-Uruguay Round [Nukazawa] Regarding the Uruguay Round, in order to turn every country into the same economic society, the harmonization of competition, environment, and trade policies and so on will emerge as the big issues. Do you have any suggestions in this regard? [Matsuura] The issues you just mentioned mainly concern trade and environment, but there are others: Trade and science and technology, trade and labor, and trade and investment. Although the recent Uruguay Round took up a wide range of issues, there are still more which have not been taken up. The Tokyo Round concluded in 1979 and the Uruguay Round began in 1986; there was a gap of seven years. The question is how to link this Uruguay Round to the next round. Will we take up individual issues such as trade and environment, rather than conduct a large-scale round? Or will we include everything and try for another big round? If it were to be big round, it would make fairly tough demands on the developing countries on those single issues. To bring the developing countries along, the developed countries must be ready to give up something at the next round. Altogether 117 countries participated this time, and 87 of them are developing countries. We must give careful consideration to the question of how to gain a consensus from these 87 countries at the next round. [Okamatsu] The discussion of specific issues mentioned above has already taken place at the OECD or GATT. And I think discussions of environment and investment issues in particular, are advancing. Because of the strong interest in environment issues, some even say the next round will be the Green Round. Environmental policies, however, are naturally determined by each country's history, society, or developmental stage, so it is not right to squeeze the developing counties with the developed countries' standard of environmental policy. Beside, when you speak of the environment, there are global environmental issues and local pollution issues for specific countries. We must be mindful of these distinctions when we discuss them. Otherwise, negotiations which would put unfair burdens on developing countries would not be realized as negotiations. As for the issue of the environment and trade policy, in the past there have been faulty trade policies which were colored by environmental considerations. In that regard, what we are advocating about the environment is, first, the absence of discrimination between domestic and international measures, in accordance with domestic measures. Second, we should adopt a policy which involves the least "distortion" for trade. Even when we adopt measures for the environment, we must choose ones which have the least effect on trade policy. Further, the choice must be based on an international agreement on the environment, not merely determined by the interests of some specific country. Another point: An argument arose for reevaluating NAFTA concerning environmental and labor issues. It is good reference to note how the United States dealt with the possible problem of a substantial amount of goods produced under low wages and low environmental standards in Mexico entering the United States. It was dealt with as follows: First the United States established the principle of honoring current Mexican sovereignty, examined its structure, and judged it satisfactory. But the United States will monitor the situation to ensure that practices are actually followed. If there are any problems, consultations between the two countries will be held to seek a solution. [Nukazawa] I think every country has a stage which Charles Johnson called the "developmental state." As Alexander Hamilton's time in the United States was an era of industrial policy, every country has experienced such a phase in order to arrive at its present-day stage. If developing countries are told that they are not permitted to have such a stage, they will have difficulty achieving growth. I wonder if the developing countries might not have trouble obtaining growth if they are levied with the task of homogenizing too rapidly. [Kaji] That is a difficult issue. GATT started with tariffs and trade, and has gradually expanded to include services and investment; now, it is even covering the environment. I think GATT will provide a powerful platform if it is utilized appropriately. But it will not function well unless some countries demonstrate leadership. But the issues which will be taken up in the future will be ones for which guarantees of mutual interests will be difficult. As for trade, it is the situation that 99 out of 100 economists would agree that free trade is in the interests of the country concerned. But as for movement in capitals, quite a few will have reservations. Furthermore, when environmental considerations come into play, it is going to be difficult to guarantee that there will be common interests. That is why I am somewhat worried that progress on future issues will not be achieved in as "clear cut" a manner as was the case with trade and tariffs. [Nukazawa] Each country's economy has been formed from the background of its design as a country, national characteristics, and culture. One after another, each country has contributed to the history of world civilization. But if we are too eager to make them all homogeneous, then some interesting and different "DNA" might be lost. For living things, the preservation of diversity is necessary. [Matsuura] As economic relationships have become so close and relationships of mutual dependency have increased, it is insufficient to focus only on tariff and nontariff barriers which are beachhead measures. In that regard, it is understandable that an argument would emerge along the lines that we should "harmonize" economic structures as much as possible because fairness will otherwise not be maintained. [Okamatsu] It provokes our antipathy when the theory of differentness is used. Following recognition that every country is different, then exchange and trade start. If all countries become the same, then it will result, in a way, in a parallel situation. I think, however, that there must be some way to seek "harmonization"--economic "harmony"--while still preserving the virtuous aspects of differences. [Nukazawa] Then, do you mean that a sense of balance rather than a legal approach is important now? [Kaji] As you all know, rivalry between the two systems has not disappeared. In other words, it is safe to say that the central/directed economic structure has lost. But now, various differences within the former Western side have become evident, and the economic differences of each country are showing up. Here, in fact, an economy motivated by the market mechanism is fundamentally functioning in most countries. So, in letting differences remain, we should fundamentally pursue the free economy. I think that, as for the macroeconomic management of each country, most nations have a fiscal and monetary policy, albeit while following the free economic principle. Coordination of all this will also remain a future task. I think that international cooperation at the macro level and the functioning of the market mechanism at the micro level will be important. Then, all will mutually recognize that the minor differences of each country--I intentionally call them minor differences--remain different. Situations have changed today when compared to those 30 years ago even in the same country. The United States and Japan have seen changes. And Europe has changed even more. So rather than compare the differences, it is better to recognize the greater similarities. [Nukazawa] Japan is said "not to have changed," but last year for instance, the Administrative Procedure Registration Law was passed and enforcement will begin in October 1994. If the Japanese government, in response to a request by the U.S. government, were to give the business administrative guidance, and if this were administrative guidance in violation of GATT, it would become extremely difficult for the Japanese government to give such administrative guidance in violation of the treaty when industry asks for written guidance rather than oral. When I told an American that the business response would be different because litigation would be brought by stockholder representatives with the complaint: "Why did you follow noncompulsory and oral administrative guidance? You caused the firm X amount of losses. You, as management, must personally pay the firm for the loss incurred," he understood the idea. The structure of Japanese industry and government is gradually going through change. Yet Americans in general seem to believe things are the same as in the past. [Okamatsu] It is significant that the Japanese position in the world has changed from that of 30 years ago and of 10 years ago. It is the case that one behaves without noticing one's own height. This is something we must keep in mind. I have been a government official for over 30 years. Today the Japanese position in international conferences is totally different from what it was when I started out. As a consequence, we must be aware of the weight of our comments and of our responsibility. We Japanese as a whole must deal with such a situation with self-awareness from now on. [Matsuura] I totally agree. When we are working on bilateral negotiations, we tend to forget Japanese significance in world society. But it becomes apparent in multinational negotiations. That is why last year, when Japan chaired the G-7 Tokyo summit, we felt that very strongly. The Japanese presence was very different between the first and second Tokyo summits. But the Japanese presence has grown further compared to the second summit held in Japan in 1986, both in the G-7 and in international society. We must recognize the fact that our responsibility has increased, and the number of things Japan must do is rapidly increasing. [Nukazawa] Thank you very much.
