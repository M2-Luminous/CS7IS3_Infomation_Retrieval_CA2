According to Divjak, the pressure exerted by the United States, and especially the Vatican, on Tudjman has yielded results. The cease-fire agreement reached with members of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] is mainly being observed. Generals Delic and Roso [of the B-H Army and the HVO, respectively] should meet in Split or Geneva in two days to define the principles of the military agreement. According to this agreement, there would initially be a joint command for the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO. This command would later be transformed into an unified command. The day when the third side will enter the federation is not far away, Divjak said. The enemy's attempts to cut through the forces of the 2d and 3d Corps by capturing Maglaj and attacking Vozuca from Olovo have failed. The offensive on Bihac and the Cazin Krajina has not yielded results either. The cases of resistance to mobilization, a lack of military discipline, and crime have become increasingly frequent in the [Serbian] occupied territories. It is thought that [leader of the Bosnian Serb military] General Mladic is out of favor as he did not succeed in accomplishing his aims in Sarajevo, the Krivaja valley, the Posavina region, and the Neretva valley. General Milovanovic is being mentioned as his replacement. What is also important is that two brigades under the command of Fikret Abdic have refused to take any further part in combat actions against the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation in the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is very good. The front with the HVO has been freed. The 7th Army Corps has been founded in the Vrbas valley. According to Divjak, the founding of a corps that would assume responsibilities in the Drina valley is also being considered. Divjak stressed that the social situation of the fighters is very bad. The question of accountability for the loss of some territories has also been raised. The key person responsible for the loss of Mount Igman is under investigation. General Divjak particularly emphasized the differences between demilitarization and protected zones. The demilitarization of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be discussed only after Serbia and Croatia have been demilitarized. The demilitarization of Sarajevo cannot be discussed while enemy soldiers are around the city, Divjak said. Just because the street cars have started operating, or because there was a soccer match between UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and Sarajevo teams we must not neglect the situation in Maglaj and Mostar, or the humanitarian situation in the republic. This is having adverse effects on other places in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Divjak said.
