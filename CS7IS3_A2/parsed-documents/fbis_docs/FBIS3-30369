Shortly after his return, Klaus said: [Begin Klaus recording] First, the Davos meeting presented, just as it has every year--and this is the fifth time we have been there--an exceptionally suitable opportunity to represent the Czech Republic in the world, which, I think, was carried out successfully during the whole series of meetings, talks, and speeches the three of us had there. Second, the forum was an opportunity to say something about the world and European problems. We tried to do that, too, and I think the voice of the Czech Republic was audible and strong. Third, Davos provided an opportunity for a large number of bilateral talks and meetings, which we had not only with a number of world politicians but also with bankers and businessmen, and we can name the individual countries with whom we had talks. We had a meeting with Chancellor Kohl. We had a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto. There were talks with the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian prime ministers. There were talks with partners from African and Latin American countries, and so on. [end recording]
