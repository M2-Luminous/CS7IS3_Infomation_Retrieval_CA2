I view proposals for seeking a solution through military strikes with a "great deal of skepticism," the chancellor said at a conference on security policy in Munich today. It is also difficult at present "to decide who is more culpable." Kohl again warned the Croatian Government against further aggravating the civil war in the Balkans. He regretted that the Croatian Government had so far not made "the necessary public statements." Those who change borders by violent means cannot count on the Federal Republic to give aid for reconstruction after the war.
