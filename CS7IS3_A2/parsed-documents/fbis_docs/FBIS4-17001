"The youth today are not like they used to be before perestroika. Misery, hunger, life in constant fear for future (which began for the kids at nine years of age, that is with perestroika years) resulted in that drafted to the army now will be weak and sick guys who are unable neither to protect the motherland nor themselves", the press service of the Liberal Democratic Party said on Thursday quoting Zhirinovskiy. "It is possible to recruit up to two million volunteers and let children study", the statement reads. Speaking at parliamentary hearings on civic accord agreement, Zhirinovskiy proposed to the Russian president to cancel his decree which stripped students of vocational schools who have reached 18 years of age of the right to defer military service.
