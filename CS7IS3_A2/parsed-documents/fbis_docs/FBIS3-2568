According to the latest statistics, the province has about 4,000 such enterprises, employing 110,000 people. These enterprises are involved in the fields of machinery and electronics, gauges and meters, bio-chemicals, genetic engineering, medicine and the combination of machinery and electrical appliances. Many of them generate an annual output value of at least ten million yuan each a year. Under the centrally planned economy, research institutions used to undertake projects assigned by the government, which allocated limited funds and took charge of the findings. Such a system could hardly arouse the enthusiasm of scientific workers for research work, a provincial government official explained. During the current reform of the management of science and technology, research institutions have more say in their work, and scientific workers are encouraged to set up independent hi-tech industrial enterprises at their own expense, at the same time assuming sole responsibility for their profits and losses. They are also encouraged to apply their research findings to production. One example is the Hangzhou General Electrical Appliance Company, a nongovernmental enterprise specializing in telecommunications. Founded in 1990 with self-raised funds of more than 100,000 yuan, the company generates an annual output value exceeding 100 million yuan and profits climbing to 10 million yuan a year. The company has 140 employees, including 30 people with doctor's and master's degrees. The company has developed a series of advanced program-controlled telephone exchanges to meet the needs of the market. Another example is the Hangzhou Organic Silicon New Material Development and Application Company, a nongovernmental enterprise combining science and industry with trade. Many of the products, including HS-900 seal mat coat material, SI building waterproofing agent and HS-T-3 silicon resin, developed by the company have filled the gaps in China's science and technology. The company has just transferred 15 research findings to a Singapore company, and is using the money earned therefrom to build new workshops and other production facilities. The Hangzhou Feishida Computer Technology Company has been paying close attention to employing scientists and technicians, and offering better working and living conditions for them ever since its founding five years ago. With 20 research workers, the company has developed FGC color high-resolution video control boards and other computer software series. After inspecting the company, Song Jian, minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, highly praised it for making great contributions to the computer industry. An official of the Zhejiang provincial society for nongovernmental industrialists specializing in science and technology said that the rise of nongovernmental enterprises in science has paved the way for transforming scientific findings to productivity, and enabled more and more people to see clearly the functions and value of scientists and technicians in the country's economic development.
