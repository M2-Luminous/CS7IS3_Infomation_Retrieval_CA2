Diplomatic sources in Lusaka say that UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, the principal mediator at the talks, has managed to reduce differences between the two sides concerning the police issue. Those sources also say that the two sides are reported to have reached an understanding that the police would be a state administration organ. It is noteworthy that UN Special Representative Blondin Beye has had separate meetings with the two sides over the last two days with a view to narrowing differences over the police issue. Should those reports prove to be true, the negotiators will now have to discuss issues pertaining to national reconciliation, the future role of the United Nations in Angola, UNITA's active participation in government, and the second round of presidential elections. Only one thing is quite clear: the riot police must really be scrapped.
