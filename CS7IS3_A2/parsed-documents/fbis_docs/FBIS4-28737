The content of this message is as follows: Dear compatriots, the inter-Cambodian conference for peace and national reconciliation or the so-called Pyongyang roundtable ended with a negative result following a day's discussion because Democratic Kampuchea [DK] representing by His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan refused to accept my proposal for an unconditional, immediate, complete, and permanent cease-fire for the sake of the entire Cambodian nation and people despite repeated appeals from Supreme Patriarch Tep Vong, Supreme Patriarch Buo Kri, Venerable Khousananda, and Venerable Patriarch Mongkol Tepeacha. The DK party replied that before such a cease-fire is imposed, the Royal Government must first accept a minimal policy program of the DK party. Therefore, the second roundtable to be held at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh on 15 June 1994 under the chairmanship of Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong, my high representative, and with the participation of the representatives of Samdech Chea Sim, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Samdech Hun Sen, and H.E. Khieu Samphan will first discuss that minimal policy program. But if following a hard discussion at the roundtable at the Phnom Penh Royal Palace there is still the same failure as at the Chhanghsu-on roundtable in Pyongyang, I, Norodom Sihanouk, will not propose any other roundtables. Any person or party responsible for the war in Cambodia [words indistinct] must be responsible for his/its actions before the nation, people, and history of Cambodia. I deeply regret that certain persons or certain parties still place personal interests and ambitions above the interests of their own motherland, people, and race. If these persons and parties place the noble and vital interests of Cambodia and those of the Cambodian people above their own interests and ambitions, Cambodia will quickly return to the noble state that it was in the Angkorian times. Dear compatriots, please accept my sincerity and enjoy five blessings of Lord Buddha for longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and enlightenment.
