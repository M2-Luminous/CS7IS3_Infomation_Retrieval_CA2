These sources said that an internal committee has been formed, comprising of the following members: Salwa Abu-Khadr, secretary general of the Palestinian Women's Union; Nabil Ramlawi, PLO ambassador to Switzerland; Yahya Yakhluf, director general of the PLO Cultural Department; Jamil Shihadah, secretary general of the Palestinian Teachers' Union; Father Ibrahim 'Ayyad, member of the Palestine National Council; and Mrs. Jamilah Saydam, alias Umm Sabri, official responsible for external relations in the Women's Union. The sources pointed out that the duty of this committee will be to propose a list of the persons who will then make up the Palestinian human rights committee. Informed Palestinian sources feel that 'Arafat's intention to form this committee is to confront the committee formed by Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, the official spokeswoman for the previous negotiating Palestinian delegations. She rejected her appointment by 'Arafat to the Palestinian National Authority and declared that she will continue her activities through the committee she has formed to defend Palestinian human rights in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
