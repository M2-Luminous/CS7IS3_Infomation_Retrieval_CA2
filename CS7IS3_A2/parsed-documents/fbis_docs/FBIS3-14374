Speaking to reporters here this afternoon on the sidelines of the Arab League Council meetings, the Qatari minister said that during his meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf yesterday, he urged Iraq to implement the Security Council resolutions on the Gulf war so that the embargo imposed on Iraq could be lifted. He noted that contacts are under way to study Iraq's proposal to form a popular committee from the Gulf states to visit Iraq to resolve the problem of Kuwaiti prisoners there. The results of these contacts, he added, are not clear yet. On reports that Qatar will extend a natural gas pipeline to Israel, the Qatari foreign minister said: The Israeli side has proposed this matter to us but we told them that we could not talk about it as long as Israel is occupying Arab territory.
