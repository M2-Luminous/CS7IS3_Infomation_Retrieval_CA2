Following political lines, members of the Haitian Parliament openly oppose the arrival of the French ship. A group of senators led by Bernard Sansaricq stands against the arrival of the French ship. On 23 March, demonstrators -- FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] militants and those of the Capois La Mort, the same militants who thwarted the MINUHA [United Nations Mission in Haiti] on 11 October 1993 -- camped for two hours in front of the French Embassy in Port-au-Prince. One day before the scheduled arrival of the ship bearing food aid, tension seems to have moved up a notch. Rothschild Francois reports: [Begin recording] [Francois] A demonstration was held in front of the French Embassy. Demonstrators were carrying placards denouncing Paris' attitude in the Haitian crisis: Democracy, Yes! France's food, No! [passage omitted]. Other reactions include that of Serge Gilles, president of the Jean Xavier Foundation, who favors the arrival of the French food aid. Gilles says, however, that the international organizations must think in the future of purchasing those products in Haiti in order not to change the Haitian population's food habits. [Gilles, in Creole] One can not turn up his nose at 50,000 meals, but I understand the people who have reservations. However, I must be realistic because children are dying. There is no food. It is not the kind of aid that we would choose to receive, but we find it. Let us give it to the children, and let us talk with the people so that they change their aid if they give money. We do not need the money. They can set up an organization which can buy rice, beans, and oil here. It will be better for the Haitian people, for the Haitian nation. The solution lies in lifting the embargo, in international cooperation that must resume immediately, in the appointment of a prime minister, in the installation of a government with an emergency program. That is where the solution lies. Until we agree on a solution so that the embargo is lifted and international cooperation resumes rapidly, if we can distribute the 50,000 meals, let us do so. [Francois] The Senate office of Senator Sansaricq categorically opposes the landing of the French humanitarian aid ship. In a statement to Radio Metropole, Sen. Sansaricq took the opportunity to criticize the French policy in Haiti. Sen. Sansaricq announces that the Senate members will be present at the Port-au-Prince harbor to prevent the landing of the French ship. [Sansaricq] It is unacceptable. The senators will be at the Port-au-Prince harbor on 25 March, and we will take all necessary measures to prevent the landing of this ship. It is an insult to the nation. It is an insult to the Haitian people. It is an insult to our intelligence that France, which has imposed an embargo on us for 30 months, now buys food from Guadeloupe to distribute in Haiti. Twenty thousand have died in Haiti. It is a real affront. The Senate strongly stands against it, and we will be there personally to prevent the landing of this ship. We will hold Philippe Seltz personally responsible for any scratch inflicted on a senator. We will be there with all the necessary strength in order to oppose the landing of this ship.
