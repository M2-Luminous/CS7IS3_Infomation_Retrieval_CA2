Sun Shangqing, a noted economist and director of an economic research center directly under the State Council, said the Chinese Government will transform some existing large and medium-sized enterprises into joint-stock companies within three to five years. As for small state-owned enterprises, the management can be contracted out, leased or auctioned, he said. He said the current reform drive will push these enterprises into the market to become more competitive and to grow into independent legal entities which should have sole responsibility for gains and losses. He held that the country will maintain macro-control over the joint-stock companies and it can convert income from leasing and selling into investment to launch new state-run enterprises.
