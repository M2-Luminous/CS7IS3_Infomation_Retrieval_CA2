FBIS4-61265 "drsov087_r_94010" FBIS-SOV-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Azerbaijan Captured Afghan Mojahed Says Others Fighting in Army Captured Afghan Mojahed Says Others Fighting in Army LD0405141994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1304 GMT 4 May 94 LD0405141994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] An Afghan mojahed taken prisoner by the Nagorno Karabakh Army has vowed to fight on its side if he was not put to death. Bakhtiyar Werballah Baberzayid, 20, told INTERFAX he would take the side of Azerbaijan's disputed Armenian-speaking enclave because its soldiers were better fighters than Azerbaijanis. He also said he knew some of Azerbaijan's military secrets, such as its field works system on some sections of the front, mainly in the Fizuli sector. He said that, with a platoon of good soldiers, he would be able to take a whole district in Azerbaijan. Baberzayid, who comes from Mazar-e Sharif, said the Azerbaijani Army has a permanent contingent of between 2,000 and 2,500 Afghan mojahedin. He said that up to 250 of them are currently fighting in the Fizuli sector alone, where he commanded a detachment of 20. They are based in the town of Beilagan, he said. The prisoner said Azerbaijan had promised him and other mojahedin a monthly pay of up to 5,000 U.S. dollars. But for the first two months, a probation period, each of them had been paid 1,000 Azerbaijani manats a month. Baberzayid said mojahedin usually serve in infantry and assault forces, since most of them have rich experience in mountain warfare and are highly skilled in the use of all types of mainly Soviet-made firearms. The Nagorno Karabakh Army, meanwhile, confirmed Azerbaijani media reports that there are Lezghins, members of one of the smaller Caucasus ethnic groups, in its ranks. The Army staff said that up to 20 Lezghin volunteers from northern Azerbaijan are today fighting on the Nagorno-Karabakh side and quoted one of them as saying, "What is being decided in Nagorno-Karabakh is the fate not only of the Armenians but also of the Lezghins, Talysh and other national minorities, whose territories were forcibly incorporated into Azerbaijan at the behest of Stalin and communist authorities."
