TANJUG's reporter in Sarajevo spoke on the phone with General Mladic this morning, a fact that completely denies the disinformation of the Italian media. At the same time, this reveals the truth that all forms of special war are being waged against the Serb nation and the Srpska republic. Such alleged information aims at causing panic among members of the Srpska republic army and destabilizing the overall situation in the Srpska republic.
