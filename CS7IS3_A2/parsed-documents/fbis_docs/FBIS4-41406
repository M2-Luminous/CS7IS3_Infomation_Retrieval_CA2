World Economic Forum Winds up in Moscow"] [Text] The work of the World Economic Forum winds up in Moscow today. The Forum opened in the evening of the day before yesterday. The foreign and Russian entrepreneurs attending it, according to the organizers, set themselves the goal of "getting the feel of the mood of the Russian economy." Addresses by Russian political and business leaders were supposed to help the businessmen in that. On the opening day congress participants were addressed in Moscow's Metropol Hotel by Boris Fedorov, former finance minister; Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Duma "Yabloko" bloc; and St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. Nikolay Travkin made periodic interventions from the floor. The former finance minister voiced the opinion that the government in its present composition continues to adhere to the course of reforms chosen by Yegor Gaydar's team, however, there is no movement in many sectors, owing to which reform is rolling back. In Boris Fedorov's view, the present parliament cannot work effectively to speed up reforms. "Russia has a need for new professional politicians," Mr. Fedorov stated. St. Petersburg Mayor Sobchak painted his city to the foreigners in roseate hues. According to him, the situation in the city is so favorable that it will soon host the Goodwill games. Mr. Travkin largely attributed the rampant crime to the development of entrepreneurship in Russia. Listening to representatives of the Russian establishment were entrepreneurs representing the world's major companies in Russia. Most of them are already carrying out specific projects. According to Roger Gale, International Finance Corporation (IFC) representative in Moscow, international finance organizations have three to five more years left for active work on the market of investments in the Russian economy, following which, the IFC representative believed, the key positions in the country will be taken by Russian financiers.
