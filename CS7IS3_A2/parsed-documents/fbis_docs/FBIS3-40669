Chakrapani: "Good Outlook for South Asia Forecast"] [Text] United Nations, Dec. 24. Departing delegates from the 48th session of the General Assembly which practically ended today but for a few routine items were given the cheerful news that 1994 will mark the start of a dynamic, growth-oriented world economy. The coming years will be especially good for South Asia, particularly India. According to them, India would attain an annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent, benefiting from its reform-oriented policies and by positive global economic trends. Mr. Cristian Oasa, U.N. economist and director of the Department of Economic and Social Information, who released the Department's year-end global survey, gave two reasons for this optimism and ambivalence about the U.S. economic situation had ended and it was now seen headed for strong growth, and the Uruguay round for trade negotiations had concluded on a successful note. "Both these factors were not present last year," said Mr. Oasa. African situation disturbing: While all regions of the world, markedly Asia, were poised for greater growth, the economic situation in Africa remained "disturbing," he noted. Output in Africa was estimated to have grown only by 2 per cent much less than its rate of population growth. The outlook for 1994 was likely to be no better. Referring to Asia, Mr. Oasa said the region was slated to remain the fastest-growing area. This was inspite of the fact that China was expected to grow by only 10 per cent for the first time in three years. "India continues to accelerate out of its adjustment-related slowdown at the beginning of the decade" the survey said. "Its output in 1994 is predicted to rise at 5.5 per cent." Along with the growth rate of six per cent or more in several countries, including the Republic of Korea, Taiwan province of China, Indonesia and Thailand, the combined growth of South and East Asia is expected to exceed six per cent. The year-end survey predicted a rise in world trade by six per cent in 1994. This was an improvement over last year when there was a fall in world trade because of weak economic growth in Europe and Japan. Industrialised countries were expected to enter the recovery phase of their economic cycles in 1994. While unemployment will continue to remain high in Europe, the report said the job rate in the United States was expected to be the highest in the industrialised world. The survey concludes with the observation that "the spirit of cooperation that prevailed among all groups of countries in the last stages of the Uruguay round of trade negotiations gives ground for optimism. Indeed, the conclusion of the round has given rise to opportunities which could mark the beginning of a more dynamic world economy." The survey is expected to be considered by the Economic and Social Council which holds its next session at New York next month. Resolutions adopted: The General Assembly, working at top speed on Wednesday, passed a number of resolutions and reports sent up by its main economic committee. Two resolutions on the issue of international economic cooperation adopted were noteworthy. One draft, strongly backed by the nonaligned group, asked the industrialised creditor nations and multilateral organisations to take additional measures including, cancellation or reduction, to alleviate the external debt burden of developing countries. The resolution received 146 affirmative votes in an Assembly of 184 nations but there was one negative vote cast by the United States. Explaining its opposition to the resolution, the U.S. delegate said the U.N. was hardly the forum to raise this matter. For multilateral debts, the forum was the executive boards of the IMF and the World Bank and the Paris Club which, he said, had given debt relief to many countries. As regards bilateral debts, this could be usefully discussed with the bilateral creditors. On the issue of North-South issues, the Assembly called for strengthening "constructive dialogue and partnership" in order to promote further international cooperation and development. Such a dialogue should be conducted "in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits, genuine interdependence, shared responsibilities and the partnership for sustainable development."
