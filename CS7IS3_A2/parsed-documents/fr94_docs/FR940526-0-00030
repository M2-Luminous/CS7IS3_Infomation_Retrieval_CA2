The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;11&hyph;02 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;8918 Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;60&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model 767 series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent cracking of both fuse pins on the same strut, which could result in loss of the strut and engine, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes having midspar fuse pins, part number 311T3102&hyph;1: Perform a detailed visual inspection and an eddy current inspection to detect cracks of the midspar fuse pins, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;54A0062, dated April 14, 1994, at the time specified in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) of this AD, as applicable. Repeat these inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 landings. (1) For airplanes having midspar fuse pins that have accumulated 18,000 or more total landings as of the effective date of this AD, accomplish the inspections within 60 days after the effective date of this AD. (2) For airplanes having midspar fuse pins that have accumulated 15,000 or more total landings, but less than 18,000 total landings, as of the effective date of this AD, accomplish the inspections within 90 days after the effective date of this AD. (3) For airplanes having midspar fuse pins that have accumulated 10,000 or more total landings, but less than 15,000 total landings, as of the effective date of this AD, accomplish the inspections within 120 days after the effective date of this AD. (4) For airplanes having midspar fuse pins that have accumulated less than 10,000 total landings as of the effective date of this AD, accomplish the inspections prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total landings on the fuse pin, or within 120 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later. (b) For airplanes having a midspar fuse pin, part number 311T3102&hyph;2 or 311T2102&hyph;1: Prior to the accumulation of 15,000 total landings on the fuse pin, or within 90 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, perform a detailed visual inspection and an eddy current inspection to detect cracks on the midspar fuse pins, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;54A0062, dated April 14, 1994. Repeat these inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 landings. (c) If any crack is found during an inspection required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, prior to further flight, replace the cracked midspar fuse pin with a new fuse pin, in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;54A0062, dated April 14, 1994. Thereafter, perform the detailed visual and eddy current inspections specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, as applicable, on the new fuse pin at the time specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this AD. (1) For airplanes having midspar fuse pins, part number 311T3102&hyph;1: Perform the initial inspection of the new fuse pin prior to the accumulation of 10,000 total landings on the new fuse pin. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 landings. (2) For airplanes having midspar fuse pins, part numbers 311T3102&hyph;2 and 311T2102&hyph;1: Perform the initial inspection of the new fuse pin prior to the accumulation of 15,000 total landings on the new fuse pin. Repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 landings. (d) When any fuse pin is removed from a strut equipped with a General Electric engine, the engine must be removed in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 767 Maintenance Manual, subject 71&hyph;00&hyph;02; or supported in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. (e) When any fuse pin is removed from a strut equipped with a Pratt & Whitney engine, the engine must be removed in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 767 Maintenance Manual, subject 71&hyph;00&hyph;02; or supported in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 767 Maintenance Manual, subject 54&hyph;51&hyph;02, Temporary Revisions (TR), dated April 22, 1994; or supported in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. (f) When any fuse pin is removed from a strut equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, the engine must be removed in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 767 Maintenance Manual, subject 71&hyph;00&hyph;02; or supported in accordance with procedures described in the Boeing 767 Maintenance Manual, subject 54&hyph;51&hyph;02; or supported in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. (g) Any midspar fuse pin, part number 311T3102&hyph;1, 311T3102&hyph;2, or 311T2102&hyph;1, that has been removed from the strut and inspected for cracks using the 100 percent magnetic particle inspection technique described in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;54A0062, dated April 14, 1994, may be reinstalled on the strut provided that the fuse pin is found to be crack-free during the magnetic particle inspection. Prior to the accumulation of 3,000 total landings after reinstallation of the fuse pin, the fuse pin must be inspected in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this AD, as applicable. (h) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO. (i) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
