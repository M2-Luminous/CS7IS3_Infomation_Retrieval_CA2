For nearly four hours, the demonstrators--many of whom were carrying placards bearing slogans hostile to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank--listened to speeches by union leaders before dispersing calmly. The various speakers reiterated their demand for a "substantial" increase in salary to offset the increase in prices of consumer goods sparked off by the devaluation. They also called for an increase of more than 300 percent in the statutory minimum wage. This rally was due to have been held a week ago but was banned by the Beninese Government, which dispatched police to the Labor Exchange to prevent the demonstrators from meeting.
