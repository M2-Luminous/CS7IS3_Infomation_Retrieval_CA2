FBIS4-6967 "dreas080_a_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Party Officially Quits Coalition Party Officially Quits Coalition OW2604022994 Tokyo KYODO in English 0214 GMT 26 Apr 94 OW2604022994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] formally decided to leave the ruling coalition at an emegency meeting of its central executive committee on Tuesday [26 April] morning, party officials said. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama earlier Tuesday had announced that the largest party in the coalition would quit the alliance, leaving it without a majority in parliament. Murayama revealed the decision following a meeting of key SDP leaders. The SDP pulled out to protest the abrupt establishment of a new parliamentary group "Kaishin" by five groups including Shinseito, headed by new Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Murayama said he is willing to hold talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who started wooing the SDP back to the alliance immediately after the party broke ranks with the ruling coalition. In a TV program, Murayama said, ''I am ready to talk (with Hata),'' if the newly elected premier seeks a meeting. But he nevertheless reiterated that the SDP has no plan to rescind its decision to part with the other coalition partners after the party was infuriated with the move to form a new parliamentary bloc. ''Unless the prime minister demonstrates stronger leadership and offers 'evidence' that they have mended their ways (of handling Diet affairs), the same thing will happen again,'' he said. The party has no intention of changing its decision to quit the coalition, he said. The SDP chief showed a clear eagerness to seek alliance with new party Sakigake [Harbinger], which earlier decided against joining the Hata administration while providing some legislative support. ''We have had good cooperation since we were in the coalition in efforts to check the dual power structure (within the coalition).'' ''I believe we can further deepen our ties and join forces to set Japanese politics on the right course,'' he said. Murayama did not rule out the possibility of a snap election for the House of Represetatives, while sounding cautious about seeking that course of action. "It would be better not to create a political vacuum under the current economic conditions," he said. "But we should make a decision on that issue after carefully assessing the entire s ate of affairs." Meanwhile, SDP members of both houses of the Diet met and endorsed the decision by the party's policy-making board to walk out of the coalition. At the meeting, Murayama called for unity among the party members. Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and some other coalition partners "want to see the SDP split up. Let us unite to guard against that," he said.
