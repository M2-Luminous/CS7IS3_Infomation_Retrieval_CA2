SUMMARY: The NRC is announcing the availability for public comment of a draft report, NUREG&hyph;1022, Revision 1, ``Event Reporting Guidelines, Second Draft Report for Comment.'' DATES: The comment period expires April 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments to David L. Meyer, Chief, Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publication Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. A free single copy of a second draft NUREG&hyph;1022, Revision 1, may be requested by those considering public comment by writing to the Distribution and Mail Services Section, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. A copy also is available for inspection and copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marcel Harper, Phone: (301) 492&hyph;4497, FAX: (301) 492&hyph;8931, or Dennis Allison, Phone: (301) 492&hyph;4148, FAX: (301) 492&hyph;7142, mailing address: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NRC has prepared a draft report, NUREG&hyph;1022, Revision 1, ``Event Reporting Guidelines, Second Draft Report for Comment.'' The document provides proposed clarification of the immediate notification requirements of 10 CFR 50.72 and the 30-day written licensee event report (LER) requirements of 10 CFR 50.73 for nuclear power plants. This document will replace NUREG&hyph;1022 and its Supplements 1 and 2. The purposes of this document are to ensure events are reported as required by improving the reporting guidelines related to 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73 and to consolidate these guidelines into a single reference document. The NRC staff is seeking public comment before finalizing the revised NUREG because of the broad interest in event reporting at nuclear power plants. The staff requests that comments be limited to the same scope as the document, which involves clarifying but not changing the reporting requirements in §§50.72 and 50.73.
