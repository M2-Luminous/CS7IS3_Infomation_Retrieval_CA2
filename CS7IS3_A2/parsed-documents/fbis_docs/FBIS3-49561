[Borowski] So the question of whether we could afford it has to be examined closely, and I think that the minister of national defense should have his say too, or maybe first of all, as he has a particular budget at his disposal. [Matczak] All expenses for possible joint military operations will be borne by the Ministry of National Defense. The Ministry of Finance counts, however, on financial support by western partners for peace as Poland recently suffered considerable losses, especially in the arms industry. This was connected with the collapse of the eastern market and with UN embargo. The partnership can become an important step not in military cooperation alone. [Borowski] As the partnership does not give certain political guarantees, it may bring some economic benefits.
