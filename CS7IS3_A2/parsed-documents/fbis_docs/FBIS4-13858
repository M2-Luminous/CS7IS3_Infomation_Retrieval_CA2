In view of the importance of the warning by the great leader, we present the following points: --Remain alert and vigilant in the trenches, because a wounded enemy is more furious. --Their struggle gets more serious and fraught with anger the more unsuccessful they are. --They are trying to tarnish the revolution; this is what is going on in the sphere of politics. --Anyone in this country undertaking constructive activity or entrusted with some task should be alert and vigilant. The enemy has not been able to strike, but he has not given up hope. --We should strengthen our strong points. Of course, we do have weak points that we should strive to eliminate, too. --You can see that smugglers and other individuals who smuggle in videocassettes full of sex, erotic pictures, pornographic literature, magazines, or nude and titillating photographs are not truly earning their livelihood. I should state on the basis of my information that their livelihood comes from other sources. They have been assigned to propagate and popularize this quagmire of lust and immorality among the Iranian people, especially the youths and their families. --Today, there are some who wield their pens in the same manner as those they see being favored and paid black money by the American CIA, which gives them a few dollars! They go ahead and write that the Iranian nation erred when it staged the revoluton. In this manner, they denigrate the greatest, most courageous, and inspiring action by the Iranian nation and say that the Iranian people regret they staged the revolution. May the hatred and disgust of the Iranian nation be upon such pens. --We will collar the big powers in all parts of the world, as they are tyrants who oppose us, and we do not spare tyrants. --We are not the kind of people or government that will ignore an aggressor or tyrant so that he can continue his work. --Formerly, when the powers of arrogance came, they did so overtly and occupied a country. Today, they use more advanced means for dominating and usurping nations and their resources.
