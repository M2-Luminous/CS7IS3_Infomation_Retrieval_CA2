Kim Chong-su, deputy ambassador of the North Korean Mission to the United Nations, said today that, because they had already proposed that the IAEA send its inspectors to Pyongyang, they would accept them at any time. Also, he acknowledged, for the first time, that North Korea had not begun the work of replacing fuel rods at the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. Diplomatic sources in Washington said that North Korea has already issued visas for the IAEA inspectors to visit Pyongyang. They predict that IAEA inspectors will leave for Pyongyang this weekend and that they will conduct inspections early next week.
