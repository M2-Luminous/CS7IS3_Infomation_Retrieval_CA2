FBIS3-32867 "drlat031_c_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-031 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 Mexico _o_Views, Reports on Chiapas Rebellion 94P20362A 94P20362A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Recent Mexican press coverage of the rebellion in Chiapas, which includes commentaries and reports of official and local views, touches on a broad range of topics, including the rebellion's ideological and organizational origins, political and economic factors promoting it, guerrilla methods of operation, viability of the movement, and the national political ramifications of the uprising. Paz Stresses Particularity Poet and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz characterizes the revolt as a manifestation of problems peculiar to Chiapas, rendering it unlikely to spread to other states. In his view, the Chiapas rebellion bears traits more akin to Guatemala and El Salvador than to other parts of Mexico. Paz observes that the guerrillas' statements reflect a mix of elements: Maoism, liberation theology, and ideas borrowed from Peru's Shining Path, and Central American revolutionary movements, "in sum, the remains of the great shipwreck of 20th-century revolutionary ideologies." He pronounces the uprising "unreal and...doomed to failure...[and out of touch] with our country's situation and its needs and current aspirations." He adds that "the Indian communities have been deceived by a group of irresponsible demagogues, and these are the ones who should be held accountable before the law and the nation." He retreats somewhat in his conclusion, however, saying that the leaders of the rebellion "are not the only ones responsible. A big share of the blame--perhaps the biggest, in historical and moral terms--rests with the well-off classes in Chiapas and many state politicians. What has happened should serve notice that if there is any place in Mexico where social, political, economic, and moral reform is necessary, that place is Chiapas." (Mexico City LA JORNADA 5 Jan 94) Modernization Need Seen Historian, novelist, and editor of the Mexico City monthly NEXOS Hector Aguilar Camin similarly criticizes the intellectual underpinnings of the revolt as remnants of Cold War leftist thinking, attributing special responsibility to church base communities and "groups of religious" inspired by liberation theology and the Catholic Church's "option for the poor." He declares "the Catholic Church as a whole and the Church in Chiapas in particular have some explaining to do to Mexican society about its radicalized wing, which appears to be the central actor in the makeup of the conflagration in Chiapas." Aguilar Camin concludes that "the explosion in Chiapas appears more like the last chapter of the now past Central American wars than the first chapter of any future violent instability in Mexico," adding that the rebellion's "cathartic eruption does not deny, but rather confirms, the process of internationalization in the country: the end of its proud insularity; the permeability of all its borders to the fair and ill winds of the world. And rather than refute, the rebellion ratifies the urgency of the modernization already undertaken, bringing to the fore the essential modernizations of the future," which he identifies as (1) a "political agreement that completes the pending democratic transition and sets aside violence as an alternative for public action," and (2) an "awareness that galvanizes the national will once and for all to confront the evils of poverty as the leading challenge and inescapable condition for the modernity that Mexicans neither can nor should abandon." (Mexico City PROCESO 10 Jan 94) Chiapas Official Assessment A Chiapas State document, identified by LA JORNADA as a confidential report to high levels of government in Mexico City, voices state government concerns over possible future violence in 42 "high risk" municipalities, as occurred in Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and San Cristobal de las Casas. The list includes: Yajalon, Chilon, Tila, Tumbala, Citala, Sabanilla, Salto de Agua, Palenque, Nicolas Ruiz, Chiapilla, San Lucas, Venustiano Carranza, Villa de las Rosas, Socoltenango, Teopizca, Simojovel, El Bosque, Huitiuipan, Pueblo Nuevo, Bochil, Jitotol, Pantepec, Tapalapea, Rayon, Tapilula, Ocotopec, Coapilla, Tecpatan, Copainala, Francisco Leon, Chenhalon, Larrainzer, Chalchihuetan, Pantelho, Sinacatan, Tenejapa, Chamula, Chanal, Huixtan, Oxchuc, Angel Albino Corzo, and La Concordia. The 16-page document, titled "Political Diagnosis of the Conflict Zone," also names 13 areas in various other municipalities requiring what LA JORNADA calls "special surveillance": In Cacahuatan, the municipality's main town of Agustin Iturbide and Salvador Urbina; in Union Juarez, the Santo Domingo ejido and Once de Abril; in Tapachula, the ejidos of Manacal, Chespal, Mexiquito, Toquiancito and Toquian; in Motozintla, the ejidos of Belisario Dominguez and Male Cuaresma; in Amatenango de la Frontera, Pajayal ejido; and in Ciltepec, the municipality's main town. According to the LA JORNADA account, the document devotes considerable attention to the economic and political problems it sees as the root of the conflict. It notes that the "considerable investments" made by the federal government have been "insufficient in comparison with the needs of the region" and notes that rural residents have been hurt by tight credit that has affected coffee, corn, and cattle operations; inadequate supply and marketing systems; the burden of past due loans; and a government decree "that makes the region an ecological reserve and blocks cattle and forestry operations without offering alternative means to survival." The document identifies other serious problems as the drop in coffee and cattle prices, the presence in the state of large numbers of Guatemalan refugees and workers, a high rate of alcoholism, the activities of middlemen, drug trafficking, and racial discrimination. Also seen as contributing to the unrest is the "activism...of social organizations and the religious activism" of priests, deacons, catechists, and, particularly, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz. The document urges the cancellation of past due debts accumulated by impoverished coffee growers and cattle ranchers, and a change in the government's attitude toward peasants to demonstrate, in LA JORNADA's words, "a treatment respectful of their dignity as humans, taking care that individuals assigned to the region are socially committed, with special attention being given to securing and administering justice." It further recommends establishing a single, microregional governmental point of contact in each municipality, as well as the creation of additional municipalities out of what are now the municipalities of Ocosingo and Las Margaritas. The document also recommends a policy of cooperation with the churches, particularly the Catholic Church. LA JORNADA notes in passing that the document reports the area affected by the rebellion as inhabited not only by Tojolabal, Tzeltal, and Chol Indians, but also "mestizos from Michoacan, Guerrero, Puebla, and Oaxaca." (LA JORNADA 9 Jan 94) Indian Support Cited In two interviews, Carlos Montemayor, author of the novel "Guerra en el Paraiso" ("War in Paradise," set during the insurgency in Guerrero in the 1960's and 1970's) and specialist in guerrilla affairs, characterizes the rebellion as the "tip of the iceberg" of discontent, asserting that it is supported by a vast network that has discreetly supplied food, money, information, and protection to the guerrillas through a complex Indian social and familial organization. He asserts that "Indian family structure is at once very simple and very complex. Deep-running communication, social organization, and economic networks run up and down the mountains, rivers, and forests of Mexico's various regions. It is very hard for groups, movements, or individuals from outside the area to pass unnoticed. My experience has been that whether one is talking about rural, mestizo, or creole areas, the mountains and forests have more eyes than the cities. It is impossible not only for vehicles but even for individuals to move about undetected." Montemayor appeals to federal and state governments to enter into negotiations with the Indian communities in which for the first time concessions would be made not only by the authorities but also by Chiapas's large land, cattle, and timber interests, and the rights of the Indian communities would be protected. He then cautions that these negotiations will be fruitless "if there is no will among Chiapas's creoles and mestizos, landholders and politicians to stop thinking like 17th-century encomenderos [Spanish royal Indian labor grantees] and if the government and the army do not refrain from seeing these negotiations as a defeat rather than a social victory in the very evolution of the country." Montemayor warns against seeking a strictly military solution to the rebellion; such movements, bred over a long period, are "very resistant" to suppression, and seeking only a military solution "could lead us to a Central Americanization" of the situation. (LA JORNADA 4 Jan 94, PROCESO 10 Jan 94) Antecedents Reviewed In a wide-ranging review of the rebellion's antecedents, Luis Hernandez Navarro, an adviser to the National Coordinating Board of Coffee Grower Organizations, asserts in the 9 January LA JORNADA that while colonization of the Lacandon Forest region was begun by lumber companies, area settlement received a major impetus in the 1940's from the many migrants who arrived there after unsuccessful efforts elsewhere in the country to secure a piece of land through the nation's agrarian reform program. Discussing the role of the Church, he adds that, as part of the "enterprise of building communities and lives where there had been none before," the settlers came to rely upon the presence and sympathy of the Catholic Church, while at the same time there was a "notable absence of government institutions," making "religion" one of the "key foundations upon which the new communities were built." According to Hernandez Navarro, catechists not only provided religious instruction but also became key elements in linking communities with the outside world. Educated and mobile, many of them having a mastery of Spanish, they unquestionably became the "organic intellectuals" of their congregations. Observing how the struggle for regularization of land claims and the delivery of government services also marked the area's development, Hernandez Navarro points out that a division of opinion arose as how best to seek improvements: "democratic organizations" sought to promote "peasant self-development"; others felt that only systemic change brought about through armed force could solve the problem. He says groups like the Rural Associations of Collective Interest-Union of Unions are an example of the first approach, and that what is today known as the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) is an expression of the second. Hernandez Navarro writes that the main arena of activity for years was occupied by the self-development groups, despite resistance from state governments; but some three years ago this approach began gradually to lose influence among the region's inhabitants, owing to years of conflict with landholders and their "white guards," who monopolized state government institutions and resources and blocked the flow of resources (itself inadequate) the federal government sought to channel into Indian communities through its programs. Elaborating on the federal programs, he claims that for "many of those initiatives it had been intended to use the local elites as promoters of modernization; and on top of this, the ongoing dismantling of government institutions that was part of the reform of the state has created a vacuum which has been only partially filled by democratic organizations." (With respect to one such program, the National Solidarity Program, Pronasol, journalist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa notes in a 9 January Monterrey EL NORTE commentary the Pronasol claim that prior to 1993 its funding for Chiapas was obliged to submit to traditional, inefficient state government controls under then Governor Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido.) These problems were compounded by a drop in earnings from the state's key products, writes Hernandez Navarro. Timber, protected since 1989 by conservation regulations, ceased to be a source of income. Coffee growers were hurt not only by the fall in international coffee prices from $120/140 per 100 pounds to $60/70, but also by the disappearance of government marketing and technical assistance. A decline in corn productivity resulted from population pressures and a contraction of the slash-and-burn cycle from 30 years to only two years. Also cited is the declining profitability of the cattle industry. Catechists' Role Noted A Tzotzil Indian interviewed in Huixtan (Chiapas) by LA JORNADA, who asked to have his identity withheld, addressed the role of catechists in the rebellion. Without identifying them, the Indian says that catechists who had taught him 20 years earlier were the ones who "tried to convince us to join the guerrillas" the morning of 1 January, when 300 EZLN members occupied the town's main square. He identifies the catechists turned guerrillas as current residents of the town who had once held "positions of authority" in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He also says that most of the rebel force, consisting of both men and women, ranges between the ages of 16 and 20, and that in talking with the guerrillas he learned that they communicate with each other by using skyrockets and red lanterns. (LA JORNADA 7 and 8 Jan 94) Political Aspects Emphasized While maintaining that economic injustice played a crucial part in fomenting the rebellion, four prominent commentators emphatically stress in separate commentaries that inadequate political reform was an equally important factor, one that, if neglected, threatens unrest during the August presidential elections. Linking Chiapan developments with the prospects for societal peace nationally, PRI member of the Federal District Assembly of Representatives and political reform advocate Demetrio Sodi de la Tijera writes that the rebellion "is not just about changing social conditions, nor is it a problem of resources or solidarity." He argues that it is "basically a rebellion over political conditions, government corruption, electoral fraud, and the imposition of officials from above, a response to plotting by officials and caciques, injustices, lawbreaking, and repression that Indian communities suffer every day, and infringements of the law that occur in many parts of the country and that affect the majority of Mexicans." In the aftermath of the rebellion, "the danger of social explosions occurring in other parts of the country and becoming generalized" has "risen immensely," especially if the upcoming election's results are "unacceptable" to "political forces" in the country. (LA JORNADA 7 Jan 94) Drawing heavily on Thomas Benjamin's 1989 historical study "A Rich Land, A Poor People: Politics and Society in Modern Chiapas" to document his case that unjust social and economic structures dominate Chiapas, Colegio de Mexico international relations specialist Lorenzo Meyer argues that "the challenge facing Mexico as a whole and her political class in particular is deeper and more serious than that which brought the government to negotiate the free trade agreement with the United States." What is involved, he said, is "negotiating, under difficult circumstances, a new political pact between those who govern and a majority of the governed" that recognizes "their status as citizens and redistributes in a less unjust manner the burden of economic development, without any of the irresponsible acts, chicanery, corruption, and shams that have made the Mexican political class world famous (`the perfect dictatorship')." (Mexico City EXCELSIOR 6 Jan 94) National Autonomous University of Mexico political scientist Jorge Castaneda similarly criticizes the political as well as economic roots of the rebellion during an interview and then asserts that "the problems of poverty are not resolved with money alone, because the problem is not one of expenditures but rather one of structures, of organization, for [Indians] to participate in decisions concerning their communities, jobs, decent treatment by officials, the return of lands, etc." On account of this, Castaneda sees the political system facing a dilemma, a "political crisis," because to carry out the needed reform, the government will have to weaken the powerful economic and social interests upon which the system is built and which remain outside the control of elected officials. For him, the rebellion signals that citizens have reached their "limit," and that if there is a failure to achieve an "electoral process that is clean and acceptable to everyone, there is a danger of violence." (PROCESO 10 Jan 94) In a Spanish-language version of his NEW YORK TIMES Syndicate column carried by LA JORNADA, novelist Carlos Fuentes stresses the importance of democratic political reform as a prerequisite for a successful and just economic reform undertaken by the government. He emphasizes that propagation of democracy must start at the most elemental level, "in the smallest villages, where the inhabitants know each other and know how to choose the best persons. All democracy starts by being local.... On the other hand, the central authorities almost always impose the worst officials [upon communities].... Only they are able to work with the Chiapan oligarchy." In his view, the "Mexican political and economic system, antidemocratic and unjust, shares responsibility for the explosion in Chiapas." Fuentes sees achievement of parallel political and economic reforms in Chiapas as a necessary first step in the genuine "economic, political, and cultural transformation" of the country.
