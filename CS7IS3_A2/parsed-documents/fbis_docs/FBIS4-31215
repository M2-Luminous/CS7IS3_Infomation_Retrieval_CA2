He stated that the international mediators have been trying to impose a take-it-or-leave-it solution by exerting pressure on Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing that the contact group said it would put forward its proposal in a week or two. We are not pleased with the proposal of the territorial division in eastern Bosnia, and there are no instruments of coercion. Therefore, we are wondering how any kind of agreement would be implemented, Silajdzic added. He also said that Bosnia-Herzegovina demanded that NATO offer guarantees for the implementation of the agreement and secure Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders in case the peace agreement is accepted. Bosnia-Herzegovina also demands specific plans for the return of refugees and clear guarantees that reconstruction aid will be provided. Silajdzic announced that members of the contact group would visit Sarajevo in approximately 10 days to resume negotiations.
