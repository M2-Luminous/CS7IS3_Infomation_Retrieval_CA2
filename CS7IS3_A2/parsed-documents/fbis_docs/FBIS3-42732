The train has left. The nomination of aspiring candidate for deputy of the Supreme Council of Ukraine ended on 26 January. According to the Law on Elections, the collection of signatures, and registrations, will be conducted until 10 February, but the number of aspirants can only decrease, not increase. Those who collected 300 signatures and paid the entry fee in the amount of five minimum wages have already taken their place on the train, have arranged their baggage, and have started to look hard at their fellow travelers. Whom do we see among the "passengers?" In what coaches and compartments have they settled? What kind of ties have bound their unions, and have the blocs not started to squabble among each other? Alas, it appears that there will be no intimate groups on this train. Although it is still early to reach conclusions, the first results of the nominations show however that groups of very diverse colors have been sorted out. Thus, for each of the 34 electoral districts of the Dnepropetrovsk region there are six aspirants on average; moreover, the voters proposed 129 persons, labor collectives--58, but parties and movements--only 17. It is noteworthy that among the aspirants about 30 are managers of enterprises, kolkhozes, and sovkhozes, 21 are representatives of commercial structures, 13 are unemployed, and only eight are workers. As a rule, the "oldsters" are going into battle. Among the aspirants we see Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs; Sergey Pravdenko, editor in chief of the newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY; Valeriy Pustovoytenko, deputy chairman of the board of the Expobank; and also seven current people's deputies. The situation is the same in the other oblasts. But the number of aspirants differs in them: It is either feast or famine. While in Galicia and generally in western Ukraine the districts are "overpopulated," they have 20 each, and even 30 aspirants in the Crimea (which made it possible for V. Chornovil to accurately call these districts "fraternal graves"); for example, in some of the districts, alas, there are none. As for the ties and blocs, there is complete confusion here also. Created at the end of last year by Rukh [Popular Movement of Ukraine], the KNDS [Congress of National-Democratic Forces], and the URP [Ukrainian Republican Party], the Council of Democratic Organizations with a permanently operating staff proved to be built on sand. "The separate nominations of candidates of the bloc and Rukh may serve as an example that not everything is in order in the camp of the democrats--it divides the united forces of the democrats," complains Levko Lukyanenko, cochairman of the staff. Everything comes down to the fact that the ambitions of the national-democrats exceed their ammunition. The managers of Rukh themselves admit that it is not party but personal aspects that come to the forefront in the election campaign. "We do not have a political party," thinks Sergey Golovatyy, "but there are clubs--the Lukyanenko, Chornovil, Pavlychko, and Moroz clubs." Independent observers think that Rukh is now striving to win the elections only with its own forces, without considering the needs of its Council partners, inasmuch as it is not confident of the effectiveness of joint actions. And already now a futile debate has started regarding who was the first to start to put whom down. "One sees an interesting alliance of our right-wingers and the party in power," says Vyacheslav Chornovil. "They are coming out against Rukh in order not to let them take those 20-25 percent that we set our sights on. Some national democrats are also being used for this." Its political opponents are holding the directly opposite opinion. "Rukh's wish is to see to it that a representative of Rukh and the KNDS is not simultaneously on the ballot in one district--this is a declaration that is not backed by anything," says Larysa Skoryk. It appears that the interregional bloc of Volodymyr Hrynyov-Leonid Kuchma feels most comfortable of all in the "train." "Our candidates," declared Hrynyov, "are prepared to cooperate without quarrels and splits in the organs of state authority as well." This bloc is oriented on the southeast region, and stands for the conduct of market reforms, but one of the points of its program envisions introduction of the Russian language as the second state language. It is also impossible to disregard the bloc of Volodymyr Lanovyy with private entrepreneurs and free trade unions. Lanovyy thinks that Kuchma's program generally does not talk about market reforms and therefore is counterposing his own program, whose keystone is privatization. Lanovyy's relationship with the miners' trade union weakens the position of parties that are traditionally influential in the Donbass--Merkulov's Liberal Party and the Labor Party. The balance worked out by Lanovyy between the trade unionists and the bankers from Inko and Pravex makes it possible for him to stand "on his own two feet" immediately. He also does not overestimate the role of the trade unions themselves which, according to the Law on Elections, and in particular the statute on labor collectives, have gained an opportunity to really influence the election process. However, trade union leaders treat with skepticism the idea of establishing a bloc with political parties. "Political forces are engaged in what is not even an intraparty or interparty fight but more of a squabble," says Aleksandr Mril, chairman of the executive committee of the association Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. "They are waging a fight for seats, for some particle of power. We have one objective--the democratization of society, reforms, and a market--but the approaches and paths are absolutely different. We think that people should be helped at least regarding bread. But they do not consider that people have been reduced to despair." In the opinion of political scientists, a bloc has also not been established between the Socialist, Communist, and Peasant Parties. Already at the very beginning, Yevgeniy Marmazov, secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, declared that "we will not form a bloc with anyone, but the Communist, Socialist, and Peasant Parties will help each other." And it appears it was that way at the beginning. For example, these parties did not allocate their aspirants in Donetsk according to districts, but proposed that the voters vote according to lists so that the Communists and Socialists would be able to select candidates together in a majority of the districts. This practice began to spread to other regions also, and, judging by everything, it did not last long. In some districts the voters will have to make a choice between the Socialists and Communists.
