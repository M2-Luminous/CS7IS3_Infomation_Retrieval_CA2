In his book On a Knife Edge which has been published by Albin Michel, he makes revelations with resounding frankness and presents a new image. But what is his political position? How does he see Russia's future today? He answered LE FIGARO's questions at the Kremlin. Sincerely, sometimes abruptly, but always frankly. [LE FIGARO] Boris Yeltsin, despite all the rumors, despite everything that has been said about you, you are still there, loyally at your post... [Yeltsin] Absolutely. I am at the helm and even more strongly than before the coup d'etat. [LE FIGARO] How do you manage that despite all the ups and downs? [Yeltsin] There is no recipe for being president of Russia. Especially because I am the first to hold this position: There is not yet any firmly anchored tradition. I always act in accordance with my view of the situation, as I feel it, in accordance with my character and my experience. [LE FIGARO] Is your book On a Knife Edge not intended to give a different image of you than the one we had? [Yeltsin] No. I have simply spoken about myself and described the events as they took place, completely frankly, with sincerity. I have tried, as the philosophers put it, to express complex matters in simple terms. It was necessary to write with humanity to ensure that all people could understand, all, the miner as well as the academician. [LE FIGARO] But you do not seem to be as many people imagine you: We see a man who is hesitant, a man who is a prey to doubt and who understands his opponents. [Yeltsin] That is because people did not know me very well. In the past I have never spoken so openly about myself. This time, I was very sincere. I have never tried to embellish myself, or to present myself as more intelligent than I am. That is the essential thing. [LE FIGARO] You have been widely slandered in Russia but especially in the West as a demagogue, a chauvinist, a populist... Of all these accusations, which wounded you most? [Yeltsin] Any unfair accusation wounds me deeply. I am very sensitive to this, and I find it difficult to tolerate. During the Congress of People's Deputies, the deputies literally mocked me, they criticized me to such an extent that my mother could not tolerate it. It killed her. You can imagine how I suffered. [LE FIGARO] So, you are much more sensitive than people generally think... [Yeltsin] Yes. Usually I am taken for a much harder man than I really am. But, at all events, I have never become the dictator which some people thought they saw in me. That is not what I aspire to, never. [LE FIGARO] Is it possible to be president of the Russian Federation and have a good heart? [Yeltsin] I think that the two things go well together. [LE FIGARO] How do you explain the hatred which a section of the Western intelligentsia has toward you, the people who always preferred Mikhail Gorbachev and who are almost nostalgic for him? [Yeltsin] Listen, I have traveled widely, but I have never experienced hatred from the Western intelligentsia. With regard to Gorbachev's good image, yes, it still exists. There is still nostalgia, but it is gradually being eroded. And that is natural. [LE FIGARO] Three years after the end of the USSR is a long time.... [Yeltsin] He paid more attention to foreign policy than to his people's internal problems. That is why, moreover, our people feel less respect for him than foreigners. [LE FIGARO] In your book you write that "we are running out of strength... A strange feeling of emptiness gnaws at us." Should that not be interpreted as an admission of failure? [Yeltsin] No. For 70 years, the former leaders of the Soviet Union had been trying to paint a rosy picture of everything, to embellish reality. They had accustomed the people to believing that nowhere else were things going better than in our country. I wrote the truth: There are doubts; among some people there is lack of confidence in the reforms, a pessimism that the reforms will not be carried through. But this is not the majority, the majority of people have confidence in Russia, its renaissance, its democracy, and its market economy. [LE FIGARO] So, you do not regret having used shock treatment? [Yeltsin] Not at all. Those who have not done so in the CIS countries -- Ukraine, for instance -- are now in a much more difficult position than Russia. I expected that. I even tried to persuade the other states that we were right and that they should follow Russia. Failing that, the former Communist Party nomenklatura would take us back to the past. And that was unacceptable. We therefore had to act quickly and resolutely. [LE FIGARO] And does that nomenklatura still worry you today? [Yeltsin] No, it is they who are worried. [LE FIGARO] Do you feel that you have made mistakes over the past three years, and if so what are they? [Yeltsin] There have been mistakes, of course. I would not like to list them, but there have been some. However, none of them has been strategic in nature, they were tactical mistakes. At specific moments, it was possible to act differently, but that does not change the strategic objective. [LE FIGARO] Where does the danger for Russia lie now? With the Communist Party? With Zhirinovskiy? The rise of neo-fascism? [Yeltsin] The real danger is the next president. That is what could present a problem for Russia. [LE FIGARO] So, will it be Boris Yeltsin again? [Yeltsin] I will not talk about that subject. [LE FIGARO] Why is the candidacy of the future president, for the 1996 elections, so dangerous? [Yeltsin] Because no possible candidate can be seen. Perhaps in two years a prominent figure will emerge, a political leader who would be recognized by 120 million voters. [LE FIGARO] So, you are planning to stay... [Yeltsin] Until June 1996 of course. [LE FIGARO] And after that, you will see? [Yeltsin] I repeat that I will not talk about that subject. [LE FIGARO] But do you not think that a man should be prepared for this task now? [Yeltsin] It must be done. And I am personally concerned with this. [LE FIGARO] Is Zhirinovskiy a threat? [Yeltsin] No. [LE FIGARO] Are the Russian people too intelligent to allow themselves to be taken in by demagoguery? [Yeltsin] He is a man who will leave the political stage. He has no social base. There is no support for fascism in our country. Our people suffered more than any other from it in World War II, it lost 20 million people in it. [LE FIGARO] How do you explain the gloom-mongering with regard to Russia? Sometimes a coup d'etat is predicted and at others there is talk of famine... [Yeltsin] Why should I answer that. Go and look at our stores, they are like France now. They sell kiwi fruit! [LE FIGARO] Man cannot live by kiwi fruit alone.... [Yeltsin] Do you not know what a kiwi fruit is? It is fruit from the south. You can find anything you want in our stores. [LE FIGARO] Do you mean that agriculture is now functioning? [Yeltsin] I mean that the market for consumer goods is recovering. I do not mean that it is the most well-stocked market in the world, but it is close to the markets which exist in the civilized countries. It takes a great deal of imagination to think of something to buy which is not in our stores. This was impossible two or two and one half years ago. The shelves were completely empty, the stores were empty. This is what the reform is, these are its results. [LE FIGARO] So, you are optimistic, even if you think that it will take a lot more time? [Yeltsin] I have never said that it would take a great deal of time. It is you who say that, not me. [LE FIGARO] In the West, it is not just the collapse of Russia which is feared, there is a conflicting, totally conflicting fear: that of the return of Russian imperialism, of a new takeover of the CIS countries in particular. Does this risk exist? [Yeltsin] No, no, no. The former empire will never return. I can absolutely guarantee that. Democracy and the empire are not compatible. When we sign 12 agreements and treaties, including a treaty of friendship with President Ulmanis of Latvia, is that the attitude of an empire? No, these are the actions of a friendly neighbor. Nothing more than that. And we are acting in the same way toward the others. [LE FIGARO] There are nonetheless 25 million Russians living outside Russia's borders. Does this not present you with a problem? [Yeltsin] Of course, this worries us. Especially when there are cases of discrimination against Russians. That is why, in Latvia's case, we are signing an agreement on pension rights for Russians living there and other documents relating to human rights, among other things. There are international rules, we want there to be no segregation between Latvians and Russians. [LE FIGARO] We in the West sometimes find it difficult to understand Russia's attitude on the Bosnian issue. On the one hand, there is Slav solidarity with the Serbs, but at the same time you give the impression of having more and more difficulty in supporting them... [Yeltsin] You are completely wrong. You are completely mistaken. It is surprising that you have such a view of things. The reverse is true. We want to end the war in Bosnia, and in Yugoslavia in general. I repeat: end the war. The Americans have greater influence over the Muslims, the Germans over the Croatians, and the Russians over the Serbs. Let us therefore work together to exert our influence to ensure that they sit down at the negotiating table and sign a peace agreement. It was I who suggested a summit meeting among Russia, the United States, the European Union, the United Nations, and the Yugoslav leaders, in a neutral European country. Let us agree that a peace agreement should be signed, or at least a cease-fire agreement. We think that our contribution is thus much more important than air strikes. [LE FIGARO] You would like this peace agreement to be signed in Moscow one day... [Yeltsin] Why not in Moscow... In Moscow or elsewhere, in any Russian city... I can also go to Geneva, to any city... [LE FIGARO] In your book, you give the impression of having a weakness for George Bush and Helmut Kohl. Who is the statesman to whom you feel closest? [Yeltsin] This is true of Bush. I wrote that with complete frankness. From our first meeting, we had good relations, we were sincere with each other, and we became good friends. It was then that we formulated our ideas on our partnership, it was then that we renounced the potential rivalry between our countries, it was then that we reached agreement no longer to target missiles at each other. I greatly respect his wife Barbara and his whole family. With regard to Helmut Kohl, we meet often, we talk frequently on the telephone, and I am going to make him an official visit in May. We have very good relations. Moreover, when it comes to support for the reforms in Russia, Germany has done more than any other country. [LE FIGARO] In On a Knife Edge virtually no mention is made of Francois Mitterrand. Why is that? [Yeltsin] I have not written a world history, or a history textbook. I have met with Mitterrand twice and he receives a corresponding number of mentions in my book. [LE FIGARO] What are you going to do when you leave us? Play tennis? [Yeltsin] No, I play on Tuesdays and Saturdays. [LE FIGARO] Take a freezing cold bath? [Yeltsin] Certainly. I do that every day. [LE FIGARO] It is surprising to note, on reading your book, that the idea of death does not frighten you? [Yeltsin] Absolutely not. [LE FIGARO] How can this be? [Yeltsin] I have never thought about it, I simply do not think about it. That is how it is, I was born like that. [LE FIGARO] How many hours do you sleep at night? [Yeltsin] Two, four, five at most. [LE FIGARO] Where do you find this strength which enables you to rise like a Phoenix? [Yeltsin] I was born like that. All my ancestors were old when they died, 96 or 100 years old. [LE FIGARO] Do you like power? Is it not that which stimulates you? [Yeltsin] No, quite the reverse, it requires strength. Too much strength, you know. Power devours your energy. [LE FIGARO] What does power mean to you? [Yeltsin] It means devoting yourself fully to the task for which you have been chosen by your people. [LE FIGARO] If you had not been disgraced in 1987 and ousted from the Politburo, would you now be Russian president? [Yeltsin] I do not like to speculate.
