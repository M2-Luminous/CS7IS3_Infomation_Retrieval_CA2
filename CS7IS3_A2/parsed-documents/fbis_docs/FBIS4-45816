Mass media here have disclosed that the water of the Huai He valley is seriously polluted and nearly 50 percent of river sections have become useless; in some areas, polluted water has been used to irrigate land over a long period resulting in a decrease in grain output and the content of pollutants in agricultural produce exceeding safety standards; the output and variety of fish and shrimp have decreased; and disputes over pollution between different localities have become more and more conspicuous. In dry seasons, plants often have to suspend production. The shortage of water resources has become more and more serious and control over the Huai He brooks no delay. A meeting on enforcing laws to protect the environment of the Huai He valley was held in Bengbu, Anhui, from 24-26 May. Besides laws and regulations on prevention and treatment of pollution to be revised this year, provisions concerning crimes in causing pollution will be added. The formulation of "Regulations on Prevention and Treatment of Pollution in the Huai He Valley" is also being discussed.
