All the articles except part seven, which is not attributed, are written by JINGJI CANKAO BAO reporter Yu Huiyin [0151 6540 7299]. Part one of the series is carried immediately under the masthead and the rest are carried in other places on page 1. The main contents of these articles are as follows: 1. "Reform Is Aimed at Development--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part One)" The article begins by saying: "Seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability is the general task of the whole party and the whole country. Reform and opening up are the motive force for development, development and reform are the foundation for the long-term social stability of the country, and maintaining social stability is the prerequisite for developing the economy and deepening reform." The article says that development and reform are interdependent and that "it is impossible to speed up development without speeding up reform." "Reform should center closely round development and should regard contradictions, difficulties, and hot spots emerging at deeper levels in economic development as key points." The article further says: "The most valuable thing of the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation in carrying out comprehensive and coordinated reforms is that it has firmly grasped some most pressing problems in development and steadily carried out reforms to gradually solve theses problems and promote development." In view of its difficulties, the corporation "put forward the basic train for thought for carrying out comprehensive and coordinated reforms--`increase the value of assets, relocate enterprises, change functions, transform mechanisms, and make arrangements for surplus workers,'--clearly put forward the target of preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets, focused attention on comprehensively enlivening the state sector of the economy instead of just individual state-owned enterprises in an isolated manner, carried out reforms comprehensively instead of item by item, and seized the opportunity to change structures and mechanisms." The article then mentions the corporation's achievements in increasing output value, sales volume, profits and taxes handed over to the state, and workers' income. In conclusion, the article says: "It should be pointed out that damaging the fundamental interests of the state and people should not be the price for development. The problem of serious losses of state-owned assets cannot be solved without reform. How to carry out reform? Can we rely entirely on selling state-owned assets to foreign businessmen and individuals? Can we blaze a new path by mainly depending on the strength of the state sector of the economy, reallocating resources and production factors, and reforming and changing the operational mechanism, while guaranteeing the rights and interests of the proprietors of state-owned assets, preventing loss of state-owned assets, and guaranteeing the property rights of enterprise legal persons as pointed out in the decision made at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee? These questions are worthy of constant exploration by people including those of the Beijing First Light Industry system." 2. "Make Advancement as a Whole, Make Breakthroughs at Key Points--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Two)" The article says: "To continue to deepen reform, we must resolve contradictions at deeper levels. However, various contradictions at deeper levels, which are intertwined, mutually affected, and mutually conditioned, cannot be resolved with reforms or readjustments carried out item by item." The article says the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation has similar contradictions to resolve and tells how it has resolved them: "It has organically integrated many items of reform, including optimizing the production setup, changing functions of government departments, changing operational mechanisms of enterprises, training and placing surplus workers, and establishing a modern enterprise system, and has pushed forward reforms of state enterprises in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. It has taken the enlivening of the state sector of the economy as the center and of stock assets as a point for making a breakthrough, and has increased the value of state-owned assets." In the end, the article tells how the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation has succeeded in enlivening state-owned enterprises in only one year: "The Beijing First Light Industry system has shifted its efforts from enlivening individual enterprises to enlivening state-owned assets, from carrying out reforms item by item to carrying out comprehensive and coordinated reforms, and from maintaining the traditional enterprise system to establishing a modern enterprise system so that state enterprises reorganize themselves in market competition and generate new and greater vitality." 3. "Planning Leads to Economic Results--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Three)" The article first says: "Comprehensive and coordinated reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industry system have been based on the `Beijing General City Construction Plan.'" According to this plan, the article says, "the role played by tertiary industry in promoting the national economy will become more and more evident. It is also possible to make full use of limited land resources and to increase their input-output rate.... To optimize the layout of the city, it is necessary to gradually shift the focus of city construction from urban areas to distant suburban areas and counties and to develop city construction and to shift from extension expansion to readjustment and transformation. The Beijing First Light Industry system has precisely proceeded from this local reality, endeavored on its own initiative to meet the objective needs of readjusting the economic structure and developing tertiary industry as mentioned in the General City Construction Plan, and put forward the development strategy of relocating secondary industry enterprises and developing tertiary and secondary industry at a high level in suburban areas beyond the Fourth Ring Road." Then the article gives details of how "the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation carried out comprehensive and coordinated reforms, taking the enlivening of state-owned stock assets including land resources as a point for making a breakthrough." The article tells how the corporation moved its enterprises out of urban areas and constructed office buildings and residential quarters in former factory premises to develop tertiary industry. The article calls for learning from the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation in attaching importance to planning. In conclusion, the article says: "In carrying out experiments at selected points on comprehensive and coordinated reforms, various localities should do so under the unified leadership of respective local governments and with unified planning, and such experiments should be organized in a unified manner. All the planning for development of various trades and professions should be included into the general plan for local city development." 4. "Enlivening Stock Assets Is a Big Issue--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Four)" The article begins by saying: "The characteristics of the comprehensive and coordinated reform carried out by the Beijing First Light Industry system are proceeding from putting property rights relationships in order, operating and developing state-owned assets in accordance with the needs of the market economy, giving play to the role of differential benefits of land resources, optimizing the allocation of resources, and ensuring a constant increase in the value of state-owned assets to strengthen the state sector of the economy. Some people thought that the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry system is mainly the development of real estate. They did not correctly understand its basic experience and basic train of thought." The article goes on to give an account of how the corporation's Hongyun Property Investment Company Limited developed real estate and used the money obtained to relocate plants, develop secondary industry at a high level, train qualified personnel, and develop tertiary industry, which provided lots of jobs for surplus workers. The article then says: "Enlivening state-owned stock assets is a point for making a breakthrough in the comprehensive and coordinated reform carried out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation. The connotation of stock assets is very broad. It includes various tangible and intangible assets. Enlivening state-owned stock assets is not confined to readjustment of the direction of use of land, but also includes improving operations, promoting technological progress, improving enterprise management, improving the quality of workers and staff members, optimizing the combination of production factors, and so on. All these can enable existing resources to produce greater economy results. The Beijing First Light Industry system has, in light of different situations and problems of enterprises, explored and adopted various ways to enliven stock assets." The article then provides concrete examples showing successes of the corporation in this respect. 5. "Surplus Workers Are Also Wealth of the Society--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Five)" The article says at the beginning: "Making arrangements for surplus workers is a prerequisite for the readjustment of the industrial setup and enterprise structure and is also an important issue which has a bearing on the success of reform and social stability." Then the article mentions difficulties in solving problems in making arrangements for surplus workers and writes about effective methods adopted by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation--establishment of an insurance and compensation mechanism for unemployed workers, the pooling of funds for training and job assignment of unemployed workers, and the establishment of a labor service development company. According to the article, the labor service development company ran 14 kinds of training classes to enable workers to acquire knowledge and skills needed for future jobs. 6. "Separating Government From Assets Is a Prerequisite for Separating Government Administration From Enterprise Management--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Six)" The article begins by saying that government departments in charge of state enterprises should ensure an increase in the value of state-owned assets and should also change their functions and separate government administration from enterprise management so that enterprises can carry out operations on their own according to law. The article then gives an important reason why it has been so difficult to separate government administration from enterprise management: "The government's social and economic administration functions have not been separated from its function as the proprietor of state-owned assets." The article goes on to say that "to separate government administration from enterprise management, the government must first be separated from assets." According to the article, the Beijing First Light Industry system has enthusiastically explored rational forms and means of management and operation of state-owned assets following the principle of separating government from assets. "With the approval of the Beijing Municipal Government, the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation, which originally exercised the function of government administration, has been transformed into a company which manages state-owned assets. It exercises the function of proprietor of state-owned assets, separates government administration from enterprise management and investor ownership from the property rights of enterprise legal persons. It increases the value of state-owned assets through operating them, and gradually separates itself from the functions of trade and social management on behalf of the government. In addition, it has removed restrictions on production and operation enterprises so that these enterprises can exercise all rights according to laws of property rights of legal persons, carry out operations on their own, and assume sole responsibility for their profits and losses." The article also says "there are other forms of management of state-owned assets, such as establishment of investment organizations, foundations, and holdings companies," and stresses that the success of such management is determined by "whether or not property rights relations are put in order, property rights responsibilities are clearly defined, and enlivening the state sector of the economy and ensuring an increase in the value of state-owned assets are taken as the starting point and standpoint." 7. "Efforts Concentrated on Bringing Forth New Systems--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Seven)" The article begins by saying: "An important standard for assessing whether or not a reform is successful is whether or not a comprehensive new mechanism is set up." Then the article gives examples of how "the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation seized the opportunity of urban transformation and the readjustment of the production setup to develop potential assets, and regarding this as a turning point, energetically readjusted enterprise structures and changed the operational mechanisms of enterprises. In developing the land resources of former enterprises, "it established a new land use system" and "succeeded in increasing the value of state-owned assets." The article continues: "Regarding the distribution system, payment of wages according to grades is changed into payment according to contribution. Regarding the labor employment system, the practice of an enterprise taking care of everything concerning workers' employment is changed into labor employment based on the ability of individual workers." Surplus workers are "trained to enhance their skills and to improve their quality so they can depend on their own ability to chose, or to be chosen for, jobs amid market competition.... The demand on giving play to the role of market mechanism runs through various links of comprehensive and coordinated reforms." The article gives as an example how the newly organized Beijing Match Plant set up new mechanisms at the very beginning of operations. "All wages are paid on a piecemeal basis and production quotas are set. Pensions and insurance are covered by the society.... Enterprises no longer bears the burden concerning resignation and retirement of workers.... All workers are employed on a contract basis and managing cadres are employed by appointment." The article also says the newly established Beijing Hongyun Property Investment Company Limited "has established an entirely new operational mechanism and a standardized management structure, and adopted operational practices in accordance with the needs of the market economy.... There is no relationship of administrative subordination between the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation, which has been transformed into a company for managing state-owned assets, and the Hongyun Company. The former does not exercise any administrative function and as a controlling company, it only enjoys benefits according to share rights and uses the rights of shareholders to influence the behavior of the latter." In conclusion, the article attributes the successes of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation to its efforts to establish new systems. 8. "Rebirth Following a Natural and Unrestrained Death--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Eight)" The article mainly recounts the fate of the Beijing Match Plant, a plant selected by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation for carrying out experiments on reform. The plant was an old one set up in the last years of the Qing Dynasty. It had 868 workers and 500 retired workers. It suffered a loss of 2.5 million yuan last year. The plant was moved to a rural area and became a joint venture with a local enterprise. "The economic results of the new match plant have increased as the strong point of having technical personnel of an urban enterprise and the strong point of having greater flexibility and running at a low cost as a rural enterprise supplement each other." A real estate management company was set up. The original premises of the Beijing Match Plant have been built into a small residential area, and this has increased the assets of the company from 10 million yuan to 110 million yuan. The company has yielded great economic and social benefits and has provided many job vacancies. "Of the 868 workers of the former match plant, 130 have been transferred to the tertiary industry enterprise, 60 technical workers have gone to the new match plant, 120 workers retired, and 558 are being trained for other posts by the Labor Service Development Company according to the needs of the market. The Beijing Light Industry System uses part of the benefits obtained from optimizing allocation of resources and increasing the value of resources to set up a job-waiting insurance system, which ensures the livelihood of workers being trained for new jobs, supplements funds for training, and guarantees the stability of the match plant." The article concludes: "In this way, an enterprise which suffered heavy losses was eliminated and two new profit-making enterprises were born. Besides, the capacity for producing daily necessities was preserved." 9. "It Is Also Necessary to Put In Less and Put Out More in Reform--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Nine)" The article says "in carrying out reform of the economic structure, it is necessary and possible to put in less and put out more. This has been proved by the comprehensive and coordinated reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation." The article also says: "Practice has proved that enterprises are carriers for the movement of capital. If enterprises do not establish a mechanism which enables them to consciously seek an increase in the value of their assets in accordance with the intrinsic demands of the law of value and a modern enterprise system which is in keeping with market competition and changes, or if they do not carry out comprehensive and coordinated reforms in the overall setting of enlivening the entire state sector of the economy, it is impossible to fundamentally solve the problems of enlivening state enterprises." The article then writes about how the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation succeeded in putting in less and putting out more: "The corporation did not depend on tax reduction, retaining more profits, or writing off past debts. Instead, it regarded enlivening stock assets and increasing the value of assets as a point for making a breakthrough, overcame the difficulty of the shortage of funds, and created necessary conditions for the placement of workers and the relocation of enterprises. The placement of workers and the relocation of enterprises provided a new opportunity for changes in mechanisms, while changes in the functions of government departments made it possible to change the mechanism of enterprises. Reforms carried out in this way gave expression to the unity between enlivening state enterprises and enlivening state-owned assets, the unity between the readjustment of production relationship and the readjustment of the productive forces, the unity between economic results on the one hand and social and environmental benefits on the other, and in particular, the unity of reform, development, and stability." In conclusion, the article says such reforms have "realized a greater increase in the value of state-owned assets and are conducive to strengthening the state sector of the economy and to consolidating the leading position and giving play to the leading role of state enterprises in the national economy." 10. "Support Comprehensive and Coordinated Reforms in a Comprehensive and Coordinated Manner--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Ten)" The article begins by saying that "the reforms of state enterprises is system engineering. Not only are various items of reforms within enterprises interrelated, such reforms also involve many aspects of the external environment, including putting the property rights relations in order, changing government functions, developing the market system, and reforming the social insurance system." The article then urges major leading officials of government to personally strengthen unified planning for reform and urges organizations of various sectors to coordinate. The article says: "All departments concerned should proceed from the overall situation of promoting the establishment of a modern enterprise system, cooperate with one another, and enhance the smooth progress of reform. Supporting comprehensive and coordinated reforms in a comprehensive and coordinated manner is a demand explicitly put forward by the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and the municipal government while giving direct leadership over experiments on reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation and is also the successful experience of the corporation in making a smooth progress in carrying the reforms within such a short time." The article then mentions how Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, Mayor Li Qiyan, and other high-level officials handled official business at the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation and how the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy and committees, departments, and offices of the Beijing Municipal Government helped solve problems emerged in the reforms. In conclusion, the article urges various localities to use the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation as reference and boldly make exploration and carry out reforms.
