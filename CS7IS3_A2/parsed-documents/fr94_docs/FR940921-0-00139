(2)(i) Unleaded gasoline representative of commercial gasoline which will be generally available through retail outlets shall be used in service accumulation. (ii) The octane rating of the gasoline used shall not be higher than one Research octane number above the minimum recommended by the manufacturer and have a minimum sensitivity of 7.5 octane numbers, where sensitivity is defined as the Research octane number minus the Motor octane number. (iii) The Reid Vapor Pressure of the gasoline used shall be characteristic of the motor fuel used during the season in which the service accumulation takes place. (3) The specification range of the gasoline to be used under paragraph (a) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (b) Petroleum diesel test fuel. (1) The petroleum fuels for testing diesel engines employed for testing shall be clean and bright, with pour and cloud points adequate for operability. The petroleum diesel fuel may contain nonmetallic additives as follows: Cetane improver, metal deactivator, antioxidant, dehazer, antirust, pour depressant, dye, dispersant and biocide. Fuels specified for emissions testing are intended to be representative of commercially available in-use fuels. (2) Petroleum diesel fuel for diesel engines meeting the specifications in Table N94&hyph;2, or substantially equivalent specifications approved by the Administrator, shall be used in exhaust emissions testing. The grade of petroleum diesel fuel used shall be commercially designated as ``Type 2&hyph;D'' grade diesel fuel except that fuel commercially designated as ``Type 1&hyph;D'' grade diesel fuel may be substituted provided that the manufacturer has submitted evidence to the Administrator demonstrating to the Administrator's satisfaction that this fuel will be the predominant in-use fuel. Such evidence could include such things as copies of signed contracts from customers indicating the intent to purchase and use ``Type 1&hyph;D'' grade diesel fuel as the primary fuel for use in the engines or other evidence acceptable to the Administrator.
