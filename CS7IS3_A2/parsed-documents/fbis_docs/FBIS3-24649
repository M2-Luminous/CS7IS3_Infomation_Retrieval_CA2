Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-09FEB94-ISRAEL Newspaper Accuses Foreign Minis try of Lying The English-language newspaper THE JERUSALEM POST, which has a strong right-wing orientation and as Israel's only English- language newspaper is regarded as influential among foreign readers, has rebuked the Israeli Foreign Ministry for its recent decision to cancel more than 1,000 of the ministry's 1,200 subscriptions to the paper's weekly international edition and to reduce subscriptions to its weekly French edition from 125 to 14 (both papers are routinely distributed among Israeli legations abroad). In an article on 21 January, POST editor David Bar-Ilan reported that Foreign Ministry spokesman Yosi Gal had attributed the cancellations to budgetary considerations, but rejected this explanation as "bald lying in public by a government official." Bar-Ilan called the ministry's action retaliation against an "unfriendly paper." Casting further doubt on Gal's statement, Bar-Ilan said that the ministry had "flatly rejected" POST publisher Yehuda Levi's offer to send the paper free of charge to all ministry subscribers. Moreover, Bar-Ilan noted that the ministry had almost simultaneously doubled its subscriptions to Israel's weekly Spanish-language newspaper AURORA, which he depicted as "super-dovish" and "enthusiastically supportive of government policies." To reinforce his claim that the Foreign Minstry's curtailment of subscriptions was a political act--rather than a cost-cutting exercise--Bar-Ilan said that an undated article by Sarah Helm in the British daily THE INDEPENDENT had reported that Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is concerned about the POST's effect on international opinion, since, "as the only English-language daily, it is an international opinion-former" and has "declared war" on the POST because the paper "is undermining the government's peace efforts." According to Bar-Ilan, Helm reported that the Foreign Ministry believes that a 10 December POST article about an alleged Israeli Government plan to return to the Palestinians all the territories seized in 1967 had been "planted" to "stir up" opposition to the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles among Jews abroad.
