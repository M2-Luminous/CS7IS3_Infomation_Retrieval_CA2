And this aspiration to come closer together manifests itself not only in economics. It may be said without exaggeration that there is a mutual attraction in categories such as spirituality and morality." These words spoken by Uzbek President Islam Karimov can be considered to be the leitmotif of the speech given by Bakhtiyar Hamidov, a deputy prime minister of the government of Uzbekistan, at the republic's embassy in Moscow. The economic reform that was started in the republic in March of this year promoted further reinforcement of Uzbek-Russian ties. Besides relations at the state level, direct mutual relations between goods manufacturers are acquiring increasingly greater significance in the economic sphere, noted the Uzbek deputy prime minister. Moreover Uzbekistan and Russia have moved away from the principle of barter, and all commodity turnover is now proceeding according to world prices. The important guest advised that famous Uzbek vegetables and fruits no longer receive any attention at all from Russian trade organizations and firms, which prefer to buy such products, often of lower quality, from countries of the far abroad. By the way, the blame for this lies to an equal degree with both Uzbek producers and marketing specialists, who haven't yet recovered from destruction of the traditional interrepublican ties as a result of the Union's disintegration. However, the process of their recovery is gradually increasing in tempo. Developing in a situation of stability and security, Uzbekistan has avoided the numerous problems that arose in most states in the post-Soviet period. It is especially gratifying that manifestations of interethnic enmity are practically absent in the republic; this is one of the few parts of the former USSR where Russians continue to live and work in peace. The line toward strengthening interethnic peace and harmony is being pursued to the fullest extent possible by the Uzbek leadership. In this connection something needs to be said about the great and active work being done in Moscow by the embassy of the Republic of Uzbekistan to strengthen the knots of friendship between our peoples. The republic's ambassador Yusif Abdullayev, an energetic, broadly educated and sympathetic person, is playing far from the last role in this noble effort.
