"Wei Jingsheng is now under surveillance," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a weekly press briefing. "He remains under surveillance, but to allege that a law suit has been filed against him is totally groundless," said Wu. Although the English translation of Wu's remarks suggested that no suit would be brought in the future, the spokesman subsequently made clear he was talking only about "now" and declined to elaborate. The public security ministry issued a denial Wednesday of a western press report that it had announced a formal decision to try Wei and had handed the case over to the courts. The foreign ministry also denied Wednesday separate reports that China was preparing to file treason charges against the 44-year-old dissident, who was released from prison in September just six months short of a 15-year sentence for "counter-revolutionary" crimes.
