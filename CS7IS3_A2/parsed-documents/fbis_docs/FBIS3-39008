Commenting on the mortar attack on Sarajevo market, Schmidbauer said: "Anybody who saw the latest events must realize that we have to operate using air strikes as well; the West's own position must back this, not verbal gymnastics; we will have to increase pressure on all those concerned enormously." In addition, humanitarian aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina should be stepped up: "The human suffering must come to an end." Allegedly, Schmidbauer said on television that he agrees with Chancellor Kohl in this matter. But the Chancellor's Office told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that Kohl had never made a statement to this effect. Schmidbauer expressed his personal opinion. Schmidbauer has clarified this in the meantime. His office says Kohl referred to NATO decisions and he does not exclude action: "Germany will not restrain anybody within NATO taking action at the United Nations' wish, but we will give them moral support." Yet, Bonn could not take on a role of its own, "because Germany cannot participate militarily." Foreign policy experts in the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group seem to share Schmidbauer's view, which goes beyond the government's cautious comments. The Bundestag group foreign policy spokesman, Lamers, said: "After the criminal attack on Sarajevo, Germany must take a decision on how long it wants to maintain its ambivalent attitude, expressing dismay, but not contributing anything to eradicating the root of the evil." The international community can only choose between action and withdrawal. "While the international community and its institutions, which are also ours, lose their credibility, exposing themselves to contempt and ridicule, and while the killing goes on, the Germans cautiously recommend moderation." Lamers went on to say that any German participation must take account of the historic burdens. "In concrete terms" Germany's action must take a different form, but "legally" it must correspond to its partners missions. "Our credibility and capability to act are at stake." Lamers called upon the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] "to come to an agreement allowing Germany to participate in the necessary actions in former Yugoslavia in a way that takes account of the historic burdens." This is the only way Germany can influence the partners' decisions and win the right to call upon others to act. Lamers said the hope that the Federal Constitutional Court would take the decision off politicians is a "sign of shrinking from responsibility and of inability to make a decision." He said an initiative is required "now." The foreign policy spokesman of the SPD Bundestag group, Voigt, on the other hand, called on the government to be careful with recommending the allies take military action in Bosnia. Due to memories of World War II, the Germans could not take part in such actions anyway. Air strikes would cause a great number of civilian losses. In the event of such attacks, there might be demands to liberate Tuzla, which is besieged by the Serbs; the town of Vitez, besieged by Muslims; and the old town of Mostar, surrounded by the Croats. Voigt recommended a precautionary stationing of UN units in Macedonia. Once the constitutional questions are clarified, Bundeswehr troops could take part in blue helmet missions in Macedonia. SPD defense expert Opel warned of a NATO military strike in Bosnia. This would only satisfy "military agitation," he said. NATO must not become a "warring party." Former General Schmueckle and former Admiral Schmaehling doubt the military effects of air strikes. The "Society for Endangered Nations," however, advocated air strikes as the only way to end mass expulsions and homicide.
