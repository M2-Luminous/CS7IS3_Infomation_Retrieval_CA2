The meeting lasted several hours, and attempted to find ways and means of alleviating some difficulties obstructing the establishment of transitional, broadbased institutions. The two parties agreed to pursue consultations in order to bring the crisis out of deadlock, particularly with the Liberal Party [PL] and Republican Democratic Movement [MDR], and they reiterated their support for the Arusha Peace Accord. According to Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka some parties were demanding the revision of the Arusha agreements. The groups did not fix a date for the establishment of the remaining transitional institutions, but the head of state promised to pursue a dialogue with the concerned parties so that a date for their establishment can be fixed. It is worth noting that the RPF maintains as valid the list of the PL deputies elected before the 37 days (?in accordance) with the Arusha Accord signature. [sentence as heard] The prime minister of the current transitional government, Madame Agathe Uwilingiyimana, also participated in the meeting, together with the special representatives of the secretaries general of the United Nations and OAU, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh Booh and (Joe Felly) respectively, while the Tanzanian ambassador to Rwanda represented the facilitator. The RPF delegation also included Jacques Bihozagara, Pasteur Bizimungu, Seth Sendashonga and Tite Rutaremara.
