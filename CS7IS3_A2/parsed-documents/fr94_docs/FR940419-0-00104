FR940419-0-00104 FR940419-0-00020 In addition to the change (which appeared in the proposed rule) to §92.218(a) to substitute ``housing that qualifies as affordable housing under the HOME program'' for ``affordable housing assisted with HOME funds,'' §92.218(c) is revised to give the new citations to the references to eligible costs. A new paragraph (e) is also added to §92.218 to clarify that contributions that have been or will be counted towards satisfying a matching requirement of another Federal grant or award may not count toward satisfying the matching contribution requirement for the HOME program. This clarification is based on the language in the Department's common rule on uniform requirements for grants to State and local governments at 24 CFR 85.24(b)(3). Eight comments opposed the policy outlined in the proposed rule that a PJ's contribution to a state or local tenant-based rental assistance program is not eligible as match. One comment pointed out some State constitutions prohibit the use of State funds for the development of private property. These States often have extensive TBRA programs to provide affordable housing. If TBRA is not allowable for match purposes, then these States would be limited in their ability to meet their match requirements. The Department has been convinced by such arguments to permit local contributions to TBRA (but not related administrative costs) to be used for match. Section 92.219(b) is amended to permit match credit for TBRA which meets the provisions of §§92.210, 92.211 and 92.253(a) and (b). This parallels the approach taken for local contributions to affordable housing which is not HOME-assisted, but which must still conform to certain HOME requirements to be considered ``affordable.'' This interim rule also provides clarification, made in response to a number of comments that requested additional guidance, on what HOME requirements apply to projects in which state or local investment of funds are being counted as match. PJs must establish a procedure to monitor these HOME-eligible projects to ensure continued compliance with the requirements of 92.203 (income determinations), 92.210 (TBRA-security deposits), 92.211 (TBRA, except for 92.211(c), Term of rental assistance contract) 92.252 (rental) 92.253 (tenant protections) and 92.254 (ownership), but the units are not subject to the annual on-site inspections or recertification of income and rents as HOME projects are. HOME administrative funds may be used to monitor these projects for compliance with HOME requirements. No other HOME requirements apply, including the cross-cutting requirements of subpart H of part 92, to non-assisted projects counted as match. Investment in units other than affordable units does not count as match, and §92.219(c) is amended to reflect this.
