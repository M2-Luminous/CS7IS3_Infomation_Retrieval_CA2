He said that reports of resignations, dismissals and reshuffles in the top echelons were planted in order to obstruct the reforms and consolidation of society. IF Note: Filatov was appointed to his present position late in January 1993 following resignation of Yuriy Petrov. Before that, as first deputy of Supreme Soviet chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov he advocated constructive cooperation with Boris Yeltsin and won the reputation of the sole president's supporter in the Supreme Soviet leadership. The differences between him and Khasbulatov were brought to a head in the aftermath of the Seventh Congress of People's Deputies in December 1992. Filatov thought that the top authorities had to work for civil peace and economic reform. This kept him so busy that he could not think of rumors, even about himself. Reports of his pending resignation appeared Monday [16 May], simultaneously with dismissal of Sergey Shakhray from the position of the nationalities and regional policy minister. Oleg Lobov, now the National Security Council secretary, was named as a possible replacement for Filatov. Some observers thought that the rumors of Filatov's resignation had to do with the report of a meeting the president had with the prime minister at which the president called for improvement of the government performance and for having its decisions carried out. The State Duma decided at its Wednesday session to hear Filatov's explanations of the president's letter to the Duma in the wake of signing the Deputy Status Act into Law. At the May 13 session Ruslan Orekhov, head of the legal department in the presidential headquarters, could not answer numerous questions. In his letter the president mentioned that the act was inconsistent with the Constitution. This was true, in particular, of benefits which might not be liked by the electors. Orekhov could not explain what benefits the president had in mind and who enjoyed more benefits, the president's staff or the deputies or those who compiled the letter for the president.
