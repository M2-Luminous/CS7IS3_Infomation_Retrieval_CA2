They said security forces cordoned off the district after the attack that did not claim any victims. A senior ministry official said the minister had good reason to be concerned about safety, since influential sectors of the neo-communist regime objected to the parley with the opposition. Alimov was foremost among government members in following up a Russian suggestion for peace talks with the opposition, which has mounted raids from neighbouring Afghanistan since the neo-communist takeover in 1992. Victims of the raids have included Tajikistan's deputy prime minister Muzabsho Nazarshoyev who was killed here March 11 and Alimov's brother-in-law who was murdered in January.
