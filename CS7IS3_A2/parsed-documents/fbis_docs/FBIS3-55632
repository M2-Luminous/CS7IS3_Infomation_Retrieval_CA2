This time an intensified economic blockade, now being implemented even on the territory of a neutral country, is accompanying the military operations. The gas pipeline entering Armenia was again blown up on Georgian territory. It has not yet been repaired. All this proves that Azerbaijan, having chosen the use of force as the only way to solve the problem, is trying at all costs to drag Armenia into the conflict. Azerbaijan is attempting to internationalize the conflict by using armed men from other countries in its combat operations. It obstinately tries to implement a visionless plan: Every time its aggressive operations fail, it resorts to every propaganda gimmick to present itself to the international community and various international forums as the victim of Armenian aggression. All such statements are then followed by massive new offensives. The Armenian Government resolutely condemns Azerbaijan's policy of solving the problem by the use of force, a policy that is fraught with the danger of the eventual deepening of the conflict between the two peoples and will in the end lead to further human loss on the Azerbaijani side and diminish the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict. Armenia has always favored a peaceful solution to the problem and is ready to continue its efforts in this direction.
