The administration announced a tender for the sale of its 100 percent stake in the Petlas Tire Company, which the government plans to close unless it is privatized. Officials said KOI would invite offers for 12 establishments of the textiles producer Sumer Holding on Friday and 32 concerns of the milk and dairy products producer SEK and two hotels of the tourism firm Turban later this month. Officials said KOI planned to privatize 10 major companies partly or wholly this year to achieve the target. They are: PETKIM petrochemicals, TUPRAS oil refining firm, petrol retailer POAS, Sumerbank, Turban Hotel and Marina chain, Eregli Iron and Steel Firm, Turkish Airlines, oil [word indistinct] DITAS, Turkish Maritime Company and ground-service firm HAVAS. A parliamentary commission adopted a draft law that would enable the government to handle privatization by decree to shorten the complex sell-off procedures. The draft, to be enacted by the parliament, will also open the way for KOI's reorganization and accumulation of sell-off proceeds in a separate fund to set up an unemployment scheme for laid-off workers. The government unveiled an austerity package this month to rescue the country's economy. The program calls for new one-off taxes, rapid privatization, closure of some state firms, selling public property and tightening control on state expenditures.
