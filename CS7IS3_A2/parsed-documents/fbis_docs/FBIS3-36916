It says: The mass media are distorting the facts regarding implementation of the demands by the work forces at communications enterprises serving in the Russian information sphere--namely, by saying that communication workers are demanding trillions of rubles and that the Union's central committee has allegedly agreed to the government's decision. The central committee of the Communication Workers' Union has protested to [Oleg] Poptsov, chairman of the All-Russian Television and Radio Company, on this issue and has demanded live air time to explain the situation. Despite demands by work forces for talks with the government, the latter has not deemed it necessary to meet either the Union's central committee or the coordinating committee. Since they have no received no specific realistic decision from the government, the coordinating committee and the Union's central committee are insisting again on talks with the government.
