This morning, UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye, who is mediating the Angolan peace talks, held a meeting with government representatives and probably yet another one with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. However, nothing concrete is known about the issues discussed, since there is an absolute silence around the sides involved in the negotiating process. Thus, the face-to-face meeting between the government and UNITA negotiators to discuss the implementation of the modalities of national reconciliation has once again been postponed. Meanwhile, UNITA says that it intends by all means to govern Huambo Province. This position was reaffirmed in the Zambian capital during a meeting between the UNITA team and members of extraparliamentary opposition parties held yesterday. The latter said that UNITA would not mind continuing holding talks until the year 2,000. Meanwhile, the government and UNITA teams will return to Mulungushi this afternoon. Radio Nacional de Angola has learned from a reliable source that Chief Blondin Beye will leave for the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, tomorrow, to hold talks with President Robert Mugabe on the Angolan peace talk underway in the Zambian capital.
