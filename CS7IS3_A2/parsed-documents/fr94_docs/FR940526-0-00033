SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission has issued the following Order: Order Under Commission Rule 30.3(a) Permitting Option Contracts on the Long-Term Japanese Government Bond Futures Contract Traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited To Be Offered or Sold in the United States Thirty Days After Publication of This Notice in the Federal Register By Order issued on July 20, 1988 (Initial Order), the Commission authorized, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a), 1 certain option products traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited (SIMEX) to be offered or sold in the United States. 53 FR 28826 (July 29, 1988). Among other conditions, the Initial Order specified that: 1 Commission rule 30.3(a), 17 CFR 30.3(a) (1993), makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the offer or sale of a foreign option product until the Commission, by order, authorizes such foreign option to be offered or sold in the United States. Except as otherwise permitted under the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder, *␣*␣* no offer or sale of any SIMEX option product in the United States shall be made until thirty days after publication in the Federal Register of notice specifying the particular option(s) to be offered or sold pursuant to this Order. By letter dated April 28, 1994, SIMEX through its counsel represented that it would be introducing an option contract based on the Long-Term Japanese Government Bond futures contract. SIMEX has requested that the Commission supplement its Initial Order and subsequent Orders 2 authorizing options on the Eurodollar, Japanese Yen, Deutsche Mark, 3-Month Euroyen Interest Rate and Nikkei Stock Average futures contracts by also authorizing SIMEX's option contracts on the Long-Term Japanese Government Bond futures contract to be offered or sold to persons in the United States. Upon due consideration, and for the reasons previously discussed in the Initial Order, the Commission believes that the request for authorization to offer or sell option contracts on the Long-Term Japanese Government Bond futures contract 3 should be granted. 2 See 55 FR 26428 (June 28, 1990) and 57 FR 2675 (January 23, 1992). 3 See section 2(a)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act, section 3(a)12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (34 Act) and rule 3a12&hyph;8 promulgated thereunder. On July 11, 1986, the Securities and Exchange Commission designated the government debt securities of the Government of Japan as exempted securities for purposes of the 34 Act's application to the marketing in the United States of futures contracts of those securities. Accordingly, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a) and the Commission's Initial Order issued on July 20, 1988, and subject to the terms and conditions specified therein, the Commission hereby authorizes SIMEX's option contracts on the Long-Term Japanese Government Bond futures contract to be offered or sold to persons located in the United States thirty days after publication of this Order in the Federal Register .
