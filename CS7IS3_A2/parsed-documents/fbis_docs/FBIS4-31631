[Surjan] Christian ideology and democratic belief do not in themselves make anyone suitable to form or implement a Christian Democratic policy, or to fill the position of party leader. We must do away with the illusions. The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] has to turn into a people's party that has a message for all strata of society. It has to have a powerful economic development and socially committed program for this. [Bartha] If I am not wrong, you will reorganize the KDNP from top to bottom. [Surjan] This is inevitable. As a result of the reorganization, we will need an executive chairman -- or perhaps a general secretary -- who is consistent and implements everything strictly. He has to be given rights that make him into a strong person in the party. I do not consider myself suitable for this position. [Bartha] It is rumored that you would prefer to see parliamentary group leader Tibor Fuzessy beside yourself as this "force." [Surjan] I will not talk about personnel issues. [Bartha] Judging from views arising from party, the KDNP is seeing many conversions. [Surjan] I do not wish to comment on this, either. [Bartha] How are you taking the fact that everyone is now blaming the party chairman for everything, for whatever reason? [Surjan] In politics, thinking about changes of personnel is natural after failures. I believe that this is how it should be. For this reason, the KDNP's leadership and I have also announced that we would hand in our resignations at the extrordinary national convention. The delegates will then decide which leaders' work they will continue to require in the future. [Bartha] What do you expect? Will you stay? [Surjan] Similar to the relationship between the president of the republic and the prime minister, the position of a chairman can also exist alongside a strong executive chairman. At least, this is the way I see it. Very many people support me, but quite a few believe that I am responsible for everything. If the party decides that it needs my knowledge, in any position, then I will accept this. If it decides -- as was suggested to me by Sandor Keresztes -- that I should vest my energies in being a parliamentary deputy, then I will help the new party leadership this way. Providing that this new party leadership does not shift to the right. The fate of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] not only showed that letting down the coalition is cowardice, it also showed that, by shifting to the right of the KDNP's current policy, one falls into an abyss. The MIEP's right-wing policy has minimal support of society, and it is dangerous for the country's future. [Bartha] As far as we know, Miklos Gaspar, who is said to be one of the leading figures of the radical wing, will also run for the position of chairman. [Surjan] I have already said that I will not talk about people. [Bartha] Fuzessy indicated that it would be fortunate if the KDNP was able continue to provide the ambassador to the Vatican. The former prime minister once successfully "exported" the then party chairman, Sandor Keresztes, who had criticized the coalition and had become inconvenient, to this position. Is it possible that you are the next one? [Surjan] It would be good for Hungary and the new government if the new Vatican ambassador was a Christian democrat. Presumably the coalition of the Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats will not deny this request. However, I clearly say no to me filling this position. As a matter of fact, I know that Fuzessy was not thinking of me when he talked about this. [Bartha] There is also talk about setting up a ministry dealing with church affairs, under your leadership. [Surjan] Ministerial and state secretarial positions can only be filled from within the coalition. At least this is natural. Therefore, this is out of the question in this form. However, if it operates as a non-governmental organization that fulfills concrete tasks then I can easily imagine mainly legally trained Christian Democrats in it -- but not me. [Bartha] Another coalition is also often mentioned, namely that of the future opposition. In the KDNP, many people fear that "the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] still wishes to absorb the KDNP." [Surjan] Some MDF politicians still consider this as the main goal of their lives. My answer to them and to others: Yes for cooperation, no for fusion. The KDNP will be a constructive opposition party that has its own image and that has goals.
