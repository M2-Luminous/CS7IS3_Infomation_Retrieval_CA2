FBIS4-11097 "drlat078_b_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 Haiti Senators Pledge To Institute `Clean Sweep' Senators Pledge To Institute `Clean Sweep' FL2104193394 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 21 Apr 94 FL2104193394 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] [Excerpts] Senator [Bernard] Sansaricq has decided to implement -- with or without the support of the Chamber of Deputies -- the resolution voted on 10 April by the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] senators and the 18 January senators, demanding the implementation of Article 149 of the Constitution. The duty of a senator is to help his endangered homeland, says Sen. Sansaricq, who has set a deadline for the implementation of this resolution. [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] "With or without the Chamber of Deputies, either we implement it or there will be a clean sweep [table rase]." Something must be done. The nation is in danger. The state is threatened to its very foundations. So, I cannot play with such a situation. I can allow a certain amount of time, set a deadline, but I think that after this deadline, all political leaders in the country -- I received many calls yesterday and today -- I think all truly lucid leaders in the country will support the Senate in what it wants to do because something must be done, regardless. [passage omitted] I have given myself a deadline. This means that if this deadline passes with nothing having been done, the Senate will provoke a crisis one way or another, come what may. [Unidentified reporter] By the way, this resolution is quite constitutional, according to Bernard Sansaricq, who demands the support of the Armed Forces. Otherwise, threatens the president of the Senate's unofficial office, the Armed Forces have only to get ready to assume power because the military authorities will have no other choice, given the clean sweep policy. [Sansaricq] We adopted a constitutional resolution. There is the principle of requisitioning the Army. "It is up to the Army to move along a constitutional path, or the Senate will withdraw after a certain time. We will collectively resign. Then, the Army will have to assume its responsibilities toward the nation. [Reporter] "To hold new elections? [Sansaricq] "Whatever they want to do." [end recording]
