A public hearing on the proposed listing provides the opportunity for the public to give comments and to permit an exchange of information and opinion among interested parties. In response to a request by the Douglas Timber Operators, Inc. for a public hearing, NMFS announces that a hearing on the proposed listing of the Umpqua River cutthroat trout will be held from 7:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., Thursday, September 29, 1994, at the Timber/Indian Rooms of the Campus Center at the Umpqua Community College.
