In his own words, his main mission is to act simply as a successor, not a substitute. His is a very delicate duty: to administer a program inherited from someone else. This, however, did not prevent him from clarifying that although he will be faithful to the process, he plans to give it his personal style. He must, nonetheless, firmly become the one in charge of implementing an already defined program. With this objective, the new finance minister thought it necessary to point out the plan's perfection, which reflects the skills of the person who masterminded it. He praised his predecessor to show that he was thoroughly familiar with the program drafted by Fernando Henrique Cardoso. His praise of President Itamar Franco sought to calm those who feared he did not have the same Planalto support his predecessor had. He emphasized that he could count on the president's thorough support "without which," he added, "my work would lack effectiveness, and the appointment would have been pointless." In the long introduction to his speech, in which he sought to clearly define the aspects of his mission, the new minister tried to characterize his style, although he is aware that he will be staying for fewer than nine months at the head of the Finance Ministry. He painted this picture in a discreet and indirect manner, but made everyone realize that his decisions will always be inspired by his social concerns; that is, that it will always pursue one objective -- man, in all of his dimensions. He made no demagogic promises and pointed out that no economic policy can be successful without being preceded by a constitutional reform. He added that the absence of this reform has been foiling all attempts at adjustment to failure. He therefore plans to do his best to ensure that the reform process continues. He is even willing to negotiate and temporize to make sure that the process will be concluded, particularly because unless it is concluded the country will reach a serious impasse. He added, however, that the success of the FHC2 plan does not depend entirely on the support the Congress or the president of the Republic gives it. He thus calls for society's cooperation in making the program effective. "The judicial branch, state-owned companies, and the governments of states and counties, as well as the media, entrepreneurs, workers, and the public in general, will all have to contribute to this success," Ricupero said. Through this call Minister Ricupero carefully established levels of responsibility. It must be noted that the judicial branch appears at the top of the list. Rubens Ricupero is giving priority to the moralization of public expenditures. He pointed out that if the order given by Tancredo Neves at the beginning of the New Republic era -- "it is forbidden to spend" -- had been complied with, the country would have been in a very different condition. Talking on behalf of an administration that holds him responsible for fulfilling this task, he said: "We will persevere in the relentless pursuit of an operational balance of the budget." We are giving emphasis to this sentence because the new minister seems to indicate that such a balance -- on which the FHC2 plan is based -- has not yet been ensured. As we have said in previous commentaries, Rubens Ricupero will certainly pay more attention than his predecessor to the public deficit issue, which still has not been resolved through the congressional approval of the Emergency Social Fund. Perhaps the minister has been daring in announcing that as soon as the stabilization is consolidated it will be possible to gradually reduce interest rates. Everything indeed indicates that for a long time the monetary area officials will have to maintain high interest rates to prevent the inflation rate from going up too much and making the FHC2 plan fail. Surely the president of the Republic, who so far has not been entirely conscious of this need, will demand that his new minister prevent the inflation rate from going up. While working on the monetary problems, Rubens Ricupero announced that in the immediate operational plan, he will define rules for issuance of the new currency and ways to back the new currency. These rules are certainly essential for creating confidence in the real. It would not be fair to conclude an analysis of the speech Minister Rubens Ricupero delivered at his installment ceremony without pointing out that his concern over social problems permeated all his remarks. In his opinion, the problem of an unfair distribution of wealth must be urgently solved. He however does not plan to correct this situation through a populist way of distributing wealth. On the contrary, he believes that the success of the anti-inflation effort depends on the capacity to reduce social unfairness. We can rest assured that as the economic program is implemented, the new minister's characteristics will be reaffirmed.
