FR940913-1-00020 FR940913-1-00006 Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other ECD Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 helicopters of the same type design, the proposed AD would require replacing the current latches with those having positive locks, relocating certain latches, and installing additional locks on the transmission and engine cowling access doors within the next 150 hours time-in-service. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 126 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 45 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $624 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $390,474. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new airworthiness directive to read as follows: Eurocopter Deutschland GMBH (ECD): Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;06&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model MBB&hyph;BK 117 helicopters, serial numbers 7001 through 7201, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the transmission and engine cowling access doors from opening in flight, being struck by the main rotor blade, and subsequently, separating from the helicopter and being ingested by the main rotor or tail rotor system resulting in a loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 150 hours time-in-service, remove the left hand and right hand transmission and engine cowlings without removing the transmission and engine cowling access doors that are installed on the transmission and engine cowlings, and modify the access door latches in accordance with the Work Procedure contained in the Accomplishment Instructions of MBB-Helicopters Alert Service Bulletin ASB&hyph;MBB&hyph;BK 117&hyph;20&hyph;104, Revision 1, dated December 8, 1989. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Standards Staff, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Standards Staff. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Rotorcraft Standards Staff. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulation (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on September 6, 1994. Eric Bries, Acting Manager, Rotorcraft Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
