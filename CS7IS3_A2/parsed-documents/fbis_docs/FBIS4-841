FBIS4-841 "drafr074_c_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Police Chief Reportedly Backed Arms Sale to KwaZulu Police Chief Reportedly Backed Arms Sale to KwaZulu MB1504155194 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network in English 1505 GMT 15 Apr 94 MB1504155194 Johannesburg Radio South Africa Network English BFN [From the "PM Newswrap" program] [Text] The results of an internal Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] investigation into an aborted arms deal to kwaZulu was revealed today, while the Goldstone Commission of inquiry into the same deal also got under way in Johannesburg. Ferial Haffejee reports: [Begin recording] [Haffejee] The commissioner of police, General Johan van der Merwe, approved the export permit necessary to sell 1,000 rifles from Eskom to kwaZulu. This was one of the findings of an Eskom internal investigation into the aborted sale. The findings were released at a press conference this afternoon. The electricity company's chief executive, Allan Morgan: [Morgan] This was confirmed later on by the South African Police [SAP], that they did receive the application and that they also issued a permit on that application on the Friday morning, the 25th. This application was dealt with at the highest echelons of the SAP. It was also approved at that level. The permit was signed by a Major Le Roux on behalf of the commissioner of police. [Haffejee] The arms drama started when Eskom Executive Dr. George Lindeque found two unlicensed trucks being loaded with guns on 25 March by employee Johan van der Walt. Van der Walt manages arms at Eskom. Lindeque investigated immediately, and the arms deal was canceled. The internal probe has found that Eskom procedures for weapons sales had not been followed by the staff involved. But the company also found that no Eskom employees knew the arms were bound for kwaZulu. Instead, Eskom is laying the blame at the door of the three arms dealers involved in the plan. The company claims that one of the dealers, J. Garb and Company, repeatedly denied that the guns were for the kwaZulu Police. [Morgan] On the 25th, when the negotiations started with Eskom in all seriousness, the Garb brothers were in fact in the office of Mr. Bonthuis. Mr. Bonthuis -- and this has been confirmed by other witnesses -- then asked them whether these weapons will not be destined for either the far-right or for kwaZulu Police. They did not comment on this, but indicated that the firearms will be exported out of the country. [Haffejee] Meanwhile, the Goldstone investigation into the aborted sale of guns got under way this morning. The commission heard that Philip Powell of the kwaZulu government first approached arms dealers Gintans Security for weapons. He claimed that the arms were for northern Natal farmers. Powell is in charge of training kwaZulu's self-protection units. Lawyers for the kwaZulu government told the commission that kwaZulu was finding it difficult to procure arms. It needed weapons for the 1,000 special constables who are currently being recruited. KwaZulu is expecting trouble in the run-up to the election, they said. [end recording]
