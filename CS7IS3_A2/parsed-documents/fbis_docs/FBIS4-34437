In an interview granted to the media this morning, Ruiz said "the dialogue between the government and the EZLN, involving the commissioner and a mediator, who was accepted as part of the dialogue, concluded this phase. Thus, as long as the situation remains unchanged, there will no mediation on my part. There is no established dialogue between civilian society and the government. "After the dialogue was held in San Cristobal, it was declared finished. A reaction followed, and that was communicated to the civilian sector, and the dialogue between the EZLN and the government, strictly speaking, ended. "Thus, the role of peace commissioner for dialogue with the EZLN ended with the presentation of direct proposals to the requests and demands that were made. Upon an appropriate report, as the one I believe we will be presenting in due time, that role ended." [LA JORNADA] Could there be another commissioner? [Ruiz] Yes, because there is now another kind of dialogue involved. It is no longer an EZLN-government dialogue but, rather, a civilian population-government dialogue, and we will have to wait and see how this dialogue is established. Bishop Ruiz said the hierarchy of the Catholic Church will not participate in the National Democratic Convention (CND), called by the EZLN and which might be held in the first half of July within EZLN territory. "We are part of history in the making. If there are concrete conditions and the entire civilian sector, which is primarily Catholic, agrees with it, we will accompany the country to a good goal: the search for a transition to a better fate in history. We cannot stay out of this. The Catholic hierarchy will not attend the convention unless there is a specific duty for it to fulfill." He said that from their very first messages, the bishops urged people to understand that the Chiapas conflict had a national scope. In this regard, the EZLN declaration of war was not against a segment of the population, such as the ranchers or large landowners, but against the Mexican Army because the problem in Chiapas has national scope. During this interview at Diocese Curia, Bishop Ruiz said that after analyzing the most recent EZLN communiques, it is clear a nonresponse to the peace agreements is not tantamount to a declaration of war. To the contrary, he explained, "saying no to the agreements is not tantamount to saying yes to war. It is a definite no to war; a no to war in favor of a civic and nonmilitary solution; a no to war because they unilaterally decided (it is now a bilateral decision) to extend the cease-fire; a no to war and a yes to the peace option through a dialogue. In this case, however, a broader dialogue is being called, a dialogue that includes the participation of the entire civilian sector." [passage omitted]
