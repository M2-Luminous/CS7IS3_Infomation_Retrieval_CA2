FR940223-1-00002 FR940223-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Parts 1124 and 1135 [Docket Nos. AO&hyph;368&hyph;A21, AO&hyph;380&hyph;A11; DA&hyph;92&hyph;07] Milk in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon Marketing Area; Decision on Proposed Amendments to Tentative Marketing Agreements and to Orders AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This decision adopts a proposal for pricing milk on the basis of nonfat solids and protein, in addition to butterfat, for the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Idaho-Eastern Oregon marketing orders, respectively. In addition, it reduces the supply plant shipping percentage for the Pacific Northwest order and modifies the producer-handler regulation to permit a State institution with outside distribution to purchase an average of 1,000 pounds of milk per day from pool plants. The decision denies a proposal to change location adjustments in Yakima County, Washington. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendments would promote orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. These proposed amendments have been reviewed under Executive Order 12278, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect, nor will it preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674) (the Act), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the entry of the ruling.
