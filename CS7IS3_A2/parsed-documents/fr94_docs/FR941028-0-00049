FR941028-0-00049 FR941028-0-00009 The two issues which generated the most significant comments were the proposed deletion of the presumption of NOV abatement and the proposed safe harbor for owners or controllers of surface coal mining operations with delinquent civil penalties for violations issued prior to October 3, 1988. The first of these issues to be addressed is the proposed deletion of the presumption of NOV abatement. Commenters representing a number of State regulatory authorities strongly objected to the deletion of the presumption. They asserted that the elimination of the presumption would lead to ``nationwide gridlock.'' They asserted that such a rule provision would lead to automatic appeals of all NOV's; that State regulatory authorities would have to expend significant resources tracking the course of NOV's and NOV appeals; that companies operating before multiple State regulatory authorities would never be able to definitively prove that NOV's were being abated such that they could be issued permits; and that such efforts would be a significant waste of State and Federal resources. They asserted that 80%&hyph;85% of all NOV's are resolved and never ripen into CO's in any event. Also, commenters representing industry interests strongly criticized the proposed deletion of the NOV presumption as both impractical and counterproductive. They asserted that the proposed deletion of the presumption would be especially burdensome on large multi-state corporations. They questioned whether such entities would be able to keep track of the abatement status of the NOV's of their many operating subsidiaries and contract miners. They further asserted that most NOV's are routinely and timely abated. They argued that eliminating the NOV presumption would lead to information overload in the permit application process; to increased costs and delays in permit processing; and to increased errors in data collection. They argued that the deletion of the presumption would require the reallocation of personnel from enforcement to document processing. In contrast to the positions of State regulatory authorities and the industry, one commenter representing environmental advocacy groups supported the deletion of the NOV presumption, asserting that the deletion of the presumption would lead to better tracking of the status of violations and to faster remediation of violations. Another commenter did concede, however, that it would be difficult for the OSM to keep AVS accurate and current with respect to violation information if the presumption of NOV abatement in the absence of an FTACO was eliminated. OSM considers the arguments raised by the State regulatory authorities and by the industry to be persuasive. OSM must give particular consideration to the concerns expressed by the State regulatory authorities on this issue. These agencies have the responsibility of implementing the ownership and control process. If the State regulatory authorities believe that the complete elimination of the presumption of NOV abatement will impose a significantly increased burden upon them for limited environmental return, this position cannot be discounted. OSM recognizes that there may be a potential benefit in having multiple jurisdictions tracking the course of NOV's for purposes of permit issuance. Such multiple supervision could theoretically encourage prompt abatement. Nevertheless, the mechanics of implementing such a process through AVS and other means would be sufficiently complex so as to create significant uncertainty among permit applicants and regulatory authorities. Such uncertainty outweighs the benefits of the complete elimination of the presumption of NOV abatement. In response to the environmentalists' arguments, OSM recognizes that there is a theoretical, potential benefit in multiple regulatory authorities tracking the course of an NOV for purposes of permit issuance. Under this scenario, a State would deny a permit to an applicant based upon his or her being linked through ownership or control to an NOV in another State even though the abatement period for the NOV had not expired. The threat of permit denial could enhance the prospect for prompt abatement of that NOV.
