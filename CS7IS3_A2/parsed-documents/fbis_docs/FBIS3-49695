The independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES carries a commentary on the NATO summit, which ended in Brussels today, writing that it "changed the security situation of the Czech Republic more than many citizens and politicians will admit." The Prague government has already accepted the conditions of military cooperation contained in the Partnership for Peace initiative, the paper writes. "Now Czech military and security experts must prove what they can do and how they can contribute to the community of interests of at least 38 countries of Europe and North America." Over the next five years, the paper writes, the Czech Republic must learn to live and cooperate with NATO and its other partners. The paper also points out the obligations the Czech Republic will take on in joining the Partnership for Peace. "Not only joint maneuvers, exercises, and financing of the future participation of the partners in international joint units for special missions will be planned, but before long also their engagement. And this already concerns the lives of our soldiers in fulfilling peace missions in crisis areas of Eastern Europe under the auspices of the U.N. or the European Union," the paper writes. CESKY DENIK also comments on the Partnership for Peace, which should bring the countries of the Visegrad Group closer to NATO. "The American Partnership for Peace plan came at the very moment it became clear that the European allies of the United States were not capable of taking any coordinated steps in Eastern Europe," the paper writes. The Partnership for Peace is the most that the Central European countries can obtain from today's political situation, and is a fundamental breakthrough in the surviving hegemony of Russian generals over the Central European regions, writes CESKY DENIK. The independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY turns its attention to the same topic, writing: "NATO is extending a helping hand -- but only in such a way that the outreached hand will not be grasped too tightly. As with the Balkans, it does not want to allow the possibility that it could be drawn into such a conflict." The paper notes that even the Czech Republic is acting with circumspection and that "it may be expected that the two careful betrothed ones will wait quite a while for the fruits of their love."
