FBIS4-36822 "drnes114_n_94004" FBIS-NES-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 LEBANON SLA, Israeli Officers on Hizballah, Peace SLA, Israeli Officers on Hizballah, Peace NC1406085194 Kafr Killa Voice of the South in Arabic 0700 GMT 14 Jun 94 NC1406085194 Kafr Killa Voice of the South Arabic BFN [Text] The secondary school built by the Civilian Affairs Administration in the border zone was inaugurated in Rumaysh yesterday. The ceremony was attended by General Gabi Ashkenazi, Israeli commander of the liaison unit; Colonel Shlomo Hasun, Israeli head of the Civilian Affairs Administration; and Lieutenant Colonel 'Aql Hashimi, commander of the western brigade, who represented South Lebanese Army Commander [SLA] Staff Major General Antoine Lahd. In a speech he delivered on the occasion, Lt. Col. Hashim said that the difficult road that we have taken is nearing its end, and we have great hope that we will reach a safe haven. The features of the road are becoming clear after the successive signing of agreements with the Palestinians and the Jordanians, and with the Syrians in the future. Hashim extended thanks on behalf of Rumaysh residents to Israel and the Israeli army for their assistance to the border strip residents. Liaison Unit Commander Gen. Ashkenazi affirmed that Israel is extending its hand for peace. He said: We will cooperate with whoever wants peace and will retaliate against whoever wants war and terrorism. Our arm is long, and we will choose the suitable time and place to strike. Ashkenazi said he is confident that the day will come when peace will be established between Lebanon and Israel and the borders between the two countries will come down. Meanwhile, he said, we will continue to fulfill the tasks we have. We believe that if there is no peace between nations, there will be no peace between states, and if there is no mutual respect between nations, there will be no good relations between states. Answering correspondents' questions, Ashkenazi said that Hizballah is trying to carry out terrorist operations against the border area. It has intentions to do so. We are ready for such confrontation. We have taken all the possibilities into consideration and made all the necessary preparations. We hope that Hizballah will understand that terrorism is not the right way, and if it does not understand, we will teach it the necessary lesson. We do not hide in villages and among civilians as Hizballah does. If Hizballah is seeking a confrontation, let it come to the battlefield. Ashkenazi stated that he has instructed the troops not to respond to the sources of fire if they come from inside villages and fields under cultivation so that the retaliation will not burn the crops that the farmers worked hard to cultivate. Answering a question by our correspondent regarding the relative calm that has recently prevailed in the area, and whether it is the result of Hizballah's fear of Israel's retaliation or the talks that U.S. officials held in Lebanon and Syria, Ashkenazi said it is due to all these reasons. Hizballah is afraid of Israeli retaliation. It has recently received a very painful blow, and needs a long time to recover.
