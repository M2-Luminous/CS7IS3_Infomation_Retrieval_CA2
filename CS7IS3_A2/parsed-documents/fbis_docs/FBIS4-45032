This is the good news that Seyyed Mohammad Gharazi, the Islamic Republic's minister of post, telegraph and telephone, gave in a speech on the occasion of World Communications Day for the information of those present and journalists (telephone rates for calling outside the country also increased recently). Gharazi said: Based on a bill, which has been presented to the Majles, telephone fees, depending on how large or small the city, will increase between 2 rials [R] and R4 per pulse. He also promised that by the end of this year [20 March 1995] the delivery of telephones to applicants will take a day or a month at the most. In justifying the huge increase in postal rates, the Islamic Republic's minister of post, telegraph and telephone said: In this area expert work has been under way for five years in the Plan and Budget Organization and two years in the General Assembly, the Board of Directors and the Council of Ministers, and finally this increase in price was approved by the Majles along with the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Law. It is necessary to explain that the Majles authorized increasing postal costs a maximum of 50 percent, but the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone increased the postal rates several times over. Gharazi added: A 50-percent discount has been provided for postal services to the press and publications. He said: Production, supplies, and communications equipment inside the country have reached a very suitable state, so that 70 percent of the nation's domestic communications needs are being met.
