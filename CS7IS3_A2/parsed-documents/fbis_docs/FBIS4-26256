Beijing has been dry for more than ten months. Water reserves in the Guanting and Miyun reservoirs, the two main water suppliers for Beijing, are decreasing, and the underground water table is continuously dropping. It is estimated that if the high temperatures continue, during this summer the city will be short of 150,000 cu m to 230,000 cu m of water daily. The municipal government has taken measures to control industrial water use to ensure the needs of its residents. Establishments which use more than the allowed amount of water will be charged double the normal fee. Beijing is promoting a household-water-saving drive among its city residents. Every household should be equipped with a water meter. And residents are advised to use water more than once before it is drained off, for instance, using the water in which clothes have been washed to clean the floor. Meanwhile, the high temperatures and lack of rain are threatening the summer crop planting in the suburbs.
