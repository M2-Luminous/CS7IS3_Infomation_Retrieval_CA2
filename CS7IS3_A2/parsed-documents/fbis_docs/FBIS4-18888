FBIS4-18888 "drweu070__a94041" FBIS-WEU-94-070-A Daily Report 12 April 1994 ANNEX Germany Kohl: Solidarity Surcharge Not Limited in Time Kohl: Solidarity Surcharge Not Limited in Time AU0804182794 Hamburg DPA in German 1249 GMT 8 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0804182794 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government will introduce the 7.5-percent solidarity surcharge as of 1 January 1995 without limiting it to a specific period. This was affirmed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an interview with ARD television on Friday evening [8 April]. He does "not" see "any chance" for limitation. He stressed that, apart from the solidarity surcharge, there will not be any further increases in general taxes next year. At the same time, however, Kohl implied additional burdens in the sphere of traffic policy. The ecologically sensible traffic development, which has been introduced with the railroad reform, will cost more money. The chancellor accused the Social Democrats of not having any practicable ideas in economic and tax policy. "It is the old socialist ideas that are now being dragged out again." A red-green [Social Democrats-Greens] coalition would destroy the incipient economic upswing through more bureaucracy, punishment of achievement, and social envy, Kohl said. He expressed the conviction that the Free Democratic Party of Germany will clearly exceed the 5 percent threshold at the elections in October and will continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. "I am quite sure that we will win the Bundestag elections." All indicators, in particular in the economy, are pointing to that. Kohl warned the CDU/CSU against leaving the political center. "I am not at all against winning as many votes as possible from right of center and as many votes as possible from left of center. However, the status of our party and the basic movement of history, of tradition, and also of the program is in the center, and we have no intention of letting anyone else to occupy this place."
