Prices in the stock market have fallen since the beginning of this week, while stock prices in the foreign stock markets have not gone down. Experts in the stock business point out that apart from the outflow and withdrawal of foreign capital invested in Thailand for profit-taking, another reason for the drop of the stock index could be the present political situation, which does not look so good. Such a situation makes investors reluctant to remain in the market. This kind of attitude seems very possible, because since the beginning of the new year there have been observable conflicts among the parties in the coalition government. A clear case is that the Phalang Tham Party has tried to bring up the issue of developing decentralization of administration through the election of provincial governors -- an issue that the Democrat Party, a core in the government, does not agree on. Strong verbal, irreconcilable conflicts have ensued between members of the two parties, although compromises were possible. Another case is the conflict between the Democrat and Solidarity Parties. The leader of Solidarity tried to dismiss a permanent secretary on a charge that he failed to meet popular demands. In fact, that is actually the job of the head of that ministry. These two cases make the people feel that there is a high possibility that these two parties may no longer be able to get along with each other in this government. At the same time, there have also been extensive rumors that the Democrat Party has approached at least two opposition parties that have enough seats to ensure the government to continue its national administration and made offers for them to join the government. Regarding this news--which reflects government instability, it is strange that the Democrat Party, and particularly its leader Chuan Likphai, have neither shown any reaction nor any tendency to correct or improve the image of the government. It looks as if Chuan is content to let problems prevail until the government collapses because of withdrawal of parties in the coalition. This contradicts his actions in the early days of the government, when the prime minister had to reach compromises among the coalition parties whenever problems arose or misunderstandings occurred. We do not want to see rumors turn into reality by letting parties in the government withdraw and inviting an opposition party to join the coalition in an undignified manner. We want to see leaders of all the parties in the present government hold a meeting to discuss guidelines for solving problems or to clearly make adjustments. All this is to ensure public confidence that the government remains stable. The prime minister should no longer remain indifferent and let the situation resolve itself. This method of playing politics will only cause the country as a whole to suffer more losses. We want to see him move urgently on this matter. Do not just threaten that if a government party pulls out, no opposition party will be invited to join, but parliament would be dissolved instead. Such a statement is just a threat, not proper for a core party in the coalition government. While the democracy-loving people hope to see this government last its full four-year term, we wonder what has happened to the prime minister and why he has remained so indifferent.
