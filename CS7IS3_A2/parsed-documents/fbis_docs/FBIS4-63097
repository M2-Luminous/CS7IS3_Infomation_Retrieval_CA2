FBIS4-63097 "drsov098_c_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 Federal Assembly Duma Defense Committee Head on Budget Increase Duma Defense Committee Head on Budget Increase LD1905191394 Moscow NTV in Russian 1500 GMT 19 May 94 LD1905191394 Moscow NTV Russian BFN [Text] [Correspondent Aleksandr Gerasimov] An increase in military expenditure, according to Sergey Yushenkov, the chairman of the Duma's Defense Committee, has practically been agreed with the president and the government and the Security Council. The additional 18 trillion [currency not specified], if they are approved by parliament, will be used for social provisions for servicemen and purchasing weaponry. At the same time, it is thought that the deficit in the state budget will not change by a ruble. The first 5 trillion rubles, the Defense Committee believes, can be obtained, for example, by removing privileges for foreign economic activities. The Defense Ministry has painstakingly substantiated its demands. Sergey Yushenkov described them with an artistic figure of speech. [Begin Yushenkov recording] The situation is forming in such a way that the cuts in defense expenditure are going beyond a certain physiological frontier beyond which begins collapse. [end recording] [Gerasimov] At the same time, it can be claimed that the original demands from the military for 87 trillion rubles were deliberately high. According to one version, the Defense Ministry was acting in accordance with the old Russian tradition--the more you ask for, the more you will be given. A second--put forward by Andrey Kokoshin, the first deputy defense minister--says that their experts were counting on higher inflation. [Begin Kokoshin recording] Of course we would have preferred there to have been higher estimates of military expenditure, but taking into account the changes that are rapidly taking place in our economy, of course this level is closer to what is genuinely needed today to ensure the country's security. [end recording] [Gerasimov] One way or the other, the military it seems are close to repeating the achievements of the agro-industrial complex-- they are receiving what they have demanded. What effect this will have on the economy or on the military itself will become clear after the budget is finally adopted by the State Duma. But now it is already obvious how badly thought through was a budget inside of which 18 trillions can be moved from one area to another.
