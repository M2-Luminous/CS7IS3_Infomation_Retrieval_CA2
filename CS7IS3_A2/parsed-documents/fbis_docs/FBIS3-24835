The DP's chairman, Mr. Ken Andrew, said in a statement that regional-based parties were entitled to oppose a single ballot paper because this could seriously harm their election prospects. Mr. Andrew said that the ANC and the NP should realize that South Africa's future was more important than attempts to win a few extra votes.
