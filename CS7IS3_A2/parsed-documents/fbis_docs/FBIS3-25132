In a "note" he issued this morning to Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa and his colleagues in the cabinet, Mr. Kiro denounced the "total isolation he has been subjected to since 3 February by being deprived of telephone calls and visits from his family." Furthermore, Mr. Kiro, who was placed under house arrest at the "Cite de l'OUA" government estates in Kinshasa on 14 January, is protesting against the "arbitrary nature of the emergency proceedings instituted by the public prosecutor's office" against him. On 8 January, Marshal Mobutu Sese Sekou issued a decree requesting the opening of a judicial enquiry at the attorney general's office against Professor Kiro "for the illegal sale and renting of public buildings in Kinshasa and the interior." Mr. Kiro was a very active radical opposition member in the past and a former minister under Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi. He joined Mr. Birindwa's government at its formation at the end of the political conclave convened by Marshall Mobutu in 1993. Mr. Kiro was a member of the Political Forces of the Conclave delegation -- the presidential group -- in the negotiations with the radical opposition held between September and December. He was appointed member of the new parliament, the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament, which was formed following the negotiations.
