Military sources in the Srpska republic say that this is a realistic number based on testimonies given by captured Albanians. A large number of Albanians were engaged by Muslim units via the Raska region after calls issued by the Party of Democratic Action in Novi Pazar and by its leader Sulejman Ugljanin. According to Srpska military circles this operation had two goals: to help their brothers in faith and to gain experience for possible war in Kosovo. [passage omitted]
