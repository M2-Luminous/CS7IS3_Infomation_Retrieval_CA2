The ambassador also said that "the Yugoslav Federal Republic firmly condemns the NATO bombings under UN patronage, because such actions affect the efforts directed towards stopping the civil war and reaching a lasting and peaceful, political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. UN officials invoke resolution 836 of the Security Council, while they themselves fail to entirely abide by its provisions." "The spring offensive of the Muslims was announced long in advance, and it started under the very eyes of United Nations and UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Forces) military observers who did nothing to disarm the Muslim troops in Gorazde and other protected areas. It was also with the cognizance of the foreign observers that 6,000 Muslim military were armed as soon as the Serbian side proceeded to self-defensive counter-attacks. When the situation on the battlefield turned to its (Serbs) advantage, the United Nations resorted to air strikes against the Serbs' positions, and this caused the death of civilians and the destruction of economic units," the ambassador said. "The Yugoslav Federal Republic definitely pronounces against a policy of pressure, ultimatum and armed attacks over the Serbian areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and shares the conviction that all this is far from capable to lead to a peaceful settlement. Therefore, the Yugoslav Federal Republic pronounces for a cease of all activities against the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the renunciation of a double-standard policy."
