The dispute has been going on for nearly three years now. Yesterday evening, the head of state received the two delegations separately. Each audience lasted about one hour. Today, the Burkinabe envoys are pursuing their discussions with the two delegations in order to establish a working program likely to bring everyone around the same table. Radio Burkina contacted the leaders of the two delegations who showed optimism about the effective takeoff of these trilateral consultations. Kriska, of the Coordination of Armed Resistance, which includes all the Tuareg movements, says this slowdown is caused by technical problems. A few modifications need to be made, however that these are not necessarily preconditions. As for the head of the government delegation, Abdourahamane Hama, who is Niger's foreign affairs and cooperation minister, the consultations remain informal because this enables them to proceed prudently. Both claim that a joint meeting is probable either this evening or tomorrow morning.
