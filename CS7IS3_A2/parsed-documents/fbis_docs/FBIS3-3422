Party committees and governments at all levels should take their local reality into consideration; study the situation well; unify their thinking, steps, and action; and thoroughly carry out this guiding principle in a positive manner. The current economic situation is good -- all localities have placed great importance on agricultural production, they started early and have paid great attention to it, and all measures taken have been quite effective. Industrial production has continued to grow rapidly and efficiency has improved to some degree; the state's key construction projects have been carried out smoothly; the consumer products market has been brisk and active; and people's lives have continued to improve. However, some difficulties and relatively conspicuous contradictions still exist in economic work -- agriculture's relative efficiency has dropped; the peasants' income remains to be increased; the scale of fixed asset investment is still larger than desired; the efficiency of some large and medium state-owned enterprises is poor; and the industrial structure is not completely rational. It should be said that, following high economic growth in the last two years, constraints caused by the "bottleneck" and pressure of inflation have increased, and the entire economic climate is uneasy. This year is a very crucial one for development and reform. We are advancing reform of the economic system amid rapid economic development, and need to maintain a high economic growth while accelerating the process of transforming the system. In particular, it is not easy to properly organize and implement the various major reform measures that have been initiated for the purpose of building a socialist market economic system, because these measures involve many sectors and industries. To do this, we must shore up our conviction that we can defeat all difficulties; keep cool heads; judge the hour and size up the situation; grasp the overall situation of reform, development, and stability; and properly handle the dialectical relationships between sustainment, rapidity, and healthiness while developing the economy. China has achieved good results in sustaining its economic development and this has drawn worldwide attention. Practice proves the fundamental reason why we have been able to sustain our economic development is that we have used reform and opening up as a powerful driving force for development, that we have followed the socialist market economic law in doing practical work, and we have prevented drastic ups and downs. This year China's reform centers on establishing a new system and a series of major reform measures have been launched. Properly organizing and implementing these measures will inject a powerful driving force to the further, sustained development of the economy. Of course, reform and development are a very complicated systems project -- it takes courage and prudence as well. This demands we properly handle the relationships between various contradictions; and we take positive, cautious, and appropriate action in designing strategy, in making use of opportunities, in grasping the rhythm, and in devising specific steps and measures. Only by doing so can we avoid sharp twists and turns, and drastic ups and downs. Currently, leading cadres at all levels should properly use the materialist dialectical viewpoint to analyze the situation, handle problems, prevent ideological one-sidedness and one-sidedness in understanding things, and prevent mistakes, especially big mistakes, in making decisions. The economy should develop more rapidly -- this is a wish of people across the country as well as a pressing demand posed by the international and domestic situations. What we mean by rapidity is rapidity with efficiency. We do not mean to maintain the high growth simply by increasing investment, expanding the investment scale, launching new projects, and expanding [wai yan, 1120 1693] development. Experience proves that speed without efficiency and that does not conform to economic law is not real speed. This kind of speed not only cannot yield the results of rapid development, on the contrary, it will increase our burden and eventually impede rapid economic development. The macroeconomic regulation and control measures timely adopted by the central authorities last year have effectively solved the prominent contradictions and problems cropping up in the course of development; have forcefully rectified the financial order; checked the real estate fever, development-zone fever, and excessive growth in investment; and stabilized the economy and supported the state's key construction projects, thereby alleviating problems in some areas and making new improvements to the economic development climate. But, the trend of launching new projects regardless of whether conditions permit or not is still quite strong in some localities. For this reason, we should continue to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control to prevent the recurrence of inflation. In preparing this year's development plans, all localities should proceed from reality, take the overall situation into consideration, be scientific, keep cool headed, be realistic, set development objectives according to actual needs and feasibility, and must not blindly compare themselves with each other. They should shift their minds from pursuing speed to paying attention to real development; and place the center of their economic work on deepening reform, transforming mechanisms, improving the industrial structure, strengthening management, promoting technological progress, and increasing productivity. This has extremely great significance for our future economic development. Whether the economy can develop rapidly and in a sustained manner primarily depends on whether it can develop in a healthy manner. Healthy economic development requires a comparatively coordinated and rational industrial structure, and a set of economic functioning mechanisms that can maintain highly-efficient economic operations. This year we still need to pay attention to improving the industrial structure. We should further consolidate and strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, increase agricultural investment, ensure a good agricultural harvest this year, and increase the peasant's income. We should continue to seriously implement the "Regulations Governing the Transformation of Operating Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," properly manage large and medium state-owned enterprises, take various measures to increase enterprises' vitality, and properly organize the experimental work on building a modern enterprise system. We should guide enterprises to forcefully open up international and domestic markets, timely adjust product mix according to market demand, and provide active support to the production of readily marketable products. We should continue to step up the construction of infrastructural facilities, ensure the state's key construction projects, and gradually alleviate constraint caused by the "bottlenecks." Construction of infrastructural facilities also needs to be carried out according to the importance and urgency of a project, and to the resources available; we should make the best use of our limited financial and material resources. We should strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, and strive to maintain a basic balance between total supply and total demand. Improving the industrial structure is fundamental work that involves many sectors and industries, so we must take the overall situation into consideration. We should consider the nation's overall situation in deciding the priority and importance of a project. At the same time, by deepening reform, we should further straighten out the relationships between various sectors and truly solve problems concerning the economic system and economic functioning mechanisms. Of course, by healthy development we do not mean there should be no faults at all; what we demand is that we should prevent major problems from occurring, and should discover problems and take effective measures to solve them as soon as they begin to surface. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, broadening the scope of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability -- this is the general work of the whole party and country this year. Work in all areas should be subordinated to and serve this goal. Judging from the situation early this year, the situation on the economic front is good. We should continue to maintain the work style of being modest and cautious, and of guarding against arrogance and rashness; we should keep our cool heads and work in a down-to-earth manner; we should meticulously organize our work and work diligently to ensure the economy develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner; we should endeavor to do this year's economic work better than we did last year's.
