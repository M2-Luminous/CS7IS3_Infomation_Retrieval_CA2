Yesterday, Mr. Malik had a narrow escape when the Hezbul Mojahedin tried to kidnap him from a hospital, but his supporters foiled the attempt. [Hong Kong AFP in English 1618 GMT 3 Jun 94, in a Srinagar-datelined report, adds the following: "A pro-Pakistani Moslem rebel group Friday denied trying to kill a rival separatist leader after dragging him out of hospital and later firing on a march organised by him in this Kashmir summer capital. "The Hizbul Mujahideen group said the Thursday attempt on the life of Yasin Malik, the leader of the powerful Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), and the attack on a rally a day later, were staged by disgruntled JKLF members. "`Lobbyism in the JKLF was responsible for the attacks,' a trenchant Hizbul Mujahideen statement said. `JKLF workers tried to kill Yasin Malik on Thursday and Friday.' "Hizb spokesman Mohammed Sadiq said Malik's charges were baseless and an attempt to gain public sympathy and coverage in the media. "`It is a ploy,' he said, referring to Malik's allegations that Hizbul Mujahideen activists had again targeted him Friday during an attack on a procession which killed at least two militants and injured four. "`If it is proved that Hizbul men were involved, we will try them,' Sadiq added. "Malik, who advocates an independent Kashmir unlike most other groups who want the state to accede to Pakistan, announced a three-day strike from Saturday to protest the attack by `black sheep and criminals.' "He also announced a fast until the 70-odd warring militant outfits reorganised themselves under three heads: those favouring independence for Kashmir, those wanting to join Pakistan, and a third `general category.'"]
