FR941012-0-00106 FR941012-0-00011 OSHA received many comments on this provision opposing the prohibition of chain-saw noise as a signaling device, that have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. Other commenters supported the provision, focusing their comments on allowing communication devices such as telephones and radios in the final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;54, 5&hyph;70, 7&hyph;74; Tr. W2 197). One of these commenters supported the provision because the use of electronic communication, such as citizen band radios, makes controlling trainees easier (Tr. W2 197). Another commenter supported the use of whistles for signalling because they produce a very unusual sound in the woods that can be heard for a great distance (Ex. 5&hyph;7). In general, there are two principal safety-related needs for a signalling system in logging operations. The first is for the maintenance of communication between employees working in adjacent occupied work areas, both to warn other employees of potential hazardous situations and to summon help in an emergency. The second need for a signaling system is to provide guidance to the operators of machines and vehicles, such as cranes and other material handling machines, when work site conditions prevent operators from seeing and controlling the operation. For example, if a crane is used to move a load from below an overhang such as a cliff, a signal person might be needed to observe the load and to signal the crane operator when and how to move the load. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of the final rule prohibits the use of engine noise as a signaling device. This paragraph does permit other locally and regionally recognized signals to be used. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing the use of locally or regionally recognized signals, therefore, the Agency has retained this provision in the final rule. At paragraph (d)(7)(iii) of the final rule, OSHA has added a provision requiring that only designated persons give signals except in an emergency. The proposed rule and the 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained this requirement. Several State standards also require that only designated persons give signals (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 38K). As defined in this standard, a designated person is one who has the necessary knowledge, training and experience to perform specific job tasks. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing this provision. OSHA has included this provision in the final rule for several reasons. First, OSHA believes that the signaling system should be included in the employer's training-program so that employees who are called upon to act as signal persons will know how to signal appropriately. This is especially important when an employee performs signaling to assist with the safe operation or movement of a machine or load. It is also important that employees know the appropriate signals in the event that help must be summoned. The employee requiring help needs to know what means are to be used to communicate the necessary information and how to use those means of communication properly. In addition, other employees must be trained in what they should listen for so they can avoid potential hazards or provide assistance. Second, OSHA believes that employees without the necessary training should not be permitted to act as a signal person for assisting with the operation and movement of machines and loads. When the signal person has not been adequately trained, the risk of harm to the signal person, the machine operator and other employees in the vicinity is great. Third, the use of trained signal persons should reduce the potential for conflicting signals that could create a hazard.
