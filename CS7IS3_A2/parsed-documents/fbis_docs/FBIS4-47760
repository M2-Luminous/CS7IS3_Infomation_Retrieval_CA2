A criminal investigation of electoral fraud is under way after police alleged Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials had tampered with the ballot on the second day of voting last week. The claim is that 30 of the boxes were improperly sealed or hinged. The docket must still be forwarded to the attorney-general. The IEC has not conceded that tampering occurred. The IEC and all political parties announced in a joint statement that one ballot box was no longer in dispute, after it was examined in their presence and monitored by foreign observers. The result for Port Elizabeth is expected within the hour. The KwaZakhele votes would be recorded separately and the ballot would be stored in an isolated area until the IEC had reached a decision. IEC official Rob Midgley said he could not comment on how soon the IEC's final determination would take but said: "This will be done as soon as possible." The National Party [NP] has formally requested the IEC declare the KwaZakhele vote invalid. The joint statement confirms the NP's "formal complaint" will be forwarded to the commission for final determination. IEC officials and party agents were locked in a meeting all day to settle the dispute on the KwaZakhele ballot boxes. Counting of the KwaZakhele votes haz now started.
