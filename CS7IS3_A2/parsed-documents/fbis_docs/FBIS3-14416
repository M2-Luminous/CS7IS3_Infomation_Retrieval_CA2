[Beilin] Are you referring to the Hebron deployment? [Gay] No, I mean in general. [Beilin] Look, I think we are very, very close to a solution to the issues of an international presence and of a token Palestinian police in Hebron, as well as the whole issue of the Gaza and Jericho agreement. I hope that tomorrow, or even by tomorrow, we will be able to resolve the insignificant differences on numbers between us and the Palestinians. We have agreed on who they will report to but not on the numbers. We will resume the talks on Gaza and Jericho with great intensity. I agree with your reporters' assessments that there is a very profound mutual interest in attending the talks and completing them as soon as possible, and with the sides sharing such an interest, I assume the talks can be completed and the implementation of the agreement can begin. [Gay] Before we address the details of the remaining open issues, I would like to ask you about Yasir 'Arafat's distress. Will Israel meet him half way in order to help him out of his predicament, or at least to improve his position? [Beilin] Helping 'Arafat or the PLO out of a predicament is not part of our goal. We are interested in achieving an agreement best suiting our national needs. In this sense, exiting from Gaza is most definitely a supreme national priority for us. By the way, I think the weakness of 'Arafat or the organization he heads will end as soon as the agreement is implemented, as soon as a serious Palestinian police is deployed, as soon as the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] leaves Gaza and Jericho, when for the first time in Palestinian history, they are able to show a tangible change, rather than just slogans. When that happens, the domestic Palestinian condition will also change. [passage omitted] [Gay] Let us now address the details. We have forgotten the two issues which preoccupied us before the Hebron massacre: the size of Gaza and Jericho; the status of settlements and settler security. Have we really forgotten these issues, or have they perhaps been solved? [Beilin] They may have been forgotten by some, but that does not mean they no longer exist. The problems which preoccupied us are still there, but we have to remember that most of the main problems were resolved in the 'Arafat-Peres meeting in Cairo. What it means is that there are no more outstanding central, or rather substantive, problems, with the exception of one or two which will have to be discussed. There are many issues, particularly in the sphere of economics -- such as currency and the customs system -- which require detailed discussions, and that will definitely take time. There is a technical difficulty which must not be overlooked: The sides have yet to write the agreement they intend to sign, and it will be probably one of the most voluminous agreements we have ever seen, because while it does not deal with the permanent arrangement, it addresses so many details that it cannot be agreed on and written in a day. Its completion will require a very intensive effort for several weeks. [Raz] But, Deputy Minister Beilin, political sources in Jerusalem have been saying with near-certainty that the agreement will be completed by 12 April. Is it possible that we are squeezing ourselves into such a tight timetable that we will be forced to make concessions merely because of our desire to wrap it up by then? [Beilin] No, we will not make concessions on any substantive or even technical matter. We will simply have to work more intensely than we would have had there been no massacre, which put everything off by a month. This means that physically, we will have to work day and night in order to reach an agreement. We will have to negotiate without pause. These are extremely complex negotiations involving dozens of people. They will all take place in Cairo, and they will have to be pursued until everything is finalized. [Raz] I have been told that the most complex part on the agenda is the so-called legal chapter. Where will it lead? Are we talking about legislative powers and the power to detain people -- namely, things beyond autonomy? [Beilin] No, no. Everything is definitely within the parameters of autonomy. We have absolutely no intention to go anywhere beyond the Oslo agreement and the jurisdiction of autonomy. We must not forget, however, that in Oslo, we discussed principles, and not how things would look on the ground. By the way, we are indeed close to an agreement; I do not think that is the main problem. I think there are unresolved economic issues -- mainly the problem of whether the territories and Israel will belong to the same customs system; that will have to be discussed at length. As I have said, there is still no written agreement, and that will have to be done. [Gay] I think you are leaving for Oman this week. [Beilin] No, I will travel to Oman on 17 April. It will be the first multilateral session in a Gulf state. This particular session will address the water issue, and I will head our delegation.

Winter points out that "Beilin, a member of the dovish wing of the Labor party, says he opposes uprooting the Jewish settlement in Hebron, adding that the status quo should be preserved in the city for the next five years."]
