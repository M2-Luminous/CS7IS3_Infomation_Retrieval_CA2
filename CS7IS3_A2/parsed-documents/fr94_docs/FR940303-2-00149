FR940303-2-00149 FR940303-2-00081 [Release No. 34&hyph;33670; File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;93&hyph;10] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Securities Trust Company; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Limitation or Elimination of Directors' Liability February 23, 1994. On August 27, 1993, Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;93&hyph;10) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') under section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 MSTC amended the filing on October 6 1993. 2 The Commission published notice of this proposed rule change in the Federal Register on January 5, 1994. 3 No public comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Letter from David T. Rusoff, Foley & Lardner, to Richard Strasser [Attorney], Division of Market Regulation, Commission (October 5, 1993). 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33379 (December 23, 1993), 59 FR 640. I. Description The proposal will limit or eliminate the potential monetary liability of MSTC directors to the fullest extent permissible under Illinois law. 4 The proposed change is based on Section 2.10(b)(3) of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, under which MSTC is organized. That section allows corporations to adopt provisions in their articles of incorporation that limit or eliminate the potential monetary liability of directors under certain circumstances. 4 Specifically, the proposal adds the following language to Article X of MSTC's Articles of Incorporation and to Article IV, ยง1 of MSTC's By-Laws: To the fullest extent that the Illinois Business Corporation Act, as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended, permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of Directors, no Director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director, except where such liability arises directly or indirectly as a result of a violation of the federal securities laws. No amendment to or repeal of this Article shall apply to or have any effect on the liability of any Director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such Director occurring prior to such amendment or repeal. General corporate law imposes a fiduciary duty of care upon each corporate director. This duty of care requires a director to exercise informed business judgment in good faith and to act with an honest belief that the action taken is in the best interest of the corporation. The proposal does not eliminate an MSTC director's duty of care but rather limits the personal liability of an MSTC director to MSTC or its shareholders should the director fail through negligence or gross negligence to satisfy his or her duty of care. 5 5 MSTC's proposal limits a director's liability even if that director had been grossly negligent provided that the director exercised informed business judgment in good faith and acted with an honest belief that the action taken was in the best interest of the corporation. Because there has been no judicial interpretation on the scope of the applicable Illinois legislation, it is possible that an Illinois court may find as a matter of law that a director cannot act in a manner that is both grossly negligent and in good faith. The proposal does not limit a director's liability in instances where liability arises directly or indirectly as a result of a violation of federal securities laws. The proposal also does not eliminate equitable remedies such as rescission or injunctive actions. Moreover, it does not eliminate the liability of an officer of MSTC for actions taken in that capacity even if the officer is also a director. Finally, the proposal does not affect the liability of a director for acts or omissions that occurred prior to approval of the proposal. II. Discussion The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular with Section 17A(b)(3)(C) 6 of the Act in that it helps to ensure the fair representation of shareholders and participants in the administration of MSTC. By limiting or eliminating the potential monetary liability of MSTC directors for actions they take within the scope of their employment, the proposal should guarantee that qualified candidates are not discouraged from becoming MSTC directors. This should enable MSTC to maintain a variety of qualified candidates from which to choose directors and in particular should help MSTC retain directors who are fairly representative of MSTC's shareholders and participants. 6 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(C) (1988). III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular with section 17A of the Act. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 7 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;93&hyph;10) be, and hereby is, approved. 7 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
