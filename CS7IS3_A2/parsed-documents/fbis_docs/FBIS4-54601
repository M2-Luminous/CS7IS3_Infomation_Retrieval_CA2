This was the almost unanimous statement made by the leaders of the six parliamentary parties' lists, who attended a forum on Monday evening in Budapest's University of Economics. The forum was the closing event of a lecture series entitled "Elections 1994". The Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF) was represented by Prime Minister Peter Boross, the Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP) by Gyula Horn, the Alliance of Free Democrats (AFD) by Gabor Kuncze, the Federation of Young Democrats (FYD) by Viktor Orban, the Christian Democratic People's Party (CDPP) by Laszlo Surjan, the Unified Smallholders' Party by Janos Szabo. The central theme of the forum was the stake of the May parliamentary elections, the possible outcome, and the tasks facing the next government. Citing the experiences of their campaign tours, the views of the party list leaders were divided as regards the outcome of the elections. Boross and Surjan were of the opinion that the voters do not want a radical political turn and change in direction. Although the two politicians acknowledged that many people presumably have still not decided who they would vote for, they stressed they believe the majority is for continuing on the road begun in the past four years, albeit with certain corrections. As against this, Orban used the term "semi-turn", which is also formulated in the FYD's manifesto, to characterize the political direction desired for the future. He said people do not want to turn back the change in system, the process of changing the system, but they definitely want a change in government.
