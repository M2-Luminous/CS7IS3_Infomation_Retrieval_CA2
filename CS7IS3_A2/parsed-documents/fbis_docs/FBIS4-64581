B."-initialed commentary: "Arms Deliveries to Turkish War Lords"] [Text] Bonn's decision to resume German arms deliveries to Turkey is strange. The Turks' war against the Kurds on the territory of the Turkish state is a fact, no matter how it is expressed in terms of international law. The arms deliveries onesidedly help one party to the war. Of course, this cannot be an argument in favor of thinking about whether one should also provide weapons to the other, the Kurdish side -- if it could pay for them. One should not send any weapons to this region, no matter what the borders there are like. Borders are not eternal -- the Germans in particular have been able to experience this gratefully, despite CSCE guarantees. The Federal Government's spokesman noted that German weapons are not used against the Kurds; the evaluation of the photographs presented by German observers and Kurdish groups did not prove that they are. The question is whether this should be the basis on which the Federal Government can give itself a clear conscience. If it had said that we have informed ourselves with the necessary care and by using all means available to us and can, therefore, rule out that the weapons delivered by Germany are used against the Kurds, this would mean a bit more. It would not mean much more and would be far too little for the decision that has been made now, however. A country like Turkey needs more weapons than those it is using against the Kurds. The more it gets for other tasks, the more it can send to Kurdistan. Therefore, the German deliveries play a role in this war against the Kurds in any case.
