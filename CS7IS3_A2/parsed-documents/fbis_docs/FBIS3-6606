FBIS3-6606 "dreas054__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-054-A Document Type:Daily Report 21 March 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI To Reject Any Call for Semiconductor Quotas OW1903060594 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 19 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1903060594 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 19 March Morning Edition] [Text] Next week at a regular meeting in Hawaii on semiconductors, if the United States formally asks Japan to present a new action plan aimed at ensuring a 20-percent share for foreign-made semiconductors on the Japanese market, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will reject it, saying "the industries of both countries are making efforts for cooperation under the current agreement, and there is no need for a new plan" (according to Vice MITI Minister Hideaki Kumano). The ministry is wary lest the United States should choose--in applying the model of resolving the recent cellular phone issue--to demand that the Japanese Government guarantee the enforcement of private sector agreements in the auto and auto parts sector, as well as the semiconductor sector, which would amount to a de facto setting of "numerical targets." MITI appreciates the fact that foreign semiconductor products' share of the Japanese market exceeded 20 percent in the October-December quarter of 1993 according to the calculations of both Japan and the United States, and its Machinery and Information Industries Bureau declared, "This is proof that the cooperative relations between the Japanese and U.S. industries are working well." The United States, however, is unhappy that the overall market share for 1993 fell short of 20 percent and is said to be contemplating asking Japan to present a new action plan. MITI reacts to this by saying: "We have stuck to the position of rejecting numerical targets throughout the economic framework talks. We will not agree to the idea of setting share targets in the semiconductor market and then having these guaranteed by the government." The ministry will point out that the number of projects involving U.S. manufacturers and Japanese users cooperating from the developmental design-in stage exceeded 3,000 in 1993, having grown six-fold over the past seven-year period. It wants to solicit the understanding of the United States by emphasizing that the industry-level cooperation is proceeding smoothly.
