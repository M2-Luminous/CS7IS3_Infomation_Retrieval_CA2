FBIS4-157 "drafr064_c_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA SADF Says KZP To Continue Policing Duties SADF Says KZP To Continue Policing Duties MB0204111894 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1020 GMT 2 Apr 94 MB0204111894 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Report by Craig Doonan] [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- The kwaZulu Police [KZP] will continue its normal policing duties and its members are not confined to barracks under the emergency regulations, but there are "uncertainties" about the KZP which have to be clarified by the minister of justice and of defence. This emerged at an SA Defence Force [SADF] media briefing in Durban on Saturday [2 April] addressed by Natal Command spokesman Col Frans Verfuss. "At this stage, they're (KZP) not restricted by the proclamation. "No where does (the proclamation) say they're confined to barracks," he said. African National Congress President Nelson Mandela said last week that the KZP would be confined to barracks and would carry out only those duties permitted by the SADF. Col Verfuss said there were "uncertainties" regarding the emergency regulations which had been referred to Justice and Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee for "clarification". There was a "bit of a grey area" in terms of the KZP's role, he said, without elaborating, adding that the KZP would in the interim continue its normal policing operations. Col Verfuss explained that KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During had been at Friday's planning session with the SA Police [SAP] and SADF where the emergency proclamation had been studied. Col Verfuss refused to elaborate on the "uncertainties" in the regulations saying these would be made clear by senior police and army officers next week. The KZP is not specifically referred to in the regulations which define "security force" as the SAP or the SADF, or "any part" of these forces. On kwaZulu self defence training camps, Col verfuss said the regulations made it clear that any illegal military or para-military training was prohibited. He, however, was unable to say whether action would be taken against the kwaZulu training camps in Northern Natal and said this would be made clear next week. Meanwhile, he revealed that three SADF companies, comprising up to 500 soldiers, had been deployed on the South Coast, Midlands and Northern Natal regions over the weekend. These included two parabat [paratrooper batalion] companies and one infantry company. In total, about 1,200 soldiers were now deployed in Natal/kwaZulu and their daily operations would depend on the "situation on the ground". "These are troops deployed in an internal stability/unrest type role and this doesn't include forces we can call up." He said citizen forces had, however, been called up for the election period from April 15 to May 15. Col Verfuss said current flashpoints around Durban were Bhambayi, kwaMashu and Ndwedwe. He said troops had been deployed in these areas and around Margate on the South Coast. Questioned why he thought violence had recently subsided in the Natal/kwaZulu region, Col Verfuss said there were "many reasons". "Probably, the major reason is there's a bit of a 'wait and see' attitude." He said next week's planned summit between State President F W de Klerk, Mr Mandela, Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini may have quelled fighting. People were also probably waiting to see how the emergency regulations would affect them. On illegal weapons in Natal, Col Verfuss said AK-47 assault rifles were "flowing in on a regular basis", while there were unconfirmed reports of RPG-7 rocket launchers being smuggled into the region. He said licensed weapons would not be confiscated under the regulations, but there was a ban on carrying other weapons, including "traditional" ones.
