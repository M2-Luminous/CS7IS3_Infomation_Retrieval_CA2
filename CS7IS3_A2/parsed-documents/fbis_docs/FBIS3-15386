Its senior executives said that the decision of the Gazprom joint stock company on reducing gas deliveries "can hardly be described as groundless," because Belarusian enterprises are consuming gas, but are in no hurry to pay for it. The Belarusian council of ministers "outlined various measures for paying the debts, Belinform was told at Beltransgaz. Some 30 billion roubles have already been transferred to the account of Gazprom. The money was raised with the help of the Ministry of Finance, the National Bank and auctions at stock exchanges," the Beltransgaz spokesman said.
