FR940727-2-00055 FR940727-2-00027 Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent Order from Revco D.S., Inc. (``Revco'') under which Revco would divest pharmacy assets in three (3) geographic locations where it faces limited competition. Revco operates the Revco chain of drug stores. The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed Order. On March 31, 1994 Revco and Hook-SupeRx, Inc. (``HSI'') executed an Agreement and Plan or Merger providing for the acquisition by Revco of all of the voting securities of HSI. The proposed complaint alleges that the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would constitute a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. ยง45, in the market for the sale of prescription drugs in retail stores in the following towns: Covington, Virginia; Marion, Virginia; and Radford, Virginia (hereinafter ``relevant geographic area''). The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by maintaining the current number of competitors in the relevant geographic areas where Revco and HSI are direct competitors and where they face limited competition. The proposed Consent Order provides that within one (1) year of the Order becoming final, Revco shall divest all assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in Revco or HSI retail stores in the relevant geographic areas. The divestiture of the Revco or HSI pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas shall be made only to an acquirer or acquirers that receive prior approval of the Commission and only in a manner that receives the prior approval of the Commission. The assets shall be divested to an eligible acquirer or acquirers that will operate a pharmacy business in the relevant geographic areas. Eligible acquirers in each relevant geographic area include, but are not limited to: owners of retail stores that currently do not operate a pharmacy in that relevant geographic area; persons previously employed by Revco or HSI; or persons who will open a new retail store. In the event that Revco has not divested the Revco or HSI pharmacy assets in the relevant areas in one (1) year, the proposed Consent Order provides that Revco shall consent to the appointment by the Commission of a trustee to divest the pharmacy assets. Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Revco is also required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the divestiture provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until Revco has completely divested its interest in assets related to the retail sale of prescription drugs in the relevant geographic areas. The proposed Order will also prohibit Revco, for a period of ten (10) years, from acquiring, without Federal Trade Commission approval, any stock in any concern engaged in the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas or any assets used for the business of selling prescription drugs at retail in the relevant geographic areas. One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Revco will be required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Revco to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) day prior to any change in the structure of Revco resulting in the emergence of a successor. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.
