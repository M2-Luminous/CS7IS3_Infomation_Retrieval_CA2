A View of the Problem of Hidden Unemployment"] [Text] Assuming that the drop in production is a temporary phenomenon, the leaders of many enterprises are striving in their favorite ways to avoid massive layoffs. For which they are using several tried methods: a short workday or a short work week, leave without pay, or partially paid leave. This has helped some. Especially those whose work stoppages occurred as a result of disruptions in the delivery of raw materials and supplies. As soon as the previous relations were put in order, the collectives began to work at full speed. But there also are many of those who have been frozen in uncertainty. There are no orders, but there are personnel. How long this will last is unknown. What is to be done in this case? We talk about this with Aleksandr Tkachenko, chief of the administration for policy for the labor market and the population of the Ministry of Labor of the Russian Federation. "Unfortunately, there are no formulas," says Aleksandr Aleksandrovich. "The fact is that hidden unemployment is an unprecedented phenomenon. It never existed previously in the history of our state. For example, in the period of the development of capitalism in Russia, there was simply unemployment. But hidden unemployment arises in enterprises interested in retaining personnel, but this is possible only when the workers are highly skilled. Only a part of all of those employed in production in the years 1913-1914 possessed a high level of skill. Therefore, the need could hardly have arisen among employers to keep a skilled worker on a short day, while paying him compensation for the unused work time. But the unskilled were simply dismissed as unnecessary during any reduction in production. Although, however, some large plant owners granted workers who had children one free day a month. However, it is impossible to say that this is not full employment; rather, it was a social privilege." [Rozanova] But how did the matter stand during stagnation? [Tkachenko] That was the kingdom of fictitious employment. Extensive development of the economy was a rather characteristic feature of the period. Where one person could handle a job, five were on the payroll. For all practical purposes, labor productivity did not increase, and it was falling in individual branches. An enormous army of managers was engaged for a large part of the day in an imitation of activity. And, still, it is impossible to call this hidden unemployment. That appeared only in the course of the radical economic reform. It was the result of a reduction in subsidies and favorable credits to enterprises that became accustomed to receiving subsidies from the state. Now they all have to pull through by themselves, which not all of them are able to do. But last year the Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics] for the first time conducted an analysis of calculated hidden unemployment as a mass phenomenon, and it is now doing this systematically. We do not have sufficient data at present to draw any kind of fundamental conclusions. [Rozanova] And nevertheless, what kind of picture has been evolving to date? [Tkachenko] Although a catastrophic drop in employment has not occurred, the process of accumulating hidden unemployment is continuing. It constitutes approximately 8-17 percent of the number of the employed in the national economy, and it is present in both state and in privatized enterprises, in many ways removing the acuteness and social danger of mass unemployment. But the imbalance between manpower supply and demand has not only failed to abate, but has gotten stronger. In August of last year, according to the findings of the first Goskomstat investigation, there were about 2 million workers who were partially unemployed (9 percent of the total number). Eight hundred thousand persons were working under conditions of a short work week; moreover, the week was cut on the average by eight hours. More than 1 million persons were on leave at administrative initiative. The length of forced leaves in August, for example, reached an average of 12 days and, in addition, 45 percent of such people on leave did not receive even a partial wage. In the first half of this year, almost 3.8 million persons in enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, transport and communications, everyday services, and science and scientific services were working in a routine of part-time employment on the initiative of administration (12 percent of the total number of workers of these branches), of which 933,000 were switched to a short workday or a short work week. More than 2.8 million workers were on additional leaves without the provision or with partial provision of wages. The total period of administrative leaves was 51.3 million man-days, or 18 days per worker, on the average. [Rozanova] What branches of the national economy were hit to the greatest extent by this ailment? [Tkachenko] Light and food industry enterprises, because of a lack of supplies of material resources, and enterprises of nonferrous metallurgy and the chemical and petrochemical industry, because of difficulties with sales. I am not even talking about the military-industrial complex; there it is the most difficult of all. [Rozanova] But in what regions is the situation the worst? [Tkachenko] Hidden unemployment has particularly hit the republics of the North Caucasus and the regions of Central Russia. According to data of the CIS statistical committee, 30-32 percent of those employed in industry in Chuvashia and Mordvinia were partially unemployed. A high level of hidden unemployment was also noted in other territories of the Russian Federation: in Pskov, Vladimir, and Novosibirsk Oblasts, the republics of Mari El and Kabardino-Balkaria (21-24 percent); and in Tver, Kursk, Kirov, Bryansk, Kaluga, and Ryazan Oblasts (17-19 percent of the workers). In the southern regions of Russia, agricultural hidden unemployment--the so-called agrarian overpopulation--becomes especially noticeable. More and more primary family providers are falling into the ranks of the unemployed and those who have been compelled to take part-time employment (this is men in the defense industries, and it is women in areas where female employment is prevalent). The hardest hit were oblasts with a single industry development--Ivanovo, Sverdlovsk, and Chelyabinsk. [Rozanova] But, after all, by keeping workers in the work force, enterprises are getting deeper and deeper into debt.... [Tkachenko] Unquestionably. This affects the textile industry particularly. The provision of textile cotton fiber in Ivanovo Oblast this year amounts to about 70 percent of the requirement determined by the production capacities of the enterprises. Of course, it will not be possible to restore the previous volumes of fabric output. Thus, it is inevitable in the textile industry that there will be a release of manpower that will be equivalent to the level of the lack of supplies of raw material resources, and, according to forecasts, it will amount to not less than 20,000-30,000 persons (according to enterprises of the joint-stock company IVTEKS). It will be necessary on a state level to develop a special program for this region to reorient textile enterprises to the output of sewn and knitted articles and other products. At the same time, there will be a need to support state organs (in the plan of interbranch cooperation), social guarantees in the retraining of workers, and currency investments. According to the calculations of specialists of Ivanovo Oblast, expenditures for the implementation of these measures will total 200 million rubles [R]. It is possible to fulfill the entire program in two to two and a half years, on condition that resources are allocated. A similar situation is developing in the cotton enterprises of Vladimir Oblast. [Rozanova] The number of unprofitable plants and factories is increasing, production is coming to a stop, and bankrupt enterprises have started to appear. Will this also make the ailment worse? [Tkachenko] Of course, about half the losses of work time now are due to difficulties in the sale of products because of the insolvency of consumers, and 39 percent of the losses are associated with the failure to provide enterprises with raw materials, supplies, replenishment articles, and fuel. Employment cuts are expected in the chemical and petrochemical industry, in machinebuilding and metal processing, and especially in instrument building, lumber, woodworking, and the pulp and paper industry. An increase in the number of employed is expected in the coal and the oil and gas industry, and ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy. But the number of vacancies will be less than the number of dismissals. [Rozanova] This means that a social catastrophe is not far off: At any moment, millions of people could end up thrown outside the gates of their enterprises. Are plant directors really standing by and not doing anything in such a situation? [Tkachenko] There are enterprises that are succeeding, as they say, in pulling out of the spin. There already are quite a few. I will name just some: The Lyuberetskiy carpet combine, the capital shoe factory Paris Commune, the Kosinskaya knitwear factory (now the Kosino joint-stock company), the Moscow Trekhgornaya factory, the Norilsk ore mining and processing combine, several aviation machinebuilding enterprises, and also combines for diamond processing. They were able to find and interest foreign investors, who supplied their own equipment. Part of the finished product goes to cover subsidies, and the rest is for the domestic market, and it has a demand because it is competitive. Part-time employment is reduced practically to zero. There are successes in converted enterprises; moreover, in rather unexpected directions; for example, the Kirov plant in St. Petersburg started to produce knitted wear instead of tanks, and the business turned out to be quite profitable. [Rozanova] How in your view does policy influence the problem we are discussing? [Tkachenko] If we are talking about the policy on the labor market, our ministry holds to the line that the process of changing hidden unemployment to open unemployment should not be speeded up. At least for the reason that we are not prepared to maintain a huge army of the unemployed: after all, the norms of deductions for the employment fund, according to our calculations, make it possible to support no more than 2.5 million unemployed. In connection with the drop in production, the Goskomstat predicts that by the end of the year hidden reserves of manpower will be transformed into open unemployment. It is possible that the situation will be influenced to a great degree by the "Law on the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises," which at the present moment is practically not functioning. It is possible that the decision of the Central Bank of Russia on prohibiting the sale of goods for foreign currency on hand after January will change the situation for the better. This will certainly reduce the importation of foreign goods and will lead to an increase in prices for them, but, on the other hand, a powerful incentive will appear for the development of a market for domestic goods, and, of course, domestic production also.
