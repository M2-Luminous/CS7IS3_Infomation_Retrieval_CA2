Talks have been held between all parties involved on all fronts but the deadlock remains. This is because President Juvenal Habyarimana, author of the artificial deadlock, has proved to be inflexible and wants to desperately maintain his dictatorial power. [passage omitted] Everyone is growing tired of the irresponsible behavior of President Juvenal Habyarimana who does not want to respect the Arusha agreements. [passage omitted] The ongoing struggle for democracy must be continued be it -- against our will -- through the use of weapons. In this regard, let us listen to a commentary by [words indistinct]: [Unidentified reporter] [passage omitted] Should President Habyarimana toughen his position by constantly violating the Arusha agreements which he signed himself with his own hand, there is no alternative other than that of resuming the armed struggle. It is the only way, as experience has shown, for the (?dictatorship) to listen to the voice of reason, albeit momentarily. Things must be clarified here. President Habyarimana agreed with change mainly because the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] combatants' armed strength compelled him to do so. Even at the present hour, if President Habyarimana continues to drag his feet on the agreements which he solemnly signed before the Rwandan people and the international community, the freedom fighters will again take up arms as this seems to be the only language capable of persuading Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] supporters to see reason. [passage omitted] The worst is to be feared should the current situation of insecurity organized by MRND supporters last. The worst is to be dreaded given the quantity of weapons distributed among the people and given the stubbornness of President Habyarimana who has deliberately and openly torpedoed the peace process. [passage omitted] Facing this feeling of inevitability of war which the president of the Republic is trying to spread throughout the country, everybody must acknowledge that peace remains the most valuable thing since it is the only thing which can truly be profitable to Rwandans. It is therefore important that everybody works toward the restoration of that peace and the creation f the broadbased transitional institutions.
