FR941103-2-00128 FR941103-2-00072 The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to require that SPEQ performance data be presented to the Committee in four tiers, with units listed alphabetically in each comparable group, is a reasonable means of ranking units for comparison. In this regard, the Commission recognizes that a unit might not have SPEQ scores which, from a statistical perspective, are significantly different from the next higher or lower unit. The presentation of the SPEQ results in four tiers that differ significantly should provide the Committee with appropriate groupings of specialist units for its use in allocation decisions. This should help the Committee in its evaluation of applicants for a new listing. The Commission believes that the Exchange's proposal to amend its Policy to state that in the case of spin-offs, listings of related companies and relistings of securities, the NYSE will honor a listing company's request that it not be allocated automatically to its former specialist unit or the specialist in the parent or related company, should provide an opportunity for the listed company to provide input into the allocation of an affiliated listing. However, a listing company's preference should not be allowed to take significance over or negate specialist performance. A listing company's preference is a minor, supplemental factor and only should be used to distinguish between the best qualified units based on performance related criteria. 14 In this regard, the listing company's request would serve only to open the allocation to all units. 14 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27803 (March 14, 1990), 55 FR 10740 (March 22, 1990) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;88&hyph;32). The Commission believes that the Exchange's proposal to delete the reference to specific aspects of trading foreign issues on the Exchange floor should provide the NYSE with additional flexibility in allocating foreign issues. Again, the foreign listing considerations in the Policy are supplemental in that specialist performance remains the key factor in allocation decisions. The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to eliminate specialist representation on the Committee will solve the appearance of a conflict of interest on the Committee and, thereby, enhance confidence in the allocation process. The Commission concurs with the NYSE's conclusion that floor brokers and allied members are in a better position to judge the relative strengths and weaknesses of specialist units. The Commission also agrees that an effort should be made to appoint individuals that have not yet served on the Committee before reappointing past Committee members. This should ensure that a broader segment of the trading floor community will have an opportunity to serve on the Committee. In this regard, the Commission also agrees with the NYSE in that the Panel should consist of a core group of experienced, senior professionals and supports its proposal to select a significant number of floor members on the Panel from among the Exchange's senior floor officials, floor governors and former allocation committee chairmen. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the revised mix of both Committee and Panel members is appropriate and consistent with the Act. The Commission believes that the NYSE's proposal to require that the list of Committee members be kept confidential and prohibit members and investment bankers from initiating contact with Committee members regarding pending allocations should minimize potential conflicts in allocation decisions. Under the revised Policy, Committee members still would be permitted to initiate contact with any specialist if they believe it would be beneficial when making an allocation decision. The Commission believes that this revision to the Policy should help to ensure that specialist performance, rather than subjective recommendation, is the most significant criterion in allocation decisions.
