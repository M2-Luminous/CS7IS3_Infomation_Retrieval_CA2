[passage omitted] The last French soldier has now left the country. Their mission was to protect and to evacuate the expatriate community. That mission has now been accomplished. As to the ongoing situation, Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin this afternoon told parliament that France has no intention of acting as the policeman of Africa: [Begin Roussin recording] France has not ceased to try to mobilize public opinion in Africa and across the world. We did not sit back with our arms folded. Though we realize that the 2,500 blue berets urgently needed the reinforcement of the 500 paratroopers to ensure the evacuation of more than 1,500 people, let me tell you that the prime minister today asked the foreign minister to remind the United Nations of its role. We cannot be the policeman of Africa. The international community has a duty to take over from us, and the United Nations must now bring the different parties together, and bring the protagonists to a cease-fire. If France is again called upon, France will answer yes. [end recording]
