Funding Limitations on Indirect Costs 1. Training projects awards to institutions of higher education and other non-profit institutions are limited to a federal reimbursement rate for indirect costs of eight (8) percent of the total allowable direct costs or, where a current agreement exists, the organization's negotiated indirect cost rate, whichever is lower. Differences between the applicant's approved rate and the 8% limitation may be used as federal cost sharing. See Section J&hyph;2, Item 6j, below. 2. For all other applicants, indirect costs generally may be requested only if the applicant has a negotiated indirect cost rate with the Department's Division of Cost Allocation or with another federal agency. Applicants who do not have a negotiated indirect cost rate may apply for one in accordance with DHHS procedures and in compliance with relevant OMB Circulars.
