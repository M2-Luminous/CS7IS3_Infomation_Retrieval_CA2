Mohan and Ouk Kimseng: "Arbitration System To Be Established Soon for Trade Disputes"] [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Ministry of Justice is studying the possibility of establishing an arbitration system here to tackle trade and commercial disputes. This is a concerted attempt to give confidence to businesses dealing with trading, especially international businesses and contracts. Senior Minister Chem Snguon, in a wide ranging exclusive interview with The Cambodia Times, said: "This arbitration court and system must be adopted soon. Concerning the Ministry of Justice, we want only to give confidence to investors and businesses dealing with this country to show that if there is any conflict, they could rely on the local justice. That is why the arbitration system must be adopted very quickly. Contrary to common notion, the courts here in the city have heard several commercial cases pertaining to contracts and international investments and judgement has already been given." "Our courts are competent to judge all conflicts arising from contractual disputes from commercial courts," said Chem Snguon, who is also the Minister of Justice. "The Ministry of Justice would like to introduce the system of arbitration to hear contractual disputes. In this respect, I would like to study the problems arising from the establishment of such systems elsewhere in neighbouring countries, so that the system when established and enforced here will be coherent and effective," he pointed out. "In the field of commerce and economics, the Justice Ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance and Trade, is looking into the possibility of adopting the common law system." Chem added that the judicial field in this country was presently based on the French judicial system. "The Ministry is now studying the common law way of procedures to see how we can borrow some elements and possibilities which could help us solve all the cases more quickly and efficiently." "We have requested the assistance of UNDP [United Nations Development Program] to provide expertise on the common law system to help improve the system. There has been a court in existence in all the provinces since 1982. There are a total of 21 courts at the provincial level, one Appeals Court, one Supreme Court and one Military Court," Chem said. "The Ministry of Justice and the judicial system here does not have enough means to face all the cases we receive. Nevertheless, we are striving hard to revive the judicial system to a level which will enable our task (to be carried out) efficiently, quickly and independently. It is the responsibility of the Ministry of Justice to reorganise all judicial systems in this nation to guarantee independence of Cambodian courts, judges, prosecutors and magistrates. The Ministry of Justice must give priority to legal formation and jurisdiction formation to have more judges and prosecutors at all levels and at all areas. We aspire to have between three to five judges per court and two to four prosecutors."
