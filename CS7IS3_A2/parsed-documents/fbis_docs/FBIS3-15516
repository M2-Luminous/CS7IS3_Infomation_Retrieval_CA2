"Ruslan Khasbulatov is a figure who has some real weight in the Russian political scene, and it is hardly possible that he will join any of the criminal elements," Dudayev told Interfax. The president said there was today no opposition in Chechnya. There are only "ordinary groups of bandits, who seek to take control of the situation under the pretense of carrying on a political struggle," he said. The republic's State Department has listed 30 opposition leaders to be arrested. Dudayev said his government knew nothing about any attempts of the opposition to draw Khasbulatov, who is at present living with his mother in the village of Tolstoy-Yurt, into their ranks. Asked about the possibility of cooperation between Chechnya's leadership and Khasbulatov, who was arrested last October as one of the organizers of the hardline revolt in Moscow, the president said: "We are not in a position to say anything about that, because it is Khasbulatov's private matter."
