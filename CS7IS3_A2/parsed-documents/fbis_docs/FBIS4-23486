He was speaking at the handing over of Armscor's 1993/94 annual report to Defence Minister Joe Modise at Armscor's Pretoria head office. "We want to overcome the perception that Armscor and the industry in South Africa is a cloak and dagger business and that there is a crook behind every propeller. That is not true. The fact that we had to get products into the country through so-called channels we will admit," Mr Moolman said in a reference to South Africa's illicit purchase of armaments and weapons technology during three decades of a United Nations arms embargo on South Africa. He said South Africa had always tried to be an honest arms dealer. Mr Moolman said he welcomed debate on the countries to which Arsmcor sold weapons, saying this was a cabinet decision. He would welcome the issue being discussed in a parliamentary standing committee. The report notes a decrease in the defence budget over the past few years. "Consequently the South African National Defence Force had less funds available for the acquisition of equipment," the report says. "Arsmcor and the defence industry are national asset that will play an important role in the development of South Africa. In close collaboration with the local defence industry, Arsmcor will continue to ensure that South Africa remains self-sufficient in key military and security systems." Arsmcor spent R4,481 million [rand] in 1993/94 on arms and equipment. Of this sum, R2,487 million was spent on aerospace equipment, including the replacement of the aged Harvard aircraft with the Pilatus PC-7 aircraft. Delivery of the first aircraft is expected in October this year. Money was also spent on upgrading existing aircraft. The Rooivalk combat helicopter was developed. Vehicle and weapons systems absorbed R1,014 million. Among the projects were developing tank technology, producing armoured vehicles for the South African army and for the South African Police Services. The remainder of the acquisitions budget was spent on electronics and maritime products. A tactical radio system was developed, communications infrastructure for the Bushveld Airspace Control Centre was developed as well as underwater telephones for use on surface ships and submarines. The Arsmcor report also highlights steps taken to harness military technology for civilian use.
