Without a political settlement the world will continue to observe the tragedy, stated Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin in an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent on his return from Geneva, where the latest meeting of the sides in the Bosnian conflict had taken place. He said that with each new unsuccessful round it is increasingly difficult to count on the success of the talks on a Bosnia settlement. Describing the recent round as "unsuccessful," Vitaliy Churkin noted that at the previous meeting in Brussels in December last year in his opinion an opportunity of reaching agreement was lost: The world community lacked the resolve to see the matter through to a logical conclusion. "And that is even more so now." The deputy foreign minister believes that essentially the participants in the talks are now "going round in circles." That is problems which at the previous round of talks seemed to be the main, final problems were not mentioned at all this time. Some completely different questions arose. Thus while then the chief and paramount obstacle to reaching a definitive agreement seemed to be questions of the Muslim republic's access to the sea and the river Sava, that is questions connected with its survival, now these questions have not been mentioned at all. New questions have arisen and there was the impression that the preceding five or six rounds of talks had not happened t all. This situation, V. Churkin said, confirms the Russian side's concern that unless it adopts a clear position and leads the sides to signing an agreement then disputes on various aspects of this agreement could continue "as long as you like." What worries me most, Churkin said, is the fact that the world community, not to mention the participants in the talks, seems to have "lost its bearings," and some kind of confusion bordering on panic has arisen. Because nothing is being achieved, important but secondary issues are being brought to the fore. "I am deeply convinced," he stressed, "that without a political settlement the humanitarian problem, however much is done with it, will be on the tragic borderline since as long as people continue to fight -- when each side will be thinking of military victory -- it will not be possible to meet the population's humanitarian needs." But what is happening now, the deputy minister continued, is that the political aspect of the matter is sometimes forgotten and important but nonetheless secondary humanitarian problems and even "individual episodes" of the overall humanitarian situation are being brought to the fore. As for the question of air strikes against Bosnia, V. Churkin pointed to the relevant UN Security Council resolutions which speak of the possibility of such actions "from the viewpoint of helping the UN protection forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and helping the world community's humanitarian measures." Speaking of the Russian side's position on this issue it cannot be said that Russia opposes any air strikes "a priori," he continued. "If a situation suddenly arises when UN troops really become the target for a direct attack by any of the conflicting side," V. Churkin explained his personal viewpoint, "I will recommend (and I am sure a political decision will be made) that the measure be supported." Or another case: Perhaps a "malevolent action" will be undertaken and some side will not allow humanitarian aid through to dying people and in these cases, he stressed, the toughest measures could perfectly well be taken. But when people speak of air strikes virtually today or tomorrow to assist the battalion replacement operation (and the changeover is planned for the middle of February [as published] and there is an agreement on assisting this changeover in Srebrenica) then in V. Churkin's opinion such proposals are aimed at diverting attention from the real problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to imagine, he continued, how it is possible to use air strikes to open the airport in Tuzla or effect the replacement of the Canadian battalion with a Dutch one. It is absolutely clear that if air strikes are be delivered in the Srebrenica region there will be no changeover -- fighting will begin and there will be no question at all of any humanitarian aid. As for the displeasure voiced recently by "some circles and people" over Lord Owen's actions in a Bosnian settlement, then in V. Churkin's opinion the latter's replacement or resignation from the post of cochairman of the international London conference on a settlement in the former Yugoslavia would be a "serious mistake" right now. Lord Owen, the Russian Federation deputy foreign minister said, is the only man who has been concerned with settlement issues from the outset and "he has concentrated all the threads of the negotiations in his hands" and if he were to be replaced now "any of the three sides in Bosnia which does not want a settlement could simply exploit this fact to continue to fool everyone, to raise ever new questions, or return to old ones and so on and so forth." Vitaliy Churkin recalled that in the past Lord Owen adopted a very tough anti-Serbian stance and called for air strikes against individual targets. "When this did not happen calls began to be heard for Lord Owen's replacement." The Russian Federation deputy foreign minister believes that it is very difficult now to find a worthy replacement for Lord Owen and that it is simply impossible without losing the pace of the negotiations. That would essentially mean, he said, that the world community would acknowledge its impotence and "talk would then turn to a completely new and large range of political efforts with vague chances of success." The next round, Vitaliy Churkin said in conclusion, is scheduled for 10 February [as published] in Geneva. This meeting has been set more modest tasks. And it will take place with a narrower range of participants and the representatives of the Bosnian sides will meet to discuss confidence building measures. That is it will be a meeting with limited aims.
