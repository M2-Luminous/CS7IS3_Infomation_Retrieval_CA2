The sovereignty of Ukraine, to which Crimea has belonged since the 1956, and internal stability in the region are of paramount importance for peace and normal developments in Eastern Europe, the statement reads. In its bilateral relations with Ukraine the Czech Republic seeks to support and strengthen the democratic system and the transition to a market economy in Ukraine, it says. Russian-Ukrainian talks are currently underway on sharing the Black Sea Fleet and defusing tension over the Crimea. The political leadership of Crimea last week adopted a new constitution loosening ties with Kiev and moving towards realignment with Russia. There is a sizable Russian majority in Crimea, which was formerly administered by Russia.
