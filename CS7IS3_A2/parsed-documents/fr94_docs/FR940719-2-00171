FR940719-2-00171 FR940719-2-00103 Thursday May 19, 1994 Part III Federal Emergency Management Agency Continuation of Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 Methodology To Establish Fee for Services To Support FEMA's Offsite Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Activities; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 96␣/␣Thursday, May 19, 1994␣/␣Notices FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Continuation of Fiscal Year (FY) 1993 Methodology To Establish Fee for Services To Support FEMA's Offsite Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Activities AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The methodology established by FEMA's interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1993 (58 FR 35770), for assessing and collecting fees from U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees for services provided by FEMA personnel for FEMA's REP Program will continue in effect for FY 1994. DATES: The continuation of the methodology established by the interim rule, 44 CFR part 354, is effective for FY 1994 (October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1994). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda H. Vasta, Chief, Regulatory Services Coordination Unit, Preparedness, Training, and Exercises Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;4570. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As authorized by Public Law 103&hyph;124 (107 Stat. 1297), a fee will be charged to NRC licensees of commercial nuclear power plants for all site-specific and generic services provided by FEMA for FEMA's REP program. The policy and administrative basis for determining the fee was specified in FEMA's interim rule, 44 CFR part 354. All funds collected under this rule will be deposited in the U.S. Department of the Treasury to offset appropriated funds obligated by FEMA for its REP Program. The hourly user fee rate for FEMA personnel is established on the basis of the methodology set forth in the referenced FEMA interim rule at 44 CFR 354.4(a), ``Determination of costs for FEMA personnel,'' and will be used to assess and collect fees for site-specific and generic services rendered by FEMA personnel during FY 1994. The methodology provides for the determination of the exact FEMA personnel hourly rate for any FY at the completion of that FY. FEMA will issue a user fee billing for the first half of FY 1994. Since, as described above, the determination of the exact FEMA personnel hourly rate for a FY cannot be calculated until the end of that FY, FEMA will use the FY 1993 hourly user fee rate of $122.88 for this mid-year billing. Any billing adjustments necessary after calculating the actual hourly rate will be made after the end of FY 1994. This hourly rate applies to charges for services provided by FEMA personnel, not charges for services provided by FEMA contractors. Charges for actual costs of contractor services will be in accordance with the interim rule at 44 CFR 354.4(b), except for generic contractor charges, for the recovery of appropriated funds obligated for the Emergency Management Planning and Assistance portion of FEMA's REP Program budget. The interim rule methodology precludes the assessment of generic contractor charges under part 354.4(b) until the end of the Fiscal Year. Charges under 44 CFR 354.4(c) will be assessed and adjusted, if necessary, at the end of the Fiscal Year. James Lee Witt, Director.
