This was stated by Colonel General Vyacheslav Trubnikov, first deputy director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS]. "In reality the creation of nuclear weapons in our country came as a result of the efforts of our science, of such outstanding representatives of which as Kurchatov, Khariton, Zeldovich, and many others. The atomic bomb is no simple device you can steal a look at somewhere and then copy it back home. Had not our science come close to unraveling the secrets of the nucleus, it would simply not have been able to understand and appreciate the information on the range of nuclear problems that our intelligence service was obtaining," the general underlined. Vyacheslav Trubnikov pointed out that the role of the Foreign Intelligence Service in assuring Russia's security is very appreciable although it is not always in the public eye. He also thinks that "the tendencies of world development are on the whole favorable for our country, while the spectrum of threats still remains rather broad." In his words, the Russian intelligence service stands up well to "competition" from such recognized leaders of world spying as the U.S. CIA, the Israeli Mosad, and the secret service of Great Britain: "We have always been in this league and, one would like to believe, will always remain in it." There he stressed: "Were the personnel of our "competition" in the sort of conditions the Russian intelligence service is at the moment, few would stand up to them. Ours carry on serving and will serve!"
