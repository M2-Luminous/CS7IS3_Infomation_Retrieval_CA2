FR940523-2-00046 FR940523-2-00026 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;237&hyph;000] Arkansas Gas Consumers v. Arkla Energy Resources Co.; Complaint May 17, 1994. Take notice that on May 9, 1994, Arkansas Gas Consumers (AGC), filed a complaint against Arkla Energy Resources (AERCo). AGC states that this complaint pertains to the unjust and unreasonable gas accounting practices and imbalance resolution procedures which AERCo has enforced on its system since the implementation of restructuring on September 1, 1993. AGC states that the practices and procedures are premised on the mistaken belief that a business transaction occurs between a pipeline and its customer whenever the customer's projection of its daily gas use is later shown to have differed from its actual gas use for that day. AGC requests the Commission to find (1) That AERCo's existing imbalance resolution methodology is unjust, unreasonable and void ab initio as applied to customers who receive their gas from paper pools rather than actual physical supply sources; and (2) that AERCo's methodology should be replaced with a new procedure consistent with the principles. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214 and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 16, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before June 16, 1994. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12479 Filed 5&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
