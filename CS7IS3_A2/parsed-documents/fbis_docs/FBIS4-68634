Sadraddinbekov: "Civil Aviation Development Program Set"] [Text] "The Decree `On Development of Azerbaijan's Civil Aviation,' issued by the republic Cabinet of Ministers, envisages the appropriation of credit to further improve the quality of the republic's civil aviation and bring it up to world standards," Maksud Asadov, director of Baku air transportation company (BTA) AZAL-AVIA, said in an interview to EKONOMIKA AZERBAYDZHANA. He said that the development program covers the period through the year 2005 and includes, in particular, upgrading AZAL airline flying stock by adding such new airliners as the Boeing-707, Boeing-757, and Tu-154M. An agreement has been reached with the American aviation company ALG (Aviation Leasing Group) to deliver aircraft of the Boeing family to Baku. Flight crews and technical personnel of the AZAL company are currently undergoing internship training in Dallas and Miami (the United States). The training is conducted by specialists from the Buffalo Airways airline. M. Asadov also reported that from 5 May to 6 June AZAL is planning to implement the Hajj-94 program, which envisages taking pilgrims to the holy places of Jeddah and Mecca. The expected profit from this is about $1 million. "The problem of nonpayments between the AZAL airline and partner enterprises in CIS countries is aggravating the problem of deliveries of spare parts, components, and systems needed for aviation equipment to function normally." Maksud Asadov noted an increased frequency of instances of delays in money transfers. According to M. Asadov, the airline's existing clearing accounts in a number of CIS cities also operate unsatisfactorily. In addition, in airports of some CIS cities where the Azerbaijani airline's aircraft fly, payment for technical service of the aircraft is sometimes demanded in cash, which is practically impossible. There are also a number of problems with respect to capital construction. For instance, construction work has been suspended on a new airport complex and a new take-off and landing strip, which is being rebuilt by specialists from the German concern Wirtgen. With respect to the latter project the airline owes the German company 3 million German marks.
