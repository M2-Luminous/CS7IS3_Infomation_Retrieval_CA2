[Al-Tijani] In fact we just had normal differences. We did not want them to be publicized by the press. We in the Sudanese Communist Party [SCP] have nothing to say to the press on the difference of views among the NDG factions. However, I am willing to explain some facts if you ask me about them. [AL-WAFD] Ummah Party says that the NDG's higher coordination committee is controlled by the left and that it is not an effective democratic instrument that enlivens the opposition's and the NDG's performance. [Al-Tijani] I believe that it is unthinkable to accuse the SCP of controlling the NDG's coordination committee, which includes representatives from Ummah Party, the Democratic Unionist Party [DUP], the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM], the legitimate command of the armed forces, Southern Sudan Political Association [SSPA], and the Sudanese National Party [SNP], in addition to other independent figures. Accusing the left or any other party of controlling the committee would be an underestimation of all these partisan bodies. All these parties are independent and control their own decisions; they make the decisions they believe serve their interests and views as well as the interests of the Sudanese people and the collective struggle to overthrow the National Islamic Front [NIS] regime. How then can we conceive of the left, represented by one party, the SCP, as controlling all the other parties that are represented in the coordination committee? The SCP does not have the necessary enormous funds, does not have many masses--as Ummah Party puts it--and does not have the military power. Hence, the allegation that it controls the committee is inconsistent with reality. The SCP cannot afford to dictate any decision to the legitimate leadership. The same thing applies to the DUP, the SPLM, and all the rest. [AL-WAFD] Last week the Ummah Party put forward an integrated plan to restructure and reorganize the NDG and the coordination committee. What do you think of that plan? [Al-Tijani] No one denies the need to structure the NDG. The issue has been under consideration since 1991 and it is being discussed at every single NDG meeting. The Ummah Party did not put forward any plans in this connection until last April, and their plan was not complete. However, we believe that this issue will not benefit the Sudanese struggle if it is published in the press. The public who read the press cannot alter the problem, unless they stage demonstrations in front of party headquarters. But that is impossible in view of the conditions Sudanese opposition activity experiences at present. Hence, it would have been better to discuss these issues among the parties to reach a final decision that all the parties concerned approve in a democratic manner. As matter of fact, a committee that was formed in the NDG discussed a large number of proposals put forward by all political forces. The committee worked out recommendations and forwarded them to the NDG and the coordination committee to be decided on at the NDG's 5th congress. There is no disagreement on the need to restructure the NDG. We, as a Communist Party, put forward a plan to the coordination committee along with the plans submitted by the other parties. The fact that the coordination committee has failed to resolve this issue since September 1991 shows that this problem may be "lopsided"--that is, this structure may favor a certain policy. If there is no clear policy, it is difficult to imagine the structure. The election of the coordination committee chairman or secretary general, for example, and the formation of ad hoc committees should be preceded by outlines of the usefulness and political tasks of these new bodies. There should be an agreement among all parties on the policies that these bodies will follow. Conversely, the parties may decide to restructure the NDG first and then agree on the political tasks. This is no problem. What counts is that the structuring should be linked to the policies that the NDG is supposed to follow. We, as a Communist Party, have no objections to any restructuring of the NDG on which the parties agree. We make no conditions other than regarding the persons who will fill the posts. [AL-WAFD] What do you mean by "conditions" about persons. Do you mean that you are opposed to certain persons? [Al-Tijani] We are not opposed to certain names or persons, but we have legitimate questions about the "president" and the qualifications he must meet. I believe that we should reach an agreement in advance on the president or secretary general, whoever they may be. [AL-WAFD] From the political point of view, how would you explain the reasons the Ummah Party raised the issue of "restructuring the NDG" at this time? [Al-Tijani] We believe that this issue should not be discussed in the newspapers. The person who first raised this issue in the newspapers should bear the responsibility. I do not believe that any political forces anywhere in the world would broach such a sensitive and serious issue in the newspapers. We, as the Sudanese opposition, are members of one committee and one grouping. We all agree on the need to solve the issue of restructuring the NDG. I believe that raising the issue in the newspapers is not in the interest of the NDG nor will it help solve the issue of restructuring. [AL-WAFD] Now that the SPLM has declared a "New Sudan" in the south, how does the Communist Party view the significance of this declaration? What about the SPLM's continued membership in the NDG, particularly since certain people interpret the declaration as being tantamount to the secession of southern Sudan? [Al-Tijani] First, as far as we know, the SPLM is not a secessionist movement; its leader has stated more than once that his favorite option is a unified, democratic, secular Sudan. Garang has stated this stance more than once. I believe that Garang is not a separatist, but a unionist. Regarding the plan submitted at the SPLM congress, we have not yet received the text of that plan. However, we do know that the SPLM is in control of certain areas in southern Sudan. They want to run a civil administration in that area. This is their right and it does not mean a step toward secession. This is my view, according to the information I have so far received. [Text] [AL-WAFD] In the light of all these changes, how do you view the future of the NDG? Will it overcome its crisis or will the Sudanese opposition embark on other organizational courses? [Al-Tijani] The NDG was formed of parties and forces with their own differences. These differences come to the surface from time to time, but it was possible to resolve most of them during the past four years. We in the NDG have agreed on a formula not only to bring down the regime, but also to solve the chronic government crisis in Sudan on the basis of an agreement reached by all the Sudanese parties and forces. This agreement constitutes part of the NDG charter, its program, and resolutions. We think that the majority of the Sudanese people accept and support the NDG formula. There is no doubt that we in the opposition will strengthen our unity and cohesion. The NDG will remain in the field as an instrument for the Sudanese opposition, whether some people agree or not. We are confident that the great majority of the NDG forces are satisfied with it and its representational capacity and are ready to work together to bring down the NIF. Whoever works for the good of the people will survive, but the scum will disappear. Mutual consent is the solution. [AL-WAFD] Finally, do you think it would be useful to hold a meeting between the Communist Party and the Ummah Party to discuss their problems? [AL-Tijani] We held regular, scheduled meetings with the Ummah Party less than a month ago. We discussed many of the issues of interest to the NDG and the whole country. If differences have emerged, they should not provoke insults. This is something that we do not approve of. Democracy recognizes differences of views. We respect the right of the Ummah Party to defend its views by democratic means. We also ask it in return to respect our views and not to insult us. We have not insulted anyone, but expressed our views. We may disagree, but we do not insult anyone. We express our views frankly and boldly, while at the same time expressing our readiness to meet half way with any force that we disagree with. We think that decisions in the NDG must be reached through mutual consent. The NDG was established on this basis. When the NDG was established, the parties in it had differences of views. Even the SPLM and the Ummah Party, which used to fight each other, are now in the same grouping. Differences do exist, and we cannot disregard them, nor can we resolve them over night. The only solution is for us to achieve mutual consent on all decisions we make for the good of the Sudanese people.
