Lien is the first incumbent premier from the ROC to visit New York since Taipei and Washington severed diplomatic ties in 1979. Previously, Lien was only allowed to make transit stops in Los Angeles or Miami on his way to Central American countries. Lien and his wife arrived in New York at 7:55 P.M. Lien said his New York tour is purely for private purposes. ROC Vice Foreign Minister Fang Chin-yen, who accompanied the premier on his Mexican tour, also traveled to New York with Lien. On hand to greet the Liens at the airport were Ding Mou-shih, ROC representative in the United States, and Natale Bellocchi, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, the unofficial conduit for US-Taiwan ties. Lien will stay in New York for two days. ROC officials stationed here said Lien is here for a family reunion with his two children who are studying at Columbia University. "We have not arranged any public activities for Lien during his stay here," the officials said. Lien just wrapped up a groundbreaking visit to Mexico where he reportedly met with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and many other senior Mexican officials to discuss ways to promote bilateral commercial and tourist exchanges. Lien reportedly also met with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who will represent Mexico's ruling party in the country's forthcoming presidential election. Lien was the highest-ranking ROC official to visit Mexico since the two countries cut diplomatic ties in 1971. ROC Government Spokesman Jason Hu, who flew to Los Angeles Sunday after accompanying Lien on his official visits to El Salvador and Guatemala, would not confirm whether Lien had met with the Mexican president. Hu instead said Lien "satisfactorily accomplished his goals as expected" during his two-day stay in Mexico. "Albeit unofficial, Lien's Mexican visit was fruitful and laid a solid foundation for future cooperation between the two countries," he noted. Quoting Foreign Ministry officials who accompanied Lien on his Mexican tour, Hu said Lien had reached consensus with Mexican officials on a number of programs to promote bilateral exchanges. Among others, the Mexican Government will send a trade mission to Taiwan later this month to court Taiwan investors. Lien will leave here Thursday and is scheduled to return to Taipei Saturday, ending his four-country tour.
