However, I have noticed -- as I mentioned on several occasions -- that polarization has occurred between the Arnulfista Party [PA] and the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD]. The data we are seeing tonight confirms this once more. The data likewise confirms that the fake polls that were being announced were in fact rigged, and that they were aimed at building up two candidates. We can see whose figures are very low, while the PA figures are competing with the PRD figures. [Reporter] Do you believe the PA is going to win? [Moscoso] Of course we are going to win. [Reporter] If you lose, will you concede defeat? [Moscoso] Pardon me? [Reporter] If the PRD happens to win, will you concede defeat? [Moscoso] First, I believe that I am going to win. If such a possibility exists, however, what we want is a calm and peaceful country. I believe that Panama experienced 21 years of uncertainty, so if the PRD wins -- if the TE and the National Vote-Counting Board confirm this -- we will recognize its victory. [Reporter] The Christian Democratic Party [PDC] candidate has conceded defeat. [Moscoso] He already has? [Reporter] Yes. [Moscoso] I had not heard that, but I think that it is still too early to recognize the victory of another candidate. [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya. If you win the elections, what would be your government's number one priority? [Moscoso] I have already said that if an announcement is made tonight that we have won the elections I will call for national reconciliation by all Panamanians, all political parties, including the PRD, the good people who are in the PRD too. This would be my priority. [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya: According to the figures being provided by the TE, the PRD is currently in the lead. On what do you base your optimism? How do you plan to take the lead? [Moscoso] There are many votes still left to be counted, especially votes from the interior of the Republic, and I am leading there, in the interior. [Reporter] There is a forecast of [words indistinct]. [Moscoso] No, not yet. I think that should be left up to the TE. [Reporter] The TE maintains its ban on mobilizations and demonstrations until the final official returns are in. Regarding the activities under way by both the PRD and the PA, isn't this a violation of the TE rules? [Moscoso] No. I think they are doing the right thing. If results are announced now by anyone other than the TE, it would be premature. People would take to the streets. We have to wait for the results to be announced by the National Vote-Counting Board. If the results that are announced now are not the same as those that are going to be announced by the National Vote-Counting Board we might find ourselves in a huge bind. I think it is best for us to wait. I agree with this. [Reporter] Due to the heated emotions of both PRD and PA sympathizers, don't you think this is inadvisable? As the evening wears on, people get more keyed up. In the event of a defeat, wouldn't these people take to the streets denouncing an alleged fraud? [Moscoso] For the first time in many years, we have a TE that everyone knows is made up of very honorable persons. I believe that now in Panama no one is going to scream fraud. We are not going to do this. I don't know if the PRD would scream fraud if they were to lose. Perhaps so, but there is not going to be a fraud. These elections have been clean, honest, and whoever wins will be the president of Panama. It is true that right now our fellow party members are there, downstairs, but they are dancing, they are calm. Instead of taking to the streets, I would rather they stay here than go out on the streets late at night. That would be dangerous.
