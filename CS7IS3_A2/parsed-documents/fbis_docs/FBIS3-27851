Eda and Abe said they will join the Sakigake-JNP group in the next regular Diet session due to open Monday. The two men expressed their intentions in a meeting of legislators belonging to the parliamentary group. To pursue the new political alliance, Eda and Abe on Saturday left a parliamentary group comprised of members of the USDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the leading component in the ruling coalition. The USDP, formed in March 1978 after bolting from the SDP, holds four seats in the powerful House of Representatives. Another USDP lower house member, Naoto Kan, has already joined the Sakigake-JNP. Yanosuke Narazaki, the other lower house legislator, is expected to remain in the SDP-USDP group to maintain ties between the two parties. Hideo Den, the USDP's only upper house member, left the party Monday. The USDP joined six other parties last August to form the coalition government, ousting the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from a 38-year grip on power. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, meanwhile, said Saturday that his own JNP will not merge with Sakigake in the next regular Diet session as initially envisioned. Hosokawa said in a news conference after Diet approval of the government's political reform package that there would not be any problem if the two parties do not rush to get together. A top official of Sakigake, headed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, also denied the possibility of the two parties' early merger.
