"Becoming a member of the EU would without doubt be advantageous to Norwegian security," Solli said in an interview with AFTENPOSTEN. "It is true that we are members of NATO, but if we look at developments inside the alliance, I think it would be an advantage from the point of view of security to have stronger ties to the European pillar within NATO." After a year as supreme commander in northern Norway Lieutenant General Arne Solli was yesterday appointed the new defense chief to succeed Admiral Torolf Rein. The timing of the government appointment came as a surprise, even though it has been clear for some time that Solli was a strong candidate. Even though the government has made the appointment now, the changeover will not take place until 31 October. The future defense chief made it clear that he does not want to be used by either side in any controversial domestic political showdown on the EU issue. He was therefore unwilling to touch on all the advantages and disadvantages of Norwegian EU membership. On the other hand it would be remarkable if Norway's top professional soldier did not have views about what he thinks best serves Norway's security interests. But if Norway does not become a member of the EU after the referendum? "Yes, well, then we will just have to make the best of the situation," Solli said. "We would still be a member of NATO and relations with the United States will always be important to us, whether or not we are a member of the EU. The problem is that we could be left standing outside forums where important decisions that will have a direct effect on us are reached." The next defense chief said that he has held talks with U.S. military authorities which he described as "good" and in which he met with "understanding" for Norway's defense problems. "I think that the Americans have given us good signals recently that they take defense cooperation with Norway seriously. I take the outcome of the COB [Colocated Operating Base] negotiations as support for my view on this point," he said. But will the United States continue to have defense interests in the northern regions now that its former rival is no more? "I agree that we do not need to conjure up the image of an opponent who no longer exists. However, neither can we ignore the fact that we are living in an unstable international situation. Changes could take place, and they could take place quickly. We must therefore have a potential to defend ourselves and bring reinforcements into the country," the future defense chief said. He believes that EU membership will give even greater security. And in addition membership will open up new perspectives for the defense of the Nordic area. "I am thinking here of the longer-term perspectives which open up here if Sweden and Finland also join the EU," Solli said. He believes that in such a situation it would be logical to coordinate defense policy and defense plans on a Nordic basis. But here realizes that there is some way to go before this happens. "This is a nonissue today. For neither Sweden nor Finland have given any signals in this direction, but it could become an issue if all three countries become members of the EU," Solli said. He takes the view that the country's defense chief has a duty to an play active role in providing information about the state of the country's defenses and about his view of current defense problems. He thinks that the current defense chief, Torolf Rein, has been good in this respect, but he expressed regrets that it is not always easy to attract the attention of the media despite the efforts made. Solli believes that the defense leadership should not abandon the concept of "anti-invasion defenses" even though some people have urged this. "No, I think that we should keep the concept," he said. "It describes our capacity to meet and attack with a united force and with action by all three branches of the defense forces. The concept will continue to have validity in the future. We must use all the means at our disposal to try to make anti-invasion defenses in northern Norway a reality. The problem today is acquiring the money that is needed," he said.
