FR940512-0-00023 FR940512-0-00010 40 CFR Part 52 [MO 15&hyph;1&hyph;6333; FRL&hyph;4883&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; State of Missouri AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The purpose of this revision to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) is to include the lead nonattainment areas into the existing new source review (NSR) program. This revision changes the applicability requirements by changing the definition of nonattainment area in the state regulations to include lead nonattainment areas, and to delete the Kansas City area as a nonattainment area in light of its attainment of the ozone standard. In this document EPA takes final action on a limited approval, because Missouri has not yet submitted to EPA augmented new source permit rules which meet the amended requirements of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on June 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the EPA, Air Branch, 726 Minnesota Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101; the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Air Pollution Control Program, Jefferson State Office Building, 205 Jefferson Street, Jefferson City, Missouri 65101; and the EPA Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Lambrechts at (913) 551&hyph;7846. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 4, 1994, EPA proposed a rulemaking to approve the three Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing Missouri NSR program. The objective of this final rulemaking is to approve the three Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing NSR program in Missouri. This SIP revision contains the amendments to the SIP defining three areas in Missouri as nonattainment for lead. This SIP revision is also being accorded limited approval because it does not meet all of the applicable requirements of the Act. 1 As of April 6, 1994, Missouri submitted NSR provisions intended to address the limited approval, and EPA is currently reviewing this latest submittal. The limited approval strengthens the existing SIP as representing an improvement over what is currently in the SIP, and as meeting some of the applicable requirements of the Act. In particular, the amendment means that Missouri's NSR requirements, which meet all of the provisions of the preamended Act, apply to new and modified sources of lead in the nonattainment areas. 1 EPA may grant such a limited approval under section 110(k)(3) of the Act, in light of the general authority delegated to EPA under section 301(a) of the Act to take actions necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act. In 1978, when EPA promulgated the lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard, it was not authorized to designate areas nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA was authorized to require states to designate areas as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. On November 6, 1991, at 56 FR 56694, EPA designated the following areas as nonattainment for lead: the city of Herculaneum in Jefferson County; and the Dent, Liberty and Arcadia townships in Iron County. No comments were received in response to the proposal. For a complete discussion of the state submittal, the reader is directed to the proposed Federal Register document at 59 FR 5370. EPA Action In this document, EPA takes final action on the rulemaking to provide limited approval of the incorporation of three Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing NSR program in Missouri. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal/state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 11, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
