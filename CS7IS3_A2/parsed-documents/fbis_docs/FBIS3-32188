Serge Gilles today expressed opposition to the sanctions on Haiti in the form of a total embargo, said that he considered it an erroneous approach by the international community that will only aggravate the sufferings of the people. In a statement to the Agence France-Presse, Gilles pointed out that based on what he saw within the country, the suffering of the people was increasing dramatically. The embargo did not create the structural misery in Haiti, he said, but it has multiplied this misery six or seven times. The increase in the rate of child mortality and the destruction of production capacity are palpable facts, Serge Gilles pointed out, adding that those who are motivated by those sanctions are doing well at the expense of the people. Mr. Gilles advocated the search for a consensus through a national conference, excluding no one, with a view toward forming first a government of national concord. It should be recalled, according to some independent humanitarian religious sources, that the embargo against Haiti, imposed in October 1991, has caused the deaths of more than 10,000 people in vulnerable groups, mostly children and the elderly.
