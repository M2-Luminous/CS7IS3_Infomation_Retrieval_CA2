The Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs today released the documents produced by the last regional seminar on this subject, which was held in Santiago last September. The report stresses that each country must establish a national authority that will prohibit in their respective territories or in any place under their control the existence of chemical weapons, trade in elements for their manufacturing, or research to develop this kind of war materiel. The documents point out that countries like Argentina, Cuba, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela are concerned with preventing impediments to economic and technological development in the area, and with establishing solid bases for trade in chemical substances not suitable for war use.
