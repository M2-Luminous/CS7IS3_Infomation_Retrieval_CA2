Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and standing committee member of the CPC Political Bureau, made a speech on behalf of the CPC central leading body and the Central Military Commission. Liu's speech emphasized two main points: First, accelerating the development of modern weaponry by relying mainly on China's own strength, and second, opposing hegemonism and power politics and promoting the establishment of the new international political and economic order. Liu Huaqing said: Along with the increase in our economic strength, we must accelerate the modernization of the armed forces. Relying mainly on our own efforts, we should develop a number of deterrent weapons for the ground, naval, and air forces, including some modern weapons that even the Western countries do not possess. Our purpose is to defend ourselves more effectively, to resist the military threats from hegemonism, and to guarantee our socialist construction and our people's peaceful lives and work. Liu added: The experience of the Chinese people shows that a nation's independence is most valuable, but China will not be able to stand firm without the backing of modern military strength and may be bullied and pressured by hegemonism. China will always stand on the side of the Third World, and will never seek hegemony or world leadership [bu dang tou 0008 3981 7333]. However, we will play our role as we should in international affairs, and will actively promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order. We fear no one; neither will we offend anyone. First, we do not fear the interference of U.S. hegemonism and power politics in our internal affairs, and do not fear its intimidation [e zha 6073 6094] and sanctions. China will never yield to the hegemonist practice of the United States. Since its founding, the PRC -- growing from weakness to strength -- has never been daunted by any military threats, sanctions, isolation, or subversive plots, and has never bartered away its state sovereignty and national dignity in the face of hegemonism and power politics. Liu Huaqing said: The whole Army is well aware that state sovereignty and national security are always of primary importance for us. U.S. hegemonism now takes China as its main enemy, and tries to interfere in China's internal affairs. Who has given them such power? Have the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army ever yielded to hegemonism at any time? Hegemonism acts simply on the basis of its comparatively greater national and military strength. Today, however, in the 1990's, China has learned how to deal with the intimidation, bullying pressure, subversive attempts, and challenges from hegemonism and power politics. Liu Huaqing further stated: The leaders of our party and state -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Vice Premier Qian Qichen -- have given explicit and firm messages to the United States: China will never tolerate foreign interference in its internal affairs and will never barter away its principles. China will not seek confrontation, but will not fear confrontation and will not evade any imposed confrontation. If the United States severs relations with China, China still will be able to develop further. It also was said that Jiang Zemin, chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission, had issued orders to commend 58 military and national defense scientific research and production units, as well as more than 250 individuals in the military and national defense scientific research units, who had made contributions to the successful development of some modern military equipment, 38 of which reached the contemporary advanced level in the world. Ten types of weapons were the most advanced in the world.
