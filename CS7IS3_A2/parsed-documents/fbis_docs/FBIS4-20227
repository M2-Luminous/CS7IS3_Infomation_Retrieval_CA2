Before analyzing the economic crisis, the impetus to autonomy, the democratic impetus, and Europe, Gonzalez laid down his stance on former Bank of Spain Governor Mariano Rubio and former Civil Guard Director General Luis Roldan. "I wish to lay down the government's stance on the accusations of corruption which have appeared over the past few weeks, creating an atmosphere of great concern among the public. In the election campaign, we promised to act vigorously and energetically against the corruption cases which might arise, trying to remove from public life those people who through their conduct did not deserve the trust placed in them. We also want the law to act with due dispatch to clarify matters which may be criminal and correspondingly to elucidate responsibilities.... ``The government, fully accepting its responsibilities, deems it essential to tackle these problems and restore social confidence. It is true that we are experiencing an atmosphere of distrust, and even the danger of disaffection with democratic values, weakening the ability to meet the challenges of the crisis. In the case of the former Civil Guard director general, a committee of enquiry has been set up in parliament. We have handed over the material which will make it possible to clarify the matters which are the committee's purpose, and so we will act in any case that arises. We hope that with the utmost dispatch it will reach conclusions which will enable us to see clearly the problems reported in parliament's proper sphere. At the same time, the law will elucidate whatever responsibilities there were, and the tax inspectorate has been acting, gentlemen, to the same end over the past few months.... "The setting up of another committee for the case of the former Bank of Spain governor has also been requested by several parliamentary groups, including our own. In this matter, too, we have acted promptly and vigorously. I regard this case as extremely important, and deem myself directly concerned by it in having proposed his appointment and having supported the former governor's honor at the time of the Ibercorps crisis. We have tried unsuccessfully to induce the former governor to explain to the public whether the accusations leveled against him are true or not, whether or not he kept money concealed, whether or not he fulfilled his tax obligations, and so forth. Not even his appearance before the Economy and Finance Committee last Friday, which we ourselves requested, has served to clarify his conduct." Elucidate Responsibilities "At the same time, we have urged the government attorney's office to act immediately, having placed all the material and human resources at its disposal, and we have set the tax inspectorate to work to investigate thoroughly and elucidate responsibilities in its proper sphere. I must inform the house that even before this parliament began its proceedings, the government attorney's office and the tax inspectorate had already done so. ``We deem it desirable to improve the conditions and the legal and instrumental resources to combat the phenomenon of corruption in the rule-of-law state in which we live. So we are not only prepared to amend this house's standing orders in order to facilitate the investigation of these matters; we will introduce, as we have promised, some changes in the rules, and are willing to study the proposals which the groups may make. ``In the first place, we will propose amending the law on the National Audit Office in order to widen its area of responsibility and to increase the office's means of monitoring and oversight. ``Second, we will immediately introduce a more complete and strict classification of conduct connected with corruption offenses and greater severity in the penalties to be imposed in amending the penal code. ``Third, we will increase efficiency in the judicial response through procedural reforms. ``Fourth, we will propose setting up a special attorney's office charged with prosecuting economic and corruption offenses. ``Fifth, we will set up a specific group in the General Directorate of the State Legal Service, charged with defending the public treasury's interests by taking part in any judicial proceedings for offenses of this nature. ``To this must be added the plan to amend the General Budget Law, which will strengthen economic and financial oversight of the public sector through mechanisms which will make possible greater effectiveness in the examination of the Auditor General's Office's audits and, where appropriate, elucidating the corresponding political and administrative responsibilities. These proposals are strengthened by the strong social condemnation of corruption.'' Economic Crisis "Trend Reversed" ``In this period, the government's activity as a whole has pursued as its main aim surmounting the crisis with a view to job creation.... Achieving this aim requires emerging from the economic crisis which has affected Spain and the whole of Europe over the past two years, and also emerging from it vigorously and confidently.... ``During the past nine months, the recessionary trend has been reversed, thanks to our economy's ability to respond, the efforts of many employers and workers, and, overall, the appropriate policy which we have been implementing.... ``The Budgets Law, the Fiscal and Financial Measures Law, and the package of reforms of the labor market are the most important measures of the past nine months.... ``Our exchange rate has been put at levels more consistent with our economy's basic characteristics.... Interest rates...have fallen by over 5 percent.... ``With respect to inflation,...this year's figures are encouraging.... The public deficit showed considerable strains in 1992, was very high in 1993, and is forecast to remain high in 1994.... ``(Foreign investment) will remain here insofar as conditions of competitiveness are right.... ``The social security pensions system is viable, makes it possible to fund current pensions, and will also make it possible to fund future pensions....'' Impetus Autonomous Communities "We have now spent a good number of years in the process of building them; a dynamic process which has changed the distribution of power and the exercise of political activity in our country. It is a process which neither can nor should stop, but one in which it is perfectly desirable and possible to move forward if we are guided by loyalty, territorial balance, and solidarity. The aim is a more decentralized, more effective state, closer to citizens -- a state of autonomous communities -- with which to face the 21st century. ``...The government's proposal (on the implementation of autonomy) is meant to take shape in a joint interpretation of the [autonomy] statutes, which, within the framework of the consequent bilateral relations and the Constitutional Court's jurisprudence, will make it possible to define by mutual agreement the scope of the sections on powers contained in the statutes.'' Democracy "All the other groups (except the People's Party) have proposed to this house the election of a candidate for the post of ombudsman; a proposal which, as you gentlemen know, will be voted on next week. If the People's Party group's (blocking) stance changes, and this election goes through, we will be able immediately and with the greatest possible agreement to set about filling the other vacancies in the institutional bodies, including the Spanish Radio and Television System board. ``However, if the current situation continues, the government will immediately propose to the parliamentary groups that we start studying amending the legal rules, with the aim, while always ensuring a high level of agreement, of surmounting the insurmountable obstacle posed by a political party's deciding to practice an institutional blockage.'' Europe "Our Viewpoint Counts" ``The entry into force of the treaty on European union, the approval of the European initiative on growth and employment, the white paper on growth, competitiveness, and employment, and the negotiations on the Union's enlargement are developments which decisively influence Spanish life. ``Our future as a country is linked to the European Union's future, and we will therefore continue to strive to ensure that the political project of integration develops effectively for the whole, but also satisfactorily for Spanish interests.... ``We must continue with our task of convergence with the other countries in Economic and Monetary Union.... The fact that some doubts about timetables or dates have arisen should be no cause for concern.... ``No country is able today to surmount the economic crisis in isolation. In an interdependent world such as ours, the solution to the crisis must necessarily be a European solution.... In order to adopt a policy of economic revival, to take decisions on the major infrastructures which must be tackled in the future, and in order to design policies such as environmental policy, the European sphere is a more appropriate sphere than the national spheres. Spain aims increasingly not just to be in Europe but to count in Europe, and to play the role which befits it as one of the major European countries.... Our viewpoint counts increasingly in Europe....''
