In his statement to reporters at Surcin airport, Papoulias said the Bosnian crisis would be the first problem to be discussed at an informal EU meeting on 26 and 27 March. He did not specify whether he brought any proposals to Belgrade, but said: "I am here to make a contribution to the peace process in the capacity of the chairman of the European Council, but also as foreign minister of Greece, which is directly interested in the Balkan problem." Asked what was happening with the EU proposal after the Washington agreement had been signed, Papoulias did not give a direct answer, but replied that the latest EU activities had been discussed at the latest session of the EU Council of Ministers. "I would like to convince you that the EU will be actively present in the upcoming developments," he said. Asked whether the EU was upset about the United States having monopolized the issue, Papoulias said "we are not upset, but in any case, we want to remain present at the scene, together with powers such as the United States and Russia." According to him, nobody "must forget the EU's contribution so far and the ideas of the EU's program of activities, which remain the most significant ideas at present," he stressed. Asked about possible deployment of Turkish troops in Bosnia, Papoulias said that all Balkan countries were interested in the problem, since they had said in the past that no forces from any of the Balkan countries must be sent into former Yugoslavia. Papoulias said if Turkey sends its units, Greece would also consider sending its forces.
