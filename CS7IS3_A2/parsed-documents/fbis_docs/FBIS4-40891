[Dashkovskyy] As everybody knows, the latest negotiations in Moscow on the division of the Black Sea Fleet did not produce any results. Negotiations between expert groups, at the level of naval commanders, have recently begun in Sevastopol. What position should Ukraine assume to avoid the role of a "younger sister," and simultaneously, to conclude previous agreements? [Kozhyn] Our state should stand on a position of parity and not allow Russian representatives to dictate their terms, because all military units deployed on Ukrainian territory belong to our state, and this relates to the Black Sea Fleet, first and foremost. When the fleet finally belongs to us not only de jure but also de facto, our goal will be for an appropriate Supreme Council commission to decide which commitments, concerning guarantees for security and inviolability of borders, Russia should undertake. Only after that is done will it be possible to talk about certain reasonable compromises. [Dashkovskyy] At a closed session of the Supreme Council, Leonid Kravchuk spoke in favor of transferring control of Sevastopol's naval base and onshore infrastructure to Russia... [Kozhyn] The president voiced his opinion on the situation, but the final decision is to be made by the Supreme Council. Personally, I am against such a transfer, because the one who rules Sevastopol and its naval base, dominates the Black Sea. Besides, everyone should respect international agreements. Soon after the 1991 Moscow putsch, during the official meeting of CIS heads of state in Belavezha, Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus signed an entire range of agreements, including one stating that every state is the sole owner of all property located on its territory, and one concerning the inviolability of borders. It is interesting how the world community would react if Moscow demanded that the Baykonur launch-site be divided between Russia and Kazakhstan?! Moreover, I generally stand for the gradual withdrawal (taking into account servicemen's problems) of Russian units from Ukrainian territory, including the Crimea. [Dashkovskyy] The maintenance of the Black Sea Fleet requires considerable expenditures, and particularly, the question of fuel arises under the current acute energy crisis. [Kozhyn] As everybody knows, almost 70 percent of maritime nation's fuel resources is spent on maintenance of navies. On the other hand, we must not go too far, because there are other important sectors. As of today, the balance is maintained -- state organizations allot funds, and moreover, the Black Sea Fleet is fully maintained by Ukraine. [Dashkovskyy] What, in your opinion, must be done to prevent a "Ukrainian Karabakh" from developing in the Crimea? [Kozhyn] I would not advise anyone to inflame passions surrounding the Crimea, which is currently being done quite successfully by the Russian media. The government's position should be weighed, but tough. When I was still the Navy commander, I warned the previous Supreme Council of possible dangerous consequences stemming from Crimean autonomy, and I insisted that this issue be revised. Since all problems must be resolved in a peaceful manner, I believe that the president must go to the Crimea. If Leonid Kravchuk does not do that in the near future, he will bear responsibility for any further developments. In my opinion, this is the last chance to preserve our independence, peace, and accord.
