Greeting all present in the name of the large delegation of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS], Federal Human Rights Minister Margit Savovic expressed the belief that the left wing in the republic of Srpska holds the future. It was emphasized that freedom, just peace, and the right to self-determination for the Serbian people are the fundamental program goals of this party which expects to become a significant political factor in the republic of Srpska in the coming period. [Dragan Ilic, president of the SPS in the republic of Srpska] The socialist ideal and the ideal of social justice has existed among these people for eons. Therefore, a political organization that embraces this idea, manifests it further politically, and places it at the service of the nation, had to appear. [Sasa Cudic, president of the Alliance of the Young Socialists in the republic of Srpska] Above all I would emphasize that the strengthening of the SPS in the republic of Srpska has resulted in the strengthening of its progeny -- the Young Socialists. I would emphasize that young people on the territory of our republic during the war and in bleak times that have lasted for three years have had some difficult moments trying to find perspective for their lives. Summing up today's promotional gathering, I can single out several basic values: Just peace, freedom, democracy, and the unity of the Serbian people. [end recording]
