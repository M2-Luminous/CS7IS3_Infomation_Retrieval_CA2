[passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] Speaking about the current state of Croatian state policy, Franjo Tudjman had the following to say about relations with the Serbs: [Tudjman] ``As the head of the Croatian state, and assuming full responsibility, I declare here that they cannot count on such a policy [not further specified]. Croatia will try to do its utmost to integrate the occupied Croatian areas into Croatia's constitutional and legal system in a peaceful way on the basis of UN Security Council resolutions and the deployment of the peace forces. But, if this cannot be implemented within the current mandate of the peace forces, Croatia will use all means -- to which it is entitled as an internationally recognized and sovereign country -- to establish its constitutional and legal system on every inch of Croatian soil.'' [Correspondent] Speaking about Croatian state policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian president said that its continuity resulted in the Washington agreement, the implementation of which will contribute to improving Croatia's already good status in the world. [Tudjman] ``The Bosniak Muslims have no other way to survive in Europe than to rely on and ally themselves with the Croats. They have no other way to join democratic Western civilization than with the Croats. The Muslim leadership understood this, and this has made possible the end to the war and the agreement which, as I said, is in our interest, but also in the interests of the Muslims. It is therefore in the interest of the Croatian people and the Croatian state. This must be clear even to our Croat people who, in those terrible events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, first suffered huge losses inflicted by the Serb aggressor, and then in the war with the Muslims at the time when they were orientated towards the creation of their independent Muslim state.'' [Correspondent] President Franjo Tudjman also spoke about the attempt to create a parliamentary and government crisis in Croatia. He said: [Tudjman] ``Croatia's political pluralism has showed its maturity. Croatia will come out of this temporary parliamentary crisis stronger. The departure of a few deputies to another party will not dent its reputation. On the contrary, this will further reinforce democratic Croatia and prove the stability of our system, which has enabled us to achieve what we have achieved in establishing an independent Croatia and in the economy.''
