FBIS4-15034 "drsov066_b_94035" FBIS-SOV-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Military Issues Border Force General on Afghan Border Violations Border Force General on Afghan Border Violations LD0504172694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1602 GMT 5 Apr 94 LD0504172694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Last month Russian border guards detained 250 persons for illegally crossing the border. The total figure since the beginning of the year exceeds 900. This was disclosed in a Tuesday interview with INTERFAX by the chief of the information department of the Russian Border Force Major-General Aleksandr Manilov. He said that last month together with customs officials border guards seized over 120 kilos of drugs and 100 firearms in seven instances. Manilov said the situation remains worst on the Tajik-Afghan border where 18 attempts by militants to break through were foiled last March. Frontier posts and pickets came under fire 11 times, in three cases from the territory of Afghanistan. The general expects a rise in the activeness of militants on the border, primarily on the Pyandzh, Moskovsky and Horog sections, and a simultaneous rise in terrorism on the Tajik side of the frontier. If the talks between the Tajik Government and opposition fail, Manilov said, the so-called government in exile will evidently launch coordinated actions in the areas of Kalai-Hum, Horog and Ishkashim. Manilov described the situation on other sections of the border as "relatively stable".
