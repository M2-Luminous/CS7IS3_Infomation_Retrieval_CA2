Monzon and Josefina Itriago, has asked 21st Penal Court Judge Cibeliz Duran to investigate alleged illegal activities that may have prompted the eight banks in which the government has intervened to go bankrupt. The inquiry will not conflict with the 26th Penal Court's investigation because it will deal with the manner in which government financial assistance was used. Meanwhile, the Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property [TSS] has also initiated an investigation into alleged irregularities at the eight banks. The Superior Council of Judges must decide whether the case falls under the jurisdiction of the TSS or whether Judge Duran should hear the case.
