The eight-hour strike took place in 19 factories; the remaining 12 only put up flags, organized rallies, or had two to four hours of strike. The committee has announced that, if the government does not change its position, it will make the protest more radical. The government's view is that it did all it could, taking into account the budget situation, and that the strike "is proof of a lack of responsibility." Negotiations between the Interunion Strike Committee (which includes the National Section of the Arms Industry of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union "Solidarity," the Trade Union of the Electromachine Industry, and the "Metalworkers" Federation) and the government on 1 February did not result in an agreement. The trade unions are demanding, among other things, additional resources for restructurings, establishing the level of government orders to be such that it would guarantee maintaining the country's defense readiness (about 5.5 trillion zlotys), compensation in return for sustaining production readiness in case of war in 1990-93, salary increases that would compensate for price increases, and also securing preretirement pension benefits. "We are a country of hunger and neglect"--this is the way Stanislaw Glowacki, chief of the arms industry branch of "Solidarity," commented on the situation in the sector. The Industry and Trade Ministry said that, during the talks, the government "presented realistic budget and legal possibilities of implementing the postulates; it presented positive effects of the industry's restructuring. The government also showed that there are possibilities of increasing budget means for 1994 for the arms industry." The ministry also added that the trade unions "rejected an offer to sign a protocol of agreement and failed to come up with alternative possibilities of solving the problem, limiting themselves to revindication." The ministry said "forcing changes in the budget by means of strikes" is the kind of behavior that "indicates a lack of responsibility."
