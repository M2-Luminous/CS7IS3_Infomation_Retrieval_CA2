FR941202-1-00036 FR941202-1-00004 (3) * ␣9* ␣9* (i) In general. Any compensation paid under a plan or agreement approved by shareholders before December 20, 1993, is treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraphs (e) (3) and (4) of this section, provided that the directors administering the plan or agreement are disinterested directors and the plan was approved by shareholders in a manner consistent with Rule 16b&hyph;3(b), 17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(b), under the Exchange Act or Rule 16b&hyph;3(a) (17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(a) as contained in 17 CFR Part 240 to End, revised April 1, 1990). In addition, for purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section, a plan or agreement is treated as stating a maximum number of shares with respect to which an option or right may be granted to any employee if the plan or agreement that was approved by the shareholders provided for an aggregate limit, consistent with Rule 16b&hyph;3(b), 17 CFR 250.16b&hyph;3(b), on the shares of employer stock with respect to which awards may be made under the plan or agreement. (ii) * ␣9* ␣9* (B) The issuance of all employer stock or other compensation that has been allocated under the plan; or * * * * * (iii) Stock-based compensation. This paragraph (h)(3) will apply to any compensation received pursuant to the exercise of a stock option or stock appreciation right, or the substantial vesting of restricted property, granted under a plan or agreement described in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section if the grant occurs before the earliest of the dates specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section. (iv) * ␣9* ␣9* Example. Corporation Z adopted a stock option plan in 1991. Pursuant to Rule 16b&hyph;3 under the Exchange Act, the stock option plan has been administered by disinterested directors and was approved by Corporation Z shareholders. Under the terms of the plan, shareholder approval is not required again until 2001. In addition, the terms of the stock option plan include an aggregate limit on the number of shares available under the plan. Option grants under the Corporation Z plan are made with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of Corporation Z stock. Compensation attributable to the exercise of options that are granted under the plan before the earliest of the dates specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section will be treated as satisfying the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section for qualified performance-based compensation, regardless of when the options are exercised. (i) Effective date _(1) In general. * ␣9* ␣9* (2) Delayed effective date for certain provisions_ (i) Date on which remuneration is considered paid. Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the rules in the second sentence of each of paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) (A), (B), and (C) of this section for determining the date or dates on which remuneration is considered paid to a director are effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1995. Prior to those taxable years, taxpayers must follow the rules in paragraphs (e)(3)(ii) (A), (B), and (C) of this section or another reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 162(m) with respect to the date or dates on which remuneration is considered paid to a director. (ii) Separate treatment of publicly held subsidiaries. Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the rule in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section that treats publicly held subsidiaries as separately subject to section 162(m) is effective as of the first regularly scheduled meeting of the shareholders of the publicly held subsidiary that occurs more than 12 months after December 2, 1994. The rule for stock-based compensation set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section will apply for this purpose, except that the grant must occur before the shareholder meeting specified in this paragraph (i)(2)(ii). Taxpayers may choose to rely on the rule referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph (i)(2)(ii) for the period prior to the effective date of the rule. (iii) Subsidiaries that become separate publicly held corporations. Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(1) of this section, if a subsidiary of a publicly held corporation becomes a separate publicly held corporation as described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, then, for the duration of the reliance period described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section do not apply to remuneration paid to covered employees of that new publicly held corporation pursuant to a plan or agreement that existed prior to December 2, 1994 provided that the treatment of that remuneration as performance-based is in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 162(m). However, if remuneration is paid to covered employees of that new publicly held corporation pursuant to a plan or agreement that existed prior to December 2, 1994, but that remuneration is not performance-based under a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 162(m), then the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section apply as of the first regularly scheduled meeting of shareholders that occurs more than 12 months after December 2, 1994. The rule for stock-based compensation set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section will apply for purposes of this paragraph (i)(2)(iii), except that the grant must occur before the shareholder meeting specified in the preceding sentence if the remuneration is not performance-based under a reasonable, good faith interpretation of section 162(m). Taxpayers may choose to rely on the rules of paragraph (f)(4) of this section for the period prior to the applicable effective date referred to in the first or second sentence of this paragraph (i)(2)(iii).
