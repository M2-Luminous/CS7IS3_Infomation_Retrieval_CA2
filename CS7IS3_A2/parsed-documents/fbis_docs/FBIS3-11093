Alvaro Moscoso Blanco, highly respected nationally and internationally for his brilliant works and his conference papers presented before distinguished audiences, is now at the helm of CORDECO, a company that is in critical economic shape but that has great potentialities, especially in the rural area, as well as many problems to resolve. Following are the thoughts Alvaro Moscoso has expressed to FACETAS: [Heredia] We are five months into the term of a new administration, and the institution that you now preside over has already had four presidents. In what condition have you found CORDECO? [Moscoso] CORDECO's situation is critical. We have found a situation without liquidity, with accounts receivable totaling over 7 million bolivianos for completed projects, unpaid by the preceding administration. CORDECO's performance is still being affected by structural organizational problems. We think the time has come to restructure and institutionalize it. We also believe that the focus of CORDECO's purposes and objectives must be reoriented. We have also found an extremely delicate situation in the PIL [Indian Liberation Party], with assets totaling not more than 25 million bolivianos and taxes owed to the state totaling over 60 million bolivianos. I believe this is CORDECO's most delicate aspect. [Heredia] The PIL is your first stumbling block. Where is it to get the money to pay the taxes it owes to the state, knowing that the PIL is an institution that must subsidize your products for Bolivia's infant population? [Moscoso] At this time there is no visible solution, because of the extent of the possible applicability of the SAFCO [Administrative and Financial System for Government Control] Law. The debts owed by the state to the state must be covered, especially when all the steps in this process have been followed. What we are awaiting now is a possible reply by the president of the Republic to overcome this worrisome problem for all the citizens of Cochabamba. Even a payment plan that the Directorate of Internal Revenue might offer the PIL and the corporation would place a strain on this company's capabilities. [Heredia] What are the first tasks you have set out to accomplish within CORDECO? [Moscoso] There are two spheres of action. CORDECO's internal sphere needs to be restructured immediately, and its hierarchy institutionalized. The restructuring will be addressed by the Social Participation Law, whereas the institutionalization will be defined by our administration. We think the institutionalization will enable us to establish a hierarchy of public-sector employees and set standards and required qualifications for service to the collectivity. We believe CORDECO must be depoliticized so as to turn it into a technical instrument for development oriented toward improving the well-being of the citizenry. The second sphere of action concerns the corporation's responses to the major problems facing the department. These problems can be boiled down to the structure of the tenancy of the land in the inter-Andean valleys, which is marked by a small-holder economy that first makes its appearance in the tropic of Cochabamba; the migration toward urban centers, which is acquiring alarming dimensions; the scant dynamism of industry from the standpoint of generating employment for these people; and the overall inability to generate employment and services for the citizenry in general. [Heredia] You speak of institutionalizing the hierarchy of functions in CORDECO. When is this going to begin? [Moscoso] It will begin once the Social Participation Law, which I understand is tied to the tasks of corporations, is passed. It will certainly modify the way in which those tasks are carried out. When this phase of structural reforms to be enforced by the central government is enacted, we shall enter the institutionalization phase. [Heredia] Toward which sector will your work mainly be directed under the new approach that your presidency is proposing? [Moscoso] CORDECO must be de-urbanized. Cochabamba poses major problems, but at the same time, it offers vast potentialities from the standpoint of natural resources. We believe we must start working in the provinces, and more specifically in the rural area, gearing the work of the corporation to the activities of the social organizations in the rural area. In some provinces, as in the case of Mizque, Provincial Development Councils have been created that successfully integrate governmental authorities with representative organizations of civil society. This linkage has introduced a new development dynamic that is notable in the Mizque zone. [Heredia] Two important and perhaps controversial points: oil royalties and relations with the mayoralty. [Moscoso] The oil royalties budgeted this year total 21.53 million bolivianos. My first step upon arriving at the corporation was to request a report on the revenue the corporation has received as royalties, and I ordered the opening of a specific account for the administration of these funds. I believe the corporation and its management must administer the royalties rigorously and responsibly, drawing on the experiences of record in other departments. We think royalties must be managed in accordance with the law of 14 September 1992 devoting them principally to the implementation of the Misicuni Project. Meanwhile, it seems to me that it would not be expedient to open up the royalties fund for grabs by all the institutions. There is a request from the Cochabamba mayoralty, a prior one from the university, the Quillacollo mayoralty has spoken of its intention in this respect, as have also the inhabitants of Carrasco Province. It seems to me very dangerous to accede to these requests without the prior benefit of a specific policy regulating the administration of oil royalties. This does not mean in any way that we do not wish to work or cooperate with the mayoralty. On the contrary, I wish to make it clear publicly that I fully intend to cooperate with Cochabamba's municipality and with all the municipalities of the Department of Cochabamba. It is my obligation and we are prepared to finance funding for the municipal mayoralty, to endorse projects for their respective financing. [Heredia] There would seem to be a degree of zeal in relation to the administering of the oil royalties. [Moscoso] The royalties are, beyond question, the corporation's operating revenues. This is laid down in law, and it is the corporation management's responsibility, in coordination with the department's parliamentary work group, to decide the use and destination of these funds. The corporation is prepared to cooperate in this regard, but it seems to me very premature to institute a future earmarking of some 20 percent of the royalties. This could give rise to a subjugation of the administration of these funds on the basis of very justified demands, not only on the part of the mayoralty.
