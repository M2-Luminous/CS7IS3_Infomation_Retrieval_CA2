The rollout ceremony was attended by Presidents Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine and Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who is currently on an official visit to Ukraine. According to chief designer Pyotr Balabuyev, the new plane is intended for carrying cargoes and equipment by civil aviation and the air force. The aircraft can carry up to 30-35 tons of cargoes for a distance up to 4,000-5,000 km at a speed of 750-800 km/h. The first air liners are expected to be put into service already in 1996. Experts believe that the new aircraft can replace the U.S.-made C-130 Hercules and the European-made C-160 Transol presently used in West European countries.
