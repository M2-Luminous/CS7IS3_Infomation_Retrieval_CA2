Mr. ter Beek's statement follows talks between him and the UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus Ghali in New York. Mr. ter Beek said he was not opposed to the French plan, but he preferred the option of a UN force because of the credibility the UN has. The UN Security Council has just been meeting to discuss the French plan to send a military force to Rwanda, but no decision is expected until later today.
