This is, above all, the opposition involving a group of people who think differently. Finally, there are different national minorities," Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, chairman of the Croatia Helsinki human rights committee, says in an interview to KOHA, a newspaper in Albanian. "The Serbian ethnic minority is usually the one accused -- at the level of collective hatred due to the frustration caused by the war and the Serbian aggression on Croatia -- for the war with Croatia," Cicak went on to say. "I think that this is not good because it means accepting the model of generalizing collective guilt that now justifies Serbs' claims that the whole of the Croatian people is responsible for the war that was waged in the World War II when, in the name of Croathood, certain idiots committed massacres. The Serbs are now doing similar things in the name of Serbianhood. In this respect, I think that it is important to individualize guilt, ranging from the ideological level -- such as the ideological level of guilt in Serbia that above all lies on the group of people around the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, which produced the "Memorandum," in fact the MEIN KAMPF of the second half of the 20th century. [KOHA] What does the new Croatian democracy under Tudjman look like? [Cicak] As a man of modest intellectual capabilities, I jokingly "punished" myself by wishing to live in an ordinary democratic state. During communism, we lived in a state that proclaimed itself to be the most democratic state in the world. I would not like to live in the most democratic state in the world. I would like to live in an ordinary democratic country and nothing else. This is neither too much nor too little. However, this is the most difficult thing -- to find a democracy in which communist ways of thinking prevail is very difficult. At the moment, a restriction of, above all, freedom of the media is featuring on the political scene in Croatia, for there is no legal possibility in Croatia for free radio or television stations. Moreover, a great pressure is exerted recently toward taking away frequencies from local radio stations where opposition parties are in power. Therefore, room for democracy is being narrowed down in connection with the most recent events, a new strike against Manolic and, in my opinion, against Mesic as well. I think that the Croatian authorities will use the Washington agreement above all for a showdown with the internal opposition. Mesic and Manolic are only a beginning, and I think that the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the kind of agreements that are on now topical in fact mean rewarding the people who are, objectively speaking, to be blamed for the war. This means opening the door for them to turn the Balkans into South America to an even greater extent, that is, to create small puppet South American-type states for whom decrees of the Croatian authorities will more and more boil down to telephone messages from Washington. Of course, this increases Washington's responsibility for the policy here and I think that they should be told this clearly. [KOHA] What is the fate of the Muslim-Croatian federation? Could something else perhaps be done? [Cicak] We have again been brought into the situation of guinea pigs in an experimental laboratory of the U.S. politics that has been producing catastrophic results from Somalia to Iran. I do not believe in such things, above all because I think that the people who led to the war cannot lead to peace. Causes of war have not been removed. I was in Sweden when I received the new Bosnian Constitution. One of the new things that are being envisaged is the "ombudsman" and the human-rights tribunal. When it was recognized, Croatia signed a document obliging itself to form a human rights tribunal, but it has not done so to date. How can we have any right to ask another country to establish a human-rights tribunal and "ombudsman" and we are not complying with international obligations within our own country. [KOHA] What is the political influence, above all of the Albanians, on the solving of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, including Kosovo? [Cicak] When I am thinking about events in the Balkans, I often remember Tolstoy's "War and Peace" that I read in prison three times. He had excellent thoughts about politicians being only labels on wine bottles with the and wines inside being good, bad, overfermented, or underfermented. Therefore, I think that the names of the people on the Kosovo political scene at the moment are simply names that represent the situation at the moment. I think that the new times and new events will make new people surface. Just as is the case in Croatia. Many people were wiped out by political events in 1971. Likewise many names on the Kosovo political scene of today will simply be wiped out by new events and I think that these events will bring in some far more radical people. Unfortunately, Albanians cannot avoid the process of radicalization that, in my opinion, will be brought from outside. The moment the Serbs need it, they will set off on a showdown with Kosovo, as this is simply the only way they can function. They need war primarily to strengthen the system and not only to create a greater Serbia. In this respect, I think that the most horrible events will take place in Kosovo, because the amount of hatred between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo is 10 times as great as that in Croatia and Bosnia. And I think that the number of conflicts and events in Kosovo will also be 10 times greater. I do not want to play a prophet, but I have, so far, correctly predicted a lot of what has, unfortunately, happened in Kosovo. The conflict in Kosovo will provoke a global conflict in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] that will cause 1 million deaths in a short time. This is my own opinion and I have also spoken with a Swedish strategist. The amount of hatred and brutality, particularly on the Serbian side, is such that it is awful. If there is such an explosion in Kosovo, people will start fleeing down toward Tetovo en masse, because all this is a valley and that would simply be the most natural thing to do. The demographic situation in Macedonia will thereby change and that will cause a chain reaction. Albania, as well as Bulgaria and Greece will not watch from the sidelines. What the world is afraid of is the greatest cynicism of the West. In fact they are not bothered much by the conflict taking place in the Balkans between us: the Croats, Serbs, Muslims, Albanians, and others. They are afraid of the NATO breakdown that has begun with the conflict between Greece and Turkey and this is why they are acting at the level of prevention. However, I do not think that their prevention will work. To quote [Serbian writer] Filip David, one should strike and thereby prevent that budding neo-nazism in Europe, which is blend of bolshevism and an extreme chauvinistic nationalism, something that can best be seen in Russia. I think that the only way this process can be stopped is by demystifying those people who have begun their nazi projects, projects summed up in the following sentence: "One blood, one soil, one leader, one people." I do not like to lecture anybody, any peoples or groups, but the message I would send to the Albanians is that everything should be done to avoid deaths. Because, there has been only one case of resurrection in history. [KOHA] What do you think about the Kosovo setup, "reflecting" the present attempts in Bosnia, that is, about the Kosovo setup in the present Yugoslavia? [Cicak] This will be the worst catastrophe. The Albanians are going to swallow the idea, reckoning that it is important to acquire the status of federal units in Serbia or Macedonia and afterwards join Albania. I would call that a mistake in the long run and I will tell you why. What is involved is the project of first having a federation of Croats and Muslims in Bosnia, then confederal links with Croatia. Following this is the federalization of Croats and Muslims with the Serbs and then confederalization between that confederation and Serbia. After that, the Americans will try to apply that model to the federalization of Kosovo and linking that into a confederation with Albania. This would be one more reason for even greater war clashes in a certain number of years. Therefore, this does not solve the essential question again. And the essential question is how to stop the way of thinking that is 140 years old and that assumes the existence of a greater Serbia, a greater Croatia, and a greater Albania. [KOHA] What can the international community gain for Kosovo? [Cicak] The first step that the international community should gain for Kosovo is the degree of autonomy that it had on the basis of the 1974 [SFRY] Constitution, which was abolished against the will of the Albanian population. A great dilemma that the Albanians will certainly then face is how to preserve the ethnic rights of the Serbian ethnic minority, because the Serbs who are a constitutive nation would thereby turn into an ethnic minority. This is not because a constitution would have it that way, but it is from a mathematical point of view. They will simply be a minority from a statistical point of view and regardless of any constitutional provisions. A climate of intolerance and hatred between Albanians and Serbs cannot be avoided. It will not be possible to avoid revanchism. The problem is how long that would be possible to endure. How can this Balkan knot be later untangled is a question. According to what I have learned, Albania itself is hardly delighted with joining Kosovo soon. Kosovo is at the higher level of development in all social spheres, ranging from the cultural sphere to the economic basis. In this respect, after the reports and talks I had, I was very surprised when, in talks with people from Albania, I realized that they are not particularly delighted with that idea, fearing an overall domination of Kosovo Albanians in a future Albanian state. This fear of the Albanians is a fact. I think that Kosovo Albanians also know this very well. Terrible problems ensued with the union of East and West Germany because, in 45 years of living separately they became two separate bodies.
