"The president is convinced that the democratic system in Chile is lasting and stable. But it would benefit bilateral relations between the Czech Republic and Chile if they were developed by personalities who are accepted in the democratic world without reservations," Spacek said. He said the Presidential Office had today received letters from journalists addressed to Havel and denouncing Pinochet's visit. Spacek said that Havel already spoke critically of the forthcoming visit at a press conference in Bratislava last Thursday [26 May]. "The visit does not have an official character and neither the president nor his office has been informed of it in advance. The Czech Republic is opening its border to all people having valid travel documents. The president only takes note of the visit," Spacek said.
