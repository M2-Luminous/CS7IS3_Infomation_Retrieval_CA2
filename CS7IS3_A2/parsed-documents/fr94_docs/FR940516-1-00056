In ยง250.292, paragraph (b)(4)(i) is revised to read as follows: ยง250.292 Additional production and fuel gas system requirements. * * * * * (b) * * * (4) Fire- and gas-detection system. (i) Fire (flame, heat, or smoke) sensors shall be installed in all enclosed classified areas. Gas sensors shall be installed in all inadequately ventilated, enclosed classified areas. Adequate ventilation is defined as ventilation that is sufficient to prevent accumulation of significant quantities of vapor-air mixture in concentrations over 25 percent of the LEL. One approved method of providing adequate ventilation is a change of air volume every 5 minutes or 1 cubic foot of air-volume flow per minute per square foot of solid floor area, whichever is greater. Enclosed areas (e.g., buildings, living quarters, or doghouses) are defined as those areas confined on more than four of their six possible sides by walls, floors, or ceilings more restrictive to air flow than grating or fixed open louvers and of sufficient size to allow entry of personnel. A classified area is any area classified Class I, Group D, Division 1 or 2, following the guidelines of API RP 500. * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11601 Filed 5&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;MR&hyph;M
