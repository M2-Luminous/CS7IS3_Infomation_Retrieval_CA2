In his recent visit to the Beijing New Technology Development and Experiment Zone, he said that the zone is a far-sighted project. He added that, in the initial stage of its development, the zone has made remarkable progress. He said that in the past four decades, a great number of technological achievements turned out in the educational and scientific fields have failed to find practical application. He said that the industrialization of high technology is one of the effective ways for turning technology into production force. He said that the experiment zone should enhance the training of personnel in the sectors of international trade, finance, law and accounting. He noted that the talents in the above sectors are now badly needed for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure in the country. He urged the Chinese inventors to timely apply for patent rights at home and abroad so as to strengthen their competitive strength in making use of scientific and technological achievements. Located in the Zhongguancun district, the experiment zone was China's first new and high technology development park. Over the past five years, 112 high-technology enterprises in the zone have achieved an annual income exceeding 10 million yuan each. Last year, the total income of the zone exceeded more than 10 billion yuan.
