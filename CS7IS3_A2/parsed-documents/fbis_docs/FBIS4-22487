But even so almost every day we hear of the birth of new financial centers. But some die almost before their advertisements appear, while others survive and put pressure on competitors. Chara is evidence of that. People prefer to endure the wait in order to put their money in this particular bank. And this is the third year like that. What is going on? Is it merely high interest rates on deposits? The president of the Chara-Holding Corporation, Vladimir Rachuk, answers these and other questions. [Interviewer] So are you people here at Chara altruists? You are not interested in profits, you give depositors more than other banks. What is your interest in doing that? [Rachuk] High interest rates on personal deposits is Chara's fundamental position. Despite the fact that interest payments eat up a large part of profits. But generally we are against excessive profits. And not only because they are disadvantageous because of high taxes. To periphrase Suvorov, let me say: profit is nothing, but circulation is fine. From the start the idea of the bank was built on that: reaching the maximum turnover with minimum profitability, only that which is vitally necessary to the bank. On the one hand, this allows us to develop quickly, and on the other, to attract depositors with truly advantageous conditions for placing their savings. But there is really no other way today; what sense is there in cutting off the branch you are sitting on. Besides, a large part of the capital used to pay interest is immediately returned to us in the form of new deposits. So it is simply beneficial for the bank to pamper the client and allow him to get rich. However, promising high interest rates by no means solves everything. Intelligent depositors try to reach the golden medium, excellent profits and the absolute reliability of capital placement. Orienting ourselves precisely to this category, from the very start we took it as our rule to "Do it well or don't do it at all." [Interviewer] But in order to create a system which will work well from the start, serious preliminary preparations are needed. Organizational, financial, cadre, and psychological preparations. [Rachuk] Yes, although we started later than others, we were able to rely on the experience of the first wave of banks, became familiar with practices in organizing banking abroad, and did serious marketing work. This allowed us to define our "niche" more precisely. Inasmuch as there was still a very strong prejudice against banks created by private persons, the goal was set of creating a bank which enjoyed special trust, even if at first it was only among a small group of persons, you know, a "bank for our own people," in which credit policy could possibly be conducted without special risk. Those who knew us were the first to come to us. And since before then we had already actively and quite successfully done business in the spheres of hotel services and real estate and a number of other spheres, many people knew about us. Add personal acquaintances and the acquaintances of our acquaintances. We were initially located in a small apartment and the director's office was in a tiny kitchen. The entire bank, so to speak, operated as an insurance company before receiving a license. But that did not frighten people away; on the contrary it somehow even made us closer to our clients. We dealt with them not across an official counter, but rather seated at a desk. Many film and theater figures, journalists, and famous doctors were the first to come to us. The point is that my father, the professor of film studies, Igor Rachuk, gave half his life to cinematography, and I hope that it was precisely the kind memory of him that brought us hundreds of people whose names would do honor to any bank where they were customers. Today the bank has grown and become transformed in many respects. But we will always be grateful to our "veterans," who essentially created the bank along with us. And I hope later clients do not condemn us for showing special attention to the bank's pioneers. [Interviewer] You talk as if Chara already had decades of tranquil activity with no conflict behind it. But you are only 2 years old and most likely everything was not smooth. [Rachuk] Do you remember the Pavlov banknote exchange? That was when we first passed the test for our depositors and within 24 hours before the deadline were already beginning to issue them money in the form of the new notes. The second test befell us along with the entire country in the days of the October events. Political instability is deadly for banking and institutions like it. It creates artificially excited demands for cash deposits and provokes unreturned credits. This time everything was moving in exactly that direction. The simplest and most painless thing would have been to take advantage of the formal cause and suspend operations, since as we were located in the very heart of Moscow, on Tver, we naturally fell under the rules of the state of emergency. But we did not resort to that. A plan for emergency conditions conceived in advance was promptly put into effect. All financial operations were suspended, with the exception of service to private persons. So that, God forbid, work did not stop for a minute because of a shortage of cash, which would have immediately created panic. In advance we had prepared a reserve of liquid securities to be put into circulation. The psychological preparation of personnel helped a great deal. Employees were calm and confident and worked quickly and carefully, like stewardesses in a plane which has gone into a tailspin. And this is hard to believe, but the situation changed diametrically; people who just a few hours earlier were only thinking of how to pull out their money, instead deposited their last money, convinced that it would be safer here than at home. I was especially pleased that this happened in my absence. I was on vacation and I could influence events only by telephone. [Interviewer] Let us assume that at that time you managed to master the situation and get rid of tension by showing a high class of professionalism. Such banking techniques are familiar from the well-known novel by Arthur Haley, "The Moneychangers." But what if your plan had not worked and a large majority of your depositors had all the same demanded their money? Would that have been a disaster for you? [Rachuk] On the day that Roosevelt died, in New York the huge simultaneous load on the city's phone system broke it down: too many people wanted to share the sad news with one another. Don't believe a banker who maintains that he has never had a nightmare about this situation. Every person must work and watch for that. Especially in our time and in our country. Nonetheless, I do not doubt that any bank which plays an honest game will fulfill its obligations. It is a different matter altogether that many, especially beginning bankers, do so at the price of their own ruin. Each bank decides how to insure itself against this occurrence in its own way. We would like to believe we have insured ourselves with special flexibility. The Chara-Holding Corporation envisions corporate responsibility for the promissory notes of each of the companies which are members of it. First of all this applies to the Chara Bank, which is the core of the holding company. Our potential allows us to use the reserve system as a basis for financial resources, in amounts which more than cover all obligations to depositors. There are purely tactical techniques. For example, the problem of a harmonious combination of long-term, medium-term, and short-term credits must constantly be a focus of attention. The point is that from the standpoint of elementary logic, in order to ensure that loan capital is returned, it must always be "at hand," hence, long-term investments must be avoided. That is on the one hand. On the other, to tie the bank to short-term credits means to deliberately renounce the bank's development and realization of large-scale constructive programs which the state and society have the right to count on. The art of banking, it seems to me, certainly consists of the ability to find and maintain this fragile point of balance. I assure you with all responsibility that the Chara Bank is ready at any time to meet all of its responsibilities. Although it will naturally have to sacrifice something. [Interviewer] Do you mean to say that you have more tangible securities than money? [Rachuk] Exactly. Above all real estate. In the center of Moscow alone we own five large installations. Selling them in an emergency means losing a great deal, of course. To be frank, it would be devilishly painful to realize that what we have begun will be completed by others. I hope it will not reach that point. I want to believe that we have earned our depositors' trust. And if more difficult moments come, they will help us survive and through ill-considered actions will not begin destroying the mechanism that works in depositors' own interests. [Interviewer] Vladimir Igorevich, all this is remarkable. But money must be put to work. Only then can it reproduce itself. There are legends surrounding Chara. People even say that the bank subsidizes the narcotics trade. Otherwise, where would such high interest rates on deposits come from? [Rachuk] Well, that is of course complete nonsense. We respect ourselves and our clients too much to get involved in questionable operations. Our money is put to work in real estate, since, as I already said, even before the bank's creation we had accumulated experience in realtor activity. The quick rate of turnover of capital invested in this business is attractive. And its efficiency. The growth rate and the money, and in dollars too, for major real estate are such that our monthly obligations on loan resources invested in it are covered with interest. The second general direction is securities. Everyone who is close to financial spheres recognizes the need to develop a secondary securities market. Unfortunately, this is somewhat blocked by legislation restricting the circulation of securities made out to the bearer. Despite this, we decided to be actively involved in this activity. Properly, well-thought-out work with securities during periods of sudden changes in the exchange rate of the dollar allows one to obtain profits of up to 1,500-2,000 (!) percent annually. This is no longer the fruit of theoretical research but practice. The fairly complicated financial mechanisms which we created and in which the obligations of the Ministry of Finance, bank stock, promissory notes, "AVVA" stock, and other securities are linked in a single chain make it possible to obtain such high profits. Also helpful is the fact that the Chara-Holding Corporation, the most important but only 1 of the 10 components of the Chara Bank, is a multispecialization firm and the primary enterprise organizes work to distribute financial capital with the greatest efficiency during any particular period of time. In other words, this helps us be in constant readiness to enter any civilized market with adequate financial resources. [Interviewer] Real estate, that is understandable. But securities; today they are valuable and tomorrow not. All this is somehow risky. We are accustomed to expecting stability, reliability, and permanence from a bank. [Rachuk] I understand your remark. So recently we have vigorously "invested" in enterprises such as GAZ [Gas] and the St. Petersburg optical-mechanical association LOMO. And while we began with buy-and-sell operations, now we are attempting to get hold of a sufficient block of stock to raise work efficiency at these large enterprises of Russia. I am tired of hearing about the losses produced at high-tech, high-precision production facilities. I do not doubt that a boss who is vitally interested in the result will be able to organize things. There were and are wonderful specialists and engineers in Russia. Especially in St. Petersburg with its great traditions. But people must be paid decently. And to do this a system of material incentive must be created, a system like those which operate in developed countries. Like Japan. Yes, as has been repeated to us before, this is a sweatshop system. But personally I am confident and ready to state to the entire world that the greatest human invention is not the wheel, but the idea of exploitation. A person must exploit himself and make others work efficiently. That is precisely what moves civilization. Without exploitation even wheels would not have appeared. Of course, investment capital will be needed. For example, 70 percent of the machine tools at LOMO must be replaced. Major customers will help accomplish this. They have already been found in the United States. I think that people interested in the large-scale program for night vision devices will also be found. [Interviewer] What do you think of the Central Bank's recent decree on increasing bank charter capital to 2 billion rubles? [Rachuk] We are already becoming accustomed to surprises which the state throws at us all of a sudden, in this case the state represented by the Central Bank. And we are learning to protect ourselves and our depositors from all types of surprises. Speaking specifically of this Central Bank decision, it seems justified for Moscow. The rank of the capital banks commits them to a particular status. There is potential for this: According to certain information, up to 80 percent of the financial operations are carried out in our city. As for the periphery and cities which do not lie at the crossroads of financial arteries, such a requirement is nonsense. [Interviewer] Vladimir Igorevich! It seems that you and I have discussed everything except one problem: Is a depositor something abstract to you or really a living person? [Rachuk] To me a depositor is an absolutely real individual: a person who has entrusted his money to us. Perhaps his last money, his only hope. I have also learned what drinking tea without sugar means. For a bank, when the number of depositors runs into the tens of thousands, unfortunately, more and more they become "all the same." Barriers of organizational-structural links have grown up between the "original clients" and our "ordinary clients." We have become separated. And it is very difficult to survive such a thing emotionally. This is by no means nostalgia for the office in the kitchen where we could talk confidentially with our depositors; for the bank as we envision it, the feedback mechanism is a vitally important condition. We and our clients are a single unit and we have a single breathing rhythm. But can a banking institution conceived of as a "bank for its own people" remain like that at all in the new age and weight category? It seems it can, if you seek the solution of this problem on a different plane. In our opinion, the Board of Trustees which we are creating under the Board of Directors of the Chara-Holding Corporation will help the bank keep its finger on the pulse of the entire mass of depositors. Depositors' interests will be represented there by people whose competent opinion, I am sure, will help better organize work with clients and raise the quality of service by bringing it closer to the requirements of European standards. Determining the priority directions of charitable and sponsorship activity will be an important task of the Board of Trustees. Our business is to earn money, but how to "put it to work" for the good of our great but tormented country is a problem that must be resolved all together with God's help! [Interviewer] In conclusion, what do you have to say about the raid by the tax police on the Chara Bank, which was made public in the mass information media in recent days? [Rachuk] As for the raid on the bank's premises under the guise of searching for documents of an altogether different organization, we will of course take all legal steps to protect our honor and dignity. Whatever political or economic goals were being pursued by this raid on precisely the bank, I emphasize, rather than on the Chara enterprise, which is being formally audited and is located on the adjacent street, and which we knew of in advance, incidentally, our depositors will in no way suffer. I am speaking of this with complete confidence, since all the Chara Bank's activity is based on precise compliance with the laws.
