When Moeen Qureshi became the care-taker prime minister, he accepted this demand immediately and reduced the import duty by 50 percent. The IMF now is demanding the gradual reduction of import duty and its termination in a few years. Pakistani economic experts believe that import duty should not be reduced more that 5 percent at this time because additional reduction will result in extraordinary reduction in government revenues, and taxes will have to be increased to make up for this lose. Since the taxes are already increasing, this additional increase will be an unbearable burden for the people to carry. The other aspect of this problem is that the gradual reduction in import duty will result in flooding our nation with foreign-made goods, which will hurt our local industries very badly. Our nation will be transformed into a market for foreign goods to all practical purposes. This will adversely effect our efforts to make industrial progress and make our national economy independent. It is believed that some important and influential persons support reducing import duty by 15 percent now and totally removing it later. These foreign agencies make these suggestions to protect the interests of the nations that give them grants. The indebted nations seriously consider these suggestions because of their needs and economic problems. However, they should keep their own national interests in mind. Against this background, we hope that while the Pakistani government considers the IMF demands, it will also protect national interests.
