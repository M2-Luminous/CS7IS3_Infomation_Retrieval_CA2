FR941103-2-00135 FR941103-2-00074 5. Applicants do not request relief under section 12(d)(1) of the Act. Section 12(d)(1) limits purchases by registered investment companies of securities issued by other investment companies. Section 12(d)(1) (E) provides, however, that section 12(d)(1) shall not apply to securities purchased by a registered unit investment trust if the securities are the only ``investment securities'' held by the trust. Applicants believe that the U.S. Treasury zero coupon obligations are not ``investment securities'' for purposes of section 12(d)(1) (E) 2 and that the Fund shares are the only ``investment securities'' which the Trust will hold. Accordingly, they do not believe relief from section 12(d)(1) is necessary. 2 Equity Securities Trust, (pub. avail. Jan. 19, 1994). Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree to the following as conditions to the granting of the requested order: 1. The Trustee will not redeem Fund shares except to the extent necessary to meet redemptions of units by unitholders, or to pay Trust expenses should distributions and rebated rule 12b&hyph;1 fees received on Fund shares prove insufficient to cover such expenses. 2. Any rule 12b&hyph;1 fees received by the Sponsor or the Distributor in connection with the distribution of Fund shares to the Trust will be immediately rebated to the Trustee. 3. All Trust Series investing in shares of the same Fund will be structured so that their maturity dates will be at least thirty days apart from one another. 4. Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3, except that the Trust will not restrict its portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.'' 5. Shares of a Fund which are held by a Series of the Trust will be voted by the Trustee of the Trust, and the Trustees will vote all shares of a Fund held in a Trust in the same proportion as all other shares of that Fund not held by the Trust are voted. 6. No sales charge or redemption fee will be imposed on shares of a Fund which are held by any Series of the Trust or on any shares acquired by unitholders through reinvestment of dividends or distributions or through reinvestment at termination. 7. The prospectus of each Trust Series and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of a reinvestment option will disclose that shareholders who elect to invest in Fund shares will incur a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee if the Fund imposes a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee.
