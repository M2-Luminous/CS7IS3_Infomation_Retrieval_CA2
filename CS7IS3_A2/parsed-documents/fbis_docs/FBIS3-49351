The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] communique, conveyed to TANJUG Friday [7 January], states that on January 5 seven armed Croatian soldiers stopped, disarmed and arrested four Canadian peacekeepers who were on a routine patrol in the area of Medak, south of the republic of Serb Krajina. The communique adds that the patrol commander had shown his authorisation to cross the territory which was ignored and the Canadian soldiers were forced at gunpoint to go to the local Croatian Army headquarters. Describing the incident as "shameful" Jean Cot requested of the Croatian authorities to conduct an inquiry and punish those responsible. In an action named "Scorched Earth" last September the Croatian Army has occupied the Medak area, and burnt down 11 Serb villages and brutally murdered 72 civilians. The republic of Serb Krajina was declared by the Serbs in 1991 in parts of the former Republic of Croatia where Serbs are a majority population, in defiance of the forced Croatian secession from the former Yugoslavia and their downgrading of the Serbs from a constituent nation to a national minority. Although the RSK has been under U.N. protection since March 1992 in that period Croatia has three times attacked the Serb state that it does not recognize, with the aim of forcibly placing it under its authority.
