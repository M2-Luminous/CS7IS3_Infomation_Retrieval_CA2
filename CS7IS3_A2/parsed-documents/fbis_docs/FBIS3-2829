"Leaders at all levels must take into consideration the interests of the nation as a whole and firmly control the annual price index in the prescribed range," he said. Zhu made the remarks when he joined deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) from Hunan Province in a group discussion on premier Li Peng's government work report. Zhu himself is an NPC deputy from the province. "Some people attribute the current price rise to reform measures introduced this year," Zhu said. "This is a gross misunderstanding." The inflation, which had started two months earlier than their introduction, has had little to do with this year's reform measures, he said. In the past two months, the national economy has shown unexpectedly good performance, the vice-premier said. He based his assessment on the following indicators: First, government revenues jumped more than 30 percent over the January-February period last year; second, money supply has been controlled effectively; third, the exchange rate between reminbi and foreign currencies has remained stable and the country's foreign exchange reserve has increased; and fourth, supplies of goods are sufficient. "Tightened controls over the scale of capital construction and over consumption spending are the fundamental measure to keep inflation at bay," he said. The central government, Zhu said, will adopt other major measures to control inflation. They include: To develop agriculture and improve the economic performance of "vegetable basket projects" for stabilizing the prices of grain and foodstuffs; to exercise strengthened management over prices; and to adopt soon a number of major price-control measures.
