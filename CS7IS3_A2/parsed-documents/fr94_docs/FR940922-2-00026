FR940922-2-00026 FR940922-2-00008 National Institute of Standards and Technology [Docket No. 940949&hyph;4249] RIN 0693&hyph;ZA01 Precision Measurement Grants Program AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The purpose of this notice is to inform potential applicants that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is continuing a program of research grants, formally titled Precision Measurement Grants, to scientists in U.S. academic institutions for significant, primarily experimental research in the field of precision measurement and fundamental constants. Applicants must submit an abbreviated proposal for preliminary screening: Based on the merit of the abbreviated proposal, applicants will be advised whether a full proposal should be submitted. DATES: Abbreviated proposals must be received at the address listed below no later than 5 p.m. EDT on February 1, 1995. The semi-finalists will be notified of their status by March 24, 1995, and will be requested to submit their full proposals to NIST by 5 p.m. EDT on May 8, 1995. The successful applicants will be notified of their selection on or before August 15, 1995. ADDRESSES: Applicants are requested to submit an abbreviated proposal (original and two (2) signed copies), using Standard Form 424 (Rev. 4/92) with a description of their proposed work of no more than five (5) double spaced pages. Standard Form 424A (4&hyph;92) and 424B (4&hyph;92) are also required. Copies should be sent to the following: Dr. Barry N. Taylor, Chairman, NIST Precision Measurement Grants Committee, Bldg. 245, Room C229, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899&hyph;0001. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Technical questions concerning the NIST Precision Measurement Grants Program may be directed to the above address or call Dr. Taylor at (301) 975&hyph;4220. Prospective candidates are urged to contact Dr. Taylor before preparing their abbreviated proposal. Inquiries should be general in nature. Specific inquiries as to the usefulness or merit of any particular project, or other specific inquiries that deal with evaluation criterion can potentially impede the competitive selection process and therefore, cannot be answered. Administrative questions concerning the NIST Precision Measurement Grants Program may be directed to the Grants Office at (301) 975&hyph;6329. Written inquiries should be forwarded to the following address: Grants Office, Acquisition and Assistance Division, Building 301/Room B129, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899&hyph;0001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Name and Number Measurement and Engineering Research and Standards; 11.609. Authority As authorized by Section 2 of the Act of March 3, 1901 as amended (15 U.S.C. 272 (b)(2) and (c)(3)), NIST conducts directly, and supports through grants, a basic and applied research program in the general area of precision measurement and the determination of fundamental constants of nature. As part of this research program, NIST has since 1970 awarded Precision Measurement Grants to scientists in U.S. academic institutions for significant, primarily experimental research in the field of precision measurement and fundamental constants. Award Period NIST is now accepting applications for two new grants in the amount of $50,000 per year to be awarded for the period October 1, 1995, through September 30, 1996 (fiscal year 1996.) Each grant may be renewed for up to two additional years; however, future or continued funding will be at the total discretion of NIST based on such factors as satisfactory performance and the availability of funds.
