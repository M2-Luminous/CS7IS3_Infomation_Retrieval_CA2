A section of the political forces and the mass media answered this question in the negative, asserting that no real mechanisms exist for implementing this document. In our view this is not so. For all its outward lack of conflict and its "smoothness," the treaty imposes quite definite obligations on the parties to it. The Federation Council and the State Duma, for example, have clearly defined the contents of the legislative acts which will be adopted in the very near future: a constitutional law on the government, a law on the budget, civil and land codes, a code of labor laws, tax and banking legislation, laws on the minimum living wage, on the delimitation of jurisdiction and powers between the Russian Federation and its components, on local self-management, on the fight against crime and corruption, and on benefits for scientific, cultural, educational, and health care establishments (Paragraph 3 Section 2, Paragraph 2 Section 3, Paragraph 1 Section 5, and Paragraph 5 Section 6 of the Social Accord Treaty). This predetermines parliament's stable and constructive work style. The toughest restrictions have been placed on the trade unions. Their obligation "not to hold or participate in the organization of strikes for the purpose of redistributing budget funds or allocating to individual sectors or territories subsidies or benefits relating to state credits or taxation..." (Paragraph 4 Section 2 of the treaty) signifies the end of "solidarity strikes," which have had such a negative effect on the socioeconomic and political situation in the country. At the same time the obligations assumed by the government and the associations of entrepreneurs and commodity producers are clearly nonspecific and therefore inadequate. This was precisely the reason why many potential supporters of the Social Accord Treaty did not participate in the assembly's work. How, then, can the treaty's provisions be concretized so as to make them considerably more effective? World practice in such agreements (which attests, incidentally, that the Social Accord Treaty is not the fruit of office creativity by the President's Administration) attests to the need for rigid concretization of measures implemented within the agreement's framework, with an indication of deadlines. Thus, within the framework of the economic stabilization law adopted by the U.S. Congress in August 1971 R. Nixon's administration undertook the following measures on the basis of agreements with employers and labor unions: In August 1971 prices and wages were frozen by the government for 90 days. Thereafter it was permitted to increase them under government control -- prices by 2.5 percent, wages by 5.5 percent a year. At the third stage all restrictions were made voluntary, while retaining state arbitration. Finally, the fourth stage, whose implementation was completed by May 1974, proposed the restoration of the practice of a controlled increase in prices and wages. The implementation of the "social contract" in Britain was different. In the summer of 1975 this agreement was concluded between H. Wilson's government and the trade unions for a period of two years. The trade unions voluntarily pledged to limit their wage increase demands to 10 percent a year in exchange for specific promises by the government to curb the inflation index. Of course, in both the aforesaid situations not all the proposed measures were fulfilled, but they had been planned specifically and not in the form of phrases like "develop the structural restructuring of ecopolitics" (Paragraph 1 Section 2 of the Social Accord Treaty). So, specificness is the feature which is so lacking in the agreement which has been opened for signing. The elaboration of the economic appendix to it, clearly recording the obligations of the government, the entrepreneurs, and the trade unions in respect of macroeconomic indicators, will make it possible, in our view, not only to expand the circle of "signatories" -- after all, this is not that important -- but also to create real conditions for stabilizing the situation in the country.
