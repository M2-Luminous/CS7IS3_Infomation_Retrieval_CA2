After thoroughly reassessing the overall situation in the state administration, in particular in order to ensure the implementation of tasks arising from the law on the reorganization of local administration, the government decided to recall 26 heads of district offices. In addition, the government recalled Dusan Kleiman from the post of director general of the News Agency of the Slovak Republic [TA SR] and appointed Ivan Melichercik as the new director. At the same time, it agreed with the proposal to solve the economic problems of Slovak Radio and approved the request for radio broadcasts in line with the law on the state budget. The government authorized the Ministry of Culture to make this request specific so that the Ministry of Finance may provide the financing for this request.
