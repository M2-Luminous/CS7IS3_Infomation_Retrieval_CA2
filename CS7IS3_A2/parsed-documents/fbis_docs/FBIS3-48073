Supporting this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: This is a very timely and just patriotic initiative in view of the desire of the fellow countrymen for reunification and the domestic and foreign situation. The Central Committee of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon highly estimated the initiative as a good proposal, expressed full support to it and warmly welcomed it. The reunification question of Korea is a question of terminating the domination and interference of outside forces and fully realizing the sovereignty of the Korean nation and achieving national unity; it is a nationwide cause which the 70 million fellow countrymen at home and abroad should accomplish, united as one under the banner of the great unity of the whole nation. Great national unity is the basic idea of Pomminnyon and reunification in the 90s is its noble duty to the nation. The Pomminnyon organisations at home and abroad should jointly and energetically organize and conduct the patriotic movement for reunification to achieve great national unity by availing themselves of all possibilities and occasions and thus brilliantly adorn this significant year as a "Year of Great National Unity". All the compatriots at home and abroad should frustrate the anti-national, anti-reunification reactionary offensive of the Kim Yong-sam group under the "civilian" veil and actively promote the great national unity in this course.
