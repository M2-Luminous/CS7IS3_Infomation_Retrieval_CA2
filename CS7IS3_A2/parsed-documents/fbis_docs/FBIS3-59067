While in the French capital, Qian Qichen also had talks with the U.S. secretary of state. [passage omitted] Arms Sales to Taiwan The Chinese minister seemed pleased with his visit, stating that "the future of Franco-Chinese relations is promising." However, he did not commit himself to much, saying that he had "told the president that French firms had to take a place in China." Which place, one wonders, since France's market share in China (1.8 percent) is much smaller than Germany's (4.9 percent), or even Italy's (2.1 percent). A cautious Mr. Qian steered clear of the issue of French weapon sales to Taiwan. He did not say whether he viewed the 12 January communique as ending permanently this particular trade -- which is what Beijing has always wanted -- or, in Mr. Juppe's words, as a simple "limitation." Indeed, it is clear that France -- and especially weapon manufacturers and the Defense Ministry -- would be pleased to sign new contracts bringing in fresh money, even though sales must now be limited to non-offensive weapons. The question is now to determine how and by whom the definition of such defensive weapons will be drawn. What of armored vehicles, for example? And will it be necessary, as stated in Singapore by Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet, to ask for Beijing's permission before each transaction? This position seems hardly congruous with that of the Quai d'Orsay [French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]. Furthermore, Mr. Longuet announced that French assistance to Beijing, which had been suspended in 1993, would be resumed. In 1992, China had been the first beneficiary of French State assistance with Fr1,250 billion -- France being the second biggest contributor of state aid to Beijing, after Japan. So this is indeed a new start -- commercial interests having now displaced the memory of the Tiananmen massacre, which the French Government of the time had denounced with a determination unmatched throughout the world. Of the resolutions made at the time by the Twelve, only the ban on arms sales -- can it last much longer? -- and the suspension of state visits remain in force. And Chancellor Kohl has shown how little concern he has for the latter resolution, when he invited China's President Jiang Zemin to come to Bonn. Will the latest compromises made by France on the altar of reconciliation with China be the last ones, or will commercial or political reasons incite some people to be even more pliant in the future? For there is no doubt that Beijing will try, as usual, to take advantage of any disagreements it may notice in Paris as well as the vague terms of the joint communique. Even though barriers to renewed cooperation have been removed, it does not follow that China's nature is going to change. The appointment of Chen Kuiyuan, the secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee, as head of the Chinese delegation to the PCF [French Communist Party] congress shows in just how little regard China's rulers hold the concerns of Western democracies with respect to the human rights issue in Tibet. Be it insensitivity or provocation, the utmost caution will be required if Paris is to avoid looking like it has let itself be lured by PRC's siren song.
