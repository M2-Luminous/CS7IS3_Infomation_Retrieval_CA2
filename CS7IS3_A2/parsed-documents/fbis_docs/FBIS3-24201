Among those present were deputy heads of the kray administration, heads of administrations and committees, as well as of the fuel and power generation complex, a large group from the military, and trade unions. "Lately we feel acutely that the government has cooled off quite noticeably toward the Maritime Kray," said the kray administration head, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. It is practically impossible to "wring out" the money due as envisaged by Decree No. 1001. And the thorniest issue, which practically separates our kray from Russia's central regions, is high transportation rates. Instead of somehow helping the Far East in this respect, the Russian Federation Government just a few days ago made a decision to raise them again by more than 20 percent. What the result will be is clear. High costs will force many enterprises located in West Siberia, in the Urals, and the European part of Russia to reroute the flow of export cargo. Now it will go abroad through the ports on the Black or Baltic Sea. This trend already is detectable. The following data point in this direction: Freight volume at the Far Eastern segment of the railroad system fell off by 37 percent. Naturally, the output of our plants and factories, and most importantly, mining enterprises, will not be competitive in the regions where industrial consumers are and which are long distance away from Maritime Kray. In this situation, a vitally important question comes up with all urgency: How is Maritime Kray to survive? Vladimir Kolesnichenko, who is considered the most knowledgeable and competent economist in the kray, predicts this development of the situation. In May, electric power rates will go up. This blow will push a considerable number of kray enterprises into bankruptcy. They are already literally being strangled by hidden unemployment. It runs by most modest estimates at 25-40 percent of enterprises' labor force. One can, of course, understand the directors--they still hope for some mythical subsidies and preferential credits. But there will be none. Therefore, says V. Kolesnichenko, we need to take radical steps right now. We have to immediately set up a commission that will determine the backbone enterprises in the kray capable of surviving at the current stage of transition to a market. Those labor collectives that cannot survive we should declare bankrupt and start finding jobs for the people. The first to go bankrupt, in V. Kolesnichenko's opinion, are enterprises in the cities where mining combines and machine-building plants are located. It is Dalnegorsk, Arsenyev, and the settlement Kavalerovo. We can already see the validity of this forecast--the mining and enrichment combine in Khrustalnyy is practically dying. The kray administration presented at the conference its plan for saving Maritime Kray from the impending destructive processes; the plan had been drafted by Moscow academics and executive branch departments. It was decided to "bring it into proper shape" during March, incorporate proposals of economic managers and the military, and then send the document for consideration to the Russian Federation Government. N. Pimenov, the chief of the kray administration's main planning and economic administration, related to the conference participants the gist of this plan. According to the document, the priority sectors will be defense, foreign economic relations, and transportation. In order to move it all from the a centralized-economy state into a market-based one, the government will have to provide financial support. Otherwise, nothing will come out of it. Here is why. The government owes 56 billion rubles [R] to our defense plants, even those where it had placed orders. (For instance, production of the "Black Shark" helicopter at the Progress plant.) And now they are literally dying at the root. Next. One may say that the government forgot about the existence of its troops and their high concentration in Maritime Kray. Take the cost of the Pacific Fleet alone! The center practically keeps them on a financial starvation diet. The kray is compelled in extreme cases to provide money for the military from its own budget. And quite substantial sums, sometimes. The result is that in addition to paying taxes, Maritime Kray residents carry an additional load, which affects the social sphere. Foreign economic relations. Maritime Kray already has in operation five vehicle crossings and eight ports open for entry to foreign vessels. What does the territory get from it? Nothing. Only 10 percent of the customs duty goes into the kray budget; the rest goes to the center. The document proposes to leave the entire customs duty collected in the kray for about two years. The transportation complex cannot be improved without targeted federal programs. Ports and port-adjacent rail stations need to be developed, new branch lines built. All of this requires government investment money. The program proposed in the document assumes, of course, subsidies from the federal budget. And this is not dumping one's problems on the center--these are precisely the expenditures the state has to finance: maintenance of the Armed Forces, development of foreign trade and large transportation systems. As to our own business, says the kray leadership, it is time to pay very close attention to the development of the entire spectrum of relations with the countries of the Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. The following fact is quoted in support of this argument: In order to bring grain from Altay Kray, Maritime Kray has to pay agricultural producers and the railroad R270,000 per tonne. Transportation of the same tonne from Canada will cost R100,000. A tangible difference. And it is visible in everything.
