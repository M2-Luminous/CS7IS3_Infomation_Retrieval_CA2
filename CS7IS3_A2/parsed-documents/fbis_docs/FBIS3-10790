Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said that the decision "is the most important political fact" in the meeting of the ministers of economy and foreign affairs of the Mercosur countries, which ended today in Buenos Aires. "There are ways to make Mercosur compatible with NAFTA, and this is what we are studying," Di Tella added. The deliberations in Buenos Aires seem to have given definition to the Argentine position, which at one point was considering the possibility of unilaterally joining NAFTA upon invitation by the United States. The Mercosur countries will now study how to reactivate the negotiations known as "four plus one," begun two years ago, that aim at approaching the North American commercial bloc. The Mercosur ministers also agreed to study all the options for promoting broad regional economic integration, on the basis of a Brazilian proposal to create the South American Free Trade Association (ALCSA). The ministers avoided, however, resuming discussions on the Mexican decision to refrain from extending the concessions obtained within NAFTA to the other Latin American countries, diplomatic sources have said. The matter, which has been a source of conflict, has been awaiting resolution since the last Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) meeting held in Montevideo in February. The proposal to create ALCSA, which was raised in October 1993, was formally presented to the Mercosur ministers by the Brazilian ministers of finance and of foreign affairs, Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Celso Amorim respectively. Cardoso told EFE that the initiative "does not go against anybody, and seeks to preserve the Latin American bloc and strengthen regional commerce," thus denying that it is an attempt "to put the brakes on a commercial invasion" by NAFTA members. Brazil, South America's most developed country, sells 13 percent of its exports to Mercosur and 8 percent to the other South American countries. Cardoso said that his country has not considered the possibility of joining NAFTA "because we cannot take the initiative; we have not been invited." "The idea is to promote commercial liberalization, but always on the basis of the consolidation of Mercosur as an institutional structure and as an organization for joint negotiations for the entire continent," Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu said. Uruguay maintains that "everything is compatible, provided the obligations assumed under Mercosur are complied with and provided there is a common foreign policy toward third countries." The Brazilians proposed that the South American Free Trade Zone come into operation 10 years after 1 January 1995, the day when Mercosur will become fully operational. Mercosur is considered the "nucleus" of the integration process. This means that Mercosur commercial policies should be coordinated with those of the Andean Pact, which is made up of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, and with Chilean policies. The Mercosur area has a population of 190 million people, with a gross domestic product equivalent to slightly more than 50 percent of Latin America's total GDP.
