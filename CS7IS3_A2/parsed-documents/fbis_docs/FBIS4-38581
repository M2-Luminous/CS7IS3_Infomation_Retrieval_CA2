In an address to lawmakers, Kravchuk said that a new constitutional court could be formed within a month to examine the Crimean basic law that provides for a Crimean citizenship, treaty relations with Kiev and the establishment of a separate militia force. The Ukrainian leader also held out an olive branch to the leadership of the breakaway republic by announcing that he was prepared to consider legislative changes that would give Crimea greater autonomy from Kiev. "I pledge to maintain peace and calm but only if Crimea adopts laws and legislative acts that are in line with the Ukrainian Constitution," Kravchuk said. "Only in this instance is compromise and settlement of all outstanding issues possible," he said, adding: "There are extremely dangerous precedents currently being established in Crimea." Crimea, a predominantly Russian-populated republic bordering the Black Sea, has stepped up its drive to secede from Ukraine and be reunited with Russia since the election in January of Russian nationalist Yuriy Meshkov to the presidency. The republic was part of Russia up until 1954 when then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev handed over the territory to Ukraine as a "gift" celebrating the friendship between the two Slav peoples. The Crimean crisis was triggered by the local parliament's decision on May 20 to restore a 1992 constitution in a move that was viewed by Kiev as tantamount to a declaration of independence. The attempt at a settlement came ahead of the June 26 presidential election which Kravchuk is expected to lose and is seeking to postpone. In his address, Kravchuk cited an agreement reached between Russia and the breakaway republic of Tatarstan as a framework for negotiating a new power-sharing arrangement that would give Crimea greater autonomy from Kiev in managing its economy. But the Ukrainian leader stressed that the Russian-Tatar agreement did not provide for a republican police force and for citizenship rights which he said amounted to a "gross violation of the Ukrainian Constitution." He asserted that all law-enforcement agencies and security forces must be subordinated to Kiev and proposed that a post of deputy prime minister responsible for territorial issues be created as well as a parliamentary commission. Kravchuk announced that a 10-judge panel for the new court could be appointed by parliament within a month and proposed that five candidates be put forward by Speaker Alexander Moroz and the remaining five by the presidency. The parliament was to examine the Kravchuk proposal and render its verdict later during the day.
