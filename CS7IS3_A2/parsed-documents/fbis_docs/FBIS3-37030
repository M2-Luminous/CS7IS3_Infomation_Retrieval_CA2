"I have not been calculating the cost of Ukraine's participation in the partnership," he said. "However, regional security is in the forefront of the treaty, while issues which require payments go next. I consider the signing of the treaty to be undoubtedly necessary and urgent. As for the prospects for Ukraine's accession to NATO, our military doctrine stipulates non- alignment, however our army, undoubtedly, has all prerequisites for reforming its infrastructure following the NATO states' pattern."
