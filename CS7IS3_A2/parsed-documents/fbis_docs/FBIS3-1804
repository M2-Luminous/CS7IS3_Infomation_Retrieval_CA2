The local press reported that the head of the DPRK delegation today telephoned South Korea's chief negotiator and said that South Korea's proposal was "a matter for rejoicing". The exchange of presidential envoys is an urgent matter which could not be delayed, he said. The three previous rounds of working-level contacts failed to make progress on the issue of dispatching envoys to Pyongyang and Seoul. According to an agreement reached last Saturday between the DPRK and the United States, if the DPRK allows nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and opens a dialogue with South Korea, South Korea and the U.S. will contemporaneously announce the suspension of joint military exercises. The U.S. also will issue the agenda for a third round of U.S.-DPRK negotiations. A seven-member team of IAEA inspectors arrived here today.
