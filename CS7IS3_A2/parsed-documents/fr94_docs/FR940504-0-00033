FR940504-0-00033 FR940504-0-00010 21. The initial Public Notice will also specify filing windows for short-form applications (no long form applications are to be filed at this stage of the competitive bidding application procedure) and bidder certifications, filing fees, upfront and down payments. Applications filed before or after the dates specified in the Public Notice will not be accepted by the Commission. Applications submitted after the deadline specified will be dismissed with prejudice. An auction information package will be made available to prospective bidders after the release of the initial Public Notice. Slightly different procedures will apply when the rules permit applicants to submit long form applications after the occurrence or nonoccurrence of certain events ( e.g., passage of time and failure to serve a particular area). 22. The short-form applications and bidder certifications will normally require applicants to provide the following information: (1) The license(s) for which the applicant wishes to bid, (2) the applicant's name, (3) the identity of the person(s) authorized to bid, (4) certifications that the applicant is legally, technically, financially, and otherwise qualified, and (5) certification that the applicant satisfies any financial qualification requirements for the service in question. Applicants seeking to file as designated entities eligible for bidding preferences must indicate their status in the short-form application and must certify that they are qualified to file as designated entities. Bidders will also be required to identify all parties with whom they have entered into partnerships, joint ventures, consortium, or other arrangements or agreements. Bidders will also be required to certify on their short-form applications that they have not entered into any explicit or implicit agreements with any parties other than those identified regarding the amount of their bid, bidding strategies or the particular properties on which they will or will not bid. 23. After reviewing the short-form applications, the Commission will issue a Public Notice listing all defective applications and notify applicants of the specific defect. If the Commission receives only one application that is acceptable for filing for a particular license, the Commission will issue a Public Notice cancelling the auction for this license and establishing a date for the filing of a long-form application, the acceptance of which would trigger the relevant procedures permitting petitions to deny. Applicants whose short-form applications are substantially complete but have minor errors or defects will be provided an opportunity to correct their applications prior to the auction. However, applicants will not be permitted to make any major modifications to their applications, including ownership changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia. Also, applications that are not signed or that fail to make the requisite certifications will be dismissed as unacceptable. 24. After reviewing the corrected applications, the Commission will release another Public Notice announcing the names of all applicants whose applications have been accepted for filing. Applicants identified in the Public Notice will then be required to submit the full amount of their upfront payment to the Commission's lock-box bank by a date to be specified in that Public Notice which generally will be no later than 14 days before the scheduled auction. 25. Once the Commission has received from the lock-box bank the names of all applicants who have submitted timely unfront payments, the Commission will issue a fourth Public Notice announcing the names of all applicants that have been determined to be qualified to bid. Each of these applicants will be provided a bidder identification number and further information and instructions regarding the auction procedures. Competitive Bidding Payments 26. Upfront Payments. In most cases, some form of upfront payment is necessary to deter frivolous or insincere bidding. We have determined that the best approach is to retain flexibility to determine the amount of upfront payment on an auction-by-auction basis. Generally, a bidder must submit an upfront payment equal to $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination of MHz-pops the bidder anticipates bidding on in any single round of bidding. A bidder may file applications for every license being auctioned, but its actual bidding in any round of an auction will be limited by the amount of its upfront payment. 27. Upfront payments will provide the Commission with a source of available funds in the event a penalty must be assessed for bid withdrawal prior to further payments. In future Reports and Orders establishing service-specific auction rules, we may determine that the $0.02 per pop per MHz formula is inappropriate because of product market or license characteristics or auction design choice. In some circumstances, we may decide that it is more appropriate instead to set a fixed upfront payment or eliminate the upfront payment. We therefore reserve the option of revising or waiving the upfront payment. In such cases, we will adopt an alternative upfront payment in service-specific auction rules or in the Public Notice announcing the auction. 28. As a general rule, we will not cap upfront payments because we need to ensure that those bidding on large numbers of licenses have the financial capability to build out those licenses and are bidding in good faith. However, we reserve the right to institute caps in specific services if we are satisfied that an absolute dollar amount will provide sufficient deterrence against frivolous bidding and pernicious strategic bidding. Setting a minimum upfront payment may be appropriate when use of our preferred formula would result in a payment that would be too small. Although a general minimum upfront payment of $2,500 is reasonable, we retain the flexibility to modify this amount. 29. As a general matter, to protect the integrity of the auction process, all applicants should be required to tender their upfront payments to the Commission prior to bidding. However, given the likely magnitude of some upfront payments and the fact that there will be a significant interval between the date that short-form applications are filed and the auction date, we will not require the filing of upfront payments with short-form applications. Upfront payments will be required to be made to the Commission on a date to be announced by Public Notice, generally no later than 14 days before the scheduled auction. 30. Down Payment. A 20 percent down payment is appropriate to ensure that auction winners have the necessary financial capabilities to complete payment for the license and to pay for the costs of constructing a system and protect against possible default, while at the same time not being so onerous as to hinder growth and diminish access. We therefore will require that winning bidders supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to being their total deposits up to 20 percent of their winning bid(s). The down payment by cashier's check or wire transfer to our lock-box will generally be required within five business days after the auction is over. 31. Remainder of License Payment. The Commission will not permit licensees to satisfy their payment obligations to the Commission through the payment of royalties. With the exception of certain designated entities, we are requiring full payment of the remainder of the winning bid in a lump sum. This will leave financing to the private sector and eliminate the need for the Commission to conduct detailed credit checks. 32. Default and Disqualification. It is critically important to the success of our system of competitive bidding that potential bidders understand that there will be a substantial penalty assessed if they withdraw a high bid, are found not to be qualified to hold licenses, or default on a balance due. We will require any auction winner who defaults by failing to remit the required down payment within the prescribed time to reimburse the Commission in the amount of the difference between its high bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. 33. A defaulting auction winner will also be assessed a penalty of three percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the three percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bid's amount. This additional penalty will also apply if an auction winner is disqualified or fails to remit the balance of its winning bid after having made the required down payment. We will hold deposits made by defaulting or disqualified auction winners to help ensure that the penalty is paid.
