FR940606-1-00031 FR940606-1-00008 Semiannual reports are required to identify any waste stream whose RCRA or non-RCRA classification has changed. The semiannual report would also identify any new waste streams and whether each is RCRA or non-RCRA regulated. An annual report would be required if no changes occurred in the RCRA status to the existing waste streams and if no new waste streams were generated. III. Summary of Environmental, Energy, and Economic Impacts of the Proposed Standards A. Emission Reductions 1. Existing Facilities For the existing aerospace OEM and rework facilities (approximately 2,869 facilities in the base year 1991), the nationwide baseline HAP emissions are estimated to be 189,000 Mg/yr (208,000 tpy). Implementation of the proposed regulation would reduce these emissions by approximately 112,600 Mg/yr (123,700 tpy), or 59 percent. 2. New Facilities For the aerospace industry, no net growth is expected over the next five years; therefore, no net emission reduction due to new facilities is anticipated during this period. B. Secondary Environmental Impacts Secondary environmental impacts are considered to be any air, water, or solid waste impacts, positive or negative, associated with the implementation of the proposed standards. These impacts are exclusive of the direct air emission reductions discussed in the previous section. All of the impacts discussed below reflect the maximum increase or decrease, as appropriate, that would occur if all of the affected sources converted to the control option described. Some product reformulations that may be used to comply with the proposed standards for hand-wipe cleaning, primers, and topcoats may contain organic HAP or VOC not present in the original product. In these cases, different organic HAP or VOC may be emitted as a result of the proposed rule, but the overall level of these compounds that are emitted will decrease. Chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP used for depainting may result in increased VOC emissions when used to replace methylene chloride-based chemical strippers (methylene chloride is a HAP, but not a VOC). There is a potential for an impact on water quality resulting from some of the prescribed control measures. Under baseline conditions for chemical milling maskant operations, no wastewater is generated; however, some of the sources may install a carbon adsorber to control solvent emissions. If all affected sources use carbon adsorbers, the amount of water needed to create regenerating steam for these systems, which will add to the wastewater burden from these sources, is estimated to be 447 million gallons per year nationwide. For depainting operations, there are two options available for meeting the proposed rule, both of which will result in a decrease in the amount of wastewater generated compared to baseline, which is 251 million gallons per year. The decrease in wastewater nationwide is estimated to be 251 million gallons and 86 million gallons if all affected sources use dry media blasting or chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP, respectively. Sources installing a carbon adsorption system on their chemical milling maskant operations would generate additional solid waste due to the necessity of periodically disposing of spent activated carbon. If all affected sources use carbon adsorbers, this added nationwide solid waste burden is estimated to be 4,500 tons per year, compared to the baseline of 21,200 tons per year. Rework facilities that presently use a methylene chloride-based paint stripper must dispose of 3,469 tons per year of paint/solvent sludge created by depainting. A total conversion to dry media paint removal would produce an increase in the amount of solid waste composed of dry paint chips and spent blasting media. This increase in solid waste is estimated to be 13,280 tons per year on a nationwide basis. The proposed standards for the control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations would result in the increase in solid waste generation from the disposal of used dry filter media. The increased solid waste burden is estimated to be 640 tons per year, compared to the baseline solid waste generation of 3,540 tons per year.
