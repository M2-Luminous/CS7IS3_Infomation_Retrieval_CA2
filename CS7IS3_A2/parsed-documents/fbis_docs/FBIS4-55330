The Croatian side is accusing the Serbian army and Serbs in western Slavonia of having committed these murders. An official statement by the 18th Corps' command says: The corps' command was informed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] at 1800 on 12 May 1994 that a multiple murder had been committed. Five persons were killed and two others wounded in the village of Vukovije, northeast of Daruvar, at 2230 on 11 May. The corps' command expresses regret at this tragic event but vehemently denies any connection between corps' members and the incident in question. By resorting to its well-known propaganda methods, the Croatian side is trying, yet again, to accuse the Serb side--before the investigation conducted by UNPROFOR and the Croatian police has been concluded. We believe that such conduct is not conducive to the building of trust necessary for the implementation of the cease-fire agreement, says the statement issued by the 18th Corps of the SVK.
