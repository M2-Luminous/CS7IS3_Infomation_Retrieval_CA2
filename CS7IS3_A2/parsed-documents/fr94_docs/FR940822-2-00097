ACTION: Proposed grant guideline. SUMMARY: This Guideline sets forth the proposed administrative, programmatic, and financial requirements attendant to Fiscal Year 1995 State Justice Institute grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. EFFECTIVE DATE: The Institute invites public comment on the Guideline until September 21, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David I. Tevelin, Executive Director, or Richard Van Duizend, Deputy Director, State Justice Institute, 1650 King St. (Suite 600), Alexandria, VA 22314, (703) 684&hyph;6100. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to the State Justice Institute Act of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 10701, et seq., as amended, the Institute is authorized to award grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts to State and local courts, nonprofit organizations, and others for the purpose of improving the administration of justice in the State courts of the United States. Approximately $111/2 million is available for award in FY 1995. Types of Grants Available and Funding Schedules The SJI grant program is designed to be responsive to the most pressing needs of the State courts. The Institute accordingly offers six different types of grants, each of which responds to an important need of the State judiciaries. The types of grants available in FY 1995 and the funding cycles for each program are provided below: Project Grants These grants are awarded to support education, research, demonstration and technical assistance projects to improve the administration of justice in the State courts. With limited exceptions (see sections II.B.2.b.i. and II.C.), project grants are intended to support innovative projects of national significance. As provided in chapter V. of the Guideline, project grants, with limited exceptions, may not exceed $200,000 a year. Applicants must ordinarily submit a concept paper (see chapter VI.) and an application (see chapter VII.) in order to obtain a project grant. As indicated in section VI.C., the Board may make an ``accelerated'' project grant of less than $40,000 on the basis of the concept paper alone when the need for the project is clear and little additional information would be provided in an application. The FY 1995 mailing deadline for project grant concept papers is November 23, 1994. Papers must be postmarked or bear other evidence of submission by that date. With two exceptions noted immediately below, the FY 1995 funding cycle will be substantially similar to the FY 1994 cycle: the Board will meet in early March, 1995 to invite formal applications based on the most promising concept papers; applications will be due in May; and awards will be approved by the Board in July. The first exception to this schedule pertains to proposals to follow up on the National Conference on Mass Tort Litigation to be in November, 1994. Applicants interested in participating in this special round of funding may submit concept papers proposing projects addressing the findings and recommendations of that conference by March 10, 1995. The papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in April, 1995. Invited applications will be reviewed at the Board's July, 1995 meeting. See section II.B.2.l. The second exception is for projects to follow up on the National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts to be held March 2&hyph;5, 1995. Concept papers for projects to implement the State action plans developed at the conference must be mailed by October 6, 1995.
