Poltoranin disagreed with the notion that Russia's Choice used Gaydar's and Pamfilova's resignations to distance itself from the president. "We do not want it, and we hope that the president will not deviate from democratic principles. Then we will be with him," he said. Poltoranin qualified Gaydar's and Pamfilova's resignations as "a logical step stemming from the policy pursued by the Chernomyrdin group in the government." "It was a well-considered, not an impulsive, step, since the outlooks of Chernomyrdin and Gaydar differ greatly. Gaydar and the entire group of reformers have no right to serve as a cover for the degradation of the economy and management system. Gaydar's withdrawal is bad for Russia, but there is no other way out," Poltoranin stressed. Russia's Choice, he added, analyzed the situation earlier, and suggested a month before December's elections that Gaydar should resign and distance himself from the government "to stop being in the shadow of errors the government committed in 1993." "At that time this decision was not endorsed, since we did not want to introduce an element of destabilization in society and lose the new Constitution, because many people could decide not to vote because of it," Poltoranin said. "Today this factor no longer exists, and so we can make decisions more openly."
