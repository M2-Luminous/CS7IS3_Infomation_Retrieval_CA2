Potential Impact of California FIP and SIPs V. Conclusion I. Background The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act) required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure to meet the ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) to develop SIPs with sufficient control measures to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. The San Francisco Bay Area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS on March 3, 1978 (40 CFR 81.305). In accordance with section 110 of the 1977 Act, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted an ozone SIP as required by part D of the 1977 Act on July 25, 1979, which EPA took final action to approve in part, disapprove in part (lack of legal authority and legislation to implement an inspection and maintenance (I/M) program) and conditionally approve in part (resource and extension requirements for transportation control measures with respect to part D) on March 19, 1982 (47 FR 11866) with respect to the requirements of section 110 and part D of the 1977 Act. On July 26, 1983, CARB submitted the legislation and implementation schedule for an I/M program which EPA fully approved on November 25, 1983 (48 FR 53114). This approval rescinded EPA's earlier disapproval of the San Francisco Bay Area's SIP. On February 4, 1983, CARB submitted a SIP revision for the San Francisco Bay Area which projected attainment of the ozone and carbon monoxide NAAQS by 1987. EPA published final approval of this SIP revision and removed the earlier conditional approval for the San Francisco Bay Area on December 28, 1983 (48 FR 57130). In its SIP, CARB projected that the San Francisco Bay Area nonattainment area would attain the ozone standard by 1987. The area failed to attain the standard. In a May 26, 1988 letter, EPA issued a finding under section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Clean Air Act (the 1988 SIP-Call) that California's SIP for the San Francisco Bay Area was substantially inadequate to attain and maintain the NAAQS for ozone and carbon monoxide. This finding called on California to begin a two phase process which would lead to the revision of the plans. The first phase consisted of updating the emissions inventory, making certain corrections to the area's existing stationary source rules, and beginning to gather other pertinent data by August 1988. The second phase consisted of submitting a revised SIP containing changes necessary to attain the NAAQS. On June 13, 1989, EPA notified California that the deadline for the second phase of this SIP-Call was September 30, 1991. On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The ozone nonattainment designation for the San Francisco Bay Area continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990; furthermore, the area was classified by operation of law as moderate for ozone under section 181(a)(1). See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991), codified at 40 CFR 81.305. In a September 5, 1991 letter, EPA notified California that earlier deadlines for the SIP-Call were revised to conform with the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
