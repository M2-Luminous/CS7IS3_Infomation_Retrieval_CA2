In an exclusive statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC], Kliridhis refused to reveal the contents of the letters, but stressed that no talks should be held either on the CBM's or the substance of the issue because of Turkish intransigence. Commenting on the REUTER report, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas mentioned that Kliridhis is using blackmail and bluffing in order to get Varosha. Correspondent Dhimitrios Andreou reports: [Begin recording] [Andreou] President Kliridhis was at the Larnaca marina today. Will he reveal the contents of the letters he sent to Clinton and Major? [Kliridhis] I have sent letters to President Clinton and the British Prime Minister. Of course, these letters are related to the CBM's. The contents of the letters are confidential for now, but when the time is right they will be published. [Andreou] Kliridhis said that there can be no further discussion on the CBM's or the substance of the Cyprus issue now. He stressed that measures must first be taken to convince us that the other side has political will. The National Council agreed unanimously that talks on the CBM's must not continue and that the substance of the issue must not be discussed now because the Turkish side has no political will. [Kliridhis] In light of these events, our position is that if there is no significant change so that we can say that the other side has the political will for a solution, there is no space for further talks either on the CBM's or the substance of the issue. [Andreou] Kliridhis finally said that the Government and the Greek Cypriot side support the UN secretary general's positions on intense and detailed negotiations among the UN Security Council permanent members, the guarantor powers, the two communities, and Europe. [passage omitted] A REUTER bulletin from Nicosia dated 10 June mentions that it has copies of Kliridhis' letter to Major and Clinton and quotes: Having examined the situation carefully, I have reached the conclusion that if the UN Security Council decides that talks must continue on the CBM's, I would find it necessary to resign and declare presidential elections in October 1994. The new president will be free of the commitments that I have undertaken and will have to decide on new measures. The previous day, the Athens newspaper ETHNOS carried a similar report and CyBC asked government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis to comment on it. [Kasoulidhis] I don't know of anything. [Andreou] But in any case there is something.... [Kasoulidhis, interrupting] I have no knowledge of the report or what you are saying. [Andreou] Has the president not expressed any thoughts about resigning? [Kasoulidhis] I have answered that I know nothing about this issue. [Andreou] The spokesman avoided making any comment today either, stressing that Kliridhis' letters are confidential. [end recording]
