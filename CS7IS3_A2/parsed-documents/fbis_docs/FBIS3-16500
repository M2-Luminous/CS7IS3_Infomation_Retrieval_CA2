As our press correspondent, Andrei Barsan, reported in his speech given after the signing of the framework document, NATO General Secretary Manfred Woerner emphasized that by joining the PFP concept, the Republic of Moldova demonstrates that it shares the main objective pursued by the Alliance: Building a European order of peace that is based on the principles of democracy and human rights. Referring to problems in the east of Moldova, Manfred Woerner said that the Alliance supports a rapid and complete withdrawal of foreign troops from that area and hopes that a rapid peaceful solution may be found in connection with the said problems. In turn, President Mircea Snegur said that, as a trustworthy partner, Moldova will strengthen its bilateral relations with Central and East European countries and will cooperate honestly with the Euro-Atlantic security structures in accordance with the PFP principles and objectives. We pay special attention to the mechanism of consultations on security stipulated by the PFP, particularly when a participating state believes that it is facing a direct threat against its territorial integrity, political independence, and national security. This is all the more important since the said principles are questioned today by the presence of foreign troops on the territory of Moldova; something that represents the main obstacle for a definitive political solution to the conflict in the east of Moldova.
