An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this today from reliable sources in the republic's law enforcement bodies. At the same time, [spokesmen] at the republic's Ministries of Internal Affairs and Security would neither confirm or deny this fact, confining themselves to saying that a search operation was underway and any information on the subject could not be disclosed for the time being. At the same time, a highly-placed official from one of the power ministries was highly skeptical of the statement distributed to the mass media by the press center of the republic's procuracy general yesterday on the direct involvement in the act of terrorism of the antigovernment group of Mullo Kasym, in hiding in Kofirnikhonskiy rayon, a Dushanbe city suburb. This is only one of the many versions being worked on together with the other law enforcement bodies of the republic, he said. However, according to the source, experienced professionals have been called in in the search operation and one can rest assured that the real criminals will be found shortly.
