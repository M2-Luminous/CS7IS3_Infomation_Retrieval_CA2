Since the assessment was put forward last week noting that the result of the IAEA's nuclear inspection of North Korea is not satisfactory, an alarming [simsangchi anta] and heated atmosphere began to take place within the United States. In particular, as the IAEA notified the United States that it is going to convene a special meeting of its Board of Governors on 21 March to deal with the inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities by its inspection team, the United States, through a statement by the Department of State, revealed the possibility of the postponement or cancellation of the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks slated for 21 March. The U.S. Department of Defense also announced that it will discuss the issue of immediately resuming the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise by pointing out that the preconditions for the suspension of Team Spirit are the nuclear inspection and North-South high-level talks. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, the White House reportedly plans to hold an emergency high-level meeting soon with participation by secretaries of state and defense, as well as assistants for security affairs. Meanwhile, President Clinton said that if North Korea does not accept complete nuclear inspection promptly, resumption of the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise and deployment of Patriot missiles to U.S. Forces Korea would be the means of choice. Thus, a hardline trend against North Korea has been created within the United States since it was confirmed that the inspection activities of the IAEA inspection team were restricted by the North Korean authorities. In particular, an unprecedentedly strong hardline air regarding North Korean problems is prevailing in the U.S. Congress. At present, the hawk faction regarding policy toward North Korea constitutes the main force both in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. It is a reality that the hardline stance against North Korea is becoming more fierce not only within the U.S. Congress but also in the Department of Defense whose hardline conservative nature has been traditionally strong. In addition, the U.S. CIA is supplying various hawk faction members with intelligence materials that serve as the basis of the hardline stance against North Korea. As a result of a hardline stance becoming superior, the position of the U.S. Department of State, which is the only organization within the Clinton administration calling for a solution of problems pertaining to North Korea through dialogue, has been weakened to a considerable extent. Up until 18 March, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher stressed that "nothing has been decided regarding the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and a channel should be open for dialogue with North Korea even while working out measures for sanctions against it." However, under the present situation in which the much-expected exchange of special envoys between the North and the South has clearly gone across the river, such an allegation for diplomatic solution by the State Department is being melted away [pichul ilta]. Therefore, it can be said that the North Korean nuclear issue is at a turning point from the U.S. argument between hardline and moderate factions into the phase of international sanctions.
