After hearing leading comrades of the Song Be Provincial People's Committee criticize themselves for the wrongdoings they committed in legitimizing and allowing the operation of 273 illicitly imported cars -- the responsibility for which rests chiefly with the chairman of the provincial people's committee and his deputies who were directly in charge of this case -- the prime minister asked the chairman of the Song Be Provincial People's Committee to scrupulously carry out self-criticism, report the results to the provincial party standing committee, and propose the form and extent of disciplinary actions to be taken against the provincial people's committee collectively. As for the chairman and the two vice chairmen of the provincial people's committee directly involved in this case, they must scrupulously review their wrongdoings, propose the extent of disciplinary actions to be taken against themselves, for instance, resigning from their present positions so other comrades can replace them. This must be carried out in such a way as to ensure scrupulous law enforcement. Those state organs such as tax, security police, customs, and trade organs in Song Be that failed to take preventive measures against this wrongdoing and to report it to higher management organs and that are found to be involved in the wrongdoings must also ascertain their specific responsibilities so appropriate disciplinary actions can be taken against them.
