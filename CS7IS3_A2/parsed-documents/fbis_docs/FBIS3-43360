The eyes and hearts of the peace- and freedom-hungry Angolan people, in particular, will be following developments in Lusaka with great interest. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye was still in Luanda this morning, after quick diplomatic visits to Gabon and Zaire to explain the complexities of the Lusaka peace talks to the heads of state of those two African nations. Later, Blondin Beye left for the Zambian capital, where, according to him, things are likely to start happening at 1400 GMT. This second round of talks will concentrate solely on political issues, notably the formation of a new national police force, national reconciliation, UNITA's participation in government, the future role of the UN Angola Verification Mission-2, and the setting of a date for the cease-fire accord to come into force. Military issues had already been discussed and agreed on after about three weeks of talks.
