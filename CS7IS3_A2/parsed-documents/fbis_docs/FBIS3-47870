In the statements, the CIAJ -- which is made up of communications equipment manufacturers and other related businesses -- requested the Japanese Government reject U.S. demands for setting numerical targets. The industry trade group also strongly requested that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Corporation be exempt from trade agreements. The statements were submitted together with supplementary data which included actual import-export figures between Japan and the United States for telecommunications equipment as well as the current situation regarding procurement of communications equipment by the governments of both nations. Among requests listed in the statements were: 1) that Japan and the United States conduct trade talks on a two-way basis; 2) that objective criteria which could become numerical targets should be eliminated in the talks; 3) that trade agreements should be made in the spirit of the GATT accords on government procurement; and 4) that NTT be exempt from trade agreements.
