Speaking without text, Suharto said there was no need for the public to be restless as the existing mechanism for national leadership change in a cycle of every five years through general elections followed by election of president and vice president by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) sitting a plenary session has been practiced without fail all this time. He said the election of a president would move smoothly as long as the MPR sticks to the procedure of drawing up the state policy guideline (GBHN) first and choosing the MPR's mandatory or president (to execute the GBHN) second, and not the other way round. He said: "There will be no problem for the MPR as long as it discharges its duty in accordance with the mechanism that has proven its effectiveness all this time." The president counselled, however, that the public should not magnify whatever weaknesses the candidate for president might have in such a fashion as to brush aside the positive qualities that he may also be blessed with. For no person is faultless, including the future presidential candidate, he said. But even if there is no perfect person, he added, someone has to be trusted to act as a mandatory of the MPR or president. "Someone just has to be trusted as leader," he said. The ulemas hosted by the president represented Indonesia's major Islamic organizations such as the Council of Indonesian Ulemas (MUI), the Nahdlatul Ulema (NU) [Association of Muslim Scholars], the Indonesian Islamic Missionary Council (DDI), and Muhammadiyah. Among them were K.H. Hasan Basri, Anwar Haryono, Azhar Basir, Jakiah Drajat, Tuti Alawiyah, and Suryani Tahir.
