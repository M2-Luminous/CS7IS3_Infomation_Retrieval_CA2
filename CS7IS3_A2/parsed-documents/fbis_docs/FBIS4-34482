Cuba also confirmed that it will not grant anyone authorization to leave the country if they have entered a diplomatic mission by force, even if they subsequently leave the mission. No exceptions will be made. A Minrex statement made reference to these actions, which first occurred on 28 May, by groups of people who entered the Belgian ambassador's residence, the German Embassy, and the Chilean Consulate in this capital. Minrex indicated, as is known, that these actions are promoted from abroad as political propaganda and that the people involved in these actions are not subject to political persecution in any way. They have been denied a visa to legally travel by foreign countries. It adds that in the first two cases, Cuba had reiterated its position of principle on the illegality and the unacceptability of the practice of violating the diplomatic mission's immunity as a way to emigrate to other nations. It also points out, with regard to the Chilean Consulate, that by-laws regarding representation are different from those regarding diplomatic missions, therefore, no one can seek to obtain "protection at that site." Minrex recalled that the practice of entering diplomatic missions or consulates in that manner, besides violating Cuban laws, also violates the principles provided for in international law and in these same type of agreements. It indicated that the sole solution for the people who have committed the abovementioned crime is to leave the occupied buildings peacefully and return to their homes. No legal action will be taken against them. It signals that exoneration laws make reference to the action of illegally entering a site but do not, of course, include any other type of crime committed previously or during the violent entry into those sites. Cuba assumes that position, the ministry states, to demonstrate its goodwill to the governments involved and to ease the way for the quickest solution to the problem, even though, by committing those criminal actions, these persons are joining the anti-Cuban campaign that is being promoted abroad and that violates the nation's laws. In its statement, Minrex points out that the diplomatic missions, in turn, should take into account that the best guarantee for their own immunity lies in respecting the laws in force in the country to which they are accredited and that their duties should be carried out within the framework of this ruling and international law. It concludes that the Vienna Agreement clearly indicates that diplomatic missions must respect the local laws and not meddle in the nation's internal matters and that their sites should not to be used in ways incompatible with their duties.
