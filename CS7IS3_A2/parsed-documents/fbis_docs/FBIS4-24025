The sources said that the group of about 15 French soldiers preparing for the Rwandan mission code-named "Operation Turquoise" were holding talks with ranking Zairian officials to decide how the French-led intervention force could transit via Zaire. The report came as two Belgian newspapers said Tuesday that some French troops had already arrived in Rwanda from Zaire, without waiting for the green light from the UN Security Council. According to the LE SOIR newspaper, "the French have apparently already crossed the border and are at Cyangugu where the Kamembe runway has already been repaired, as the Kigali airport was judged to be unusable," LE SOIR said. Cyangugu lies in southwestern Rwanda, across the border from Zaire. The Flemish-language GAZET VAN ANTWERPEN also reported that French soldiers were already in Rwanda, quoting reliable sources, but did not say where they were or give their number. A French draft resolution introduced in the UN Security Council on Monday said the French deployment, expected to involve 1,000 to 2,000 troops, would last until the UN mission in the central African state could muster reinforcements. It would end in mid-August at the latest.
