But as the type-B stocks supplied for transactions by foreign investors in China have a small trading volume and are inconvenient to trade, figures in Chinese securities circles have been holding recently that the type-B standing is very likely to be eliminated, to be replaced by the type-H, or even for all five types to be consolidated into one. China's Stock Markets: "One Country, Five Systems" While Hong Kong's stock market is repeatedly setting new records, China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets are continuing to fluctuate at a low level, down nearly one-half from their peaks. And China's type-B stocks have nothing good or unusual to be reported about, performing even more weakly in Shenzhen than in Shanghai, generally reflecting even less strength. On 18 October 1993, the Shanghai B-share index stood at 73.45, which closing price was down 24 percent from its high of 96.68 on 24 February, but up 43 percent from its low of 51.39 on 27 July. And the Shenzhen B-share index's closing price of 113.58 was down 38.75 percent from its high of 185.44 on 8 February, but up 40 percent from its low of 80.63 on 6 August. K'uang Wei-t'ien [6782 4850 3240], managing director of the New China-Hong Kong Finance Corp Ltd and the New China-HK Financial Advice Corp Ltd, tells PAISHING, "As a commercial bank, New China-HK can concentrate its attention to China's stock markets only on A and H shares, with B shares having limited growth prospects, so that the `one country, two systems' is quite adequate, and there is no need for `one country, multiple systems.' It would be best to replace B shares with H shares while the B-share market has not yet grown to maturity." Shanghai B Shares Beat Out Shenzhen B Shares Supposing a consolidated stock system, Huang Pin-yuan [7806 2430 0337], director of the New Hungchi Investment Service Corp Ltd, holds that two conditions must be met: 1. The authorities must allow A shares to be provided for trading by foreign investors, to attract foreign investment funds. 2. The renminbi must be made freely convertible to foreign currencies, so that A and B shares can be merged. And the H shares listed in Hong Kong must have a secondary-listing status equal to that of Chinese enterprises outside of China. B shares have never had a brisk trading volume on either the Shenzhen or Shanghai stock exchanges. As to B-share prospects in these two places, Huang Pin-yuan holds that the short-term B-share prospects differ for Shanghai and Shenzhen. He points out that as Shenzhen has a weaker economic setting, plus mostly real estate speculation business, foreign capital is less interested. But as Shanghai has a 5- to 6-decade history of economic development, as well as a better industrial and commercial base than Shenzhen, it can attract a certain amount of foreign investment capital. B Shares Are Only "Second-Squad" Liu Wei-kang [0491 4850 0474], research department director of the Paota Securities Corp Ltd (Hong Kong), also says that as B shares per se have a low issue volume, an inadequate trading volume, little fundraising capacity, and not much impact, they should be gradually eliminated and replaced in the long term. Liu Wei-kang explains that while B shares, just like on a soccer team, originally wanted to be promoted to the "A team," they were too weak, being merely the first-kick "B squad," to be promoted to the "A team" only at the right time in the game. So B shares used Shenzhen and Shanghai as "practice fields," hoping for further development only by waiting for growth to maturity. Liu Wei-kang holds that as 1997 approaches, the already low-impact B shares will have steadily less impact. So he believes that B shares should be gradually replaced by H shares. Huang Pin-yuan tells PAISHING that on 18 October in Shanghai, the market value was 83 billion yuan for A shares, but 5.8 billion yuan for B shares. In Shenzhen, this was 54.7 billion yuan for A shares, but 6.95 billion yuan for B shares. This left the B-share market value temporarily one-half to one-third that of A shares. B Shares Are Likely To Be Replaced by A and H Shares While China's economic drive comes from its own investors, meaning that the status of A shares is most important, A shares are subject to the temporary defect of not being able to compete for foreign exchange. K'uang Wei-t'ien points out, "While Chinese A shares cannot yet compete for foreign exchange, they can use other forms, such as directly listing their companies in Hong Kong, in either A or H form. In addition to Hong Kong, they can also consider listings in London, England and New York, U.S.A." As Hong Kong's stock market system, time lag, communications, and transportation are all fine and suited to China, Chinese stock listings should first consider Hong Kong. K'uang Wei-t'ien says, "If A shares could be listed also in Hong Kong, they would not only have a larger circulation volume, but also would be subject to easier operation. Once Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, commercial banks should concentrate on expanding A- and H-share markets." B Shares Should Be Eliminated While They Are Still Immature The conversion of B shares to H shares is a general trend. K'uang Wei-t'ien states, "As Chinese B shares number only some 30+, this means that it is necessary to use a better system to handle their replacement in the current stage." Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp holdings also include the two types of "Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp London-registered" shares priced in either Hong Kong dollars and British pounds, with some companies also having set the precedent of converting preferred to common stock. K'uang Wei-t'ien says, "The conversion of B to H shares is not as simple as the conversion of preferred to common stock, as China's conditions differ somewhat from Hong Kong's. And while each company's structure and conditions also differ, meaning that listings must conform to Hong Kong standards, the listing of quality Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong is an inevitable trend." In addition, the market-profit-rate of Chinese B shares also differs from that of A shares, with K'uang Wei-t'ien admitting that the B-share market-profit-rate does not reflect market conditions. In the conversion of B to H shares, the prices of B shares might come under pressure. K'uang Wei-t'ien points out that "lower stock prices, as long as they are a normal market activity, would not be too great a problem." Overseas Capital Does Not Favor B Shares The listing of B shares is of a short-term nature, never having had much circulation volume. As to overseas investors, a larger trading volume causes sharp volatility in stock prices, meaning also taking greater risks. Due to this inherent shortcoming, B shares have never been preferred by foreigners. But Huang Pin-yuan points out that as B shares bring nice profits in Shenzhen, as well as having a lower market profit rate, it is believed that they still have certain short-term prospects. While Huang Pin-yuan predicts that achieving a uniform shareholding system cannot be accomplished in a few short months, he believes that it will certainly be resolved within a decade. And state and corporate shares will also have to be converted to A shares.
