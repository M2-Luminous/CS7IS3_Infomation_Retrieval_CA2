"Whoever changes borders through the use of force cannot count on the support of Germany," Kohl said in the so far sharpest statement addressed to Croatia, according to foreign news agencies. Kohl spoke at a meeting of around 200 ranking Western officials and security experts in Munich. Kohl, whose country had wholeheartedly supported Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation, said he would "not support anyone who oversteps the limits of normal, acceptable behaviour under international law." Germany was the one to push the then European Community into recognizing Croatia in early January 1992. The U.N. Security Council on Thursday threatened to introduce sanctions against Croatia because of the presence of its regular army troops in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to U.N. estimates, between 3,000 and 5,000 regular Croatian Army troops are fighting on the side of Bosnian Croats against the Muslims.
