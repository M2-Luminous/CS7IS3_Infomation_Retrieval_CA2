"If the Serbs do not withdraw their artillery pieces, bombs will have to fall. Then the Germans must not stand aside," Waigel said during the CSU's traditional fish dinner in Schwabing in Munich on Friday evening [18 February]. One cannot sit forever in front of the television screens and express one's dismay, Waigel said. "Action must finally be taken now." The threat, with well-aimed air strikes against the Serbian artillery positions and lines, is the only promising means "to stop the murderers, rapists, and looters."
