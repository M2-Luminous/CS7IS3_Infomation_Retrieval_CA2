The head of the Russian delegation to the talks with Latvia, Ambassador Sergey Zotov, told Interfax that the main Russian-Latvian treaty providing for the withdrawal date might be signed only if all the other three agreements, in the first place that on social guarantees for Russian military pensioners and their families residing in Latvia, were signed at the same time. The Russian diplomat said that the summit could be held in the near future, as soon as Latvia was ready to sign all the four agreements at the same time. The package includes the main treaty setting the withdrawal date as August 31, an agreement on the functioning of a radar station in Skrunda for another five and a half years, another one on social guarantees for Russian servicemen for the withdrawal period and the other one on social guarantees for Russian military pensioners. The Latvian leadership declared its readiness to sign the first three documents, though it has been opposing the signing of the agreement on military pensioners.
