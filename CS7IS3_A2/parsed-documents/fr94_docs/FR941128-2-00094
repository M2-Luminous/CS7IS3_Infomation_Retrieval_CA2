FR941128-2-00094 FR941128-2-00047 (e) Entry into the relevant markets may be more difficult because it will require entry at more than one level; (f) Competition among drug wholesalers may be reduced because of the competitive advantage that control over Lilly drugs will provide McKesson; and, (g) The price of pharmaceuticals is likely to increase and the quality of the pharmaceuticals available to consumers is likely to diminish. The Complaint further alleges that the proposed acquisition of McKesson by Lilly would, if consummated, violate section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. It further alleges that the Agreement and Plan of Merger between Lilly and McKesson violates section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. The Order requires Lilly to maintain an open formulary, and provides that the existing open PCS formulary will comply with this provision. A copy of this formulary is appended to the Order. For the purposes of the Order an open formulary is defined as a formulary that allows the inclusion of any ambulatory ( i.e. , non-hospital) prescription drug product which the PCS independent Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (``P&T Committee) determines is appropriate for inclusion in such formulary. The Order requires that Lilly appoint an independent P&T Committee to administer the open formulary. This committee will make all decisions concerning the inclusion and exclusion of drugs on the open formulary. The order sets forth the parameters under which the P&T Committee is to operate. The Order also requires that Lilly cause PCS to accept all discounts, rebates or other concessions offered by any other manufacturer of pharmaceutical products on the open formulary, and requires that all such discounts, rebates and concessions be truthfully and accurately reflected in determining relative rankings of products on the open formulary. Nothing in the Order prohibits Lilly from offering closed formularies as well as the open formulary. The Order also prohibits Lilly and PCS from providing, disclosing, or otherwise making available to each other Non-Public Information. This includes information concerning other persons' bids, proposals, contracts, prices, rebates, discounts, or other terms and conditions of sale. The Order also requires Lilly to retain all documents, and cause PCS to separately retain all documents, for five years, relating to the exclusion of any prescription drugs from the open formulary, any preference or ranking accorded to any prescription drug on the open formulary, and statements or indications of discounts, rebates or other concessions. The Order also requires Lilly to make known the availability of the open formulary to persons who currently have a PBM service agreement of formulary agreement with PCS, and (for a period of five years) to prospective customers. The Order also prohibits Lilly, for a period of five (5) years from the date the Order becomes final, from: Acquiring, without the prior approval of the Commission, any stock, share capital, equity, leasehold or other interest in any person, corporate or non-corporate, engaged in the providing of Formulary Services in the United States, if such person has more than two (2) million lives covered by its Formulary Services in the United States; acquiring any assets used for, or previously used for (and still suitable for use for), the providing of Formulary Services in the United States from any person who has (or had within the two years preceding such acquisition) more than two (2) million lives covered by its Formulary Services in the United States; or entering into any agreement, understanding, or condition with McKesson or any wholesaler of pharmaceutical products that Lilly will sell or distribute pharmaceutical products bearing any brand or trade name used by Lilly, in the United States or any part of the United States, exclusively through such wholesaler. The Order also compels Lilly to fulfill certain standard notification, reporting and inspection requirements. The Order terminates ten years from the date it becomes final. It is anticipated that the Order would resolve the competitive problems alleged in the Complaint. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and Order or to modify it in any way. The proposed consent order has been entered into for settlement purposes only, and does not constitute an admission by the respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in the complaint. Donald S. Clark, Secretary.
