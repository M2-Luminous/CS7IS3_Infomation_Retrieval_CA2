We wish to extend our festival greetings to workers, peasants, intellectuals and all laboring people of various nationalities in the whole country! This year will be a crucial year for accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. We have to carry out the reform of the economic structure under the premise of maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and also have to realize a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development under the situation of speeding up the reform of the economic structure. Therefore, we are required to do a lot of work and must correctly handle the relations between reform, development and stability, because those efforts are extremely important to having a good control of the overall situation and to doing a good job in this year's work. We must firmly rely on the working class and give full play to the role of the working class as the main force in deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability. In order to give full play to the role of the working class as the main force in the course of reform, we must widely and penetratingly publicize the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and encourage the broad masses of staff members and workers to understand, support, participate in, and promote reform. The working class was, is, and will be, the advanced productive force. The change of enterprises' operational mechanism and the establishment of a modern enterprise system are important links in the change of the economic structure. They are closely related to the personal interests of staff members and workers of enterprises, and they cannot achieve success without the understanding and support of the broad masses of staff members and workers. Reform will not change the staff members' and workers' position of being the masters of the country. Moreover, reform is to better whip up and develop the enthusiasm of staff members and workers, and to strengthen enterprises' vitality and vigor in the increasingly fierce competition of the market. In the course of carrying out reform by enterprises, we should actively explore new forms of democratic management and democratic supervision, protect the position of staff members and workers as the masters of the country, guarantee their power of using their due rights, and ensure that they will fulfill their own obligations. To give full play to the role of the working class as the main force in the development, we must turn the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the broad masses of staff members and workers into increasing production, practicing economy, raising quality, adding variety, increasing economic efficiency and carrying out technological innovation and also into running well enterprises and promoting the development of the productive force. Statistical data have shown that the work of staff members and workers of the whole country accounts for approximately 70 percent of the gross domestic product, or more than 90 percent of state revenues. Over the past decade and more, our country's economic power and combined national strength has increased significantly and we have made achievements which have attracted worldwide attention. The hard work of the working class is, in particular, inseparable to the consecutive high speed of economic growth in the past two years. In the future, the working class will also continuously make new contributions to the revitalization of the Chinese nation. To bring into play the role of the working class as the main force in maintaining stability, we should thoroughly guarantee the working class' lawful rights and interests as stipulated in the constitution and other laws. China is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants; hence, the working class shoulders an important responsibility toward the country's long-term stability, order, and prosperity. Workers should pay attention to ideals, discipline, unity, and overall interests; should conscientiously subordinate individual to collective interests, local to national interests, and immediate to long-range interests; and should strive to maintain social stability and to safeguard the political situation characterized by stability and unity. To carry out the great historic mission during the great social transformation, Chinese workers should step up the effort at study in order to comprehensively improve their quality. They should diligently study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, enhance their awareness and steadfastness in implementing the party's basic line, and play an active role in building material and spiritual civilizations. They should study some rudimentary knowledge, basic theory, and legal knowledge on socialist market economy so that they can keep a clear head during the change of economic structure and be clearly aware of their position and role in reform. They should also study knowledge on management and operation, as well as science and technology, so that they can improve their skills in the socialist modernization drive. To show concern for workers' livelihood and solve their practical problems is an important guarantee for bringing into better play the working class' role as the main force. Due to various reasons, some workers' living standards have improved slowly, and some have even encountered passing difficulties. Party committees, governments, and trade union organizations at all levels should, with a profound sense of responsibility, show concern for workers' livelihood and do everything possible to help them overcome difficulties. The fundamental way of solving problems lies in deepening reform and developing the economy. While solving problems, it is necessary to explain to workers why some problems are difficult to be solved immediately or completely. The party Central Committee has time and again instructed party organizations and leading cadres at all level to serve the people wholeheartedly, to forge close ties with the masses, and to show concern for their everyday life. Trade union organizations at all levels should listen attentively to the views of the masses, promptly and accurately reflect them to party and government departments, and try their utmost to help the masses. Recently the All-China Federation of Trade Unions launched a "show-compassion project" nationwide in a bid to mobilize various quarters of society to help solve problems for workers and enterprises plagued with difficulties. The project is essential and timely for enhancing the confidence and courage of enterprises and workers to tide over difficulties. Party committees and governments at all levels, as well as the whole society, should actively support this project to show the compassion of the party and the government for workers in distress. Led by the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, the large numbers of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other working people throughout the country should unite more closely and work hard and adroitly with an indomitable spirit to create a bright future for our country and hundreds of millions of workers through reform and construction.
