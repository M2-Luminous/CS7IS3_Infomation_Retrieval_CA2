FR940822-0-00024 FR940822-0-00009 On September 20, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;7&hyph;93) relating to tax-free exports of vaccine was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 48801). On November 29, 1993, temporary regulations (TD 8497) relating to the vaccine floor stocks tax were published in the Federal Register (58 FR 62524). A notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;50&hyph;93) cross-referencing the temporary regulations was published in the Federal Register for the same day (58 FR 62558). No comments responding to PS&hyph;7&hyph;93 were received. Written comments responding to PS&hyph;50&hyph;93 were received, but no public hearing was requested or held. After consideration of all comments, the proposed vaccine export regulations and the proposed vaccine floor stocks regulations are adopted by this Treasury decision, and the temporary regulations relating to the vaccine floor stocks tax are removed. Summary of Comments All of the comments received on PS&hyph;50&hyph;93 addressed the de minimis exception to the floor stocks tax. The proposed regulations provide that any person whose liability for tax does not exceed $1,000 is not required to report or pay the floor stocks tax. One comment requested that the de minimis amount be increased to $10,000. The de minimis exception was established for the administrative convenience of the IRS to eliminate the necessity of processing returns from persons holding small amounts of vaccines and having a small tax liability. The $1,000 de minimis amount is adequate for this purpose and the comment is, therefore, not adopted. Another comment suggested that the exception be applied on a physician-by-physician basis so that a group practice (such as a partnership or professional corporation) would have a de minimis amount proportionate to the size of the group. As noted, increasing the amount of the de minimis exception is not consistent with its purpose. Further, if adopted, this suggestion could increase the administrative burdens of the tax. For example, allocation problems would arise if a physician is engaged in practice through more than one group (such as a partnership and a clinic or hospital). Accordingly, this suggestion is not adopted. The comment also suggested that the de minimis exception be treated as an exemption and that only amounts of tax in excess of $1,000 be reported or paid. This suggestion is inconsistent with the limited purpose of the exception_to eliminate small returns. It is, therefore, not adopted. Fuel Floor Stocks Background OBRA 1993 makes several changes to the Code with respect to the taxation of motor fuels. First, effective October 1, 1993, it increases the rates of excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel. The gasoline tax, under section 4081, increases from 14.1 cents per gallon to 18.4 cents per gallon; the diesel fuel tax, under section 4091, increases from 20.1 cents per gallon to 24.4 cents per gallon; and the aviation fuel tax, under section 4091, increases from 17.6 cents per gallon to 21.9 cents per gallon. These new rates include the 0.1-cent-per- gallon tax that funds the Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund. Second, effective January 1, 1994, OBRA 1993 generally moves the point of imposition of tax on diesel fuel to the terminal rack. Third, effective October 1, 1995, OBRA 1993 increases the tax on fuel used in commercial aviation by 4.3 cents per gallon. OBRA 1993 also imposes three floor stocks taxes, which are not codified, on these fuels. The taxes are to be paid by persons holding fuel on the effective dates of the changes. The first floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel that are held at the first moment of October 1, 1993, at a point in the distribution chain where these fuels would not otherwise be subject to the increased tax rates. The rate of the October 1, 1993, floor stocks tax is 4.3 cents per gallon. The second floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on diesel fuel held by any person at the first moment of January 1, 1994, if (A) no tax was imposed on the fuel under section 4041(a) or 4091 as in effect on December 31, 1993, and (B) tax would have been imposed by section 4081, as amended by OBRA 1993, on any prior removal, entry, or sale of the fuel had section 4081 applied to the fuel for periods before January 1, 1994. The rate of the January 1, 1994, floor stocks tax is 24.4 cents per gallon. The third floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on commercial aviation fuel held by any person at the first moment of October 1, 1995, on which the LUST tax was imposed under section 4091 before October 1, 1995. The rate of the October 1, 1995, floor stocks tax is 4.3 cents per gallon. On November 29, 1993, temporary regulations (TD 8498) were published in the Federal Register (58 FR 62526). A notice of proposed rulemaking (PS&hyph;49&hyph;93) cross-referencing the temporary regulations was published in the Federal Register for the same day (58 FR 62559).
