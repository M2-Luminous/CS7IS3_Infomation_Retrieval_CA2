[passage omitted] This evening the OAU--the Organization of African Unity--is refusing to support this intervention. In particular, the OAU is raising the dangers that such an operation could entail. Ghislaine Dupont has just spoken on the telephone to Pascal Gayana, deputy secretary general of the organization: [Begin Gayana recording] The OAU is expressing a position as a continental organization. On the whole, it was surprised to see that a member of the United Nations had initiated an individual action at a time when the pan-African organization had embarked upon an action at the Tunis summit for which it hoped to get the support of the members of the international community--including France, of course. It is something of a surprise for us. We think this is a surprise, given that the African states had committed themselves to supplying troops in accordance with the relevant resolution of the United Nations on Unamir and were waiting for the members of the international community and of the Security Council, in particular, to supply as agreed the necessary means. We understand, in a general way, the motives as they have been set forth by France, but we are sorry that this was not done in a concerted framework. [end recording] [passage omitted] On the French side--despite the various fears and controversies-- there is still an obvious determination to act, but Prime Minister Edouard Balladur did, nevertheless, tone down his speech to the deputies this afternoon. He named five [as heard] conditions that appear to limit the scope of the intervention. Bernard Pons, chairman of the Rally for the Republic group in the Assembly, listed them: [Begin Pons recording] The first is that the intervention should be done with the authorization of the United Nations. The second is that all precautions should be taken in order to set a time limit for this operation. The third is that there should under no circumstances be any operations in the heart of Rwandan territory, but the bases for the intervention should be in a neighboring country, at the borders of a neighboring country, in Zairean territory. Balladur also pointed out that other countries must take part in the operation. I think as far as Europe is concerned he has agreement from Italy, and a certain number of African countries have given their agreement. I do not yet know how they will participate. So there are some conditions that the prime minister regards as essential. A number of deputies have expressed, not reservations, but concerns. The prime minister has told them that he quite understood these concerns, and this was why he believed there were a number of conditions that it was essential to respect.
