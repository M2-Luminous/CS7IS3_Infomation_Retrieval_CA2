The arrival at Gudauta Airfield of military-transport aviation aircraft does not signify the beginning of a peacekeeping operation by the Russian Armed Forces in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. This operation can only begin after ratification by the Federation Council of the edict by the Russian president. The arrival in Gudauta of a signal center and combat-engineer battalion was proposed as a preparatory stage for the introduction of peacekeeping forces. Their main task is to clear the area of mines and to establish communications with the command posts. As Colonel General G. Kondratyev stated at the meeting with journalists, the introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces into the zone separating the warring sides may only be effected after the adoption by parliament's upper house of the relevant decision. Subunits from the 345th Airborne Regiment stationed in Gudauta will not take part in peacekeeping operations. Russia's deputy defense minister expressed the hope that a political decision by the supreme legislative bodies will facilitate the establishment of peace on this land.
