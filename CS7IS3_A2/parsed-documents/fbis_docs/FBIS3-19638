How serious are these signs this weekend [19-20 March], in your view? [Kinkel] There is, at least, a small ray of hope. Everything you mentioned before indicates the small but important steps forward have been possible, in particular the signing of the agreement between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims in Washington last Thursday and Friday, which I attended. This was a first, important agreement between two of the three parties to the conflict, and the decisive thing now is -- and all participants agreed on that -- to include the third party, the Serbs. I hope this will be possible. [Timm] How are the Serbs to be included? Serbian leader Karadzic has announced conditions -- the most important of them probably is the lifting of the UN sanctions so that, as he said, the Serbs can sit at the negotiating table with equal rights. Is this a condition that can be fulfilled? [Kinkel] First of all, there are already talks. Of course, now it will be decisive how much influence the Russians can exert on the Serbian side in this connection. The basis of the Washington agreement was the European action plan, which, for its part, was based on the Kinkel-Juppe initiative, which, in the end, envisaged that the Serbian side would be promised a suspension of the sanctions -- not a lifting of the sanctions, but a suspension --if specific steps toward peace are taken beforehand. The question of sanctions -- this is also something that we, as the European Union troika, extensively discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and with all other foreign ministers present in Washington on Friday -- will now have to make a decisive contribution to whether progress is made. However, cautious action will be necessary in this respect. As I said, first the Serbian side must do something and only then can there be a suspension of very specific sanctions. [Timm] The lifting of the blockade of the roads into Maglaj by the Serbs yesterday -- is this a concession that would be expected? [Kinkel] In any case, it is a gratifying sign. Maglaj has been in a very, very difficult situation for months. You saw the pictures on television, how these convoys were received with joy. I can only say: Now, after the partial solution that has been achieved for Sarajevo -- we do not yet have a definite political solution there -- we must now try to extinguish the other sources of fire, so to speak, one after the other. This includes Maglaj. It also includes other towns that are besieged and difficult areas. In addition to the political process, which now requires in particular the inclusion of the Serbs, we must try to come to grips with these other sources of fire in practice and, above all, gradually bring the humanitarian relief convoys to all those places where there is still terrible suffering. [Timm] What role do the Europeans still play in this peace process? After all, one gets the impression that progress is mainly achieved through the mediation of the United States and Russia. [Kinkel] This is certainly correct. It was very important that the Americans got more closely involved. However, the basis of the agreement achieved last weekend was the preparatory work done by the Europeans and also --something that is easily forgotten -- the preparatory work done by Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. This means we are still massively involved in the process. Above all, it will be necessary for the Europeans to be very closely involved in the implementation of a peace treaty. Therefore, on Friday we also talked about the fact that administration by the European Union is envisaged for Mostar, and we, the Germans, want to provide an administrator there. I discussed the matter once again with Mr. Tudjman and Mr. Izetbegovic on Friday. They are both still very much in favor of having the matter done in this way. [Timm] Americans and Russians are also playing a similar role in the peace process in the Middle East. They are also godfathers of that peace process. Israel and the PLO have been talking to each other again since yesterday. The resumption of the official talks seems to be imminent. What are the prospects for peace like there? And here, too, the question: Which role can the Europeans play in this process? [Kinkel] First of all, the Russians are not playing any decisive role in the Middle East process. It is, indeed, the Americans who are doing that. On 18 March the UN Security Council adopted a resolution on the terrible massacre in Hebron after more than three weeks of deliberations -- a resolution that contains a condemnation, an appeal to Israel to disarm the settlers, and a call on Israel to take measures to protect Palestinian civilians, including the international presence. In this connection, we, Europeans, will also participate. However, in particular we also have the task of providing economic aid there. We have done that in the past and we are now doing that very strongly with our involvement in the occupied territories, bilaterally as Germans and, above all, also as the European Union. Large amounts of money have been provided. Now help must be provided in Gaza and in Jericho. That is, the Europeans are facing quite a lot there. [Timm] Mr. Kinkel, there are prospects for peace in Bosnia -- even though they are vague -- and in the Middle East. Another hotbed of crisis brought itself to people's attention on the weekend, namely North Korea. The U.S. secretary of state now wants to come to trade sanctions in the UN Security Council. How explosive is the situation there, in your view? [Kinkel] Well, what has happened there over the past few days is unpleasant. It is true that North Korea is not at all willing to join the Nonproliferation Treaty. On the contrary, threats have been voiced. This is alarming. It would be important that, above all, the Chinese, who have the greatest possibility to exert influence, get involved there strongly. Of course, it is also important that the UN Security Council discuss how the events that are on the horizon in this connection can be contained. I do not want to start speaking of the devil, but the development is quite certainly not gratifying. [Timm] Mr. Kinkel, in conclusion one more question to the chairman of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. Yesterday there were local elections in Schleswig-Holstein. Once again, the FDP stayed below the 5-percent threshold at the land level -- it achieved 4.4 percent. A week ago, after the Landtag elections in Lower Saxony, you said that the FDP must simply get better. Does it have to get even better as a result of yesterday's elections? [Kinkel] First of all, the result is not gratifying. There is no reason to whitewash anything. However, one must not overestimate local elections. One must understand that the free voters' associations have not achieved bad results there, as far as I can tell by the first reports. If one looks at the entire picture, we were able to stop a trend to a certain extent, which is doubtlessly not working for us at the moment. However, once again, this is not a gratifying result, but one must not overestimate it. I am certain that the FDP will catch up again. We must do everything and roll up our sleeves so that this happens in practice. We will discuss this matter in the Presidium later today. I repeat that one must not lose one's calm and deviate from one's course now. At the moment we simply have problems also because everything that is not working in this country is blamed on those who are in the government in Bonn and we have to take the blame for some difficulties that exist objectively. We will get out of this negative trend and will manage it. I am sure of that and, I say once again, one needs good nerves for that. On the weekend I attended two party congresses. Things will start moving upward again.
