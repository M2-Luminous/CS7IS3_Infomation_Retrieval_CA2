The joint venture will engage in the contract analysis of point-of-sale (POS) data and attendant consulting services offered to retailers and manufacturers. The joint venture was entered into under the assessment that U.S.-style leading-edge data analysis know-how could play a useful role in Japan amidst rapid changes taking place in the marketing field based on manufacturer-retailer collaboration. The joint venture will assume the provisional name of "Japan Information Resources." Capitalization has not been determined thus far, but ownership will be set at 60 percent for IRIC and 40 percent for Mitsui. The new venture will contract with super markets, drug stores and clothing chains to gather on-line POS data. It will contract to analyze sales trends for retail outlets as well as furnish advice on changes in categorical sales data and appropriate stockage levels based on a cross-section of data. The venture will also have the capability to measure changes in sales trends based on modifications to display methods and price cuts and the scope and effectiveness of promotional gimmicks offered by manufacturers such as discount coupons and flyers. Additionally, the joint venture will engage in comprehensive consulting projects such as linking manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers into optimum marketing systems. In U.S. marketing circles, POS systems and on-line receiving and order systems are integrated to provide for rapid reaction to changes in sales patterns and to reduce marketing costs. IRIC plays a behind-the-scenes role and maintains data networks with retailers and manufacturers. On the other hand, Mitsui will use the joint venture to establish collaborative relationships with domestic manufacturers and retailers. Mitsui also intends to use the joint venture to acquire additional clients for its own marketing network.
