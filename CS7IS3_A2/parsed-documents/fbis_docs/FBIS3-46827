I would like to ask you about a typical post-Cold War case. Would you give your view and analysis of the situation in the DPRK? [Saito] The DPRK is the only nation with which Japan has yet to settle post-war issues. There is no change in Japan's desire to normalize diplomatic relations with the DPRK. There is a possibility, however, that the DPRK, a geographically close neighbor of Japan, is developing nuclear weapons and this is a serious issue. Japan cannot tolerate DPRK development of nuclear weapons. We strongly hope that suspicions about the DPRK's development of nuclear arms will be cleared up in the U.S.-DPRK talks. We hope the talks will settle the DPRK nuclear issue one way or another. [Reporter] It has been pointed out that any crisis in the Korean peninsula will inevitably lead to a change in Japan-U.S. security arrangements. [Saito] Japan-U.S. security arrangements will not be affected by any crisis on the Korean peninsula and we are not concerned about that. The military threat to Japan has not yet disappeared (even following the end of the Cold War). Japan cannot protect itself from various crises by its own power alone. The significance of Japan-U.S. security arrangements will remain unless a change occurs in Japan's ability to protect itself. Japan-U.S. security arrangements keep other Asian nations free from security concerns and their effect will remain unchanged. [Reporter] Looking at Japan's security, there are China and Russia, both of them political and military superpowers. [Saito] Japan will host the ASEAN regional forum next year. I think it is right ASEAN foreign ministers and their counterparts from China and Russia hold talks to discuss the regional security issue. Japan will urge both China and Russia to hold security talks with Japan. Japan should promote these security talks and the ASEAN security talks simultaneously. [Reporter] Regional security considerations aside, will the Asian and Pacific region not move toward forming an economic bloc? [Saito] The region may move toward forming such an economic bloc. It is to be expected that European nations will watch closely the strengthening of relations between the United States and the member nations of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference [APEC], but there is nothing for them to worry about. The European Community (EC) wants to maintain its relationship with APEC whereby it attends APEC conferences as an observer. Japan supports this. [Reporter] With the Cold War behind us, Japan's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council is becoming more realistic. [Saito] I believe Japan is qualified to join the UN Security Council as a permanent member. If an international consensus forms on Japanese membership, Japan should go along with it. We must not be impatient, however. [Reporter] There is also the question of participation by the Self-Defense Forces in such UN and multinational forces that fought in the Gulf war. Should the government not make clear its view on this before the question comes up again? [Saito] The best thing would be to have the issue debated and then a decision made once conclusions from the debate have been drawn. In any case, however, it is clear that Japan can only take actions are permitted by the Constitution, even if it is admitted to the UN Security Council as a permanent member. If Japan becomes a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the UN body cannot ask Japan to do what is prohibited by the Constitution. I do not mean Japan cannot join the UN Security Council before deciding the limits of its participation. As far as the multinational forces are concerned, my personal view is that it would be difficult for Japan to join them. [Reporter] Other nations hope Japan will participate in the UN peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia. [Saito] Some argue that as Yasushi Akashi has been appointed the UN peacekeeping operations representative in the former Yugoslavia, Japan should do something. I cannot agree with the argument, though. It is clear, however, that if the situation there is left uncontrolled, it could get worse. A political decision will be made on Japan's participation in UN peacekeeping operations after we are clear whether Japan's participation is compatible with the Peacekeeping Operations Cooperation Law. I mean the government will begin examining the possibility of participation if it conforms to the Peacekeeping Operations Cooperation Law and the United Nations makes a request to that effect.
