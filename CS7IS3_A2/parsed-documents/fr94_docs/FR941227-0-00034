FR941227-0-00034 FR941227-0-00007 Note 3: Paragraph (b) of this AD restates the requirement to adjust the aileron secondary stop contained in paragraph (b) of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10. As allowed by the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10 has been accomplished previously, this AD does not require that it be repeated. (c) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849), revise the Abnormal Procedures Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM: ``Where abnormal aileron control backlash is experienced by one pilot, the other pilot should assume control of the aircraft without using the disconnect facility. The disconnect facility should only be used in accordance with published procedures in cases of control restrictions or jamming.'' Note 4: Paragraph (c) of this AD restates the requirement for an AFM revision contained in paragraph (c) of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10. As allowed by the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10 has been accomplished previously, this AD does not require that it be repeated. (d) Within 180 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, install new swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027, dated January 17, 1994. Accomplishment of this modification constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. The AFM revision required by paragraph (c) of this AD may be removed following accomplishment of this modification. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 5: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with §§21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
