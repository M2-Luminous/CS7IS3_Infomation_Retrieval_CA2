FR941227-1-00042 FR941227-1-00011 50 CFR Part 23 RIN 1018&hyph;AC72 Export of American Alligators Taken in 1995 Through 1997 AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed findings and proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates international trade in certain animal and plant species. As a general rule, exports of animals and plants listed on Appendix II of CITES may occur only if a Scientific Authority has advised a permit-issuing Management Authority that such exports will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the animals or plants were not obtained in violation of laws for their protection. Based on documentation presented for consideration by the CITES Parties in 1983, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has determined that the American alligator is listed on Appendix II for reasons of similarity in appearance under Article II.2(b) of CITES as well as the potential threat to the species survival under CITES Article II.2(a). This notice announces proposed findings by the U.S. Scientific Authority and Management Authority on the export of alligators harvested during the 1995&hyph;1997 taking seasons from certain States previously approved for such export for the 1992&hyph;1994 harvest seasons and for the State of Arkansas which was previously approved for the 1994 harvest season. These proposed findings also stipulate that monitoring procedures previously established for this species be continued. In addition, references in the regulation concerning the manner in which tags are to be attached to American alligator hides at the time of export and the conditions for export of parts and products are being clarified. The Service requests comments on these proposed findings and information on the species involved. DATES: The Service will consider all information and comments received by January 26, 1995 in making its final decision on this proposal. State American alligator program reports are due by May 31 of each year. ADDRESSES: Please send correspondence concerning this document to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 N. Fairfax Dr., room 420&hyph;C, Arlington, Virginia 22203. Materials received will be available for public inspection by appointment from 7:45 a.m. to 4:15 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the Office of Management Authority, 4401 N. Fairfax Dr., room 432, Arlington, VA.
