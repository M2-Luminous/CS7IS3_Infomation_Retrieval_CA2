There were also skirmishes between the representatives of the two nationalities, sometimes gunshots could be heard. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Units of the Interior Ministry troops and OMON (riot police) arrived in Derbent from neighbouring districts and managed to stabilize the situation. However, the tension was not relieved completely. Both Lezghins and Azerbaijanians put forward nationalist mottoes and demanded at the separate rallies that heads of the city and district authorities resign. The participants in the rallies appealed to the republic's leadership to restore order to Derbent and to the southern part of Daghestan as a whole and to protect the rights of the local population. The cause of the unrest traces back to a quarrel between several Lezghins and Azerbaijanians which took place the other day and ended in a fight and shootout. As a result, two Lezghins were killed, several people, including teenagers, were wounded. After that, a hundred of Lezghins blocked a motor way leading to Derbent. They stopped a car, in which Sayid Kurbanov, head of the district administration, his deputy and head of the Derbent police rode. The policeman-driver was disarmed by unidentified persons. Kurbanov was arrested and taken to an unknown locality "to continue the negotiations". He was released soon.
