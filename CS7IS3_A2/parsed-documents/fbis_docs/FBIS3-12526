If Justice Me'ir Shamgar and his colleagues were permitted to travel as far as the United States, it is doubtful that they would exonerate Secretary of State Warren Christopher -- or even President Bill Clinton -- from responsibility for the fiasco. The Americans are very fastidious. They meticulously word and file everything away. It would not even be necessary to dig up secret files. The exploits of the settlers were cited in this year's State Department annual human rights report. The investigators would find that the CIA's agents in Israel repeatedly reported on the evil deeds of the Kahanists from Brooklyn. And, if he had a hard time reading overt and covert material, Christopher could have heard about it from Palestinian leaders. This, of course, unless he fell asleep, as he did during Clinton's speech in Brussels and his latest meeting with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Old hands at the State Department cannot remember such a lethargic, bureaucratic, and hesitant secretary. Asked to comment about the fate of the occupied territories, he would have a ready-made answer: The peace process, and the process alone, is the solution. And what did the secretary contribute to that process? Twice a week he would grovel before Jewish functionaries and promise not to put pressure on Israel, God forbid. The U.S. team includes a handful of dedicated officials who witnessed the birth of the peace process and are eager to hold the baby in their arms. The secretary reined in anybody who asked permission to intervene in the negotiations, lest this be interpreted as a provocation of the Rabin government. The Jewish leadership, which has not yet shaken loose of the Likud's grip, knows why it prefers Christopher and has gone to great lengths to stand in Strobe Talbott's way to the secretary of state's office. Talbott's articles in TIME show that his views about the damage caused by the settlements in particular and the occupation in general are very close to those of Peres and Yosi Beilin. Prior to the Oslo agreement, I heard Peres speak in favor of working intensively on a permanent arrangement (a confederation) and skipping the interim stage. Why pay twice, he asked time and again. During his visit to Washington, Beilin publicly stated that he would forego the autonomy stage. Yitzhaq Rabin apparently exhausted his ability to be dragged by the Foreign Ministry duo when he signed the Oslo agreement, and there is no way they can drag him into a debate about the future of the settlements/provocations. Since 13 September, Peres and Beilin have been asking the Americans to take action, particularly on the Syrian arena, but also on the Palestinian track. People who know Rabin know that if there is anything he idolizes, fears, and respects it is Washington. If the United States had a President who could see reality beyond the level of crime in Chicago, he would ask the prime minister -- to cite just one example -- to tell him how he intends to deal with criminals armed with government-issued weapons who openly declare their intention to kill Palestinian policemen. After all, Clinton was asked to be the best man at the signing ceremony of the Oslo agreement. Since then, he has missed no opportunity, particularly in domestic political events, to boast about this feat. He must have reached the conclusion that a strong police force in Chicago would improve his chances of getting reelected. This is much more important to him than a Palestinian police force and Jewish criminals, or vice versa. A month and a half ago, through his meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, Clinton made his most active contribution to the peace process. What came out of it? Another one or two -- who is counting? -- rounds of sterile talks in Washington. Everybody patted themselves in the back about the "businesslike atmosphere" achieved by cutting down the size of the delegations and the frequency of press briefings -- some contribution by the only superpower in the world to the peace process. One should not infer from this weakness that the country that put a man on the moon had no people who could read the writing on the wall. Appearing before a Jewish convention, Dennis Ross, the head of the U.S. peace team, warned that long intervals in the negotiations on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO might jeopardize the process. His remarks cast the heads of the U.S. Administration in a grimmer light when one considers that he and his colleagues supposedly said the same things to their superiors. Even now that the President has invited Israel and the PLO to Washington, it is hard to discern a substantial change in the way it perceives the problems and their solution. For convenience's sake -- in other words, for fear of upsetting the Jews -- the focus remains on matters of procedure and venue. The logic behind this passive approach is that the peace process itself will improve the atmosphere in the area. The massacre in Hebron made abundantly clear that what we have here is a question of ideology, which is becoming more acute as the peace process advances toward a compromise solution. The only remedy to such an ideology is resoluteness and firmness. A change of venue will not change fortunes. Jimmy Carter did not overcome the ideologist Menahem Begin thanks to the fresh air at Camp David, but thanks to his arm-wrestling tactics and the negotiating methods used by a superpower with a protege. Bill Clinton shares responsibility for the tragedy in Hebron and its aftermath. If he does not bring up the problem of the settlements with Yitzhaq Rabin, the Middle East will join his other failures in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and apparently, Russia. It is very doubtful that when the day comes, the Jews, whom he fears so much, will thank him for this failure.
