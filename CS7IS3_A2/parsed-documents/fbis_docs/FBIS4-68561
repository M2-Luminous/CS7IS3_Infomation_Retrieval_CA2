FBIS4-68561 "jpusr051___94003" FBIS-USR-94-051 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 11 March 1994 CAUCASUS ARMENIA Citizenship Reportedly Sought for Terrorist Citizenship Reportedly Sought for Terrorist 944K1132B Yerevan AZG in Armenian 11 Mar 94 p 2 944K1132B Yerevan AZG Armenian CSO [Text] We reported in our 26 February issue, based on a report filed by the Noyan Tapan news agency, that "the French authorities officially applied to the Armenian embassy in Paris with two questions: a) Is Armenia prepared to accept Simon Nairian? b) Is Armenia prepared to offer him permanent residence?" Noyan Tapan picked up this news from the Committee for the Defense of Armenian Political Prisoners. A member of that committee, Armenian Supreme Council Deputy Aleksandr Manucharyan, rushed to gather signatures in parliament to appeal to the Armenian president to grant citizenship to one of the principal figures of tragic incident at Orly airport in Paris in 1983. Nairian is now completing the last weeks of his 15-year sentence in a French prison. Manucharyan's initiative is based on the premise that "if Armenian citizenship is not granted to Nairian, after he is released he will be turned over to Turkish authorities who will definitely hang him." Nairian is a citizen of Turkey where he has been condemned to death in absentia. However, when our correspondent in Paris contacted the Armenian embassy in France to verify these facts he was given an ambiguous answer. He was told that neither the French authorities nor any official person has come to them with any such problem and that they consider the uproar that has been raised in Armenia a tempest in a teacup. What remains unanswered is from where the Committee for the Defense of Armenian Political Prisoners picked up this information and what basis it has for its verity.
