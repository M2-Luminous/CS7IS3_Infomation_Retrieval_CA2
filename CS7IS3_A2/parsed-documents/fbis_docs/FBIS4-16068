In October they arrived in Tajikistan. By their very presence in various parts of the Republic, and especially the first joint exercises they held, they have cooled many hotheads who want to change the constitutional order in the Republic by unlawful means and to destabilize the situation. The crime rate has also improved markedly. Unfortunately not all states that signed the collective security treaty have fulfilled their peacekeeping obligations. The military contingent from Kazakhstan has not arrived in Tajikistan at all. The Kyrgyz force has merely staked out its presence. The mandate of the peacekeeping forces is about to expire. So, what will happen next? [Begin recording of Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander in chief of CIS Joint Armed Forces] The need for them to remain here until at least the end of 1994 is obvious because, unfortunately, there are potential forces, groupings, groups, gangs, and formations, certain forces that are striving to breach the peace here, to destabilize the entire situation.
