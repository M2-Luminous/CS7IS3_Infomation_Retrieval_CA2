A leaflet distributed yesterday in the Gaza Strip, Ramallah, and East Jerusalem noted that the attack near Bi'r Zayt in which five settlers were wounded had been perpetrated by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam troops. The leaflet added that this was "the beginning of the implementation of the plan to expel the settlers from all the territories," as had been promised in a previous leaflet in which the settlers were given an ultimatum to leave by 15 March. The authors contend that this ultimatum had already caused several families to leave Qiryat Arba'. However, the leaflet noted, Hamas does not consider this sufficient "and will continue to strike until the last settler leaves." [passage omitted]
