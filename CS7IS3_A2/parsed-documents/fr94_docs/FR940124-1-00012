FR940124-1-00012 FR940124-1-00004 Since the revised regulation will address the effects of Lewisite as well as mustard agents, we propose to revise the heading of 38 CFR 3.316 to indicate that the regulation addresses claims based on chronic effects of exposure to vesicant agents rather than mustard gas only. The current regulation applies only to those veterans exposed while participating in secret tests of protective equipment during World War II; we propose to expand it to cover any verified full-body exposure during military service, which will allow veterans exposed to mustard gas under battlefield conditions in World War I, those present at the German air raid on the harbor of Bari, Italy, in World War II, and those engaged in manufacturing and handling vesicant agents during their military service to be eligible for consideration under this regulation. We are not proposing to include veterans who were exposed to vesicant agents via patch or drop testing. The literature upon which the NAS report is based covered animal studies and two types of human studies: (1) Industrial studies of workers in chemical factories which manufactured mustard gas; and (2) studies of soldiers exposed to mustard gas in warfare, primarily during World War I. These studies involved full-body exposure, not patch testing. The NAS report does not discuss any studies relevant to patch or drop testing. However, the NAS report concluded that the exposure of many participants in chamber and field tests was equivalent to that of soldiers in World War I, and therefore the NAS report concluded that the World War I and chronic exposure studies were relevant to the experience in the chamber and field tests. Since the NAS report only considered studies involving full-body exposure, we believe that the NAS findings regarding specific diseases are linked only to full-body exposure, and not to patch or drop testing. We also propose to amend 38 CFR 3.316 by adding a requirement that service connection will not be established if there is affirmative evidence that establishes a nonservice-related supervening condition or event as the cause of the claimed condition. The current regulation is based upon a literature search of the immediate and short-term effects of mustard gas exposure by the Veterans Health Administration, which revealed that nonfatal exposures to mustard gas result in an immediate acute injury. It was also reported that any chronic disability related to mustard gas exposure should appear shortly after the exposure and continue to the present. The NAS report, however, found that delayed effects of mustard gas exposure may appear even though no acute effects were noted. Because of this delay in manifestation of effects of mustard gas exposure reported by the NAS, during which time the veteran may have been exposed to other nonservice-related causative conditions or events, we have determined that it is reasonable to consider evidence of intervening cause which may exist, just as we do for other presumptive conditions (See 38 CFR 3.307(b)). The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.
