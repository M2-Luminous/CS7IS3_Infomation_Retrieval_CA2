In remarks to the magazine CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress], the official mouthpiece of the Peruvian Congress, Padron said: "It is a bad idea to continue the blockade against Cuba and Haiti because the people have the right to survive and subsist." The Andean Parliament president said: "It is not ethical to submit a nation to starvation in the name of democracy." Padron added that commercial blockades, like that imposed recently on Haiti and the one that has prevailed for 32 years against Cuba, "affect the people, not the generals or officials who continue drinking wine and eating meat while the people have nothing to quench their thirst or assuage their hunger." The Venezuelan congressman asked the OAS to find a political solution to the Haitian and Cuban problems and to conduct all necessary diplomatic negotiations "instead of settling for less humane alternatives."
