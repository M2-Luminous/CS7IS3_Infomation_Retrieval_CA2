Why was this responsible mission at the premiere international commonwealth in the world entrusted precisely to him and a small group of coworkers? So, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Viktor Batyuk is an interlocutor of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA. First, a short file. Viktor Batyuk is 54. He graduated from the Institute of International Relations in Moscow. He held diplomatic positions in the organization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine: at the Permanent Mission of Ukraine at the United Nations (New York, 1968-1973), as an aide to the minister, the general secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1974-1977), the permanent representative of Ukraine at the offices of the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva (1978-1984), and as the chief of the department of international organizations and member of the collegium of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine (1985-1991). On 4 March 1992 he was appointed a permanent representative of Ukraine at the UN. Within Ukrainian delegations, he has taken part in many international meetings, as well as 20 sessions of the UN General Assembly. Also, he is a member of the Union of Writers of Ukraine, a translator of the works of Indian and American writers. He is married with three children. The diplomatic corps of the Ukrainian UN mission consists of: Volodymyr Khandohiy--deputy permanent representative; Oleksandr Motsyk and Oleksandr Horyn--first secretaries; Viktor Andriyaka, Ihor Humennyy, and Valeriy Kyrychenko--second secretaries; Vitaliy Malashchenko--an attache. All have special higher education. Their average age is 37. With one exception, all are married. [passage omitted] [Korsun] Viktor, let us discuss the issues of our mission. [Batyuk] At present, Ukraine has its diplomatic missions in a few dozen countries. As has already been mentioned, 184 states belong to the United Nations. Consequently, contacts are maintained through us with countries in which our embassies do not operate (we bring to their attention the positions of our government, political statements, and so on). This is an intensive and great effort. For us, vacations once every two years have been established. [Korsun] What is the difference between the functions of the Ukrainian representative at the UN in the environment of the former Union and at present, when we have an independent state? [Batyuk] The difference is striking. Previously, it was like this: The landlord and a live-in son-in-law sat on a block. The latter merely listened, and had no right to put in a word of his own. At one time, ours was a decorative, pro forma mission, despite the fact that the flag of Ukraine flew over the common building. We now say our word outloud, pursue the policy of an independent Ukraine, and work out our course independently and follow it independently. [Korsun] How do our neighbors, the Russian mission, respond to this? Does their leading, supreme role manifest itself (say, through information)? [Batyuk] We feel supremacy. To be sure, there are no complaints concerning purely human relations between colleagues. However, the congenital "great-power attitude" is frequently all too obvious. Besides, we room with in-laws. For example, a "directive" comes: Effective 1 February of this year, payments for the use of such and such services will be increased by this amount. There are no explanations as to why. Visitors come to us here, to this reception room. Some ask before the conversation, pointing at the adjacent wall: "Will Mr. Vorontsov (representative of Russia at the UN--note by UKRAYINSKA HAZETA) hear our conversation?" I happen to answer "Yes" because important texts sent by fax to the UKRINFORM for some reason suddenly end up in the adjacent mission. Or else this "thing" which was recently installed by the neighbors. (He pointed at the ceiling.) They said that this was additional fire protection equipment. It is strange because issues of reliable fire prevention were resolved here a long time ago. Once again, they did not consult us even 'for the sake of appearances' about the 'fire alarm' system." [Korsun] Can we say this in the newspaper? Is this not a diplomatic secret? [Batyuk] No, this is not a secret. This is our predicament. This is why the issue of moving our mission to separate premises remains pressing. A search for ways to resolve this problem is underway. First of all, it is necessary for Russia to return the share due us in a 13-floor building which was legally acquired in 1964 by three states--the USSR, Ukraine, and Belarus. Russia is in no hurry to relinquish its control over diplomatic property. I think that our ministry should raise this property problem before the Government of Ukraine in an acute and resolute manner for the latter, in its turn, to press Moscow: "Return to us what is ours." Otherwise, only Russia will present bills for "our debts." At present, it is difficult, almost impossible, for Ukraine to equip embassies in other countries "from square one." For example, our diplomatic mission in Turkey is crowded into a few hotel rooms. At the same time, it is felt that the significance of our UN mission is somewhat underestimated. To my mind, we should buy something even below 38th Street where establishments of this rank are not located. However, housing costs two times less there. At the beginning, let it be the way it is. Let our poverty shine through. However, as Oles Honchar said, on the other hand, we have freedom and independence. Enough of this living and feeling as if we are in a single kolkhoz called the USSR. [Korsun] I know that the Ukrainian community in the United States, which has already established the Fund of Aid to Ukrainian Diplomatic Missions, sympathizes with you. [Batyuk] Yes. I am immensely grateful for this. The building of our embassy in Washington is being outfitted with the monies collected by the fund; the building of the consulate in New York, the official opening of which is planned for this year, is being repaired. The consulate in Chicago has been in operation for a year now. Here, the fund has also joined us in order to purchase some equipment. In particular, we received a copier and installed a trident at the entrance to our floor; on request, they provide consumer services to the members of Ukrainian delegations, and so on. Thus, our countrymen help us here with more than just words and applause.... [Korsun] A mountain of debts to the UN is dragging Ukraine down.... [Batyuk] A contribution amounting to 1.87 percent of the UN budget has been established for our state. This proportion is obviously overstated. It was calculated on the basis of the Union total when the ratio of the karbovanets to the dollar was likewise overstated. There are also a number of other reasons. Everybody understands them, but for now nothing can be done, although we continuously strive to establish the truth. As of today, our debt to the UN comes to $95 million. If we do not pay $19 million before the end of this year, we will lose the right to vote in the General Assembly. This has already happened to some small countries. We would prefer not to end up on this list. Unfortunately, only $1.5 million has been paid so far out of the $19 million. [Korsun] It would be interesting to know what the overall budget for maintenance of the UN comes to. [Batyuk] At present, $1 billion is the annual budget for general expenditures and tentatively $3 billion for peacekeeping and security measures. The latter number changes depending on the situation and the existence of hot spots in the world. In recent years this item of expenditure has increased severalfold. [Korsun] You mentioned the 13-floor building which you "inhabit" together with Russia. How many floors does your team have? [Batyuk] Russia has allocated one floor to us. Certainly, this is not enough. Missions of independent states of the former USSR--Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan--also have some space. Both we and they have cramped working conditions. Our team includes 13 employees, of whom eight are diplomats and five are support personnel (a secretary, an accountant, a driver, a typist, and a janitor). [Korsun] In one of the interviews, you complained about a lack of qualified cadres in conjunction with an extensive entry by Ukraine into the worldwide diplomatic space. Are you happy with your assistants? [Batyuk] It is possible to do business with those I now work with. Our shortcomings are common and concern almost all diplomats. We grew up in the environment of Russification and a lack of ethnic identity. Many lack the experience of working in an independent state. Professional qualities are desirable for each one of us first of all. [Korsun] What are the arrangements for your coworkers as far as the way of life, schooling for their children, etc., are concerned? [Batyuk] Three families--mine, the secretary's, and the driver's--live in this building where our permanent working offices are located. The rest of the families live in the so-called "white house" (it is just that its color is white). This is a residential building for families from the missions of the former Union. It has about 200 apartments now. The children of our employees go either to American schools (if they began to study in younger grades here) or to a Russian school (if they were older when they came here). All children also attend the Ukrainian "Native School" on Saturday. For example, my grandson Ivan, who is seven and a half, went to an English school. Certainly, one day of instruction in the Ukrainian school per week is clearly not enough. The example of the former GDR would be desirable. As is known, Germans are a nation with a markedly manifested national sentiment. Previously, if there were as few as two school-age children in a German diplomatic mission, a permanent teacher was assigned to them for daily instruction. [passage omitted]
