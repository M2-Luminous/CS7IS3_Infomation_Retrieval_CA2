FR940505-2-00138 FR940505-2-00099 The third test, ASTM 3659, ``Standard Test Method for Flammability of Apparel Fabrics by Semi-Restraint Method,'' measures the burn rates in a vertical configuration. The average vertical burn rates of the materials were as follows: molded webbing_6.36 inches per minute; sweatpants_19.79 inches per minute; and ``T'' shirt_30.41 inches per minute. From these results, the study concluded that the molded webbing is significantly less flammable than typical children's clothing. Finally, a series of tests were conducted to determine the relative ease or difficulty of igniting each of the three materials using ignition sources most typically expected to be found in a motor vehicle: A lit cigarette; a paper match and a butane lighter. None of the materials ignited using a smoldering cigarette placed on top of the horizontally suspended material sample. The ``T'' shirt ignited in one-fifth the time (3 seconds), and the sweatpants ignited in slightly less than one-fourth the time (4 seconds) it took the molded webbing to ignite (15 seconds) using a paper match flame. The ``T'' shirt ignited in slightly less than one-sixth the time (2.5 seconds), and the sweatpants ignited in nearly one-fifth the time (3 seconds) it took to ignite the molded webbing (14.4 seconds) using a butane lighter flame. Messrs. Kennedy and Shanley concluded that, based on these tests and on their expertise in this area, when compared to the relative ease of ignition of typical children's clothing, the molded webbing material presents no risk to the safety of the occupant of the Fisher-Price car seat. Messrs. Shanley and Kennedy also examined how the webbing would contribute to a vehicle fire in comparison with the other interior elements of a typical motor vehicle. They found that the molded webbing contained in the Fisher-Price child safety seats comprises 0.019 percent of the combustible material in the interior of the average motor vehicle; it weighs approximately 0.06 pound and the total combustible material in the average motor vehicle weighs 337 pounds. From this, they concluded that the molded webbing comprises an inconsequential percentage of material when compared to the total amount of combustible material contained in a typical motor vehicle's interior. Mr. Shanley concluded that ``the removal of this material would have no effect on any interior motor vehicle fire and, conversely, that its presence in the vehicle would not, to any degree, increase the risk, of an interior vehicle fire.'' Messrs. Shanley and Kennedy also searched all available databases and source materials for information relating to the involvement of child car seats in interior motor vehicle fires. Their research focused on the possibility of an interior motor vehicle fire originating in a child car seat, especially where it appeared that the shoulder belt webbing may have been the original fuel source. Their search did not reveal any instances where an interior motor vehicle fire originated in a child car seat or where a car seat contributed in any way to an interior motor vehicle fire. With regard to the occupants of a motor vehicle having sufficient time to evacuate the vehicle in the event it caught fire, Mr. Shanley stated that:
