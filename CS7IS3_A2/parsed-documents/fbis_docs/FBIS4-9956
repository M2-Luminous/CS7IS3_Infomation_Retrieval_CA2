Let us listen to a report by our correspondent for the [Les Cayes] area, Henrisma Robert: [Begin Robert recording in progress] ...the only one out of 10 vetiver essence factories in the Les Cayes area has decided to shut down. Their fuel reserves have run out. The owners of those factories...[pauses] We met, for example, with Mr. (Eugene), who said he wanted to keep one of the three vetiver essence factories he owns, located near (Ravine du Sud), operating. This factory owner told us is he doing his best not to shut down because he employs more than 200 heads of household who have no other job. Moreover, said (Eugene), southern Haiti alone produces over 80 percent of the vetiver essence on the national market, so this product constitutes an important source of income for the southern region. (Eugene) explained, however, that given the difficulties he is facing because of the gasoline and gasoil problem and the high cost of materiel that has broken down or needs replacing, he is going to put an end, over the weekend, to the operations of the only factory operating in Les Cayes. The question many people are asking now is: When will the Dessalines [sugar] Company follow suit? This is Henrisma Robert from Les Cayes for Signal FM. [end recording]
