I have the authority, and it is my duty to do so; it is unnecessary to look for other reasons because these are routine changes," said General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, in angry reply to a question concerning the latest changes within the Armed Forces. He added, quite simply, that he imparts orders because he is the leader of an institution that must be maintained to fulfill any mission that emanates from the Constitution of the Republic. Gen. Discua Elvir denied that the changes in question are indicative of a purge or a generational struggle. He said that comments to this effect are made for the sole purpose of distracting the general public. When asked why Colonel Lazaro Avila Soleno was not removed from his post while others were, Gen. Discua Elvir emphatically replied "because I am the one who imparts orders in the Armed Forces." Meanwhile, he gave assurances that there will be no further changes because the changes that had to be made have been made. He added that there is no unrest within the Armed Forces because everyone knows that those who were removed had held their posts for over three years, and these changes are established in the Armed Forces Law.
