"China also wishes to enhance its long-term friendly ties and cooperation with Uzbekistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," said Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, at a meeting with a delegation from the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan. The delegation, led by A.M. Jalolov [spelling of name as received], second secretary of Uzbekistan's party central committee, arrived here on June 15 as the CPC's guests. Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, noted that traditional friendship between the two countries has grown since they established diplomatic ties. He noted that Uzbekistan President Islam Azim Karimov's visit to China in 1992 and Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Uzbekistan in April this year gave a powerful impetus to the growth of bilateral relations in depth and opened a new chapter for such relations. Jalolov said the bilateral relations between the two countries and the two parties are developing satisfactorily. The Uzbekistan people and party are greatly interested in the tremendous achievements that China has made in reform and construction, he said. Jalolov expressed the hope that his current visit will enable him to learn more about China's experience. Besides Beijing, the delegation is expected to visit Shanghai and east China's Jiangsu Province.
