France Pierre, who is responsible for the group Capois La Mort (name of an independence hero), said that along with the food destined for some 50,000 students "there will also be French troops arriving to invade the country." Emmanuel Constant, leader of FRAPH, said there were plans to conduct demonstrations to prevent the ship's arrival because, in his opinion, the expiration dates on the food sent by the French Government has elapsed and "will kill the children." The French Embassy in Haiti, however, said the food destined for public and private school students is in good condition and that they will come with a certificate to prove the quality of the products purchased on Guadeloupe. In a communique published on Wednesday, the French mission added that the food shipment is part of the traditional assistance that several countries have been providing to Haiti. Despite the information given by the French Embassy, right-wing groups continue to voice their opposition to the ship's arrival. Constant even accused the French Government on Monday of being "cynical because it is creating hunger in the country as a supporter of the economic embargo against Haiti but is now giving alms to clean its conscience." According to Constant, the real solution is to lift the embargo so that Haitians "can satisfy their economic needs." Senator Bernard Sansaricq, president of one of the two boards of directors of the Senate, said that 13 senators will show up at the Port-au-Prince wharf on Friday to prevent the French humanitarian aid from being unloaded. "It is an insult to the nation, the people, and our intelligence that France, after imposing on us a 30-month embargo which has killed 20,000 children, is now sending us food," said Sansaricq. He added that the group of senators has the means to prevent the unloading of the food. Sansaricq blamed Philippe Seltz, in charge of French affairs in Haiti, for what may happen to the senators who will show up at the wharf to protest. Meanwhile, Serge Gilles, leader of the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti (Panpra), said that even though this type of aid is not the most advisable thing it must be accepted to save the children. Gilles suggested that from now on the food someone may wish to donate should be purchased in Haiti. The arrival of the ship with the food has been supported by Reynold Georges, leader of the Alliance for the Liberation of Haiti (Alah). Georges, who has supported the position of FRAPH and other right-wing organizations close to the military, said it is necessary to receive the aid to prevent the deaths of children. Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Puerto Rico [as received], said it is difficult to understand the groups that do not accept humanitarian aid in the country. Schrager said that France wants to participate in the aid given to Haiti and feels that the gesture should be appreciated.
