It envisages an exchange of experience in the area of military construction, cooperation in training special UN troops, and setting up information links between the two countries. At a news conference on 16 May, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy said that "being a non-nuclear and nonaligned country, Austria is very close to Ukraine. But the concept of "neutrality" today requires clarification. In conditions of regional instability, noninterference in existing conflicts would be incomprehensible." Werner Fasslabend noted that "the aim of his visit was to learn about Ukraine's experience in military building since the stability of other countries created stability in Europe."
