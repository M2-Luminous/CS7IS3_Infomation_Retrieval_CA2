Speaking at a news conference in Sarajevo about the Bosniak-Croat agreement, President Izetbegovic stressed: [Izetbegovic] "What we are interested in is their urgent implementation [sentence as heard]. We will not allow the dynamics of their implementation to be slowed down. We will try to speed up their implementation and remove obstacles in the way of achieving this. ``Regarding other things, I can only restrict myself for the moment to talking about the problem of whether or not to go to these talks--something referred to in yesterday's communique--we will go to these talks. We believe that a refusal to go to the talks will be an own goal and will only help the aggressor to continue waging the war and shift the blame on to us. We are not for war but for peace. ``As for the talks, of course--this is not a precondition--but we expect and demand that in the meantime, in the next few days, the problem of Gorazde be resolved in keeping with the NATO pact ultimatum and the corresponding resolutions. Above all, I am thinking of the withdrawal of Serb soldiers from the three-kilometer zone. This is not a precondition for attendance at the talks, but unless this happens, we believe that this must be fulfilled--of course this is not a precondition, this is a matter of carrying out of an earlier decision that was not fully respected and that brings into question the credibility of the international community, and of course brings into question the justification and the reason for organizing any conference or making any decisions if the decisions cannot later be implemented." [Correspondent] Dwelling on yesterday's communique by the Contact Group, President Izetbegovic drew attention to both its positive and negative points. [Izetbegovic] "Positive--because we are persevering in maintaining the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its survival within the internationally recognized borders. Positive--also because it advocates aid for reconstruction once peace is established and furthermore, because it advocates resolve for the implementation of the existing UNSC resolutions, the continuation of humanitarian aid deliveries, and the free passage of convoys, while refusing to meet the demand of the Serb side to abolish the sanctions before the negotiations begin. ``The bad points of this communique--not to say negative--we see because it mentions Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union. As you know we have opted for a federation. It also mentions the notorious 51-49 percent division [words indistinct]. At the same time, there is a certain degree of readiness in the communique to gradually abolish the sanctions. ``Finally, as far as the cessation of hostilities is concerned, we are thinking of a temporary cessation and in our opinion a four- month period is too long. A two-month period would be quite sufficient if a political resolution is desired. A four-month period is unacceptable."
