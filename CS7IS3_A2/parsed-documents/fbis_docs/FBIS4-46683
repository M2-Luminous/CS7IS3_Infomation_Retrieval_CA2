The greatest increases in food prices were registered in the Central Chernozem region (3.9 percent), and the lowest--in the Northeast region (1.0 percent); they remained at practically the same level in Kaliningrad Oblast. Prices for nonfood items went up most in the Urals region--by 6 percent, while in the cities of Northwestern and Central Chernozem regions they changed only insignificantly. Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the consumer market were as follows (percentage of the preceding date): 04/19 04/26 05/04 Average daily price rise May April Consumer goods 101.6 101.7 102.2 0.30 0.30 and services including: foodstuffs 101.3 101.6 101.9 0.29 0.23 nonfood items 101.9 101.5 102.3 0.39 0.25 for-fee 103.5 104.4 103.8 0.64 1.27 services for the population Foodstuffs. Over the period 26 April to 4 May, prices in organized and nonorganized trade rose by 1.1 percent and 5.4 percent. Price changes by main categories of food products are shown below (percentage of the preceding date): Total Including: in organized in nonorganized trade trade All food products 101.9 101.1 105.4 including: Meat and meat 102.3 101.2 105.1 products Fish and fish 101.1 101.1 101.0 products Milk and milk 101.3 101.0 103.1 products Eggs 101.1 101.1 100.2 Sugar 100.2 100.1 102.5 Bread and bakery 101.8 101.8 - products Cereals and 101.7 101.5 107.6 macaroni items Vodka 100.3 100.3 100.0 Potatoes and 104.0 102.4 105.5 vegetables Fruit 107.9 103.9 110.8 In organized trade over the elapsed week fruit and vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate. Prices for cabbage, onions, and apples rose by 4-7 percent. Prices for rye-wheat bread and bread made of highest grade wheat flour, macaroni, rice, millet, and salt went up by 2-3 percent. There was practically no change over the week in prices for vodka, sugar, butter, and vegetable oil. Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases in nonorganized trade, mostly due to seasonal factors and holidays, were registered with respect to fresh produce. Prices for apples, cabbage, and onions rose over the week by 10-13 percent, carrots, beets, and garlic--by 4-9 percent. Prices for meat products increased by 5-6 percent, and for eggs remained practically unchanged. The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs increased over the week by 1.9 percent and as of 4 May amounted to 48,500 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured a factor of 4.6; the highest cost of the basket was registered in Magadan (R131,100) and the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R28,700). In terms of the consumer basket cost, Moscow and St. Petersburg and Moscow ranked 34th and 42d among 132 monitored cities (R53,300 and R49,800 on a monthly basis). Nonfood Items Over the period 26 April to 4 May, prices for nonfood items rose at a somewhat higher rate than those for foodstuffs. The greatest price increases were registered with respect to children's items, wallpaper, and medicines (2-5 percent). Gasoline prices in 12 cities of Russia increased over the week by 10-30 percent. With the average for Russia price of R288 per liter, the highest price was registered in Magadan--R520 per liter, and the lowest--in Norilsk--R120. For-Fee Services for the Population Over the elapsed week the cost of certain services continued to rise at an anticipatory rate--rents in municipal housing (20.5 percent), municipal services (6-8 percent), and transportation and communications services (5-6 percent). The cost of housing and municipal services increased several-fold in Ivanovo and Chelyabinsk Oblasts. There was a 1.5- to two-fold increase in urban bus fares in Izhevsk, Novosibirsk, Smolensk, Cherepovets, Blagoveshchensk, Nizhniy Tagil, and Kopeysk, and in the cost of residential telephone service in Petrozavodsk, Irkutsk, Serov, Nizhniy Tagil, and cities in Tatarstan. Wholesale Prices for Industrial Output Wholesale prices for industrial output in April increased by 10 percent (in April 1993--by 21 percent). As compared to December 1993, prices increased 1.7-fold (over the same period of 1993--2.5-fold). Also in April, as during the preceding months, prices for producer goods increased more significantly than those for consumer goods, which can be seen from the following data (% of the preceding month): January February March April April 1994 1994 1994 1994 1994 as % of December 1993 Industry--total 119 116 110 110 167 including: producer goods 120 117 111 112 171 consumer goods 113 113 109 108 152 Since the beginning of the year prices have risen the least in electric power generation, the fuel industry, nonferrous metallurgy, and the chemical, timber, woodworking, pulp and paper, and food processing industries--by 6-11 percent. In the fuel industry over the month prices for main categories of fuels went up by 6 percent on average. The greatest price increases--by 18 percent--were registered with respect to gas; coal prices went up by 13 percent, oil--by 5 percent, and petroleum products--by 3 percent. By the end of April the price of one tonne of oil in Tyumen Oblast was R69,000, and in Republic of Tatarstan--R54,000. Coal in the main coal-producing regions--Kemerovo and Rostov Oblasts--cost R18,000 and R25,000 per tonne, and in Republic of Komi--R29,000. Wholesale prices charged by gas-producing enterprises exceeded R6,000 per 1,000 cubic meters. Since the beginning of the year gas prices have increased fourfold, oil--1.9-fold, and coal--1.6-fold. Electric power rates at the end of April averaged R31 per kw-hour for all categories of consumers, which is 1.7 times higher than in December 1993. In ferrous metallurgy after a relatively low rate of price increases at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, prices for most categories of output went up sharply. With respect to many monitored categories of output the rate of price increases was considerably higher than over the quarter. For instance, prices for stainless round billet in April went up by 84 percent (overall over the quarter--by 20 percent), open-hearth steel--37 percent (7 percent), wire rod--22 percent (4 percent), and hollow drill steel--by 36 percent (9 percent). Iron ore prices increased in April by almost 40 percent, which is three times as much as over the quarter (14 percent). In the chemical and petrochemical industry, with an average price increase of 11 percent, prices for some products rose at a faster rate: carbamide and epoxy resins--by 22-25 percent; paints, varnishes, and synthetic dyes, tires for trucks and cars--by 18 percent; the output of rubber and asbestos industry--by 17 percent; and mineral fertilizer--by 14 percent. There have been substantial price increases (by a factor of two to 2.3) since the beginning of the year for nepheline concentrate, sulfur, mineral fertilizer, yellow phosphorus, sulfuric and hydrochloric acid, drying oils, synthetic detergents, and some other products. Price rises continue to slow down in the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry. Over April prices here rose on average by 9 percent (11 percent in March). Prices for the output of the timber-logging sector increased over the month by 7 percent, and since the beginning of the year--1.5-fold; that of the woodworking industry--by 11 percent and 1.7-fold, respectively; and pulp and paper industry--by 9 percent and 1.8-fold. Similar to March, the price index for construction material in April was higher than the industry average--113 percent. Prices for construction brick, roof slate, wall panels, and ceramic tile increased by more than 13-15 percent; prefabricated ferroconcrete components and parts, construction and non-ore materials, mineral cotton and items made of it--by 11-12 percent. As compared to December 1993 the price level with respect to cement, roof slate, asbestos-cement pipe, construction lime, and ferroconcrete blocks practically doubled. In light industry prices rose on average by 12 percent, including for cotton fabrics--by 9 percent, woolen fabrics--by 14 percent, and silk fabrics--by 11 percent. Prices for knit underwear and outer knitwear increased by 7-9 percent, garments and footwear--by 11 percent. Since the beginning of the year prices increased on average 1.5-fold, and with respect to some varieties of goods (cotton thread, gauze, dressmaking linen fabrics, silk fabrics, twine, and women's pantyhose)--1.8-1.9-fold. In the food processing industry in April prices for some varieties of butter-churning, milk, fats and oils, and fruit and vegetable industry output remained practically unchanged. Prices for meat and fish products and the output of milling and cereal-making industry rose on average by 4-6 percent. Since the beginning of the year prices for the output of baking, macaroni, hard liquor, beer-brewing, salt, perfume and cosmetics, and soft drinks sectors have increased 1.7-2.0-fold. Price changes by industrial sectors are shown below: April 1994 as % of March 1994 December 1993 All industry 110 167 Electric power generation 111 178 Fuel industry 106 181 Ferrous metallurgy 117 156 Nonferrous metallurgy 109 152 Chemical industry 111 176 Petrochemical industry 111 165 Machine-building 112 168 Timber, woodworking, pulp and 109 167 paper industry Construction material industry 113 180 Light industry 112 155 Food processing industry 106 149 Market Saturation With Consumer Goods Over the past two months the level of retail trade saturation with goods remained unchanged and measured 87 percent.[.sup]*)[/] In April of this year, as compared to April of last year, it increased by 16 percentage points.[.sup]**)[/] With respect to foodstuffs, the saturation coefficient over the elapsed month measured 84 percent as compared to 62 percent in April of last year. Russia's consumer market is currently saturated with butter and eggs. The saturation level is also high (97-99 percent) with respect to beef, poultry meat, summer salami and bologna, vegetable oil, sour cream, milk, sugar, and vermicelli. The situation at regional markets with such food products as fish, cottage cheese, rye-wheat bread, and macaroni items is characterized by the following data (in percents): Saturation coefficient Frozen Cottage Rye-wheat Millet Macaroni fish cheese bread items Russian 88 51 74 83 70 Federation Including economic regions: Northern 100 20 100 80 60 Northwestern 100 33 100 100 67 Central 100 91 100 83 92 Volgo-Vyatka 80 80 100 80 40 Central 100 60 100 100 60 Chernozem Volga 88 50 75 100 75 North Caucasus 50 50 38 88 63 Urals 100 85 86 100 71 West-Siberian 86 71 57 100 100 East-Siberian 50 33 33 50 50 Far-Eastern 88 25 75 88 50 [.sup]*)[/] ratio of number of cities where item was available for sale at time of registration to total number of cities surveyed [.sup]**)[/] ratio of saturation coefficients taking into account data comparability Retail trade saturation with nonfood items measured in April of this year 92 percent and increased as compared to the same month of last year by 15 percentage points, including color television sets--by 2 percentage points; hosiery--by 8 percentage points; garments, knitwear, footwear, and refrigerators--by 15-22 percentage points. Men's suits, cotton socks, and women's elastic pantyhose were available for sale everywhere. Petroleum Products Production Output of petroleum products fell in January-March of this year: I quarter I quarter 1994 as % As % of the preceding month 1994 of (million tonnes) I IV January February March quarter quarter 1993 1993 Primary 46.7 85 89 96 93 98 refining of oil Automotive 6.7 89 91 103 89 104 gasoline Diesel fuel 11.5 82 87 96 88 109 Boiler oil 18.9 90 93 98 98 94 Jet fuel 2.0 80 83 94 84 108 Lubricating 0.4 48 65 88 89 107 oil In the first quarter of this year the situation was more favorable with respect to production of fuel for the needs of power generating stations and boiler rooms, as well as winter fuel for transport. As compared to the analogous period of last year, the output of winter diesel fuel increased by 8 percent and amounted to 2.6 million tonnes. While in absolute figures the output of boiler oil declined, its share in the total volume of petroleum products production increased from 38 percent in January-March 1993 to 41 percent in January-March of this year. At the same time, production of household furnace fuel decreased over the indicated period of time by 23 percent. Because of the decline in solvent demand, production of petroleum products for the needs of aviation declined considerably. The output of aviation oil and gasoline fell by a factor of three as compared to the first quarter of last year, that of aviation kerosene--by 20 percent. Production of aviation gasoline decreased by a factor of six in the Omsknefteorgsintez association, and of aviation kerosene--by half in Kirishinefteorgsintez, and one-quarter--in the Yaroslavnefteorgsintez association and the Moscow NPZ [oil-refining plant]. The output of petroleum products used in automotive transportation and agriculture declined as compared to the corresponding period of last year. Production of diesel fuel fell by one-quarter or more at 11 out of 18 oil refining associations and plants of the Rosneft state enterprise, including the Saratov NPZ--by 71 percent, Khabarovsk NPZ--by 34 percent, and Ryazan NPZ--by 29 percent. The greatest drop in production of automotive gasoline was registered at the Saratov NPZ (74 percent) and Khabarovsk NPZ (45 percent). Production of diesel oil declined in Russia as a whole by 60 percent, and automotive oil--by half. The output of kerosene for technical uses (tractors) declined as compared by January-March of last year by 38,000 tonnes (81 percent) [figures as published], and at the Saratov NPZ--by 40,000 tonnes (10-fold). The decline in petroleum products production is associated to a considerable extent with nonpayments. As of 1 March this year the total accounts receivable owed to oil refining industry enterprises amounted to R3.5 trillion. Sector enterprises, in turn, owe R4.2 trillion their suppliers, banks, and so on. Because of a decline in solvent demand, unsold finished products are accumulating at oil refining enterprises. As of 1 April this year saleable remainders of technical-use kerosene exceeded by a factor of 3.7 the volume of March output; those of motor oil amounted to 52 percent of March output, of household furnace oil--35 percent, and automotive gasoline--26 percent. In the first quarter of this year there was a decline in the volume of crude oil refining by fractionation processes: thermal cracking--by 21 percent, and coking of heavy oil residue--by 37 percent. At the same time the volume of refining by way of hydrocracking increased 9 percent. Overall the share of fractionation technologies in the total volume of oil processing declined from 10 percent in the first quarter of last year to 9.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, and the depth of crude oil refining--from 60.5 percent to 58.2 percent. Fuel Trade With Near-Abroad Countries Over January-March of this year the export of fuel from the Russian Federation to Commonwealth countries: January-March 1994 exported % of fulfillment of as % of annual January-March 1993 intergovernment agreements in I quarter Gas, billion 18.8 - 95 cubic meters Coal, million 1.0 - 44 tonnes Oil, million 6.4 26 47 tonnes Automotive 73.3 6 7 gasoline, thousand tonnes Diesel fuel, 308 12 23 thousand tonnes Boiler fuel, 398 33 23 thousand tonnes Russian fuel is mainly exported to Ukraine, which accounts for 37-55 percent of all automotive gasoline, oil, and boiler oil shipped to CIS countries, and 70-80 percent of gas and diesel fuel; to Belarus--17-32 percent of coal, gas, boiler fuel, and oil; and Kazakhstan--16-22 percent of oil and coal. In January-March this year exports to these countries amounted to: Ukraine Belarus Kazakhstan January-March as % of January-March as % of January-March as % of 1994 January-March 1994 January-March 1994 January-March 1993 1993 1993 Gas, 13.0 97 4.4 88 0.3 103 billion cubic meters Coal, 520 55 159 85 223 32 million tonnes Oil, 2.6 48 2.1 59 1.0 34 million tonnes Automotive 27.6 7 3.7 47 4.3 2 gasoline, thousand tonnes Diesel 248 43 14.0 55 18.4 3 fuel, thousand tonnes Boiler 193 18 95 29 10.7 6 fuel, thousand tonnes The lag in the shipments of a number of categories of fuel mainly results from the fact that Commonwealth countries owe unpaid amounts to Russia. For this reason 2 percent of automotive gasoline quantities envisaged for the quarter was exported to Kazakhstan, 5 percent of diesel fuel, 14 percent of boiler oil, and 38 percent of oil. Reciprocal shipments of fuel to Russia over the elapsed months of this year came only from Kazakhstan. Over January-March of this year it shipped 1.3 million tonnes of oil to the Russian market (39 percent of last year's level) and 5.9 million tonnes of coal (71 percent). Stock Exchange Activities in 1993 By the end of last year there were 72 stock and funds exchanges and exchange stock departments; of them, for all practical purposes, 26 stock and funds exchanges and 36 exchange stock departments were operating in the fourth quarter. The main indicators of operations with exchange assets on the stock and funds exchange market in Russia in 1993 are shown in the table: 1993 Including by quarters I II III IV Number of 62 21 45 50 62 operating stock and funds exchanges and exchange stock departments Number of deals 93 15 14 24 40 concluded, thousands Exchange assets 2,046.5 8.9 202.5 1,349.4 485.7 sold, billion rubles including: securities 595.1 4.6 27.7 109.0 453.8 money funds 1,445.2 4.2 173.9 1,240.2 26.9 foreign 6.2 0.1 0.9 0.2 5.0 currency By the end of 1993 the bulk of operating stock and funds exchange and exchange stock departments were located in the Central and Volga regions--12 exchanges in each; six were located in the North Caucasus, eight--in the Urals, seven--in Siberia and the Far East, eight--in the Northern and Northwestern regions, and eight exchanges--in the Volgo-Vyatka and Central Chernozem regions. Central region exchanges (mainly in Moscow) accounted for 93 percent of the total volume of exchange assets sold on the stock and funds market exchanges in Russia, including 81 percent of the value of securities, 97 percent of the value of the money funds placement, and 90 percent of the value of foreign currency in ruble equivalent. Exchanges in the Northwestern regions handled 4 percent of the total volume of exchange assets, in the Urals region--2 percent, and exchanges in the remaining regions--only 1 percent. The scale of exchange activities in operations with exchange assets in 1993 by region of Russia was characterized by the following data: Number of Exchange Including as % of the total deals, assets thousands sold, R billion securities money foreign funds currency Stock and 92.8 2,046.5 29.1 70.6 0.3 funds exchange market in Russia including: stock and 49.7 1,853.0 22.0 77.7 0.3 funds exchanges exchange stock 43.1 193.5 97.4 2.6 - departments Northern 0.6 1.9 23.1 76.9 - region Northwestern 22.2 81.3 98.5 1.5 - region Central region 40.8 1,892.2 25.4 74.3 0.3 Volgo-Vyatka 0.6 0.6 100.0 - - region Central 1.0 0.3 100.0 - - Chernozem region Volga region 9.9 7.8 80.7 19.3 - North Caucasus 2.3 2.1 97.1 2.9 - region Urals regions 8.2 46.1 25.7 74.3 - West-Siberian 3.3 9.1 87.5 5.5 7.0 region East-Siberian 2.7 1.0 99.7 0.3 - region Far-Eastern 1.0 3.7 93.9 6.1 - region Kaliningrad 0.2 0.4 43.6 56.4 - Oblast In number of deals concluded and volume of exchange assets sold, stock and funds exchanges hold a dominant position in the exchange assets market. They handle the sales and placement of 91 percent of the total volume of exchange assets, including 68 percent of the value of securities, 99.7 percent of the value of money funds, and 100 percent of the value of foreign currency in ruble equivalent. Overall in 1993, 2,192.3 billion worth of exchange assets were offered for sale, and R2,046.5 billion sold, that is, the liquidity (convertibility of exchange assets into money) measured 93 percent. Operations with money funds continued to account for the bulk of operations in exchange trading (70.6 percent of the total volume of exchange assets sold), and operations with securities were second in significance (29.1 percent). Operations with foreign currency were of lesser significance for stock exchange activities (0.3 percent). Over nine months of 1993 the volume of exchange assets sold continued to increase, mainly due to increases in the volume of money funds placed through the market. In the last quarter of the year the situation changed in connection with the suspension of operations with short-term interbank credits held by the Cashier Union at the Russian International Foreign Currency and Stock Exchange. This resulted in a reduction of operations with money funds from R1,240.2 billion in the third quarter to R26.9 billion in the fourth quarter; the total volume of exchange assets sold decreased correspondingly. The most popular form of money funds were interbank credits (IBC). Their proportional share in all money funds placed through the exchange stock and funds market in 1993 amounted to 98.9 percent. Among other money funds are commercial credits, and institutional and private deposits; they accounted for 1.1 percent of total value of money funds. The liquidity of money funds throughout 1993 remained high (99.4 percent), including 99.5 percent for IBC, 94.6 percent for deposits, and 70.9 percent for commercial credits. Liquidity of private deposits is rather low--0.6 percent. Because of continuing inflation, placement of money funds at exchanges is short term. Over 1993 the bulk of deposits placed through the exchange stock and funds market were available for a period of up to three months. The structure of deposits by period of use was characterized by the following data (in % of total): Period of 1993 use, months March June September December up to 2 86 22 35 49 3 14 76 49 45 4-5 - 1 1 - 6 - - 15 - more than 6 - 1 - 6 Total 100 100 100 100 Commercial credits were placed mostly for a period of up to three months; interbank credits--up to two months. The structure of credits by placement terms (use period) is shown in the table (as % of total): Period 1993 of use, months commercial credits interbank credits March June September December March June September December up to 2 - 35 25 100 66 98 99 77 3 100 62 75 - 15 2 1 23 4-5 - - - - 19 0.0 - - 6 - 3 - - - - - - more - - - - - - - - than 6 Total 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 Continuously increasing demand for credit ensured an increase in demand for untied money funds, which included deposits of both enterprises and individuals. Over 1993 there was a marked trend toward a stable increase in average interest paid on deposits. The highest interest rates were paid on deposits placed for a period of two to three months. The "cheapest" deposits were available at the exchanges in the East-Siberian and Central regions, where on average interest rates in December amounted to 115 percent and 170 percent, respectively. The most "expensive" deposits were found in the West-Siberian region--216 percent (minimum rate 185 percent and maximum--240 percent). Bank of Russia rates on centralized credits given to commercial banks were raised eight times over 1993--from 80 percent to 210 percent. Average interest rates on interbank and commercial credits in December were lowest at Central region exchanges (mostly in the city of Moscow) and were equal to the Bank of Russia refinancing rate (210 percent), which is due to a high concentration of banking capital in the region. The highest average interest rates were noted in the West-Siberian region--251 percent (minimum rate 154 percent, maximum--280 percent). The demand for credit for a period of three months decreased in December of last year, and average rates declined to 180 percent. The spread (margin) in interest rates between credit and deposit money funds available for a period of one and two months declined considerably by the end of the year and amounted, respectively, to 9 and 16 points as compared to 22 and 33 points in September. In 1993, 53.7 billion securities were sold on the exchange stock market for a total amount of R595.1 billion. Operations with securities accounted for 89 percent of the total number of operations with exchange assets. Liquidity of operations with them measured 81.6 percent. The most prominent phenomenon in securities trading was active buying and selling of short-term state bonds (GKO) and privatization vouchers. These state securities accounted for 93 percent of the value of all securities sold; stocks of production companies, exchanges, banks, and investment institutions accounted for only 6.3 percent, and financial options, futures, bills of exchange, and others--for 0.7 percent. In connection with the Government of Russia's policy of gradual cutbacks in the volume of the Bank of Russia's centralized credits for the purpose of financing the republic budget deficit and increasing noninflationary sources of covering the deficit, in 1993 the Russian Ministry of Finance began to issue short-term state bonds for a period of three and six months. Their proportional share in the total value of securities sold amounted in 1993 to 47.6 percent. They were sold on the Moscow Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange [MMVB]. During the first placement of short-term state bonds their liquidity ranged from 41.1 percent to 99.9 percent. The profitability of issues by weighted average price fluctuated within a range of 103-176 percent; for six-month bonds it was 181 percent. High profitability made these securities attractive for investors. The development of the privatization process was reflected in privatization voucher trading. The proportion of the value of privatization vouchers in the value of securities sold in 1993 on the stock exchange market amounted to 45.4 percent, and on exchanges in the Central Chernozem region--93.6 percent, Kaliningrad Oblast--99 percent, and the North Caucasus and West-Siberian regions--78.2 percent each. The liquidity of operations with privatization vouchers remained quite high--91.4 percent. In 1993 the value of privatization vouchers kept growing. The average price of the voucher in the first quarter amounted to R4,800 in Russia as a whole; in the second quarter--R6,100, third quarter--R9,700, and fourth quarter--R18,700. In December it was selling on Moscow exchanges for R22,000. Stocks comprised the bulk of trading in nonstate securities. The proportion of stocks in the value of securities sold in 1993 on the stock exchange market amounted to 6.3 percent in Russia as a whole; on East-Siberian exchanges it accounted for 86.2 percent, on Far-Eastern exchanges--93 percent. Most of the time the stock offered for trading was common stock. Its share in the value of all stocks sold reached 95.7 percent by the end of the year; the share of preferred stocks declined over 1993 from 35.3 percent to 4.3 percent. In a number of regions--the Northern, Volga-Vyatka, and Central Chernozem regions and Kaliningrad Oblast--preferred stock was not traded; in the Volga, North Caucasus, and East Siberian regions their share was extremely small. In the Far-Eastern region overall in 1993 their share in the value of all stocks sold comprised 42 percent. Liquidity of stock operations measured 29.5 percent. The predominant kind of stocks were shares with low nominal value (from R1,000 to R10,000), which accounted for 72.3 percent of the value of all stock sold; shares with a nominal value of up to R1,000 accounted for 26.3 percent (in the beginning of 1993--50 percent and 37 percent, respectively). In the second quarter there was an increase in sales of stocks of enterprises undergoing privatization, and the share of stocks of production companies and enterprises in the total value of stocks sold increased from 51 percent in January-March to 80 percent in January-June 1993. With the activization of voucher investment funds operations there was a perceptible increase in the share of sales of stocks issued by investment institutions. While in January-March it was 2.6 percent, and in January-June--2.1 percent, in January-September it was already 54.7 percent. By the end of 1993 the proportion of stocks issued by production companies and enterprises and investment institutions and sold through the stock exchange was almost equal and comprised, respectively, 47.7 percent and 48.3 percent of the total value of shares sold. Bank stocks comprised 3.3 percent and exchange stocks--0.7 percent. Among other securities that were available for sale in 1993 but did not receive widespread acceptance were bonds of joint-stock companies, enterprises, and organizations; certificates of deposit and savings certificates; bills of exchange; financial options and futures; and others. The volume of trading in them is extremely small. They account for only 0.7 percent of the value of securities sold. Most popular among them were savings certificates, bills of exchange, options and futures--their liquidity in 1993 measured between 61 percent and 97 percent. Certificates of deposit and bonds issued by joint-stock companies were noted by their low liquidity--2 percent. Foreign currency operations played an insignificant role in the activities of stock and funds exchanges (their proportional share in the total volume of exchange assets sold comprised 0.3 percent). The bulk of foreign currency is sold on foreign currency exchanges, which are issued licenses by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation for the right to conduct foreign currency operations. The Bank of Russia in 1993 took steps in the direction of increasing the network of regional exchanges through which foreign currency subject to compulsory sales was realized. By the end of the first half-year their number reached six, and in the beginning of 1994--seven. All of this contributed to decentralization of foreign currency received and redistributed. The MMVB continues to hold the leading place in terms of volume of operations with foreign currency. Since June 1993 the MMVB has introduced more frequent trading with the purpose of meeting demand to the maximum extent possible, which increased the volume of sales of dollars. Distribution of the volume of sales and demand and supply over the year is presented in the table ($ billion): 1993 including by quarter I II III IV Volume of 12.7 1.5 1.7 4.8 4.7 sales Initial 11.9 1.5 1.6 4.2 4.6 demand Initial 12.1 1.3 1.4 4.8 4.6 supply The official exchange rate of the ruble in relation to the U.S. dollar is set by the Bank of Russia according to the results of trading at the MMVB, held on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In 1994 in the state securities market there will be an increase in the sales of GKO and gold certificates; privatization vouchers will be taken out of circulation. In March of this year the Government of Moscow imposed a tax on exchange operations involving foreign currency, which resulted in a decrease in the volume of foreign currency trading at the MMVB.
