A high-level Russian Government official said that "upon the strong request from the ROK Government, relevant Russian ministries have decided to allow five North Korean loggers who currently hold legal residence certificates in Russia out of all the loggers who have escaped from timber camps in Siberia, to leave Russia for South Korea as soon as possible." The official said that "because Russia has no legal basis to prevent foreigners with residence certificates issued by the Russian Government from traveling abroad, the Russian Government's permission of their trip to South Korea is neither a violation of domestic nor international law." A relevant ROK Embassy official in Moscow said that "ROK and Russian officials concerned are now discussing whether to allow the five loggers to leave Moscow," and predicts that "they will arrive in Seoul, though belatedly, later this month."
