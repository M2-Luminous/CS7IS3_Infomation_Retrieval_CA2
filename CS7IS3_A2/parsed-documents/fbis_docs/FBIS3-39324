Ten Turkish F-16 fighting Falcons are already stationed in Italy taking part in NATO enforcement of the "no-fly" zone over Bosnia- Herzegovina. As Greece did not allow Turkish fighter planes to fly through its skies, F-16's took a longer route over the Mediterranean to reach Italy. The decision of sending the warplanes was made after a NATO ultimatum, for Bosnia's Serbs to put heavy weapons in Sarajevo under the United Nations control.
