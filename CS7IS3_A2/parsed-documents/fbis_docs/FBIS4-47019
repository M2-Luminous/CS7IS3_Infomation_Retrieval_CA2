To make the following revisions and addenda to the Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan approved by the decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan of 23 March 1993: to make the preamble to the Program read as follows: "The Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan was drawn up in accordance with Decree 1552-XII of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan of 9 July 1992 'On Progress of Fulfillment of the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan of 19 April 1991 "On Measures for Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan."' It is an integral part of the socioeconomic policy being pursued by the Government and the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. "Social protection of the population of the Republic of Tatarstan provides for a sum total of legislatively enshrined legal, economic, and social safeguards ensuring observance of the most important social rights and the creation of the conditions for the achievement of a socially acceptable living standard of the populace. It incorporates the realization of state social safeguards (minimum wage and minimum pensions, grants, and other social payments), the preservation of current and the creation of new jobs, support for enterprise, targeted social support of the urban and rural population and other sociodemographic groups, the pursuit of an effective financial-credit and tax policy, the structural reorganization of the economic system, and the creation of market mechanisms. "The socioeconomic situation in the republic in the first half of 1994 has been characterized by a continuing decline in output in industry, a nonpayments crisis, an ineffective financial-credit and tax policy, and the lagging of the rate of growth of personal income behind the requisite level. "A trend toward a relative decline in the rate of growth of personal income has been observed since the start of the current year. "Average wages in the Republic of Tatarstan in December 1993 constituted R128,100, in April 1994, R142,700 (in the Russian Federation R141,200 and R171,500 respectively). "Per capita income in December 1993 constituted R81,700, in April 1994, R90,200 (R84,000 and R124,000 respectively in the Russian Federation). The living standard assessed as the ratio of per capita income to the value of the subsistence minimum showed a tendency to increase in 1993, but it declined in the first quarter of 1994. The main reason for the decline in society's living standard is the insufficient growth of personal income. "The proportion of the population with income no lower than the subsistence level constitutes 11.2 percent, and above the subsistence level, but below the minimum consumer budget, 56 percent, and 4.3 percent of the population is in the category of people with a high and very high income. "As of the start of realization of the Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan the numbers of the populace in receipt of compensation payments constituted 57.6 percent, in March 1994, some 5.8 percent. "In connection with the fact that the subsistence level determines the minimum permissible level of man's material security and characterizes the poverty line, it cannot be a reference point in the socioeconomic policy of the republic, it may be merely a stopping device. The need for the establishment of such a reference point is now urgent. The indicator of the minimum consumer budget should be such"; that the section "Stage I of the Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan" should read as follows: "Stage I of the Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan.
