FBIS4-53883 "dreas100_m_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 Thailand Former Phalang Tham MP Launches New Party Former Phalang Tham MP Launches New Party BK2405065094 Bangkok THE NATION in English 24 May 94 p A8 BK2405065094 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] A new political party, reportedly set up to accommodate defectors from the Phalang Tham Party, was formally unveiled yesterday. Founding member Phiraphong Thanomphongphan said his Lak Siam (Siam Principle) Party submitted its application for registration to the Interior Ministry last week. Phiraphong, a former Phalang Tham MP for Bangkok, said his party has a lot of support among businessmen, permanent officials, ordinary citizens, and politicians in existing parties. Phiraphong said the party registrar is expected to endorse the application today and Lak Siam is ready to begin recruiting members. Phiraphong was seen yesterday visiting the office of Deputy Prime Minister and Phalang Tham Leader Bunchu Rotchanasathian several times before holding his press conference at Government House. It was rumoured earlier that Phiraphong's party was being established for defectors from the Phalang Tham Party, especially those holding Cabinet posts and those who joined the Phalang Tham just before the last general election. Speculation was that most Phalang Tham ministers are disliked by members of the party's powerful religious wing, who want them out. When asked about the rumour, Phiraphong had a question of his own: is Phalang Tham close to collapse? Phiraphong said Lak Siam's leader will have to be capable of working in either opposition or government. Unconfirmed reports said Lak Siam had earlier failed to recruit former prime minister Anan Panyarachun to head the party.
