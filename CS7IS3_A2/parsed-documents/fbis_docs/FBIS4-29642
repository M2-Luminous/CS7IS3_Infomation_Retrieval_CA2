The 108 legislators from 35 countries at the Asia-Pacific Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) conference on "science and technology for regional sustainable development" made the call in a document unanimously adopted at the end of their five-day meeting in a Tokyo hotel. The document, titled "Inventing the Future: Science and Technology for Sustainable Development," said the parliamentarians "viewed human capital as the most valuable resource a country can possess for its advancement." But the document said the Asia-Pacific region contains the majority of the world's population below the poverty line and this can only be altered if countries in the region cooperate in the formation of scientific and technological partnerships aimed at regional sustainable growth. "It is clearly recognized that there are important linkages between poverty, population growth and pressures on the environment," the document said. "Poverty is indeed one of the great sources of environmental degradation. "Any practical strategy for sustainable development demands that basic needs of the population be met as a matter of the highest priority." The document said strategies to improve living standards should include expanding connections among business, industry and universities, and more emphasis on science and technology in government decision-making, particularly in new technologies like biotechnology, information sciences and bioenergy. It also recommended greater involvement of women in scientific and technological activity. Outlining the contents of the document at a press conference after the meeting, Goku Menon, head of the Indian delegation to the conference, said it focused on the uses of science and technology in meeting the basic needs of people in the region. He said the conference was an example of the growth of regional ties which will lead to greater scientific and technological cooperation at the expense of "narrow nationalism" in the region.
