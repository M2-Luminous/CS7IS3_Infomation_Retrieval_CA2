The statement points out that in 1812 and 1940 Bessarabia was torn from its homeland by means of agreements between various powers and despite the will of the Romanian people. "The events which took place in 1989 and later made us hopeful that Bessarabia would be re-unified with its motherland," asserted the Romanian parliamentarians and said that the USSR Supreme Soviet had called the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact "which tore Bessarabia from Romania in 1940" invalid. The chamber also gave its backing to Moldova's efforts to be integrated into European structures and "condemns actions of political forces trying to again include Moldova into the previous structures."
