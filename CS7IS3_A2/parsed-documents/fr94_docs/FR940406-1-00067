FR940406-1-00067 FR940406-1-00019 Proposed Amendments to §110.7_Penalties Several State pesticide regulatory agencies had questions in regard to the penalty provision in §110.7 of the current regulations. These agencies interpreted this section to provide that the Administrator, or his designee, would have discretion to reduce the penalty for a second violation of the regulations to less than $1,000 if it was determined that the certified applicator made a good faith effort to comply with the regulations, but, that the Administrator, or his designee, would not have discretion to reduce the penalty to less than $1,000 for other subsequent offenses. USDA has reexamined this issue and agrees that the current language could be unclear. We, therefore, propose to amend the penalty section to eliminate any ambiguity. We are proposing that all offenses subsequent to the first offense would be subject to a fine of not less than $1,000, except that the penalty shall be less than $1,000 if the Administrator, or his designee, determines that the certified applicator made a good faith effort to comply with the regulations. This proposed change follows the language of the statute and provides the Administrator, or his designee, flexibility in assessing penalties for all subsequent offenses, not just the second offense. Therefore, USDA proposes to amend §110.7 to read as follows: Section 1491(d) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 provides that the Secretary shall be responsible for enforcement of section 1491 (a), (b), and (c) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990. Therefore, as provided in section 1491(d) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, any certified applicator who violates the requirements of 7 U.S.C. 136i&hyph;1 (a), (b), or (c) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 in the case of the first offense, and in the case of subsequent offenses, be subject to a fine of not less than $1,000 for each violation, except that the penalty shall be less than $1,000 if the Administrator, or his designee, determines that the certified applicator made a good faith effort to comply with this Part. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 110 Pesticide and pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. For the reasons set forth in the preamble 7 CFR, part 110 is proposed to be amended as follows: PART 110_RECORDKEEPING ON RESTRICTED USE PESTICIDES BY CERTIFIED APPLICATORS; SURVEYS AND REPORTS 1. The authority citation for part 110 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 136a(d)(1)(c); 7 U.S.C. 136i&hyph;1; 7 U.S.C. 450; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.50. 2. In §110.2, the definition for licensed health care professional is amended by adding the phrase ``or certified'' immediately following ``licensed.'' 3. In §110.2, the definition for medical emergency is revised to read as follows: §110.2 Definitions. * * * * * Medical emergency. A medical emergency shall be defined as a situation that requires immediate medical treatment or first aid. * * * * * 4. In §110.3, paragraph (a)(6) is removed and paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows: §110.3 Records, retention, and access to records. * * * * * (b) The information required in this section shall be recorded within seven (7) days following the pesticide application. However, whether or not the written record has been completed, the certified applicator shall provide the information to be recorded in accordance with the provisions of §110.5(a) of this part. * * * * * 5. Section 110.5 is revised to read as follows: §110.5 Availability of records to facilitate medical treatment. (a) When a licensed health care professional, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health care professional, determines that any record of the application of restricted use pesticide required to be maintained under §110.3 of this part is necessary to provide medical treatment or first aid to an individual who may have been exposed to the restricted use pesticide for which the record is or will be maintained, the certified applicator required to maintain the record shall promptly provide the record information and any available label information. If it is determined by a licensed health care professional, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health care professional, to be a medical emergency, the record information of the restricted use pesticide, relating to the medical emergency, shall be provided immediately.
