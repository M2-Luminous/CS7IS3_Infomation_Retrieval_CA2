Gianfranco Fini opened his umbrella (or, rather, his parasol, since he will be spending the weekend by the sea) to ward off the deluge of charges being leveled by politicians and the international press. He responded with the following attack: "Such a hullabaloo is the result of the propaganda of the left-wing parties, which are seizing the opportunity to gain more space in their respective countries." [Fusi] Is it only propaganda? The [French] Socialist Rocard is even proposing a boycott.... [Fini] Everyone knows that in Italy Rocard's remarks count for absolutely nothing. It is a polemic that serves only election campaign interests. France too will be voting in the European elections.... [Fusi] Pardon me, Mr. Fini, but are you not worried about the negative image that this is earning Italy? [Fini] It is not true that there are negative reactions abroad. What is going on is the result of left-wing activists. [Fusi] Is the NEW YORK TIMES a left-wing activist, too? [Fini] No, in that instance, it is a question of misinformation and superficiality, the result of intellectual laziness. They have a view of Italy that does not correspond to the present situation. [Fusi] So will the alarm over "the fascist ministers" have no repercussions abroad? [Fini] The governments are not worried about it, nor do they have any reason to be. It is enough to wait for a few weeks in order to dispel any uncertainties. One of the new Italian Government's first tasks will be the G-7 meeting. On that occasion it will be clear to everyone that the positive evaluation of Italy will not suffer any threats because our country will not veer away from the options already adopted in the international context, nor will it fail to honor its pledges. And it will also be clear that the National Alliance ministers will not carry out any action that could modify Italy's positive international image. [Fusi] You are trying to play matters down, but the anxiety remains. [Fini] I am not worried. It is a campaign which will soon die down, precisely on the basis of the actions taken by Berlusconi or his various individual ministers. Be that as it may, I will soon be touring Europe's capitals to explain who the National Alliance is and what it wants. [Fusi] Will that be enough? [Fini] In Strasbourg [European Parliament] we will not join the far-right groups. As everyone knows, we are not allies of [French National Front leader] Le Pen, and we will continue on that path. [Fusi] The anxiety is not confined to other countries. Some people maintain that the president too suggested not including MSI [Italian Social Movement], but only National Alliance ministers in the government.... [Fini] Nonsense. There have been no vetoes, nor could there be any. The president is the guarantor of the Constitution, and the Constitution does not prohibit any individuals from becoming a minister. The only guarantee with regard to the ministers must be provided by the prime minister -- first and foremost, concerning the ethics of the individuals chosen, and also concerning their belief in democracy and freedom. But these principles apply to all future ministers, not only those of the National Alliance. [Fusi] The fact remains that it is Scalfaro who must sign the ministerial appointment decrees. [Fini] I repeat: There will be no problems, nor could there be any. [Fusi] What do you think of [Chief Prosecutor] Borrelli's decision to remain in charge of the corruption investigation panel? [Fini] He was quite right. It seems clear to me that he is trying to keep the panel united. [Fusi] What about [Judge] Di Pietro, who has denied that he wants to become minister of the interior? [Fini] I have already said that I would welcome Di Pietro as interior minister. This, even though I believe that his chances have faded now. [Fusi] Mr. Buontempo takes issue with you. Does that not worry you either? [Fini] Teodoro is contrary by nature. He is the only one who is worried, and I am pleased to leave him to his worries. I have always said that the National Alliance is a confederation of several members, and one of these is the MSI. Buontempo's fears are exaggerated and obsolete. [Fusi] So is there no right-wing fringe on the MSI side? [Fini] If it does exist, I will take note of it. But it certainly cannot influence me. I will not turn back: The option for the National Alliance is definitive, and will become increasingly so. We will contest the European elections with that symbol and of 87 candidates only 45 are MSI members. In any case, this is the only possible way.
