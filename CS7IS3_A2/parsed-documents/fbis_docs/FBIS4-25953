Published by the Information Office under the State Council, the three-part white paper gives a detailed account of China's basic position and attitudes toward intellectual property protection, and a systematic introduction to its legislation and law enforcement in this regard and China's efforts in fulfiling its duties of international intellectual property protection. The paper says that, as a whole, China, however, for a variety of historical reasons, began work on its intellectual property rights protection system at a comparatively late date. After China started reform and opening to the outside world, it accelerated the process of establishing an intellectual property rights protection system in order to rapidly develop social productive forces, promote overall social progress, meet the needs of developing a socialist market economy and expedite China's entry into the world economy, says the paper. According to the paper, since the end of the 1970s, China has done a tremendous amount of effective work in this field, covering in a little more than a dozen years a distance which took other developed countries scores of years, even a hundred years, establishing a relatively comprehensive legal system for the protection of intellectual property rights, thereby attracting worldwide attention for its achievements not only in establishing the system but also in enforcement. The paper says that it is the Chinese Government's view that the intellectual property protection system plays a significant role in promoting progress in science and technology, enriching culture and developing the economy. It adds that it functions both as an important institution ensuring the normal running of the socialist market economy and as one of the basic environments and conditions for conducting international exchange and cooperation in science, technology, economy and culture. China considers the protection of intellectual property an important part of its policy of reform and opening to the outside world and of the building of its socialist legal system, the paper says. Since the initiation of the policy of reform and opening to the outside world, China has formulated a number of laws, such as those on trademark, patent, copyright and combating unfair competition, and has been actively involved in the activities of world intellectual property organization and other concerned international institutions and become member states of related international conventions. When reviewing the World Intellectual Property Organization's past 20 years of cooperation with China, Dr. Arpad Bogsch, director-general of the organization, pointed out that "China had accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in the history of intellectual property protection," the paper recalls. In accordance with its national conditions and current tendencies in international development, China has formulated and fine-tuned various laws and regulations on intellectual property protection, thereby constructing a socialist legal system for intellectual property protection with Chinese characteristics, says the paper. It concludes that the scope of the intellectual property rights protected in China and the degree of protection afforded have gradually conformed with international practices and the high degree of legal protection for intellectual property rights has been realized. The white paper points out that China's Intellectual Property Law stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne by anyone who violates the law, including civil liability, criminal liability and exposure to administrative sanctions. The white paper says that with the implementation of intellectual property laws, intellectual property rights are effectively protected in China. These laws are also actively encouraging invention and other forms of creation and fair competition. For instance, the protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in China. The Patent Law of China has greatly encouraged inventions and other creations in China, and has proved a magnet to patent applications from other countries and regions. The third part of the white paper gives a presentation of the executive system on the protection of intellectual property rights, that is, the judicial as well as the administrative approaches to the protection of intellectual property rights. In China, any citizen, legal person or any other organization may appeal to the people's court in accordance with the law upon infringement of their rights. They enjoy practical and effective judicial protection. The people's court exercises judicial authority independently. They submit only to law, without interference from any administrative organs, social organizations or individuals. The white paper points out that in addition to judicature in accordance with international practices, China's system for the protection of intellectual property rights comprises the Patent Law, the Trademark Law, and the Copyright Law and other administrative channels designated in intellectual property laws, all proceeding from China's actual conditions. For instance, since the Copyright Law was put into force in 1991 local administrative organs responsible for copyright affairs investigated and dealt with many cases involving pirated books and video products and illegal duplication of laser discs. They have confiscated and destroyed the pirated goods and levied administrative sanctions on the infringers. A large proportion of the cases concerning violations of foreigners' intellectual property rights were investigated and dealt with by China's intellectual property protection administrative offices on their own initiative, acting in accordance with their prescribed functions and powers. The white paper points out in the concluding remarks that more than a few international observers have come to the conclusion that in terms of intellectual property protection China has reached international advanced levels. Nonetheless, China cannot remain satisfied with the achievements it has already made. China is a developing country and still has much work towards optimizing its intellectual property system. This system in its modern form was established only a short time ago, and as a result, awareness of intellectual property rights remains underdeveloped in society at large. In some regions and in some governmental departments there is insufficient appreciation of the importance of intellectual property protection. Some serious acts of infringement have violated not only the legitimate rights and interests of the holder of the intellectual property right, but also the dignity of the law. Accordingly, the State Council has drawn up decisions on further strengthening the protection of intellectual property. China is confident that the implementation of all the important measures contained in the decisions will mark a great new step forward in the nation's efforts to ensure the protection of intellectual property rights. China will continue actively to promote international cooperation in the field of intellectual property and tries to make positive contributions towards the development and optimization of the international intellectual property system.
