An Unsatisfactory Situation The Facts With the collapse of the USSR and the profound change in the strategic stakes, France, even more than other countries, finds itself forced to redefine its priorities. In the intelligence sector, economic and technological concerns are becoming as important as they are in the military and political sectors. The time has come to improve the system for the acquisition, processing, and dissemination of knowledge--a system that is deemed inefficient. And so the formulation of the economic intelligence concept comes at just the right time in terms of meeting the vast and urgent needs of our country in this sector. An examination of the national apparatus holds few surprises. It resembles a railroad map, with all the government intelligence bodies (ministries, secretariats, departments, agencies) converging on the central administration in Paris, while what is missing is transverse communications routes! Thus we have a perfectly centralized system, one that is designed to serve the state alone (that is, its function) but lacks internal flexibility. Most important, it does not have natural channels to the business sector, even though that is the nurturing medium in which the life of the whole complex develops. Another schematic, expanded to include all of the public and private sources, of which there are many, shows a dispersed network in which the only strong link is that between the state and the nationalized enterprises. Each of the other client categories (territorial collectives, large enterprises, PME [small- and medium-size businesses]-PMI [small- and medium-size industries], banks, and trade unions) has very little communication or poor communication--or none at all--with its other economic partners. Thus, one can identify the principal gaps in our system. There is an absence of state policy on economic intelligence; global disinterest in the matter on the part of the elected officials; an almost total failure to exploit the remarkable resource represented by the French-speaking world; very little transfer of knowledge from the military-industrial complex to civilian enterprises; very little use being made of intelligence by the PME-PMI; total inactivity on the part of the trade unions, contrary to the practice of their German counterparts; and heavy foreign domination of the offices of private consultants who, as everyone realizes, know everything about a business after an audit. Considering the matter from the point of view of the business sector, for the moment, we see that in the most important businesses, the economic intelligence function is inadequately integrated in the strategies of the top management and general staffs. In the PME-PMI, the problem is most often ignored, or is not dealt with due, one must assume, to the lack of resources or the lack of time. The CCI [Chambers of Commerce and Industry], for their part, are beginning to open up to economic intelligence, some of them quite dynamically. Overall, the use made of economic intelligence is limited, for the most part, to the establishment of centers for documentation or oversight, the creation or consultation of data banks, and the organization of industrial safety or security teams. It is true that these elements, often dealt with very capably, are indispensable, but they are but a part of the whole. They are scattered tools the use of which is not integrated on the basis of a vision of the whole, much less a collective dynamic. Having made this statement of what is missing overall, it is useful to look for the causes thereof. The Causes An earlier study devoted to intelligence[.sup]1[/] provided me with an opportunity to express my regret that our French character is hardly such as to direct us toward collective effort, nor toward the somewhat strict disciplines required for the mastery of information. Economic intelligence is the twin of information--without being identical to it, if only because of its open nature--"to a sufficient extent" to justify using the same reason to explain the same effects. At the outset, there are many cultural characteristics that result in blockages in the structures, ways of thinking, and behaviors. Where institutions are concerned, the longstanding trend toward centralization, the cult of regalian power, the difficulty of establishing procedures for dialogue--all of these things are basically opposed to the circulation of information, which, while it is not handed down the line willingly, does not move up the line any more easily. Information is power, and it will therefore be generated with such caution that it may perhaps be obsolete even before it has served anyone's purposes. The hierarchic procedures used in government departments for disseminating information might thus prove counterproductive in some cases. Moreover, the indispensable rules for protecting confidentiality constitute obstacles, in a number of cases, such that the sharing of the wealth contained in information is impossible. And so it is that overall the norms for classifying information in the public departments and the private sector, with all texts being drafted in isolation, constitute a jungle of prohibitions and procedures rather than a clear and consistent system adapted to the operational needs imposed by the new stakes in world economic competition. The difficulty is even greater if the problem is considered on the European level. The Europol project designed to combat the traffic in drugs is coming up against national regulations that are blocking the creation of a complete central index for the use of the police and customs authorities in all of the signatory nations. Thus, the government departments, which are oriented more toward the upper levels and toward themselves than downward, or even toward their neighbors, constitute in themselves the framework for constraints and major contradictions that are hindering the establishment of a state economic intelligence dynamic. In the majority of the enterprises, the absence of an economic intelligence background is reflected in numerous ways. The problems include the intermingling of espionage and open research (the only realm of interest to us here), the inadequate mastery of the realities in the war of competition, the resistance to the compartmentalization of sensitive intelligence because of the fear of internal repercussions on human relations, the difficulty of expressing information needs, the refusal to recognize that useful information has its price, the limitation of practical use to the single realm of technological oversight, the lack of awareness of the collective aspect of the problem on the part of personnel, and a decision-making process that gives the owner's intuition priority over a rational analysis of the factors involved. Within the context of the war of competition, these errors spell eternal doom for those enterprises--particularly those in the key industrial sectors--that fail to learn to correct the situation through the specific integration of economic intelligence, specifically in their patterns of thinking and their practice. In the banking sector, which is a pillar of the economy and the information crossroads, one must mourn the lack of a global apparatus for collecting and processing information. This is "each man for himself" elevated to a system that does not work to the benefit either of the cost price of information or the adoption of a veritable economic intelligence process. For those who realize that the banks are fundamentally more patrimonial than speculative (despite the recent real estate disaster) or industrial, this attitude comes as no surprise. Unlike the Anglo-Saxon banks, they hesitate to take risks. They differ from the German banks in that they reject commitments over the very long term, as well as the partnership with businesses without which there can be no veritable industrial policy.[.sup]2[/] Thus they are more inclined to defend than to attack. In pursuing this course, they carefully protect their own little patch, and they have, for example, thus far effectively contained the Japanese competition in the deposits sector, thanks to a well-established network and extremely functional internal organization. Although that is true, their offensive approach is less well-established. Does the Credit Lyonnais still remember that at the beginning of this century it had such an exemplary information system that some Swedish banks sent spy missions to Paris to learn how it operated? Are our commercial banks offering our enterprises services as complete and dynamic as those the German banks routinely provide to their clients? Didn't the recent disaster in real estate investments cost vastly more than would have been the case with a reasonable economic intelligence apparatus involving a minimum of structures, some resources, a special training plan, and, above all, a minimum of exchange of information? Thus, the same cultural causes give rise to the same losses and inadequacies. Our well-known individualism is naturally opposed to the sharing of information and to its joint enrichment. It is indeed true that powerful networks exist, for example that of the "old boys" who are the products of prestigious crucibles (the "great schools") and who do communicate, but mainly among their peers. And the sum of the private interests does not always coincide with the overall collective interest. Moreover, our Latin fondness for the spoken word does not make us paragons of discretion. And in addition to that, our curiosity is opposed to the application of the frustrating "need-to-know" rule, which limits access to information. And then, too, we prefer the appearance of immediate results to the essential nature of long-term undertakings. That having been said, self-flagellation is not an end in itself, and we are not, after all, without certain weapons for waging the necessary battle--with a view to winning it, of course. The Planning Laboratory The globalization of the economy and the stakes in the integration of France into the European Community have led the departments under the prime minister (General Planning Board, Technological and Industrial Development Service) to reflect on our industrial capacity to compete and, in particular, with Mr. Henri Martre presiding, on the subject of "economic intelligence and strategy in the business sector." For one whole year (September 1992 to October 1993), therefore, some 50 representatives of all of the participants in economic life (businesses, social partners, local agents, public authorities, and members of the European Commission) labored on this new theme, putting together a very important and original base of knowledge, as presented in this article. Three working subgroups studied the following complementary themes: comparative analysis of the economic intelligence systems throughout the world; economic intelligence within the enterprise sector; and national considerations, prospects, and actions. The first positive consequence of this work was that it brought together the main agents in economic activities and the professional users of information, which circumstances (and compartmentalization) usually keep separate. An evident synergetic effect favoring a subsequent horizontal demultiplication of activity (proceeding within networks) could be noted. A single example illustrates this statement. The work done revealed that there has usually been a lack of studies undertaken following commercial failures. As a result, the idea of looking for the causes of an exemplary failure, such as the failure to sell a weapons system to a foreign country because a competing product won out, was born. The study pursued led to pertinent conclusions that could be used immediately by the interested parties, the most important being the great difficulty encountered in using an approach of the economic intelligence type. The second consequence was the identification of the main sources of dysfunction, some of which have been described above. The third consequence was a number of recommendations that can provide a guide for perfecting a model of a system adapted to our needs and our culture were inspired. A Possible National Model The established importance of cultural factors in economic intelligence points to the need for a French model. Thus for us, it is a matter of incorporating the methods tested elsewhere and deemed transposable, on the basis of what we are and the nonvariable factors in our general organization, while at the same time enriching this experience with the many contributions our natural flexibility will make possible. While it is clearly understood that business must be at the heart of the desired system, it must also be noted that today it will be possible to reach the critical mass needed for the efficiency of the whole only with the power of the state apparatus. The German and Japanese examples are explicit in this regard. Our lengthy experience in mixed state and private sector structures may prove a decisive trump, if we are able to make the mechanisms run more smoothly and truly put them in the service of the enterprises. It is in this way that it should be possible to find "the most French solution." In our research, we immediately rejected the Japanese model based on a collective organization, real estate discipline, and a desire to dominate that we do not have. We will maintain some distance, as well, from the Anglo-Saxon model, the liberal certainties of which are debatable. This will not be easy, for the majority of our elite personnel have been steeped in this model, and our training schools are not prepared for such a development. However, the facts will force them to admit, along with Christian Harbulot, that "an effective information strategy today must be built around a national economy dominated by an objective alliance between the private sector and the public sector." With this in mind, it could be noted that the German model is of great interest to us. Its power rests, on the one hand--we saw this earlier--on a synergy realized among businesses, banks, insurance companies, and the public authority, which includes both the federal departments (information project-study department) and the Lander (bodies working to develop mixed-capital commercial ventures). We have noted that in France the main poles of economic intelligence have been the enterprises, the state (central departments and various bodies), and the territorial collectives. The recommendations as to the desirable directions to be pursued in the effort to make our model, properly adapted and efficient, a reality, remain to be proposed. The Role of the State Without in any way taking the place of the enterprises, the state should play a major role in the prospective path that concerns us. It should be an institutional role, first, defining a veritable economic security doctrine, which is the indispensable framework for the articulation of the various mechanisms making up the desired intelligence apparatus. The existing texts were drafted with the prospect of a wartime economy in mind. They must be adapted to the economic war in the peacetime in which we are living our daily lives. This means, first of all, a review of the conditions governing access to the information in the hands of government departments[.sup]3[/]; a still more refined definition of economic crimes, including those affecting information; and, finally, a drastic escalation of the applicable penalties. It is true that the new Penal Code will not go into effect until March 1994. A second series of efforts will focus on the mastery of information, both on the national level, where the complete cycle should be improved, and on the level of Europe, with a view, in particular, to the new threats of major economic crime. A third improvement will involve filling in the prevailing gaps separating the central and regional administrations and the private sector. A special effort to make good use of the foreign trade networks is also needed. Much could be done to make standard information generally available.[.sup]4[/] On all levels, the formats for access should be modified in order to separate the portion of information that is protected from that which can be disseminated. A veritable commercial logistics system for information must be created to let the public know of the existence of studies and reports that are not confidential, to automate access to them and to organize independent dissemination. All of this can be entirely profitable, because information today has its price. Cooperation between government experts and those in the user enterprises could also be organized. The role of the state in providing incentives might involve sponsoring the development of new careers in the information field, establishing pilot programs at the nationalized banks to implement an economic intelligence policy of collective interest in this professional sector, and encouraging individual and group undertakings oriented toward the development of economic intelligence. Thus, without creating additional structures, and at the same time seeking out new sources of income, the state could encourage the establishment of a veritable information project-study system. The Territorial Organizations The primary role of the territorial organizations should be the coordination of activities. Each of these entities (regions, departments, communes, CRCI [Republican Committee for Trade and Industry], CCI, and professional associations) have, in fact, quasi-independent relations with the state and with foreign countries. One can imagine the duplication, the loss of information, the blurring of our image abroad, and the bargains made available to foreign competitors. On the basis of the observations made in countries as dissimilar as Germany, South Korea, and Sweden, it appears clear that the key role in the organization of the circulation of economic information is played by the regional councils, which have the power and the financial means, and the chambers of commerce. Situated halfway between the enterprises and the government departments, they comprise the privileged level for contact with the PME-PMI. This explains, for example, why they have given priority to scientific and technical information (because of the proximity of the ARIST's,[.sup]5[/]) as well as the protection of assets (the main concern of the enterprises). On a parallel basis, the 21 regional chambers and the 162 local chambers of commerce should, then, make the best possible use of the potential offered, first by the 25 ARIST's, which employ 150 information experts and 750 assistants distributed among the 25 regional centers, by helping them to develop their activities and to play a larger role; and then by the 184 economic information centers, the 25 regional international documentation centers, the 29 "Euro-infocenters," etc. They could also identify the relationships among the commercial forces in order to establish the levels and the intersecting points for the circulation of information and the improvement of operational information. They could develop a broad sensitivity to economic intelligence and training for the designated agents. They could report on the use of the very numerous national data banks (Delphes, Telefirm, Firmexport, Perene) and various others, of which there are scores. They could further develop local training and commercial English, the inevitable key to the export sector. The field of desirable and possible actions available to the regional councils and the chambers of commerce is thus limitless. The Business Sector For the business sector, the base of the economy, the frequent source of, and the logical terminus for information, the task involves giving the economic intelligence function the place it deserves, on an urgent basis. If this is not done, it will mean bankruptcy or the loss of autonomy. Business structures must, first of all, explicitly integrate the intelligence function in general management in which the dominant information triad ideally includes strategy and two principal adjuncts. One is "intelligence," which dictates what one should do as a function of the "prior information" available on the sector and the competition. Then there is the "logistics" adjunct, which dictates what one can do with the existing resources. Strategy then issues its instructions to the operational agents. We have moved far away from our habitual civilian and military practices. It is essential that it be possible, within each enterprise, to identify the director of "intelligence" as such. His authority will extend to the "economic intelligence" structure, to the resources, the procedures, and the training. The structure should include a department responsible for sponsoring research, the utilization of the results, their dissemination, and information security,[.sup]6[/] as well as cells in the various departments of the enterprise. One employee will deal with economic intelligence locally in each of its basic and daily aspects. Experts will occupy the positions requiring lengthy training. Resources are absolutely essential. A budget must be agreed upon, one sufficient to guarantee the establishment and activity of networks, the tracking of competition, the gathering and processing of documents, various equipment, security, and training. The procedures used must be precise, diversified, and adapted to all the activities in professional life--contacts and travel, conduct in the field, active security, the gathering of information, accounting, the daily attitude toward internal and external information, and daily protective procedures. Training must be simultaneously broad (general consciousness-raising) and specialized (for the economic intelligence employees and the experts in utilization and security), and it must have precise objectives (specific phases). It is necessary to develop the conviction that economic intelligence as a new weapon can only be effective in an enterprise at the price of definitive commitment on the part of the general management and real support from the personnel, and, a fortiori, its representatives. Today, the threat of unemployment is giving powerful impetus to the needed development of thinking. Also, of course, the concept of economic intelligence will inevitably contribute to the cohesion of the enterprise. Thus a mastery of understanding in the economy should lead to a whole spectrum of specific measures designed to produce a French model, the characteristics of which might be summarized as follows. A flexible and well-adapted state structure: Following the revision of the legislative and regulatory texts and the establishment of an efficient administrative information network oriented toward the business sector, specific measures would allow a collective culture and practice to emerge, particularly regarding auxiliary activities in the realm of training and the sponsorship of innovative public and private projects. Territorial organizations taking the initiative, financing projects, and more efficiently coordinating and demultiplying information, to the direct benefit of businesses. Banks making more dynamic prospective utilization of information to the benefit of the client enterprises, which ask only to become partners. Simplified enterprises, routinely receiving information from the government departments and the banks, and experienced in aggressive and legal economic intelligence practices. It is therefore clearly with a view to a collective and aggressive information culture that all of the protagonists in our national economic life must unite their efforts. The tribulations experienced by the SME [European Monetary System] during the summer and the dispute about GATT have clearly demonstrated that this national framework is not yet obsolete, however necessary the search for a homogeneous European complex, united against the two other continental economic blocs being established, remains. We, too, can legitimately seek to have an economic intelligence system adapted to our individual characteristics and our interests. Conclusion The increasingly keen economic competition on the international level has long since made the productivist logic of Taylor obsolete. We have proceeded from "produce, first" to "sell at any price," and this imperative has had as its corollaries increasingly "harsh" practices, even approaching criminality. This competitive confrontation has become a complex phenomenon. With the globalization of the economy, everything is developing as if the planet had shrunk. The commercial opportunities are dwindling steadily, and competition is becoming visible on various levels in the international market. The business sector thus finds itself at the point where the tensions and multiple contradictions described in the first part of this article intersect. Management of this complexity requires various tools, and economic intelligence is one of those in the front rank. Since our country failed to appreciate the dimensions of the phenomenon in time, we find ourselves faced with the situation familiar to all of us. The damage done is considerable, and it has not yet been fully assessed. We note the unemployment, but not the slow takeover of our best enterprises by foreign capital--capital that in some cases is not even European. Is anyone aware that a third of our PME-PMI that have more than 250 employees are no longer French? Within this critical context, we can no longer afford to savor the delights and the horrors of Gallic discord. We must make the cultural leap recommended by Toffler because today "knowledge is moving to the top of the list of resources," and it can only be obtained on the basis of "the free flow of information." And that, in turn, depends on the organization of information channels. To achieve all this, we must change our assessment of the world around us and learn to interweave information and strategy, on the one hand, and innovation and the assessment of competitive forces, on the other. Only a collective advance in economic intelligence can enable us to resolve this new and complex equation. However, the game is far from lost. What has been our weakness can become our strength. It has now been established that only those information systems backed by the power of the state can achieve critical mass. Our long tradition of ongoing relations with the establishment gives us a real advantage--for example, over the American society. Our Latin nature, keen and curious, intuitive and "Cartesian," predisposes us to intelligent research and the sensible employment of useful information. There must be better coordination between these two phases, just as down the line the distribution of information must be organized. This latter is the realm in which the Japanese and the Germans excel. What we need now is a collective desire, properly adapted tools, and coordinated undertakings by the practitioners themselves, operating on functional levels. The state must introduce some flexibility into its powerful and diversified machinery. The territorial organizations must play their intermediary role more effectively. Our banks must draw inspiration from the German banks. And our enterprises must be daring! In these times of grave crisis, this national ambition can only be transformed into a reality through the joint actions of the citizen--the individual economic operator whose concern is his job--and the public and private enterprises and bodies--the collective economic protagonists who are focused on their tasks or their balance sheets. Let us all remember that economic intelligence is a state of mind, that it is a matter of a collective information culture...and that it will reward each individual information recipient one hundredfold. Following the end of the Cold War, this is the challenge of the hour: the mastery of useful information, which is the new key to power because it makes the adoption of decisions based on a strategic perspective possible. Let us state it plainly. Economic intelligence is legitimate, and all advanced countries make use of it. This will not be easy, but we no longer have a choice. And then, "where there is a will, there is a way." Let us boldly take up the challenge that economic intelligence represents. Footnotes 1.

It must be said in their defense that the 1981 nationalizations affected the private banks owned by the industrial groups in particular, interrupting a process "in the German fashion" that is well-adapted to economic competition. 3. For example, the protection provided Ministerial Instruction No. 486 by the notation "limited distribution" is counterproductive. This useful document should be freely circulated. 4. The Beatrice customs authorities' data bank, for example, is not sufficiently well-known. 5. Regional scientific and technical information agencies. 6. There is an academic dispute between the advocates of autonomous security and those who urge integrated security. Since the real situations vary infinitely from one business to the next, the proper solution is that which proves best adapted locally.
