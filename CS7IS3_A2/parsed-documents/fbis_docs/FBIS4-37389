Nor has he succeeded in attaining an agreement over a mechanism for observing a cease-fire. Do you see this as a failure of Lakhdar Brahimi's mission? [Al-Akwa'] First of all, I thank you for this interview. In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. I wish to comment on the description given to us as being the Sanaa delegation. We did not come here in the capacity of a delegation representing only Sanaa but as a delegation representing the country's ruling three-party coalition, the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. We came to Cairo on this basis and in order to meet with the representatives of the third coalition partner, the YSP. When we arrived, however, we discovered that they were insisting that they represented an independent state. This is of course impractical and unacceptable. [Riyad] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj [foreign minister in south Yemen] has declared that the coalition delegation, as you have described it, has no authority to make decisions. [Al-Akwa'] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj has no justification to say such things. What is the authorization needed to make decisions? When a certain party sends an envoy on a particular mission, this means it gives him powers equal to his mission. [Riyad] 'Abdallah al-Asnaj has remarked that Aden's delegation has the power to make decisions pertaining to a cease-fire. [Al-Akwa'] I wish to say this: He represents a rebellious party and can claim to have power. In actual fact, they always avoid reaching a solution. Formerly when we and they held a political dialogue, I was a member of the political dialogue committee. Whenever we came close to a solution, they provoked disputes and introduced new debates to lead us into an endless maze that would prevent a solution. [Riyad] Why does the fighting continue so fiercely despite the two sides having accepted the idea of dialogue and the UN Security Council resolution which provides for a cease-fire. Sanaa bears the blame for continuing the war, or at least everyone is saying that it is to blame. [Al-'Akwa'] This is a very simple matter. A permanent cease-fire aims to encourage the international community to intervene and disengage the two warring sides. This is the rebels' objective. From the beginning the rebels sought not to solve the crisis or observe a cease-fire in a normal way. They were afraid that if this happened, the citizens would think more about the situation and distance themselves from the rebels' goal, namely seceding by force. Their aim is to continue the fighting and to provoke an international response. They went so far as to attack civilian targets inside Aden in order to claim that the legitimate forces had carried out those attacks. They did this to justify intervention by international troops to disengage the warring parties. They wanted to guarantee their secession. [Riyad] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that Egypt stresses the need for observing an immediate cease-fire because continuing the fighting would devour all chances of safeguarding unity. Under the current circumstances, how do you view the future of this unity? [Al-Akwa'] Truly, all the Yemeni people support unity. When we say they are rebels we do not say it just for the sake of making accusations. They claim that they want to secede the south. But they do not represent the south or the wishes of the people of the south. They fail to understand the geographical reality of the south. They are now deployed in extremely small areas. Let's take for example the southern governorates. Lahij is currently under the control of legitimacy; Abyan is also under the control of legitimacy; parts of Shabwah, Aden, and Hadhramaut are under the control of legitimacy. They are deployed in a very small area. They have no popular support. They rely on party forces. They rely on individuals who have received party education. This is evident in the support that the citizens in the southern and eastern governorates give to the legitimate forces. The rebels' forces have been expelled not only by the legitimate army but also by the citizens in those areas, whether in Abyan, Shabwah, Hadhramaut, or Lahij. The security and administrative affairs in the areas that were regained by the legitimate forces are being supervised by their sons and not by the legitimate forces. This is obvious and any person can verify this on the ground. We do not consider our brothers in Egypt as a foreign party. We believe that we have common blood with our brothers in Egypt. Yemeni and Egyptian blood was shed and it watered the Yemeni land to achieve and establish the Yemeni revolution. The revolution's principal objective was to achieve the Yemeni unity. [Riyad] What is the next step now that UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has failed in his mission? [Al-Akwa'] I do not believe that he has failed. [Riyad] But he failed to bring the two sides together, or to achieve a unified formula of a mechanism for halting the fighting. [Al-Akwa'] I am definite that Lakhdar Brahimi has not yet announced that he has failed. It was the rebels' representatives who said that Brahimi has failed. This is because they had built their calculations on this basis -- that Brahimi would fail in his mission. They made the announcement before Brahimi said anything. Brahimi has not failed, but they tried to place obstacles to undermine his mission by insisting that they represent an independent state. If we were prepared to accept them as an independent state, there would have never been a problem or a war. But the problem cropped up when they tried to impose secession and set up an independent state by force. It was the responsibility of the government and the legitimate forces to defend unity. They started to use force to impose secession. [Riyad] Does this mean that the dialogue will continue and that there is hope that an agreement will be reached? [Al-Akwa'] We are interested working out an actual mechanism for a cease-fire. We believe that every day that passes means more blood will be shed and more people will be killed. This will only complicate the issue. Every day that passes means more efforts will be needed to resolve the problem. Therefore, we are very interested in working out a mechanism that could achieve a cease-fire immediately. [Riyad] Thank you. [Al-Akwa'] You are welcome.
