The two presidents have reached an agreement to end the targeting of their long-range nuclear missiles at each other. Skeptics had been prompt to point to the infirmities in the accord. Besides mentioning the difficulties involved in carrying it out, they have pointed out that the whole exercise could be easily reprogrammed to return to the old position of aiming at each other. However, what is being forgotten is that despite numerous problems afflicting U.S.-Russian relations today, Russia as well as the other constituents of the former Soviet Union have along with the United States firmly set themselves on a course of nuclear disarmament which is practically irreversible. Both the intermediate nuclear forces treaty evolved at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in December 1987 in Washington and the Strategtic Arms Reduction Treaty, START-II, arrived at in January last year in Moscow during the last Bush-Yeltsin summit have provided sufficient testimony of that course. In fact, such a course signifies the final burial of the cold war, conclusive evidence of which is offered by the latest accord. Perhaps, more striking is Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, the president of Ukraine, joining Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin in Moscow to attest their signatures on an agreement envisaging the destruction of the nuclear arsenal in Ukraine's possession. This arsenal of 1,900 warheads is the world's third largest after those of the United States and Russia. This accord too has generated a lot of skepticism, fuelled as it is by the rise of nationalist sentiments in the various republics of the erstwhile USSR threatening to nullify the essence of whatever has been achieved. Nevertheless, while not being blind to such an eventuality, it is necessary to underline that these fears are exaggerated, precisely when the public opinion in Russia and other member states of the former Soviet Union is for protection of their national interests alongside economic development and national regeneration for which reinforcement of peace through nuclear disarmament constituents an essential precondition. Mr. Clinton has emphasized the U.S.-Russian role in promoting European security. The agreements about to be concluded in Moscow are of far-reaching nature and would, therefore, actually exert a powerful positive influence on global security in general, far beyond the borders of the European continent. They are also in full conformity with the Indian action plan for disarmament spelt out by the late Rajiv Gandhi at the third special session of the UN on disarmament.
