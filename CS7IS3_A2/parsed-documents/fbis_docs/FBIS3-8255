Barely 24 hours after taking control of the airfield, the 140 Swedish and Danish troops under the command of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) have deployed across the north-east base, ensuring around-the-clock security along the 2,400-metre (3,000-yard) runway. The bid to open the airfield to humanitarian flights for the first time in 23 months of war, in an operation codenamed Pegasus, is to officially begin at noon Tuesday. It follows an agreement by Bosnian Serbs encircling the area to allow two air corridors into the Moslem-held city airport. Backed by machinegun-mounted armoured troop carriers and six Leopard tanks, they have been instructed to watch movements by Bosnian Serb forces dug in eight kilometres (five miles) away but in a direct line with the runway, which can take heavy transport aircraft. The men must also pinpoint attempts to infiltrate the airfield perimetre, seven kilometres (4.2 miles) long. "I don't want to see flocks of sheep on the runway when the planes begin to land," an officer said. But one of the top priorities for now is to clear the field of mines. "This military base has been mined three times," said the Swedish commander Magnus Lavman. The army of former Yugoslavia laid mines, especially anti-tank devices, when the airport was built. It has remained in disuse since 1992 when troops avacuating the field booby-trapped the airport and commandeered its technical equipment and fighter planes, including MIGs. Last year, troops from the mainly-Moslem Bosnian army fearing attacks from enemy Bosnian Serbs laid new mines in the woods surrounding the field. French bomb disposal experts have already been ordered to the base. A first military plane carrying technical equipment is expected within five to seven days. "We must move swiftly. The UN's credibility is at stake," one western officer said. During the first stages of the operation, UNPROFOR planes alone will land on the runway. The Russian-built Ilyushin 76s, Antonov 32s and Yakovlev 40s are to transport electronic, fire-fighting and loading and unloading equipment to be used for the relief flights. Once this part of the operation is complete, within several weeks, UNPROFOR will have to establish flight approach routes to avoid over-flying combat zones. When the field has been secured and equipped, transport planes carrying aid for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will be able to start bringing in relief. The relief flights will enable much-needed supplies to reach some 700,000 people, most of them refugees who fled from other areas and have been surviving on deliveries made by road convoys that cover only 30 percent of their needs. Aid flights are to come in from Zagreb and the Croatian port of Split under an agreement between the United Nations and the Bosnian Serbs. The airport is located about 15 kilometers (nine miles) from Tuzla.
