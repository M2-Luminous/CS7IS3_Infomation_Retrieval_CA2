It is out of the question to yield to pressure from the militiamen, General Germanos, deputy chief of staff of the French Armed Forces, says. [Begin Germanos recording] A certain number of militiamen are currently manning roadblocks on the roads along which our units are driving with the aim of reassuring the population. Faced with the very resolute stand adopted by our soldiers, who confronted the militiamen, and following a very stern warning from our men, the militiamen cleared roadblocks and pulled back. What we want, and we said so very firmly, is to prevent them from opposing in any way the action aimed at ending the killings and at controlling the situation. We will not accept that.
