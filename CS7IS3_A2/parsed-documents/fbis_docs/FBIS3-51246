Perez Balladares was interviewed live during our morning newscast: [Begin recording] [Perez] We foresee a confrontation between groups that oppose this government and the government, regardless of the government candidate's name. [sentence as heard] We believe there is still time to comprise the alliances that are necessary to remain in power. We will also, obviously, lead the people's opposition proposal against the current regime, the government that failed to yield results, the government that resulted in frustrations, that we [words indistinct]. [Unidentified reporter] Regardless of the government candidate's name, meaning Ruben Dario Carlos or Mireya de Gruber? [Perez] Regardless, we think there will be a government candidate and our own candidacy. [Reporter] It does not matter if the candidate is Mrs. Gruber or Mr. Carles who is reportedly going along those lines? [Perez] That is not the important issue. In any case, I think they both represent the government. Former Comptroller Carles was a conspicuous member of the current government until recently. He now reneges on many of his promises, but we will remind him about those promises in due time. Mrs. Gruber is president of the Arnulfist Party and, evidently, she seems to be its standard-bearer. We believe they are both one in the same. [Reporter] Is the PRD willing to relinquish a vice presidency either to the PALA [Labor Party] or the Liberal Republican Party, in case an alliance is comprised, particularly when the PALA.... [pauses] Dr. Carlos Lopez Guevara said here, in a "Telemetro Reports" morning newscast, they will leave if they are not given the opportunities they expect. [Perez] I think it is more serious, meaning it is more important and worthy for us to present a proposal that is capable of implementing our government platform than to go around, like some parties are doing, making a show of themselves by handing out what they do not even (?have). [Reporter] You specifically mean the ruling parties. [Perez] Of course. I specifically mean them. Consequently, I believe our directorate board, which shall meet quite soon, will be the one to decide the terms and conditions of the alliance. [end recording]
