Target date or not, it seems to be farther away than before. A closure has been imposed on the territories after a wave of terror attacks, and we do not seem to be making any progress. [Rabin] I disagree. The government has decided to opt for a political solution on the basis of the Declaration of Principles, signed in Washington, and the Cairo agreement, which settled the main security points regarding Gaza and Jericho. It states precisely that the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip will remain there in blocs and details the travel procedures for the Israelis there. We should remember that there are 5,000 Israelis and 750,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The agreement also settled the problem of the border crossings, as well as responsibility for external security on land, at sea, and in the air. Naturally, at the same time we are dealing with those Palestinians who fight the agreement through terrorism, primarily against Israelis. We suffered a severe blow in the ruthless murder in 'Afula by a suicide terrorist who activated a car bomb near a bus stop there. We suffered many fatalities in that instance. This war, conducted primarily against the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad terror organizations, continues. One of their men attacked passengers at the Ashdod Junction. We are aware of this, and we will fight them with all our might. I believe we will defeat them, although we have witnessed terror attacks in the past, and I fear that there is no hermetic solution to the problem of terrorism. We have not achieved this in the 46 years of the existence of the State of Israel. Our effort today is directed at attaining a compound solution, one aspect of which is political -- that is, getting rid of Gaza. I would be very glad to see the moment when Israeli soldiers, in the framework of an agreement -- not a withdrawal without agreement -- will no longer have to move around Greater Gaza, with its 750,000 residents, and suffer casualties as we did during the seven years of intifadah. [Raz] Mr. Rabin, you speak of a political effort. Will the indefinite closure that is part of the war on terrorism, as you announced at the cabinet session yesterday, not harm the effort to attain an agreement with the PLO? Cabinet ministers warned yesterday that it might make 'Arafat refuse to assume responsibility for the territory. [Rabin] I do not think so. I believe 'Arafat and his followers will opt for the political solution and take charge of the Gaza Strip -- with the exclusion of those matters we agreed on in the Cairo agreement and the accompanying map, of course. I believe we have the right to protect ourselves, especially when there is a political opening and the option of reaching an agreement. We did not suspend the discussions following a Palestinian terror act against us; he did, after the Hebron massacre. Therefore, we are not to blame for lost time. The government must provide for maximum security, and this is not easy. For example, the car bomb that resulted in the deplorable crime in 'Afula was stolen in Tel Aviv and bore an Israeli license plate. Some 10,000 cars with Israeli license plates cross from Judaea and Samaria into the territory of Israel daily. The soldiers and policemen make every effort to check them. Let us not forget that there are dirt roads they can take. A suicide terrorist who is willing to die may succeed here and there. We will do everything possible to prevent this, but there have been five car-bomb attacks by terrorists. We are dealing with terror organizations the likes of which we did not know three years ago. The method of operation of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad and their readiness to commit suicide is reminiscent of Hizballah in Lebanon, which caused us serious damage and many fatalities in the past. Yet we will deal with and overcome this problem in a compound move consisting of a political solution and military activity. [Raz] Perhaps the best way to deal with those organizations is not by imposing a closure but by stopping the political process because it is causing more Israeli fatalities? [Rabin] I believe you cannot compare the situation today with that in the past. Stopping the negotiations would be a victory for the enemies of peace, on the Palestinian side primarily, as well as the opposition to peace in Israel. A loathsome murderer who committed the crime in 'Afula should not be rewarded by our stopping the political process. [Gay] Are we not rewarding those who refuse to condemn it or at least openly stand up to those who are trying to kill the process? [Rabin] I believe 'Arafat made a grave mistake when he did not condemn the attack; however, his conduct is no yardstick for the Israeli Government. Therefore, I do not believe that stopping the negotiations is the right thing to do. It would be giving a prize to those who kill Israelis and want to kill the peace. [Gay] We have heard a lot about the need to consider 'Arafat's domestic difficulties, but it seems that support for the agreement among the Israeli people is waning. Demonstrations against it are staged every evening at main crossroads. Does this not worry you? [Rabin] Allow me first to address the Palestinian side of the issue. The fact is that I suggested imposing a closure because, first of all, we must take every step to provide more security for the 97 percent of Israelis who reside within the boundaries of sovereign Israel, including united Jerusalem. Naturally, we have an obligation to protect the 3 percent of Israeli citizens who live in the territories of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. As for the opposition here, as long it is within the boundaries of the law and is reasonable, it is legitimate in a democratic state. I believe the extreme right has crossed red lines. I do not recall that when the terror attack in which we suffered the most fatalities since the State of Israel was established took place -- I am referring to the 1978 attack on the bus on the Coastal Road, between Herzliyya and Tel Aviv -- any of us called the government bloody or turned the blood shed there into a tool for political gains. The time has come for the extreme right to stop rejoicing over spilled blood. [Raz] Let us turn to the other negotiating track: Syria. Has there been any development there? The negotiations are to resume at the end of this month. [Rabin] The negotiations with Syria will resume, and I believe that, following the new framework we discussed during my meeting with President Clinton in the United States, we may find a way to get the negotiations onto more reasonable tracks than those along which they have been conducted so far in Washington. [Raz] Is any preparatory work being done? Are there any new tracks? [Rabin] The problem is that there are no additional tracks at this time. I feel, however, that the shape of the negotiations as we knew them in Washington is no longer appropriate. There, the Syrians demanded that Israel pledge a full withdrawal in return for full peace, which the Syrians have not defined. I will not accept a demand for total withdrawal as a precondition for negotiations. Negotiations should deal with every aspect: the nature of peace; the extent of withdrawal, since Israel had agreed in principle to a withdrawal on the Golan Heights; the linkage between peace and withdrawal; security arrangements; timetables; the normalization steps to be taken at every stage and the duration of the examination of the normalization before we withdraw to the agreed upon line -- as is well known, we oppose total withdrawal; and, naturally, the U.S. contribution to fortifying Israel and to supervising the arrangements that will be made with the Syrians in the framework of a peace agreement. These issues will have to be examined in a comprehensive framework and not as the Syrians have been trying to do by saying: First say total withdrawal, and then we will talk. This will not serve as the basis for negotiations with Syria. [Gay] Another issue on our agenda today: Will you make one last move to prevent Knesset Member Hayim Ramon and his friends from announcing that they will run on a separate list in the Histadrut labor union elections? [Rabin] I held quite a few discussions with Ramon in which I did my best to convince him not to run on a separate list. I have a lot of regard for Hayim Ramon. He was a very good minister and a loyal partner in the last Knesset elections campaign. I believe he will be making a grave mistake in terms of his cause and his personal career. At the same time, he is a big boy now and can make his own decisions. Naturally, as party leader I believe it is a mistake to quit the party. All past examples show this does not work: Ben-Gurion, Moshe Dayan, Shim'on Peres, and many others quit MAPAI [Israel Workers Party] in 1965, certain they could score an impressive achievement. They won 10 Knesset seats and returned home four years later. It would be a shame to try this again. [Gay] Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. [Rabin] Thank you.
