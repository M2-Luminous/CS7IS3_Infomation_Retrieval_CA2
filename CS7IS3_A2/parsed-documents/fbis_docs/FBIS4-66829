Keramane, governor of the Bank of Algeria, by the APS; place and date not given: "`Adjustment Is First of All an Internal Necessity'" -- first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] [Text] In an interview with the APS, Mr. Keramane explained the agreement with the IMF; here are excerpts from this interview. [APS] Mr. Governor, Algeria has just signed a new agreement with the IMF in the particular conditions that our country is experiencing. How would you describe it, especially as far as its implications for our economic and financial situation are concerned? [Keramane] You are right to mention the particular conditions that our country is experiencing, which refer first of all to the current economic crisis--a crisis which, except for petty differences between factions, has brought about a national consensus on the need to get to the root of the problem. In other words, it is an established fact that in order to achieve a diversified modern economy, better equipped to open itself to the world, adjustment is a necessity, and would be so even if oil sold for $30 a barrel. Adjustment is first of all an internal necessity resulting from the situation of our economy, not from any treatment imposed upon us from the outside. This being so, because oil does not sell for $30 and since our debt service is one of the heaviest in the world, it is useful, if not indispensable, that this adjustment should get the IMF support. Especially considering that in recent years, in the context of the new international order, the IMF has become a kingpin in international financial relations. Our internal social problems force us to look for the most gradual transition possible, and therefore to try and avoid the shock therapy which, by the way, did not always yield the expected results in those countries that already used it. This explains why the negotiations were long and difficult. [APS] Will the stabilization measures that Algeria is beginning to implement, with the devaluation of the national currency and credit tightening, remain in force for the entire term of the one-year agreement, or should we expect other similar adjustments to follow? [Keramane] In a stabilization program, most if not all measures are taken at the start of the program. We must define new economic parameters and then let economic operators, the production sector and the various agents adjust to the new context. Economic operators need stability, which is the objective of the stabilization program; therefore, we are not going to keep changing the rules of the game. As far as the rate of exchange is concerned, 36 dinars to the dollar is a realistic rate that may provide a basis for stabilization. It represents a reasonable adjustment, which was necessary and, at the same time, is sufficient. Certainly, you might say that a 40-percent devaluation is a lot, but you should recall that, a little over two years ago, negotiations with the IMF revolved around a rate of 32 dinars to the dollar so that, taking into account inflation and the increasing financial problems we have had in the past two years, it is not excessive to have reached conclusions on the basis of 36 Algerian dinars to the dollar. This, we believe, is how this devaluation should be judged. As far as interest rates are concerned, they were slightly increased, precisely to support the new exchange rate level. In this case too, the objective of the stabilization program is generally to achieve positive real interest rates, i.e., a structure with interest rates higher than those of the structure we just agreed on. The bank lending rates will be relatively stabilized, and the cost of credit to the economy should not increase appreciably. The objective is to contain inflation and achieve a reasonable underlying inflation rate rather than to systematically attempt to achieve positive real interest rates. Actually, this new interest rate structure anticipates inflation control. In other words, the essential objective of the program is to bring inflation under control and, by the end of the year, to achieve a reduced inflation rate in line with the interest rate structure we agreed on. Borrowing rates, for their part, will increase, and the CNEP [Algerian National Savings and Insurance Bank] also just gave the signal. This will stimulate savings and enable banks to allocate intermediate and long-term credits more efficiently. To answer your question more bluntly, I can say that we are not contemplating any additional surprise measures. This being so, we should also not operate in a rigid context. In such a program, you monitor the real economy, and you may have to adjust to its evolution. [APS] What material measures are you contemplating to soften the impact of the current adjustments on the purchasing power of households? [Keramane] The problem of the household purchasing power is linked to that of inflation control. First, we must define the inflation problem. At times, as was the case for instance during Ramadan, there may be large price increases on some products, but the inflation picture, as reflected in the annual inflation rate, is relatively lower since, for 1993, it was estimated at about 20 percent, compared with 32 percent in 1992. Devaluation should not translate into large price increases. You should not make the simple reasoning of transposing the devaluation percentage into price increases. First, because many products are manufactured locally; therefore, only imported products will be directly affected by the devaluation. They will be affected somewhat later, when new inventories are brought in. Normally, current inventories should be sold without any price increase. As far as industrially manufactured goods are considered, inflation will come into play only through imported inputs that, depending on the product, account for a varying proportion of the final product cost and, in this case too, do so with a certain lag. Therefore, the effect of devaluation on prices should normally be moderate and staggered in time. We should recall that the objective of bringing inflation under control is an essential objective of the stabilization program, and one that will be achieved through a whole series of measures. This is the best way to protect the purchasing power of households. Of course, for the most underprivileged the program provides that the social safety net will not only be retained, but also improved. [APS] What about the impact on the operation of the production plant? [Keramane] As far as the operation of the production plant is concerned, now that the stabilization program has been adopted the essential factor is that the production sector will find it easier to import its raw materials, its spare parts, and all the things that constitute the production input. This means, in particular, that companies will have access to cash to buy products commonly used in their production processes. As a result, the cost of credit will be less. Perhaps some companies could even reduce their raw material inventories since they will be assured to have ready access to their supplies. Generally speaking, therefore, these measures linked to foreign trade and import financing should have a twofold positive effect on the production sector: reduced costs and increased operating flexibility. [APS] The easing of restrictions on foreign trade implies commercial convertibility of the dinar; is Algeria getting close to this objective? [Keramane] The stabilization program implies an easing of restriction on foreign trade and will provide a number of measures to that effect simultaneously with measures that the Bank of Algeria will take concerning import financing. We can say, therefore, that this program will make it possible to achieve the objective of commercial convertibility of the dinar. [APS] Companies, both state-owned and private, might again raise the question of exchange losses? [Keramane] This question was raised after the 1991 devaluation and, as you said, will probably be raised again. Today, however, its extent is reduced by the fact that operators were able to protect themselves against currency risks through the futures quotation system set up by the Bank of Algeria. Certainly, the problem of exchange losses is a major problem and the Algerian Government took it into account in their negotiations with the IMF. It will be possible to set up a system to soften the impact of devaluation on the debt of state-owned and private companies. Of course, compensation will be only partial and in keeping with the nature of the economic activity considered. [APS] Does the correction of internal financial balances, as a major stage in the structural adjustment of the economy, mean that the Bank of Algeria will follow a policy of strict financial austerity, irrespective of the priorities of economic recovery? [Keramane] For an economy, overall financial austerity is linked to the existence, or lack, of a budget deficit, which may be big or small. As far as the budget deficit is concerned, which amounted to 9 percent of the gross domestic product in 1993, the stabilization program will make it possible to aim for a post-stabilization deficit of 5 percent in 1994. It will be further reduced in 1995. The revenue increase resulting from the devaluation and the expected effects of the rescheduling will make it possible not just to achieve the budget deficit reduction objective, but also to provide increased resources for credits to the economy. It will therefore become possible to give the necessary importance to economic recovery without monetary laxity and without starting again to print more money. Actually, as far as monetary expansion is concerned, the program sets an objective that aims to strengthen the downward trend of money supply observed in recent year. As you know, monetary expansion reached 24 percent in 1992 and 21 percent in 1993, whereas fiduciary money grew by 17.6 percent in 1992 and 14.3 percent in 1993, respectively. These figures show that monetary expansion was far less in recent years than some would say, and the trend toward a reduction of these rates will continue under this program. [APS] In addition to the billion dollars that the IMF intends to make available, what can we expect from our economic partners in terms of financial contributions? [Keramane] We should first point out that the IMF $1-billion contribution is particularly large for a one-year stabilization program and for a country like Algeria. It is a sizeable contribution to our balance of payments, and it is also a signal of the IMF to the international community, at multilateral (World Bank, European Community, etc.) as well as at bilateral level (with the various partner countries), and to the world's financial and banking system. There are a number of credits in the form of [word illegible] installments that remain available with multilateral partners, and the Algerian Government will therefore endeavor to have these installments made available as soon as possible, simultaneously, with the EEC and with the World Bank as well as with other potential multilateral partners such as the Arab Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank. We should also make contact to obtain other credits to support our balance of payments or to finance projects, as the case may be.
