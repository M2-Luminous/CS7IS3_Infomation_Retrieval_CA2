An official at the container shipping headquarters of the China Ocean Shipping Company, which opened the new route, said that the rapid growth of Sino-U.S. trade and trade with other Far East nations have made the opening of the new route a necessity. According to the official, ships will leave Tianjin every Saturday and go via Qingdao in Shandong Province, and Kobe and Yokohama in Japan to Seattle in the United States. Then they will sail north to Vancouver in Canada and return to Tianjin via Kobe. Six ships capable of handling a total of 2,700 containers will ply the new route. That will push the China Ocean Shipping Company from tenth position to fifth position among 100 shipping companies in the Pacific region in terms of shipping capacity. The first port with a specialized container dock in China, the Tianjin port now has eight berths for containers, with an annual handling capacity topping one million standard containers. The port has opened some 160 international shipping routes.
