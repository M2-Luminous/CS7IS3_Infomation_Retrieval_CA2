What is the reason for this? [Stanic] We believe that the founding of a zupanija did not suit the Posavina inhabitants, i.e., that this was not a solution of the territorial- political problem of the Bosanska Posavina. The reason for this is a whole series of specific characteristics, mainly its distance from Herceg-Bosna. Moreover, one should not disregard the fact that we are under occupation, so that our interests and the interests of Croats who live in the free territory of Herceg-Bosna are not the same. Our specific characteristic is also that we are not at war with the Muslims. Our relations are very correct, Croats and Muslims are waging the war together against those who attacked them. [Sabic] How would you define the position of the province in relation to Herceg-Bosna and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Stanic] We believe that we are entitled to a place both in the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Herceg-Bosna. Simply stated, we are part of the Croatian body but also of the internationally recognized state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In declaring the province we are not threatening what Herceg-Bosna has positively achieved thus far, nor do we intend to do anything that would lead to a conflict among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. No political or legislative body existed in Posavina, there was no unified government because municipalities were directly linked with Herceg-Bosna, so that the founding of the province was a great accomplishment. [Sabic] You say that you do not want a conflict to occur among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, certain political disagreements exist, and with the founding of the province of Bosanska Posavina they gain importance. [Stanic] A political conflict already exists, but it will remain just that. I must emphasize that the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] as well as representatives of political and military leaderships, cultural societies, and the Church participated in the convening of the first general assembly of Bosanska Posavina. A few days later, the same people who participated in the proposal of the decision and in the conclusions publicly disassociated themselves from the decisions of the assembly, which is rather unbelievable. We believe that this is the influence of the people from Herceg-Bosna, which means that there is an effort from one center to carry out a policy that should be valid in the entire territory. [Sabic] Posavina residents held assembly meetings even before the one at which the decision on establishing the province was made. How many assembly meetings were altogether held? [Stanic] What is in fact happening, what each of these gatherings mean was probably not explained in the best way. There was only one general assembly, the one that was held in Slavonski Brod. Before that, an assembly of Croats who emigrated or were exiled from Bosanska Posavina was held.
