FBIS4-6570 "dreas078_c_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea U.S. Defense Secretary's ROK Trip Denounced U.S. Defense Secretary's ROK Trip Denounced SK2204102194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1007 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204102194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's three-day visit to South Korea was a war monger's trip aimed at examining the war preparations against the North on the spot and giving a new order to the puppets. During his trip, Perry held military confabs with the traitor Kim Yong-sam, the puppet defence minister and the puppet foreign minister and framed a series of dangerous intrigues such as resumption of the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers this year, reinforcement of U.S.-South Korea combined forces, strengthening of a "cooperation system" and promotion of "sanctions against the North" at the United Nations Security Council. This was an unpardonable criminal act which would bring the situation on the Korean peninsula to a crisis and might cause a dangerous event. Perry did not forget to cry over the "provocation" of the North. But this was intended to justify the aggressive design of the United States. It goes without saying that the military provokers on the Korean peninsula are the United States and the South Korean puppet clique that deployed new-type Patriot missiles in South Korea and plan to extensively introduce tanks, howitzers, multiple rocket vehicles and other means of war. The warhawk Perry's visit to South Korea and war confabs show well that the U.S. authorities have no willingness to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation but they are working hard to stifle the DPRK with strength. It must not go unnoticed that the Kim Yong-sam group invited the U.S. defense secretary for a "close cooperation system" and held war confabs with him against fellow countrymen. This eloquently shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is a gang of never-to-be-condoned traitors hell-bent on war provocations against the North with the sinister intention to slay fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces as a war servant of the United States. Although the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique are trying to strengthen the "cooperation system" and overpower the DPRK with strength, it is a foolish dream. The U.S. imperialists and the "civilian"-veiled warmaniacs must refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful that their persistent line of war and confrontation will lead to their own destruction.
