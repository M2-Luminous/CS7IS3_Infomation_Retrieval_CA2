FBIS4-8434 "dreeu072__a94006" FBIS-EEU-94-072-A Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Ministry Supports Passage of UNPROFOR Gear Ministry Supports Passage of UNPROFOR Gear AU1304175594 Sofia BTA in English 1716 GMT 13 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1304175594 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- A BTA correspondent today asked Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov about the Foreign Ministry's stand on a UN request for Bulgaria's assistance in the transportation of UN property and equipment for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] contingent in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] via its territory. The deputy foreign minister said taking an official stand on this matter is within the cabinet's powers. The Foreign Ministry's opinion after careful consideration of the request, made on behalf of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, is that this country's reply should be a positive one, Mr. Churov said. UNPROFOR-Macedonia has an entirely new task to carry out. With its task to prevent the Yugo-conflict from spreading to Macedonia, it is the first preventive operation the UN has ever launched. Bulgaria, therefore, sees UNPROFOR-Macedonia as a factor of stability in this part of the Balkans, and its presence there, as fully coinciding with this country's national interests. Being committed to Article 43 of the UN Charter, this country is expected to meet any request on the part of the organization to facilitate its operations, including passage through Bulgaria's territory when it is essential for keeping the peace and security in the world. In this particular case were are being requested to facilitate the passage of UN equipment and not military troops, which means that a decision on the matter should be taken by the cabinet, Mr. Churov said. The deputy foreign minister went on to say that Bulgaria's consent has nothing to do with granting corridors for the passage of military contingents of countries which, according to Bulgaria, should not in any way participate in the Yugo-conflict, even if under the UN auspices. Our conviction is that the United Nations will use the equipment for preventive and not military operations. The request is within this country's commitments under the UN Charter and has a mostly technical character, the deputy foreign minister also said. Bulgaria's principled stand in favour of non-involvement in the Yugo-crisis remains unchanged. So is this country's understanding that neighbouring or Balkan countries should in no way participate in the conflict, Mr. Churov said.
