It raised objections to the idea expressed by the president in his New Year address of forming a broader coalition. Yesterday, a reply was delivered to our editorial office. We are publishing the letter in full: "I have read your open letter of 8 January 1994. I respect your right to an opinion and to criticize the president's public addresses. Nevertheless, I believe that it would have been decent if you had asked me to answer your questions in a personal letter to me, rather than in an open one, or if you had invited me to a private meeting so that I could explain any misunderstanding before you took a public stand. It is not customary for a president to answer open letters in the press. I have decided to take this course because of the particular significance of the problems that you presented in your letter. In the meantime, other voices have been raised on the same problems, accusing me of wanting to cast doubts on the position and work of the government. This is utter nonsense and the product of unfounded mistrust, which I must categorically reject. You yourselves ask several questions that seem to blend into a single one: You ask me whether other parliamentary parties in addition to the HZDS and the SNS [Slovak National Party]--that is, parties that do not have any credit for the establishment of the Slovak Republic--should be represented in the coalition. Let me recount several basic facts. The results of the elections in June 1992 facilitated the formation of a government purely on the basis of the program of the HZDS and the SNS. This government had the support in the Slovak parliament not only of 74 HZDS deputies but also of 15 SNS deputies. Because of this and also because of the votes of some Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies, it was possible for the Slovak parliament to adopt the Declaration of Sovereignty of Slovakia and to approve the Constitution of the Slovak Republic. We did, however, need votes from other parties in the Federal Assembly to pass the Law on the Demise of the Federation and other related laws. We succeeded, as is well known, in obtaining votes from the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia [SDSS] and again from the SDL. Therefore it was possible to terminate the function of the federation by peaceful and constitutional means and start on 1 January 1993 on the road of independent state existence. The demise of the federation ended the first postelection phase, and the emergence of the independent Slovak Republic on 1 January 1993 started the second. In this second postelection phase, during which the silent coalition fell apart and eight deputies left the HZDS club, there are much more difficult and long-term tasks that require, among other things, the consolidation of all forces and their participation in carrying out historic tasks. There is no point in incessantly recalling who wanted or did not want what prior to the elections and during the first postelection phase. Instead, we must ask who and under what circumstances is ready and willing to participate in building the Slovak statehood and solving vitally important problems. We need to invite partners rather than produce adversaries. Such work requires peace, stability of government, a Slovak Partnership for Peace--that is, a partnership of all the significant political forces and trust and support from abroad. This could be achieved if the government were constantly supported by 80-90 deputies. Given the present coalition, we know that consistent support can be expected from 74-76 deputies. It is enough to continue with makeshift government solutions and improvisations that enable it to survive on a month-to-month basis. It is not enough, however, for us to seek in a peaceful atmosphere and with the maximum support of hundreds of thousands of people the conceptual and profound solutions to the problems of the economy and internal security and to receive sufficient trust and support from abroad. I appealed in my New Year address for a peaceful and conceptual way and for stability of government, which requires the consistent support of at least 80-90 parliamentary deputies. In this spirit, I spoke about the need to form a broader coalition government. That is why I am calling for such a government. It is my duty. The responsibility of the HZDS implies the movement's obligation to form such a government. It is the duty of not only the HZDS chairman or the HZDS leadership but of the entire HZDS to do everything in its power in the interest of finding a solution to the vitally important needs of our citizens, to create political stability in the country and accord among political and nonpolitical forces. Its election victory granted the HZDS a single privilege--namely, the right to form a stable government and guarantee a peaceful atmosphere and the necessary support for its work in parliament and public administration. Whether we like it or not, the exercising of this privilege puts an end to the differentiation between those who wanted an independent Slovak state and those who did not, those who voted for the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Slovak Republic and the Constitution of the Slovak Republic and those who did not, those who vociferously call for early elections and those who oppose them, those who support the government and those who criticize it and incessantly question its acts. According to our democratic Constitution, regardless of whether we are in the government coalition or the opposition, we are all equal, and that applies not only to deputies but to all citizens, regardless of whether they voted for the HZDS, the KDH [Slovak Christian Democratic Movement], the SDL, or Coexistence. To ask for other privileges in addition to this is undemocratic and anticonstitutional. You ask who is to be in the coalition that I am postulating. Again, I can only give you a general answer, but I know that a coalition can only be formed with the help of those political entities present in parliament. Who will form it depends on whether the HZDS will aim for a broad coalition, with the support of at least 80 deputies, for instance, or a broader coalition, with the support of, say, at least 90 deputies. True, within the broad coalition, the election results would definitely have to be taken into account, both in the composition of the government and in its policy objectives. This would not mean in either instance--and with the parliamentary mechanism it is not even possible--a denial that the HZDS emerged from the elections as the strongest political force. If a broader coalition government is considered, then it is solely because such a situation transpires in parliament as to make it a necessity. While, at the beginning of 1993, it was possible to choose between a noncoalition and a coalition government, today a coalition, and it seems a broader coalition, government is unavoidable. I again repeat that personal dislikes of people at the head of individual parties and movements must not stand in the way of the formation of a stable and operational government. I would be glad if these words could convince you that, with my idea of the need for a broad coalition in my New Year address, I did not in the least intend to cast any doubts on the government. This is precisely the reason that I refer to a broader coalition government. I see in it a guarantee of a greater and more stable support in parliament and in the public. Only such a government can guarantee internal stability, raise the international credibility of our state, and contribute to the creation of a calm, human, and working atmosphere in our country. We can achieve this only if all of us consistently put the interests of Slovakia and its citizens above the interests of individual people, parties and movements, and other groups.
