Watanabe, a former trade minister, made the remarks in a speech in Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima Prefecture, in northern Japan. He mentioned Shinseito, Komeito, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the parliamentary group composed of Sakigake (Harbinger) and Japan New Party (JNP) as parties that could form single force to maintain power against the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Watanabe said, "we have responsibility for merging the five political forces into a single party prior to the April 1995 nationwide local elections and the July 1995 House of Councillors election." Shinseito, a splinter from the LDP, would put priority on merging with the JNP, headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and Sakigake as a first step toward reorganizing Japanese politics, Watanabe said, adding, "we will then call on the SDP, the DSP and Komeito to join the force." He said the five political forces should forge a single party to satisfy the Japanese people. Shinseito and Komeito have said the governing coalition parties must unite to create a two-party system, sustain a coalition government and prevent the LDP from regaining power. The LDP lost its 38-year grip on power last August shortly after its defeat in the July 18 general election.
