It is one of nine plants providing lighting and heating for Russia. Its contribution to the country's power system is 12 percent. In the central and black earth region the Novovoronezh plant provides 75 percent of the power needed by the region. Systematic nonpayments by consumers are the reason for the possible shutdown: the nonpayments slow down the reconstruction and modernization of the station's power sets. There are not sufficient funds to improve safety guarantees. [passage omitted]
