Wanton actions or thoughtlessness that put other people's lives or health in danger are punishable. Thus, one might believe that reckless sex would also be a criminal offense. But such is not the case. With its verdict yesterday, the Supreme Court decided that if an HIV-infected person performs unsafe sex without informing his partner of the risk, knowing full well that there is a danger of a lethal outcome of the act, then it is not a punishable offense. The Supreme Court's verdict was immediately faxed to Arhus, where the Western High Court was trying another case involving an HIV-infected woman who stood accused of having unsafe sex without informing her partner. In accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court, the woman was soon able to leave the Western High Court after being acquitted. This puts the matter back in the hands of Folketing. The Folketing has been under the impression that the deliberate spread of infection was covered by existing paragraphs in the penal code. But now the Supreme Court has indicated that the law does not provide such clear authority. The Folketing must now do something about this. Of course, we must not start a witch-hunt against HIV-infected persons, but those who are infected must recognize their personal responsibility, which is a consequence of the fact that they are a potential danger. The entire AIDS system, with its built-in oath of silence and anonymity, is presently based on voluntarism and trust. But when we see examples of flagrant irresponsibility, as illustrated in the extreme by the case before the Supreme Court, we cannot help but think that the system must be changed. One's own misery is not lessened by sharing it with others. Particularly considering that AIDS must presently be seen as incurable, it should be a crime for a person who knows he is HIV-positive to fail to inform his partner of the danger.
