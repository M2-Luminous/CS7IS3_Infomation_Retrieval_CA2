The explanations were a result of the wave of rumors that have arisen with respect to other financial institutions confronting problems. According to public opinion, there is a list of institutions facing bankruptcy that have been rejected for intervention by the finance minister. In brief statements to the press, the finance minister overruled the Banking Superintendency's stance with respect to the banks' opening again in two months time and said: "Take notice of what I am saying, they will open [words indistinct]." Sosa Rodriquez was also asked about repayment schedules, to which he reiterated that up to 4 million bolivares would be paid, as established by law, and not the 10 million bolivares recommended by the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund (Fogade). Nevertheless, the finance minister expressed his confidence that account holders will not "withdraw 4 million bolivares in one single blow." The minister did not explain how they intend to cover the funds once the banks begin to operate, since it had already been reported that the funds would be obtained through a 150 billion bolivar bond issuance as approved by the Public Credit Law, better known as the Emergency Law, which includes a total sum of 400 billion bolivares. This total amount is intended to be enough to reimburse 90 percent of the account holders of the eight institutions in which the government intervened this past Tuesday. Finally, Julio Sosa Rodriguez was asked about the censure vote proposed by the Radical Cause Party parliamentary bloc, which, if supported by two thirds of the vote, would force the minister to resign. The minister refrained from commenting, smiled, and only recalled that a censure vote had already been passed against Andres German Otero, an engineer such as himself. Mr. Otero was finance minister during the first government of former President Carlos Andres Perez. Congress is scheduled to vote on the censure motion this coming Tuesday.
