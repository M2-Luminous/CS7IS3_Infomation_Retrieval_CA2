A provincial government official said that over the past few years, Anhui has spent billions of yuan building a network of railways and roads. To date, new railways totaling 2,000 km have been built to link Anhui to neighboring Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, he said. A new railway construction upsurge emerged last year, he added. Construction of the 200-km Hefei-Jiujiang section of the Beijing- Kowloon railway is nearing completion, he said. Hefei is the provincial capital and Jiujiang is a major port city on the Chang Jiang river in neighboring Jiangxi Province. Another 190-km section of the railway, a top-priority construction project, is being built in northern Anhui, he noted. In 1993 Anhui began building and upgrading 91 roads totaling 2,817 km, he said. These roads will be built at a total cost of 4.8 billion yuan. A bridge across the Chang Jiang river is being built at Tongling, a nonferrous metal production center in east China. The bridge will be the first along the 400-km section of the Chang Jiang flowing through Anhui Province. The official said that Anhui currently has 30,729 km of roads, including 102 km of expressways and 1,120 top-grade highways. Now, roughly 99 percent of all rural townships and 80 percent of all villages are connected with roads. The road density in the province averages 22 km per 100 sq km, he said. Anhui has also made fresh progress in airport construction in recent years. The Luogang airport in Hefei has become a modern airport, and an airport in the city of Huangshan, best known for its picturesque Huangshan mountains, can accommodate Boeing 737 jetliners, the official said. Two airports opened in the cities of Anqing and Wuhu, respectively, last year. Another airport in the city of Wuyang is being expanded to accommodate Boeing 737s later this year, the official said. Anhui currently has regular air services to 20 major cities in other parts of China. Air routes now link Hefei and Huangshan directly with Hong Kong, he said. The Chang Jiang port cities of Anqing, Tongling and Maanshan opened to foreign ships in 1993. Another port city, Wuhu, opened to foreign ships in 1992. To date, Anhui has opened ten shipping routes to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Russia.
