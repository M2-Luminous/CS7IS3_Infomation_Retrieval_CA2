[Pittner] First of all, we are going to create conditions, be they personnel or organizational, to ensure calm in the streets, to ensure calm in society as far as crime is concerned, as well as in relation to certain manifestations of hatred that can be expected at times of political change. My view therefore is that our task, rather than reorganizing the ministry, will be to take measures so that the citizens have the chance to prepare themselves in a free and democratic atmosphere for early elections and vote in accordance with their conscience. [Samel] Does it mean that you are not planning any changes in the system, for example, in relations among the police, the Interior Ministry, and other relevant bodies? [Pittner] It is quite possible that some changes will have to be made in the Police Presidium, since, in my view -- which, however, is not very well-informed at the moment; I will need to have the situation analyzed -- it has become bloated and has perhaps become, I am exaggerating now, a second ministry. [passage omitted] My aim will be to slim down the Police Presidium and ensure that it is effective and performs tasks necessary for the benefit of the citizen. [Samel] What steps do you intend to take in connection with the investigation of the events of 14 March, when four journalists were assaulted in Primate Square? [Pittner] It is a very serious matter. Alas, it was very irresponsible of the previous government to turn down the president's request that it remain in office until the new government was appointed; this meant that the police lost their top leadership, which must have influenced the way they acted. On the other hand, it does not exonerate those policemen who did not fulfill their duties. If it is proven that the accusations were true, or that they refused to help others because of political reasons or inclinations to different political views, the most strict legal measures will be taken in accordance with the law on the police corps.
