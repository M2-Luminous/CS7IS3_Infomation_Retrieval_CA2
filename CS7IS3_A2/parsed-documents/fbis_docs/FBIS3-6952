"The incidents that took place can be divided into two categories. The first involves people wanting to put political pressure on the government, while those responsible for the second category are terrorists," Chawalit said at a press conference after a 90-minute meeting with senior police officers. Chawalit said the March 3 grenade assault on Social Action leader Montri Phongphanit's home, the March 8 bomb attack on a train in Songkhla's Chana district, the March 9 grenade attack on Deputy Permanent Secretary for Interior Sawai Phramani, the March 13 grenade attack on the Nakhon Phanom governor's residence and the March 20 blast in downtown Hat Ya in Songkhla province fell into the first category. The truckload of explosive materials which was believed to be aimed at the Israeli Embassy last Thursday was the work of international terrorists the interior minister said. "I call on the public to remain calm and analyze the situation carefully to arrive at a rational conclusion. I have told you before that I will take responsibility for everything that happens," he said. But he claimed the attacks carried out by disaffected political elements with the aim of destabilizing the government were not of national significance. "For example, the grenade attack in Nakhon Phanom (at the provincial governor's home) may be a mistake on the part of the assailants," he said. "Acts of terrorism usually intensify and eventually lead to armed struggle, which is exactly what happened in our country in the past," he said. Chawalit said his meeting with senior police officers, led by Police Director General Pratin Santipraphop, was to review the political implications of the incidents and to find ways to effectively deal with them. He said he was satisfied with police investigations into the incidents. But he could not set a deadline for the cases, which he described as difficult to be solved because those involved are not "common criminals". "Bringing the perpetrators to justice is not beyond the arm of the law," the minister said. Chawalit said he was summoned by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday morning for a briefing on the latest developments in the investigation into the cases. Police sources said the interior minister imposed a code of silence on all senior police officers except Pol Gen Pratin. Pratin, asked to comment on criticism that police always failed to catch people committing terrorist acts, said: "I think we will fail to arrest any of them again this time." Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of the National Security Council, said he briefed the prime minister on the terrorist attacks during a two-hour meeting yesterday. "Thailand should not be made a target of terrorist attacks. We denounce all acts of international terrorism that affect our internal security," Khachatphai said. Deputy Chat Thai leader Sano Tianthong said Chawalit should show responsibility for the violence by stepping down because the Police Department under his ministry had failed to solve serious crimes, particularly acts of terrorism. "It is interesting to note that there have been many bomb attacks since Chawalit took office as interior minister. The interior minister is not supposed to shirk his responsibility now," Sano said. The deputy Chat Thai leader said he believed the violence could be attributed to local disaffected political groups as well as international terrorists.
