The upper chamber of parliament expressed this stance in the Federation Council's address to the Russian Federation president in response to his message. The chamber adopted the address at its sitting today. Deputies have informed Boris Yeltsin that they have defined "measures which when implemented will promote steady interaction between branches of authority in the interests of democracy." Deputies stressed that "they regard the treaty on achieving civic accord in Russia as an important step toward implementing the president's message," since it allows "obligations undertaken by all branches of authority, parties and public organizations to be placed under democratic surveillance." The document addressed by the parliamentarians to the head of state stresses that they are counting on a responsible attitude on the part of the the president and government towards topical problems raised by the Federation Council. Deputies note with regret that so far the chamber's appeals have not always met with a proper response from the executive authority.
