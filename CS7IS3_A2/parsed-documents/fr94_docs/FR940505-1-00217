If the vehicle passes the pressure/purge check, the evaporative emissions system is assumed to be functioning properly. Similar to the light-duty enhanced in-use I/M standards, the enhanced in-use compliance I/M standards for MDVs should be more easily met relative to the enhanced in-use MDV FTP emission standards for composite NMHC and NO X described in Section A.(3) above. As was the case for light-duty vehicles, the lack of a cold start in the IM240 test, generally higher numerical standard levels and the fact that evaporative emissions are not quantitatively included together should more than compensate for any variability resulting from the use of the shorter IM240 cycle. This is particularly true given manufacturers will have the ability to design their vehicles for good emissions performance over the IM240 cycle as well as over the full FTP. EPA requests comments on the level of the proposed enhanced in- use I/M standards for LDVs, LDTs and MDVs, as well as the proposed transitional enhanced in-use I/M standards. EPA also requests comments on the use of a single enhanced in-use I/M NMHC standard and on the option of applying a more stringent standard for the first five years or 50,000 miles. c. Threshold for manufacturers responsibility. Under enhanced I/M programs for conventional vehicles, owners are responsible for repairs of those vehicles which fail the enhanced I/M tests. EPA is proposing that manufacturers would become liable for repairs of a specific vehicle engine family (i.e., an I/M-based selective recall) if 5.0 percent of the tested vehicles of that engine family failed the enhanced in- use I/M standards during the first half of the family's useful life or if 10.0 percent failed before the end of the family's full useful life. That is, if more than 5.0 percent of tested vehicles of any engine family/model year combination fail the enhanced in-use I/M standards before 50,001 miles or fifth year after the production year (whichever comes first), then the responsibility for repair of any future failures of vehicles belonging to that engine family/model year combination will shift to the manufacturer. This percentage rises to 10.0 percent for vehicles up to 100,000 miles or in their sixth through the tenth years of use. In staying below these thresholds, the manufacturer must consider the typical level of maintenance provided its vehicles in enhanced I/M areas. It is extremely difficult to identify the lowest level of maintenance short of abuse. It is also impossible to build vehicles such that none of the vehicles develop problems in-use. However, participation in the enhanced I/M programs will encourage individual vehicle owners to perform increased maintenance to reduce the likelihood of I/M failure and the subsequent burden of repair and re-test. Thus, a lower failure rate may be reasonable to expect from vehicles in enhanced I/M areas. EPA believes that the 5 and 10 percent failure rates proposed above balance the responsibilities of the manufacturer to build a vehicle which performs well under typical in-use conditions and those of the vehicle owner to properly care for the vehicle. EPA requests comment on the appropriateness of the two liability thresholds presented here. EPA also asks for comments on alternative liability thresholds, as well as appropriate justification for those alternatives. EPA proposes that the liability threshold for the enhanced in-use compliance I/M program apply separately to each affected exhaust emission family in each model year after 1998. Since several exhaust families can fall into a single evaporative family, but generally not vice versa, EPA believes that isolating I/M repair liability within an exhaust family is the most appropriate approach. In addition, EPA is proposing that the liability thresholds apply separately for HC and NO X emissions. Thus, if the number of HC emission failures exceeded a threshold, but the number of NO X emission failures did not, manufacturers would only be responsible for repairing those vehicles which failed the enhanced in-use I/M HC standards. A difficult question arises when one of the two pollutant thresholds have been exceeded and a vehicle fails both of the enhanced in-use I/M standards. EPA desires to limit manufacturer liability as much as possible to the repair of the problems related to that pollutant exceeding its threshold. However, it may not be practical to separate what repairs affect each pollutant and determining such a split could lead to frequent disagreement between manufacturer and owner. Thus, EPA proposes that manufacturers be responsible for performing all repairs to those vehicles which failed both the enhanced in-use I/M HC and NO X standards, but have exceeded only one (i.e, HC or NO X ) threshold. However, EPA requests comments on requiring manufacturers to only be liable for repairing the vehicle in order to meet the I/M standard for the pollutant exceeding its threshold.
