"Peace will never come to the Balkans until the repression by Serbia of 2 Million Albanians in Kosova is lifted and independence is granted to the republic of Kosova. The Kosova issue must be in the agenda of any international conference on the Balkans." Dr. Bukoshi called on the United Nations, the U.S., the European Union to fully include Kosova in the peace process. "No true peace can occur in the Balkans until there is an end to the brutal Serbian repression which continues unabated in our republic," the statement says.
