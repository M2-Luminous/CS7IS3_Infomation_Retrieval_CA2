[Sha'th] Good evening sir, and many happy returns. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Did the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations reach a stalemate after the failure of the Tunis negotiations? [Sha'th] In fact, the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron is still casting dark shadows on the peace process. In fact, overcoming this crisis requires much effort and a true sense of responsibility toward the Palestinian people's security in the occupied territories. What is required is not just a security Council resolution, but measures to enable the Palestinian people to enjoy true security, so the peace process can produce the results we all planned for and which we were about to see just two days before the massacre. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Do you believe Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Washington will result in the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the future? [Sha'th] We are waiting to see the results of that visit. We believe Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is the one who can decide that Israel will solve the present problems. However, we will wait to see the results of that visit. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Are the channels of communication between the PLO leadership and Israeli officials still open, or are they still closed? [Sha'th] There was an Israeli delegation in Tunis a few days ago to hold talks with the PLO leadership. Before that, there was another delegation here in Cairo. I do not believe the problem lies with the channels of communication. Such channels of communication in our world and in this age are not a problem, since the peace process is still going on. The problem lies in the absence of a decision to solve the problems facing us. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil: Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the PLO attaches great importance to the Security Council's resolutions and noted that previous Security Council resolutions were not effective. [Sha'th] The UN resolutions issued during the Cold War were frozen, due to differences between the big powers and their allies. The situation now is different. We cannot accuse the United Nations of bias toward certain sides. The United States enjoys a strong influence in this regard. It is the side that can put these resolutions into effect. Therefore, a Security Council resolution, like the one that led to the repatriation of the deportees, should be effective and should be implemented. Otherwise, such resolutions are worthless. We want a resolution to ensure true security for the Palestinian people, at least until the Palestinian entity is established and the Palestinian police are launched. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Thank you very much, and many happy returns. [Sha'th] You are welcome, and many happy returns.
