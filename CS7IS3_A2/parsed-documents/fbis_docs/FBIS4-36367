[Abu-Libdah] Good evening to you. [Mu'addi] Dr. Hasan, has the $5 million -- the first installment of the money committed by the donor nations -- materialized? [Abu-Libdah] The Palestinian leadership represented by brother Abu-al-Lutf [Faruq Qaddumi] signed the transfer application about two weeks ago. We should receive that sum any minute; it will be used to cover some pressing needs. [Mu'addi] The staff at the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction is busy preparing lists of cadres and institutions promised by the PLO to the donor nations. Are you through with this task? [Abu-Libdah] Let may say, to begin with, that we promised the donor nations to revamp certain institutions, and success in that effort will decide the fate of international aid. We did that job by constituting the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction. Other institutions are being founded, now that the members of the Palestinian National Authority have been named. We delivered on all our legal and official commitments demanded by the donor nations. We are now waiting for the donor nations to deliver on their end. [Mu'addi] It seems that this week the donor nations will convene a session in Paris. What is their agenda? Will the matter be settled there? [Abu-Libdah] That will be a meeting of the secretariat of the donor nations. It will address a number of the issues that have been preoccupying us. They will consider our effort to draw up a budget for the national authority. Hopefully, we will be able to convince these nations to make good on the promises they made in January, 1994 and to plug the anticipated deficit in the budget of the Palestinian Authority, both regarding the Palestinian police and the central administration. Beyond that, we are preparing a number of documents, through which we hope to fill the needs of the authority so it can begin its operation. Let me make it clear that, since it signed the Oslo accord, the Palestinian side has done all it can to meet the conditions required to qualify for the international aid that was pledged to us. We are at a crossroads. If the donor nations fail to meet their obligations, we will be hard pressed to fulfill our commitments toward the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. In my opinion, the peace process must not be built solely on verbal promises. We are at a stage when we most need for the verbal pledges to be converted into reality. [Mu'addi] Dr. Hasan Abu-Libdah, deputy director general of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, thank you. [Abu-Libdah] Thank you.
