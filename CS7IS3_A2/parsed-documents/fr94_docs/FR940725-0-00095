FR940725-0-00095 FR940725-0-00013 G ’ = the estimated annual average per capita Medicaid costs for all services other than those included in factor G for individuals served in the waiver, were the waiver not granted. Even though we have eliminated the ``C'' value (number of unduplicated waiver individuals a State intends to serve for each year of the waiver) from the equation, we will continue to require each State to report this information to us as part of a waiver request. This number may be revised when a State determines that it needs to increase or decrease the number of individuals it estimates it would serve under the waiver. We will include this number in our approval notices. b. Provisions of the final rule. We are revising §441.303(f) to include the changes noted above. We are simplifying the formula at §441.303(f)(1). We are providing in §441.303(f)(2) that, for purposes of the formula, the prime factors include the average per capita cost for all services provided under the State plan that are not accounted for in other formula values and include expanded EPSDT services. To further simplify the waiver application process, we are also revising §441.304 by deleting paragraph (a)(2), renumbering paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) as paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2), and revising paragraph (b). Section 441.304(b) will now read: HCFA will determine whether a request for extension of an existing waiver is actually an extension request or a request for a new waiver. If a State submits an extension request that would add a new group to the existing group of recipients covered under the waiver (as defined under §441.301(b)(6)), HCFA will consider it to be two requests: one as an extension request for the existing group, and the other as a new waiver request for the new group. Waivers may be extended for additional 5-year periods. 2. Computation of Estimated Expenditures Under Waivers for Individuals With a Particular Illness or Condition a. Background. Section 9502(d) of COBRA added a new section 1915(c)(7) of the Act that authorized States that have established or wish to establish separate waivers for institutionalized, physically disabled individuals to estimate the average per capita expenditure for such individuals separately from the expenditures for all other individuals in NFs and ICFs/MR. Section 9411(a)(3) of OBRA '86 subsequently changed section 1915(c)(7) to allow such separate demonstrations of cost-neutrality to be applied in any waiver targeted to inpatients with particular illnesses or conditions. In both cases, the specific group of eligible individuals must have been inpatients in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR prior to being deinstitutionalized into the waiver program. Prior to the enactment of COBRA, States were not authorized to compute expenditures differently for a specific group of individuals by comparing costs to those in that group only, rather than total inpatient populations. Section 9411(a)(3) of OBRA '86 amended section 1915(c)(7) of the Act to allow States the option of using an alternative method for estimating costs under section 1915(c)(2)(D) of the Act. This alternative method applies to waivers for individuals with a particular illness or condition, who are inpatients in hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR. The State may determine the average per capita expenditure that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under the State plan separately from the expenditures for other individuals who are inpatients of those respective facilities. Alternatively, States may continue to use the usual method of estimating average per capita expenditures; that is, include the utilization and cost of all Medicaid recipients otherwise using a hospital, NF, or ICF/MR. In the Conference Committee report for OBRA '86 (H. Rept. No. 1012, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 400 (1986)), the Congress indicated its intention by stating that ``illness or diagnosis'' meant, for example, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or AIDS-related condition (ARC) and that ``condition'' meant, for example, chronic mental illness or ventilator dependency. Thus, for waivers directed to any specified group, States may make expenditure estimates specific to that group of patients who are inpatients of hospitals, NFs, or ICFs/MR, distinguished by illness or condition. As with all home and community-based waivers, States must furnish reasonable and verifiable cost estimates for waivers dealing with individuals with a specific illness or condition.
