It follows from his explanation, which cited naval rules, that coastal buildings and facilities belonging to the fleet are part of the fleet and therefore are a subject of the talks. The Ukrainian side, on the other hand, insisted that all this property automatically belongs to Ukraine because it is situated on its territory. Touching on certain other demands by the Ukrainian delegation, Grachev said they were unacceptable and even discriminatory with regard to Russia. Specifically, in the view of the Russian defense minister, the demand that the whole Russian Black Sea Fleet should be concentrated at one base in Donuzlav is unacceptable. First, this would contradict the notions of military security. Second, it is quite impossible to site even part of the fleet's officer corps at Donuzlav. Yuriy Dubinin, a representative of the Russian president, who took part in the talks, praised the Russian military delegation for the diplomatic skill shown and regretted that in spite of this the talks produced only a negative result.
