This is because the basic framework of the ruling coalition parties will be maintained, and the political upheaval will probably be resolved sooner than expected. Hata, who has served in key cabinet posts, including the minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, and the minister of finance, also has great credibility. In particular, being the incumbent foreign minister, he is familiar with the substance of the stalled negotiations between Japan and the United States, and has many personal connections in the United States. He is widely expected to effect a breakthrough in the negotiations. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] and International Trade and Industry [MITI] say that Hata "stands firm on issues of principle," (MITI) and that "he will speak up to the United States whenever necessary." (MOFA) He is admired for negotiating with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor for six and one-half hours on the bilateral economic framework talks immediately prior to the Japan-U.S. summit meeting in February, and insisting that "numerical targets are absolutely unacceptable." The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] says that, "He has served twice as agriculture minister, and is the number one expert on agriculture in the coalition government," (according to a senior MAFF official). There is widespread expectation on Hata particularly because the MAFF and the Prime Minister's Office did not exactly see eye to eye during the decision process leading to the partial opening of the rice market last year. The Ministry of Finance is elated at the fact that the framework of the ruling coalition parties will be basically maintained. It believes that not only have prospects for starting deliberations on the draft 1994 budget become brighter, "some progress can also be excepted in tax reform, although this is already a bit behind schedule," (according to the Tax Bureau). However, while expectations are high regarding a reconciliation between Japan and the United States, others express the concern that: "He is the very person who brought about the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. summit meeting; he may have some problems when it comes to breaking the current deadlock in bilateral relations." Still others are apprehensive that with the discord in the ruling parties coming to the surface, the policymaking process will be even more arduous.
