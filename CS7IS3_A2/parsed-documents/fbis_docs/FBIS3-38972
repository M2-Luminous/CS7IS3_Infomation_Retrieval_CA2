This twin mistake would be "an irresponsible, blind and crucial error" that "we will surely pay for", he said, stressing that new international security arrangements should offer no scope for "new walls or old nuclear umbrellas." "The future of security in Europe depends on the success of the development of market economies in East Europe and along the southern coasts of the Mediterranean," he said. If this process should collapse, he warned, all attempts to "build up institutions" or "enact diplomatic designs" are doomed to failure because "stable democracies do not bloom amid declining economies, growing unemployment and poverty." The West should not take fright at the difficulties of East Europe and the southern Mediterranean, he said, recalling that just a few decades ago it was unrealistic to aspire to the levels of stability and prosperity achieved by the West thanks to the determination and cooperation of all Western countries. "The disappearance of the Soviet Union may have given the impression that this close cooperation is no longer indispensable. That is a mistaken impression," he said. Andreatta went on to warn against a growing "nationalisation of security perceptions. Dangers, of a lesser intensity than in the past but not necessarily less imminent, are perceived differently in different capitals," he said, explaining that this posed difficulties in presenting a common front, as had proved the case regarding former Yugoslavia. Another key concern expressed by the minister is that "transatlantic relations should not return to conflictual games." He hailed the successful outcome of the GATT re-negotiation talks as a move in the right direction, but called for a sort of arbitration court (along the lines of the European Court of Justice) to rule on trade and legislation disputes between the United States and the European Union. Returning to his central theme, Andreatta drove home the need for a recognition that "economic factors have become a component of security, and not merely one of its instruments. The new world order we are trying to build, with less optimism but no less enthusiasm than a couple of years ago, cannot ignore economic considerations," he said, pointing up the importance of the new Partnership for Peace with East Europe including economic programmes. This, in turn, called for a deepening of links between the European Union and East European countries, he said, recalling the recent Italo-British proposal to extend cooperation to the second and third pillars of the Maastricht Treaty, regarding political and justice links. As for the Mediterranean, Andreatta said that the creation of a single market spanning its northern and southern rims should be one of the main international objectives of this decade. He stressed the importance of Western assistance -- with the security pay-off this can bring -- being in the form of "trade, not aid. The best form of assistance we can give is access to our rich markets," he said. He rejected the charge of Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, that the West's assistance to Russia masked "colonisation" goals, stressing that its aim was to "expand the global market. Having stable and satisfied neighbours" would then contribute to greater security, he reiterated. Moving closer to home, he said that "the end of Eastern Socialism must not be replaced by the end of Western Socialism," explaining that the role of government should be one of "support" that however stopped short of "interference" in the workings of the market.
