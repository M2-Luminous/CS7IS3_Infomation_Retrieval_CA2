The HWWA justified its assessment by pointing out that the expansion of the money supply, quite strong in the first months of the year, will slow down in coming months, since the special factors determining growth of the money supply will lose importance. A number of reasons indicate that the growth rates of the money supply are statistically overstated, and that the [present] volume of the money supply will not have an inflationary impact. However, it seems hardly possible that the Bundesbank will achieve its "very ambitious money supply goal, an expansion of M3 by a maximum of 6 percent in 1994," especially since liquidity effects from the lowering of the minimum reserve rates at the beginning of March and the transfer of Bundesbank gains to the Federal Government, a total of 35 billion German marks [DM], still have to be absorbed. In the opinion of the HWWA, exceeding the goal of 7 percent growth, recommended in the spring report of the research institutes, would be "acceptable for a certain period, if a perceptible tendency toward lower rates of the money supply expansion were to develop. This is because the concept of money supply control is geared to the medium term." The HWWA counts among the special factors temporarily inflating the money supply, among others, that longer-term time deposits were converted into shorter-term deposits and that short-term funds were shifted from abroad into the country. The "window dressing" operations, typical at year's end and affecting the balance sheet, evidently were larger than usual. Meanwhile, however, they have perceptibly diminished. Special tax factors also had an impact, such as the inclusion of accumulating investment funds in the interest discount tax as of 1 January, 1994, which caused extensive selling within the country. The HWWA draws attention to the fact that, because of these special influences, the effective monetary development is difficult to assess. But the interest rate development indicates that monetary policy does not have an overly expansive effect. Although short-term interest rates have been lowered since September 1992, the present level is still relatively high compared to earlier, similar economic phases (3-percent money market interest rate). Also, the interest structure does not yet correspond to the picture usual for this economic phase. Short-term interest rates are not yet noticeably enough below the long-term rates to offer an adequate incentive for investments in fixed assets.
