Yesterday, Craxi sent a medical certificate from a Tunisian doctor, by fax, to the justice department which stated that the former premier was undergoing treatment for diabetes and thus could not leave his holiday home on the Tunisian coast, in Hammamet. Lo Giudici went to the justice department today to illustrate his client's position and later told the press "the justice department has put no ultimatum for Craxi to turn in his passport given that this is an executive measure." Craxi's attorney then added how "the health of my client is my concern at the moment. Besides, Mr. Craxi has always demonstrated the utmost readiness to collaborate and as soon as he has resolved his health problems he will be at the disposition of the justice department here." The magistrates handling the preliminary investigation into Craxi's alleged wrong-doings also confirmed how no further measures would, at present, be adopted against Craxi. "There's no rush" said Maurizio Grigo who also made it clear they were waiting for some signal of intent from Craxi's retreat in Hammamet. In the meantime, the magistrates were said to be examining the various bilateral agreements between Italy and Tunisia should it become necessary to seek Craxi's extradition in the event he stay abroad to avoid arrest.
