FR940429-0-00115 FR940429-0-00012 Discussion: The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. This provision is consistent with the requirements that an institution must satisfy to obtain institutional eligibility under the HEA for locations or branch campuses in States different from the main campus. For institutional eligibility purposes, the institution must obtain a license or other legal authority to provide postsecondary education at the branch campus or additional location from the State in which the branch campus or other location is physically located, not the Senate in which the main location is physically located. Changes: None. Section 667.11␣Allotment Formula Comments: Two commenters writing on behalf of States that would receive the minimum allotment under the proposed formula believed strongly that a SPRE could not conduct reviews of referred institutions and carry out its other responsibilities under this part within that allotment. One of these commenters suggested the minimum allotment be increased from $50,000 to $75,000. The other commenter contended that a SPRE's actual costs in carrying out its responsibilities would be five to ten times the proposed minimum amount. A few commenters writing on behalf of States were concerned that unanticipated and extraordinary expenses a SPRE could incur as a result of a legal challenge from a referred institution to the SPRE's determination that the institution should no longer participate in the title IV, HEA programs, could prevent the SPRE from carrying out its planned activities under this part. These commenters suggested that the final regulations provide for an appeal to the Secretary by the SPRE for additional funds to meet those legal costs and unanticipated and extraordinary expenses. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenters that the proposed minimum allotments were too low and has raised that minimum, as suggested by one of the commenters, from $50,000 to $75,000. The Secretary also raised the minimum allotment from $20,000 to $30,000 for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The Secretary also agrees with the commenters that a SPRE should be allowed to petition the Secretary for additional funds for unanticipated and extraordinary legal expenses. The Secretary use funds available for reallotment for this purpose. Changes: The formula in §667 is revised to provide an allotment of $30,000 each to Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and to provide a minimum allotment of $75,000 to each of the other States. This section has also been revised to provide that funds available for reallotment may be used to pay for a SPRE's unanticipated and extraordinary legal expenses. Comments: Several commenters writing on behalf of States disagreed with the proposed provision under which the Secretary would reallot, to other SPREs, funds not spent by a SPRE by the end of the period for which those funds were made available. These commenters suggested that a SPRE be allowed to carry over to the next allotment period any unspent funds from the current allotment period if the SPRE could demonstrate that it was making progress in carrying out allowable activities. Discussion: The Secretary believes that funds allotted to a State for a specific period be spent by the SPRE during that period. If a SPRE cannot spend its allotment for that period, the Secretary believes that those funds are best used by carrying out SPRP activities during that period through reallotment to other States. Changes: None. Section 667.12␣Application for Funds Comments: A few commenters writing on behalf of States noted that it would be wasteful to require a SPRE to prepare and submit on two different occasions plans and budgets to receive its entire allotment for a fiscal year if the SPRE was unable to complete the development of review standards during the previous fiscal year for which it received an allotment. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the comments but points out that while this procedure can be modified, under §667.3 a State must have submitted by December 31, 1995 or, in some instances, December 31, 1996, standards that can be approved by the Secretary. Changes: Proposed §667.12(d) is revised to allow any SPRE that did not complete development of review standards to submit simultaneously in its application for funds a plan and budget to complete developing review standards and a plan and budget to review referred institutions. Comments: A commenter writing on behalf of a number of associations suggested that each State should be required to submit a plan, not only to develop the review standards and complaint procedures, but also to identify information maintained by institutions and State agencies that is relevant to the development the State review standards. Additionally, the commenter suggested that the plan should also include the costs of coordinating information systems and should identify information not currently collected that is needed to demonstrate compliance with review standards. The commenter recommended that the proposed regulations be revised to require a State to provide the estimated total cost to develop the SPRE's information system if the total cost exceeds the State's fiscal year 1993 allotment. The commenter also suggested that a State be required to provide the total estimated cost to review all referred institutions even if the total estimated cost of reviews exceeds the State's allotment. The commenter believes these costs are among those that President Clinton's Executive Order 12866 requires the Secretary to identify and consider in determining, when developing regulations, the costs and benefits of collecting and maintaining regulatory information. Discussion: The Secretary disagrees with the commenter. The statute governing the SPRP does not require a SPRE to perform the activities suggested by the commenter, and the Secretary believes that SPREs should not be forced to engage in those activities. The Secretary considers these regulations to satisfy section 1(b)(6) of Executive Order 12866 that requires each agency to assess both the costs and benefits of the intended regulations. The Secretary further believes that it is unnecessary to require a State to provide the estimated costs to carry out any functions of the SPRP that exceed the State's allotment since the SPRE is not required to perform functions in excess of that allotment. Changes: None. Comments: One commenter was concerned that a student or other party may try to hold a SPRE liable for alleged harm based on his or her reliance on an institution's continued eligibility for title IV, HEA program funds in a case where the institution is referred to a SPRE because the SPRE did not have sufficient funds to conduct that review. The commenter suggested that a provision preventing any liability from falling on the SPRE for failing to review an institution because of inadequate funding be added to the regulations. Discussion: While nothing can prevent a person from suing a SPRE for the reasons cited by the commenter, in the Secretary's view, there would be no legal basis for charging a SPRE with any liability under the facts described by the commenter. Changes: None.
