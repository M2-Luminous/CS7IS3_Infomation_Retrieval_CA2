What the president should have done was to brief the National Council about his intentions and negotiate with the country's political leadership about ways to deal with the deadlock, a deadlock for which he is greatly responsible. It is inexplicable that while the president briefed the National Council about his letters to Clinton and Major, he did not mention his resignation threat. It is unacceptable that once again the president shows such lack of confidence toward the country's political leadership. Nor can the shallow argument that his resignation from the presidency is a personal issue be accepted. At at time when the Cyprus issue is at a difficult stage, the National Council has unanimously agreed on future moves, and as his policy has borne such bitter fruit, the president's action is most unfortunate. His attempt to present himself as a hero is vain. If the president felt that his policy bore such bitter fruit that he felt the need to resign to disengage Cyprus--as he says--from accepting them, he should have done it when he accepted the 21 March UN document on the CBM's. The president is well aware that it would not be easy to disengage once the CBM's were accepted. His mere resignation is not enough. The international community must be persuaded about our positions. The president of the republic knew from the outset that the National Council opposed his moves. He was aware of political opposition to the CBM's but he proceeded with what he considered to be correct moves. Now that Cyprus is facing a painful and dangerous crossroad, he is threatening to resign. Of course, we are not the ones to show him whether to proceed in one way or another. We are simply presenting food for thought for the people. These thoughts are being stated because of the presidency's bad moves. Now is the time for responsibility. Each one must assume his own responsibilities in the way he believes is correct and the people will judge.
