He was welcomed by Tomas Cardenas, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Villa Clara Province. First, Raul visited the Corralillo farming-military district and the Central Army firing range. He was briefed on the program to increase rice production and develop the cattle industry, fish farms, and reforestation efforts. Colonel Ciro Gomez Betancourt, chief of the Army Studies Center, gave a briefing on the results of the training period, during which the projected maneuvers and exercises were conducted successfully. This has helped maintain the troops' high combat-readiness level despite the current shortage of resources. Raul insisted that every officer and soldier must realize the cost of every maneuver, exercise, projectile, or any other military resource, as well as develop self-sufficiency efforts to guarantee the food demands of the troops. Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Rolando Ramos, chief of the agrarian district, told Raul of his goal to plant 34 caballerias of rice and to become self-sufficient in rice for 1995. He noted efforts to breed bulls for Army ox teams as well as efforts on fish farms, which they hope will cover 20 hectares this year. They hope to produce 30 tons of honey and other highly priced byproducts through beekeeping, as well as 300 tons of charcoal from Marabu, which is abundant in this coastal region. Raul also visited the Central Army's microjet plantain farm, in Santo Domingo Municipality. Raul was pleased with the progress made on land cleared by the soldiers by hand and with dynamite and irrigated with water from the Alacranes reservoir. Raul also congratulated farm chief Ariel Pena for the results attained and asked him to personally report to him on fulfilling his goal by year's end. The farm workers work hard to remove weeds, which have multiplied since the May rains. Raul also visited the (Agrofar) Center, an entity attached to the military agrarian union. It supplies seed to FAR farms and trains personnel and helps with research and ways to replace imports and increase export resources. Center Director Antonio Rodriguez gave a briefing on efforts to ensure that the FAR gets quality seed since 50 percent of the agricultural yield depends on this. Antonio is the son of well-know researcher Adolfo Rodriguez, 87, who was a pioneer in agamic seeds research, which is the cornerstone of a broad movement responsible for the quality of Cuban agriculture: [Begin recording] [Castro] The Army will eat the beans it produces or it will eat no beans at all. Your efforts will not be lost because they will continue through this bloodline. The children and grandchildren must be introduced to this affair. [Adolfo Rodriguez] Yes. I also have grandchildren who will be here soon enough. The comrades tell me they hope to see a movement of seeds alone or otherwise we will have nothing to put on the ground. [end recording] Raul was also interested in seeing the center's production section. He praised its leaders and workers and stressed the need for every agricultural leader to visit this center and learn from its valuable experience. [Begin Castro recording] This place is a gem. Let us work faster toward its completion. [end recording]
