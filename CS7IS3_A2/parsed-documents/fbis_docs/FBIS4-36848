It is a clear command. He has issued orders to one powerful organization about discovery and information, and has given orders to a powerful judicial organization about judgement and legal investigation. God willing, I hope those two organizations act strongly, as the leader wishes. That is one of our fundamental problems. It is one of the deep-rooted evil deeds which I am talking about, this financial corruption in the administrative organization. It has crippled, really crippled, many areas. Once it is dealt with we hope that that corruption is eradicated. [passage omitted] And let me offer my thanks here for the matter of price tagging which they have carried out. It is a very good thing that has been done. But several points must be considered. One is that it should be pursued. It should not be mere words and then disappear; it should not be for one or two months but for always. The officials carrying out the policy as well as the judiciary system should take the matter seriously. That is most necessary. Another is that they should not busy themselves with trivial issues. If, for instance, a barrowman sells potatoes at 5 rials more expensive than the rate, they should not harass him, just like the former chamber of trades, and just deal with those poor street vendors. They should trap the big overchargers and bring them to book. Dealing with trivial matters dissipates the forces. [passage omitted]
