The new Law on Military Service will correct the deficiencies that elicited protests from the people affected by this action. In view of the various proposals presented by groups who consider themselves to be affected by the law presented by the Army, it is unlikely that the reforms will be discussed before the next Congress is installed. According to the military spokesperson, several sectors proposed reforms which actually made recruitment more complicated instead of less discriminatory, the intended objective. The new Law on Military Service includes salaries and incentives for fulfilling this constitutional duty to make it seem more like a social concept than an obligation. On another subject, the military spokesperson said the Army is not protecting six civil patrolmen whose arrest has been ordered for their alleged participation in the murder of political leader Jorge Carpio Nicolle last year. The Army has firmly stated that military personnel involved in criminal actions must be tried.
