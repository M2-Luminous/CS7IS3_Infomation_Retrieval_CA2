The Americans. Europeans (and all others) should start being persuaded and light up their lantern. However, the evidence has still not hit people's minds. And yet, the fall debates on the GATT were indeed revealing of the new behavior of the United States. This fortress, surprised that its "I want" was not greeted with the customary obedience, brandished the threat to turn away from Europe and isolate itself from it. The Uruguay Round ended without leaving any breathing space to a future world trade organization. Commercial universality has become the myth and regional blocs the reality of the next few years. Monetary heresies, cruel for some and delicious for others, evidently have not been put into question. This apparent immobilism contrasts with the strategic evolution taking place, but silently so given that comments are rare and hence deserving of note. "The year 1993 will remain perhaps as important as 1989. Discreetly, without warning, the Americans have started to disengage themselves from Europe." This is the opinion, for instance, of Defensa-Eurostrategie's Philippe Grasset. The fact that under Clinton the reduction of the U.S. military budget has accelerated has not escaped attention. In eight years, with the help of inflation, its purchasing power suffered a three-fourths loss (from $126 billion to $46 billion); how is it possible to limit the demands of the military-industrial complex, stop waste ($20 billion), revise an imperial strategy to confine oneself as much as possible, note the impossibility of simultaneously conducting two large-scale military operations, give up arms sales, notably in the Middle East, and no longer hope to have others finance--as was the case in the Gulf war--operations that are mainly in Washington's interest? These are questions--perhaps anguished ones--that caused the fall and departure of U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. Yugoslavia, Somalia, Haiti: all are contemporary failures revealing a deep and durable malaise. The mid-January meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin at a time when Russia and its annexes are boiling like a witches' caldron will add more confusion than clarity. All the more so since the Americans, in risking money in this mess, have been particularly tight (20 percent of Western assistance, compared to 80 percent for Europe). On the other hand, one must pay attention to the NATO January summit. Since the meeting in August 1993, the United States has lost, in this sacred precinct of its world influence, the primacy for which it actually did not fight much. Somehow, this is a historic session: Americans are completely isolated on a proposal to carry out air strikes in Bosnia under the sole control of NATO and without a Security Council decision. Since then, the Clinton administration, increasingly rebellious against foreign affairs that only interest 2 percent of the American people, seems to be encouraging Europe to assume responsibilities and obligations to facilitate its own disengagement. Slyly opposed yesterday, the Eurocorps has now become an interesting prospect, perhaps even a model, that should be developed. Let us not forget to mention Secretary of State Warren Christopher's hostile statements on Europe, or the gesticulations of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Seattle. All these signs seemingly open a less difficult road for the Western European Union (WEU), which was vegetating since 1948 and is now progressively becoming a strucuture of reflexion, liaison, and mobilization for European national forces. An entire apparatus, long immobile because of the Cold War and afterwards the U.S.-Soviet condominium, has begun to move. However, many seem not to have comprehended this: witness those French parliamentarians pleading for a return of our country to NAT0 under the old conditions, an astonishingly blind proposal. What one should notice, above all, is the mutation and the departure of the abusive dry nurse, both so reassuring and so bothersome. The foreign and common security policy explicitly contained in the Maastricht Treaty ought to be the answer to this henceforth new situation for the nations of the European Union. Everything now leads them to act as adults, together if possible, with everyone assuming full responsibility. Europe's defense, its strategy, its resources, its sovereignty and that of its member states will become full-fledged obligations. 1994 will be a demanding, even trying year. To face it standing up after laying low for so long, is not that an enviable fate for the peoples of Europe and the best example they can set?
