What kind of movement this is and what are its aims? Here is an interview with one of its leaders, Albinas Visockas. [Begin recording] [Visockas] After the Landsbergis group was removed from power by the Lithuanian nation and the Democratic Labor Party [DLP] came to power we pinned great hopes on the future. Unfortunately, not all our hopes have been justified. A group of people, including former members of the DLP and non-party people, decided that it was essential to form a new, resolute, left-wing, workers' party that would represent the strata of the population most frustrated in the material sense. After a year of preparation, we have today a constituent congress of such a resolute, left-wing, workers' party. [Unidentified correspondent] But to recall our recent past, the communists maintained that they represented the interests of the workers -- above all, the interests of the working class and peasants. May it not happen that you will follow the same path? [Visockas] Of course, but the difference is that this time the initiative came from below, that is, among the initiators of this party are workers, unemployed, tractor drivers, housewives, and other strata of the population who possess very little. [Correspondent] What social group do you yourself represent? [Visockas] I am a worker, although I have higher education. I consider that this was the fate of many people in Lithuania after competent and professional persons were removed from all offices and institutions by the Landsbergis group. There are such people. I am a worker, my comrades are also -- some of them are night watchmen, some of them cleaners, etc. But we are very glad that we have managed to acquire the initial rather large intellectual potential, that is, there are doctors of sciences, professors, candidates of sciences, lecturers in our party. Thus there is a good basis for the formation of the party. [Correspondent] Do you intend to cooperate with other parties in Lithuania, including such public movements as the Workers' Union? [Visockas] Yes, we intend to cooperate with all parties and movements that will not look down at us, that wish to cooperate, but we are not going to be subserviant. We have no inferiority complex. We do not feel any guilt, we are equal to other political parties and movements in Lithuania. [Correspondent] Your movement or party is of a socialist orientation? [Visockas] Yes. [Correspondent] How many persons holding the same views as you are there? [Visockas} I can say exactly. We have 429 party members. But they are those who have decided. Those who will decide after the congress and in the following months, I think that there will be very many of them. [end recording]
