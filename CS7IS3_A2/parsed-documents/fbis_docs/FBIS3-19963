This has been conducted against the background of recent changes in the nature of the threats to government security and the Government's White Paper on Openness. Answering a Parliamentary Question from Mr. Bob Dunn MP for Dartford, Mr Major said: "In recent years, the nature of the threats to government security has changed. Whilst some of the traditional threats to national security may have somewhat reduced, others have not. The security of Government is also increasingly threatened by for example theft, copying and electronic surveillance, as well as by terrorism. ``To ensure that its approach to security reflects current threats, the Government has recently completed a review of its arrangements for the management of protective security in departments and agencies. This has recommended a new protective marking system for documents which will help identify more precisely those which need protecting, enabling them to be protected more effectively according to their value. The new system will also be more closely related to the Code of Practice on Government Information announced in the Government's White Paper on Openness. ``In addition, the review has concluded that existing security measures should be examined closely to ensure they are necessary in relation to today's threats; that commercially available security equipment should be more widely used; and that personnel vetting enquiries should be streamlined particularly in routine cases. Overall, the aim is to give departments and agencies, and management units within them, greater responsibility for assessing the nature of the risks they face and for making decisions, within a framework of common standards of protection, about the security measures they need to put in place. Substantial cost savings will result. ``The first stage of the implementation of the proposals of this review will be the introduction of a new protective marking system with effect from 4 April 1994 alongside the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The new definitions, which will allow fewer Government documents to be classified, particularly at the higher levels, are set out below. The other elements of the new approach to protective security will be put in place in due course.'' The Four Categories of Protective Marking: Definitions The markings to be allocated to any asset, including information, will be determined primarily by reference to the practical consequences that are likely to result from the compromise of that asset or information. The levels in the new protective marking system are defined as follows: TOP SECRET: the compromise of this information or material would be likely: to threaten directly the internal stability of the UK or friendly countries; to lead directly to widespread loss of life; to cause exceptionally grave damage to the effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or to the continuing effectiveness of extremely valuable security or intelligence operations; to cause exceptionally grave damage to relations with friendly governments; to cause severe long-term damage to the UK economy. SECRET: the compromise of this information or material would be likely: to raise international tension; to damage seriously relations with friendly governments; to threaten life directly, or seriously prejudice public order, or individual security or liberty; to cause serious damage to the operational effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or the continuing effectiveness of highly valuable security or intelligence operations; to cause substantial material damage to national finances or economic and commercial interests. CONFIDENTIAL: the compromise of this information or material would be likely: materially to damage diplomatic relations (ie cause formal protest or other sanction); to prejudice individual security or liberty; to cause damage to the operational effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces or the effectiveness of valuable security or intelligence operations; to work substantially against national finances or economic and commercial interests; substantially to undermine the financial viability of major organisations; to impede the investigation or facilitate the commission of serious crime; to impede seriously the development or operation of major government policies; to shut down or otherwise substantially disrupt significant national operations. RESTRICTED: the compromise of this information or material would be likely: to affect diplomatic relations adversely; to cause substantial distress to individuals; to make it more difficult to maintain the operational effectiveness or security of UK or allied forces; to cause financial loss or loss of earning potential to or facilitate improper gain or advantage for individuals or companies; to prejudice the investigation or facilitate the commission of crime; to breach proper undertakings to maintain the confidence of information provided by third parties; to impede the effective development or operation of government policies; to breach statutory restrictions on disclosure of information; to disadvantage government in commercial or policy negotiations with others; to undermine the proper management of the public sector and its operations. Notes to Editors 1. The existing protective marking system comprises a classification system of four levels relating to national security, complemented by a complex range of privacy markings (eg COMMERCIAL IN CONFIDENCE, MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE) relevant to other sensitive information. These markings will be replaced from 4 April 1994 by a single system of protective markings that encompasses the whole range of information and other assets held by government. 2. The definitions on which the current system is based are: --TOP SECRET: "causing exceptionally grave damage to the nation" --SECRET: "causing serious injury to the interests of the nation" --CONFIDENTIAL: "being damaging to the interests of the nation" --RESTRICTED: "being undesirable in the interests of the nation" Privacy markings cover lower levels of damage, or harm to interests narrower than that of the nation as a whole. 3. The new markings retain the same labels as the old classifications, but the definitions have been elaborated so as to encompass the threats to government information both in respect of national security and more widely. They have also been defined in terms of the consequences of compromise. This makes the definitions less abstract, so that people can better decide on the right level of marking for any information. The intention is that these markings will serve as a signal to indicate the standard of protection that needs to be afforded to the information in question. This will help both to drive down the amount of information classified, particularly at the higher levels, and to encourage the provision of sufficient, but not excessive, standards of protection. 4. Costs. It is difficult to establish the current costs of security in government. Costs are spread widely and impinge on a wide range of government activities. However the direct, observable costs of security management in government are currently estimated at over 300 million pounds a year. Savings are expected to arise from the protective marking system reducing the amount of material afforded the highest, hence most expensive, levels of protection; from enabling departments and agencies to put in place what they determine to be the most cost-effective protective measures in their own circumstances; from a critical review of the value added by existing security measures; from making maximum use of industry-standard equipment; and from the streamlining of the personnel vetting system. 5. In addition, it is expected that the implementation of the review findings will enable contractors employed on classified government business to reduce their own security costs and will encourage wider competition amongst contractors for classified government work.
