Sources in the Mexican Government and in the Clinton administration have confirmed that there have been consultations on this matter. In Brasilia, an official source said that the Brazilian Government views the possible launching of Salinas' candidacy as normal, and no cause for concern. This week the Brazilian Government officially launched the candidacy of Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero for this post. Ricupero, who served earlier as the Brazilian ambassador to GATT, earned the respect of the formulators of international trade policies in Geneva because of the role he performed as chairman of the contracting parties at a difficult juncture of the long Uruguay Round negotiations. According to Luiz Felipe Lampreia, the incumbent Brazilian ambassador to GATT, Ricupero's candidacy emerged naturally in talks with the GATT "inner circle" -- with the support of European, Asian, and Latin American countries -- after GATT Director Peter Sutherland announced that he is not interested in leading the new organization. An official source said: "Rather than launch Ricupero's candidacy, all the Brazilian Government did was take over an initiative originated by others." [passage omitted]
