In this connection, a plan has been drafted and submitted to the State Council, and it is expected to be officially approved and implemented this year. The existing residential household system is the "double-track structure" which has been practiced for several decades. In fact it is a system under which rural household status is distinguished from nonrural household status by the criterion of whether one enjoys the privilege of being supplied with commodity grain or not. This form of division has made it extremely difficult for a household with rural resident status to transfer to the nonrural category. A peasant can hardly have his rural resident status changed even if he has been working in a town for several decades. So he is not entitled to the privileges and treatment of other urban residents with nonrural resident status. How is China going to do away with the constraints that the existing residential household registration system imposes on social evolution and social stability, in the wake of rapid economic development? This question has aroused debate within academic circles over the past few years, the focus being placed on whether cities should open their doors wide to peasants and residents of small towns. One view holds that in the wake of urbanization and industrialization, it is necessary to provide a fair environment to enable people to travel and choose occupations freely. This can speed up the development process on the one hand and, on the other, alleviate the uncomfortable feeling on the part of peasants who do not have a sense of belonging to the cities where they are living. Another view holds that once the 800 million Chinese peasants are allowed to move freely, it will inevitably cause a great urban population explosion much more dreadful than what has already taken place in Mexico city. Since there are grounds for both views, the authorities concerned, after rather long study, have finally adopted a compromise that incorporates a gradual, progressive reform. Under this program, the existing "double-track" residential household registration system will be replaced by a new registration system based on three population control categories, namely, permanent residential household, temporary residential household, and dependent residential household; the conventional mode of identity verification by the residential household registration book will be replaced by the identity certifying system with the resident identity card as the principal proof of identity; rural and nonrural categories will be distinguished by domicile and occupation; and any transference of residential household registration will be based on consideration of the housing and living conditions of the city concerned and subject to policy regulation and control. Some attempts to reform the conventional residential household registration system have been made earlier in many localities, even in some counties in the suburbs of Beijing. Some localities have begun selling urban household registration quotas to peasants, some localities have introduced a "blue seal household registration quota" system specially designed for immigrants of the investment category, while some others have introduced a "green card" system, and so on. All these practices have been endorsed by the Beijing authorities.
