In Lombardy, more than 200 suspected Mafiosi were arrested, who are accused of hundreds of crimes -- from drug trafficking to murder. Among the more than two dozen drug dealers who were arrested in Toulon and the surroundings, there are also the two killers of Yann Pait, a parliamentary deputy and dedicated fighter against organized crime, who was shot dead in Hyeres in February. Reportedly, intelligence service experts were involved in the investigations preceding the two large-scale police operations. If this is true, Italians and French did what FRG Interior Minister Kanther wants to make possible in Germany and which has been repeatedly been demanded by Interpol Secretary General Raymond Kendall over the past weeks. The British criminologist, who was responsible for antidrug operations at Scotland Yard for several years, recently said that one may assume that drugs constitute a threat that is similar to a war. Thus, appropriate means must be mobilized, starting with the intelligence services and counterespionage. With their technical knowledge, these authorities could "be extremely useful in the struggle against organized crime." The criminal opponents at the drug front have long been using intelligence service means. Given estimated annual profits of $300 billion, they have the financial means to undermine the bases of the democratic states. Consequently, Rendall and other advocates of stricter drug repression accept rule-of-law objections against the mixing of the assignments of intelligence services and police only to a certain extent. The Interpol chief thinks that the resulting risks are "far smaller than the dangers posed by organized crime." Kanther, too, wants the 6,000 officials of the Federal Intelligence Office (BND) to "put their technical possibilities into the service of discovering crimes." For this purpose, he must amend the BND law. Whether the Bundestag will agree is just as questionable as the readiness of the intelligence service officials to subject themselves to stricter political control.
