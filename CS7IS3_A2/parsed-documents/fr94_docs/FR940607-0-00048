FR940607-0-00048 FR940607-0-00016 Although the job of testing pump station and breakout tank facilities may be time-consuming, it is crucial to ensure public safety and protect the environment. Population has encroached on the older pump stations and tank farms since their construction, increasing their threat to public safety. Also, slow leaks at tank farms have polluted ground water and endangered neighborhoods. In considering the issue of pump stations and tank farms, RSPA examined the existing rule in ยง195.302 regarding the testing of older onshore HVL pipelines. Except for tank farm facilities to which the rule does not apply, ยง195.302 does not exclude any of the facilities the commenters suggested RSPA exclude from the present rulemaking. RSPA believes non-HVL facilities should not be treated differently. Leaks at non-HVL hazardous liquid facilities can have fire and pollution consequences. Also, even minor accidents at breakout tanks in tank farms have the potential to become uncontrollable emergencies because of proximity to other large volume hazardous liquid storage tanks. Therefore, RSPA has adopted the final rule as proposed concerning pump stations and breakout tanks. The demands of testing these facilities should be mitigated, however, by the compliance deadlines, which are discussed next. Compliance Deadlines RSPA proposed a deadline of 1 year after publication of the final rule for operators to plan and schedule testing or to reduce MOPs. RSPA also proposed a deadline of 4.5 years after publication of the final rule for testing all pipelines with more than 50 percent pre-1970 ERW pipe, and for testing at least 50 percent of all other pipelines. Finally, RSPA proposed that operators complete all testing within 7.5 years after publication of the final rule. One operator argued that RSPA should allow operators to use the entire test period to plan testing or to reduce MOPs. This commenter said that planning for testing or reduction in MOP would involve complicated analyses that would take longer than 1 year. The commenter also said any plan may need to be changed because of unforeseen operational problems that may arise during the test period. RSPA proposed a 1-year deadline to assure that operators start their testing program early in the test period. Early planning is necessary to minimize unexpected delays and assure that operators complete testing within the time allowed. Also, RSPA assumed that when operators plan to reduce MOP, the reduction could be done without lengthy preparations. Further, RSPA strongly believes any MOP reduction should be done early in the program to lessen the continuing risk to the public. If unforeseen testing or operational problems arise during the test period, an operator could modify its initial testing plan and schedule as needed to resolve those problems. Of course, any modified plan or schedule would still have to provide for completion of testing before the applicable deadline. The proposed 1-year deadline for MOP reduction or planning and scheduling testing was the same amount of time that ยง195.302 allowed for similar activities on the older onshore HVL pipelines. However, the process will involve more mileage than it did for onshore HVL pipelines. Also, RSPA expects operators will need further planning to maintain the product-supply requirements of their customers. Therefore, RSPA has extended the proposed planning and scheduling deadline to 1.5 years in the final rule. Another operator thought the proposed test period for pre-1970 ERW pipelines was unfair to operators who have many of these pipelines. These operators would not be able to spread costs and impacts on operations over as much time as other operators. This commenter suggested that an equitable approach would be to require that operators give pre-1970 ERW pipelines priority in testing over the full test period. RSPA proposed a shorter test period for the pre-1970 ERW pipelines because these pipelines have unique safety problems. The unique problems cause pre-1970 ERW pipelines to have a greater potential for failure than other older pipelines. Since pre-1970 ERW pipelines pose a greater risk, requiring operators to test them sooner than other older pipelines is critical to safety. API declared that the proposed testing periods would create an undue hardship on consumers and the pipeline industry. It suggested RSPA lengthen the period to 10 years for all older pipelines, with testing priorities based on risk. Operators and shippers need the additional time, API said, so the nation's pipeline network can adapt to the impact of the testing program on the market. The operators and shippers would use the time to arrange alternative transportation and to prevent regional supply disruptions. Using similar reasoning, two operators also urged us to allow more time for testing. One operator thought a reasonable period would be 7 years for pre-1970 ERW pipelines, and 10 years for the others. The other operator thought the periods should be 5 and 10 years, respectively. RSPA, too, is concerned about the potential adverse impact on the nation's fuel supplies that could result from testing thousands of miles of pipelines. Aside from the substantial planning that must be done before testing, many operators will need time to obtain waste water disposal permits from various jurisdictions. Operators will need time to prepare pipeline systems for testing and to arrange for personnel and equipment to conduct the tests.
