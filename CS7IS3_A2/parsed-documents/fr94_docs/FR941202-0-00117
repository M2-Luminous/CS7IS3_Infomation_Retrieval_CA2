FR941202-0-00117 FR941202-0-00012 A. Need for and Objective of Rules This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. In prior orders, the Commission has adopted spectrum caps and cross-ownership rules to prevent excessive aggregation of spectrum. The goal of these limitations is to promote competition by ensuring that the aggregation of spectrum in a given geographic area does not result in anticompetitive influence over price or service offerings. The Fourth Report and Order in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252 adopts attribution rules that make certain management agreements and joint marketing arrangements attributable interests for purposes of applying the Commission's spectrum cap rules. In the absence of such attribution rules, there is a risk that management agreements and joint marketing agreements may undermine our efforts to foster a competitive marketplace for wireless services. B. Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis No comments were submitted specifically in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. C. Significant Alternatives Considered The rules adopted in this Order are narrowly tailored to minimize any intrusive consequences with regard to the operations of CMRS licensees. The Order does not prohibit management or joint marketing agreements. It finds, however, that certain management or joint marketing agreements will be treated as creating attributable interests in the licensees for purposes of the Commission's spectrum cap limitations. The regulatory burdens we have established for all CMRS licensees, including small entities, are necessary to carry out our duties under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. We will continue to examine alternatives in the future with objectives of eliminating unnecessary regulations and minimizing any significant impact on small entities. A copy of this Order will be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Synopsis of the Fourth Report and Order On July 18, 1994, the Commission adopted a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 59 FR 37734 (July 25, 1994) in which we sought comment on whether we should consider certain non-equity relationships to be attributable interests for purposes of applying the 40 MHz limitation on broadband Personal Communications Service (PCS) spectrum, the PCS-cellular cross-ownership rules, and a more general Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) spectrum cap. The Commission also requested comment on whether any attribution rules we might adopt in this proceeding should apply differently depending on whether the applicant or licensee involved is a designated entity. Specifically, the Second Further Notice asked whether resale agreements, management contracts, and joint marketing arrangements that do not confer de facto control on a party should be considered attributable because these interests may affect the incentive or ability of PCS and other CMRS licensees to compete vigorously in the marketplace or because they may affect the number of effective competing providers or the independence of pricing decisions by service providers. After close of the comment period, the Commission released the Third Report and Order, 59 FR 59945 (Nov. 21, 1994), in this docket. In that Order, the Commission adopted a spectrum cap of 45 MHz on the combined ownership of broadband PCS, cellular radio, and Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) licenses that are classified as CMRS. This spectrum cap is in addition to the existing 40 MHz cap on broadband PCS ownership and the PCS-cellular cross-ownership rules. The Third Report and Order also conformed the rules relating to station management and control for CMRS providers and stated that we would address whether standards regarding indicia of control in connection with CMRS management contracts should be further conformed or modified in the context of our examination of whether to attribute non-controlling management contracts. In an effort to ensure that the significant changes that will be occurring in wireless services produce a robustly competitive market with a diversity of efficient providers serving a variety of consumer needs, the Commission has taken steps to prevent excessive aggregation of spectrum through various spectrum caps and cross-ownership rules. The goal of these limitations is to ensure that a single entity will not have the ability to influence or control a large portion of the available mobile wireless spectrum and thereby undermine competitive pricing for wireless services. This Order makes attributable management agreements and joint marketing agreements between licensees that confer the ability to determine or significantly influence price or service offerings. While such arrangements are considered attributable, they will not be prohibited by our rules so long as those with attributable interests remain below the various spectrum thresholds after considering all attributable spectrum. The Order concludes that management agreements, resale, and joint marketing arrangements can enhance the competitiveness of wireless service providers. Management agreements had been used in the SMR industry and have proven to be beneficial to the introduction of new technology such as trunked systems and new wide area systems. In certain contexts, however, they may also be used to facilitate the exercise of market power and produce anticompetitive results.
