In their appeal to the Russian president, the government, and the Federal Assembly, the communications workers explain the proposed "forced halt" in airing television and radio programs by "an emergency situation" that came about at communications enterprises. According to the appeal, this situation was caused by the television and radio companies' two- or three-month delays in payments to communications enterprises because funds were not appropriated from the republican budget. As a result, all of them wound up in the red, had to stop purchases of materials and spare parts, and had to cancel plans to buy electronic products. This is why emergency reserves have been depleted within the past two years, and why presently no routine repairs of mast antennas are being carried out, which in itself is fraught with serious consequences. Given that, the authors of the appeal demand that the government "approve the amounts of state television and radio broadcasting and decide on financing them taking into account changes in tariffs and inflation." By the deadline set by the communications workers, the Russian Federation Finance Ministry is also obliged to fulfill Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's directive of 22 December with regard to repaying debts to communications enterprises to the tune of 67.6 billion rubles. If these and a number of other demands are not fulfilled, the communications workers are intent on halting the airing of television and radio programs throughout Russian territory in the immediate future.
