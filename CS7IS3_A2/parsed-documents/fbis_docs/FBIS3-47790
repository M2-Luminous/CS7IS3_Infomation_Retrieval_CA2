"Japan is a very important market for our exports," said Duong Ky Anh, a senior official of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which cosponsored the exposition along with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). Duong said he hoped the exposition and other events like it to follow will help to vastly increase Vietnam's exports to Japan, the country's largest export market. According to Japanese Finance Ministry figures, Vietnam's exports to Japan registered 870 million dollars in 1992 compared with 196 million dollars in 1988. Duong estimated his country's exports to Japan rocketed up to 1.2 billion dollars in 1993. He expressed hope the figure will rise as high as 1.6 billion dollars in 1994. The exposition, supported by both the Japanese and Vietnamese Governments, is the first of its kind ever held in Japan focusing on Vietnamese goods. It lasts until January 27 and precedes the holding of a major Japanese industrial product trade fair in Hanoi next March. Representatives from 25 Vietnamese companies are exhibiting such potential export items as shrimp, coffee, handicrafts, furniture and clothing. Duong said Vietnam wants in 1994 to double the amount earned last year when mineral fuels, mostly crude oil, made up over half of the value of Vietnam's exports to Japan. He said Vietnam anticipates increasing the value of marine products exported to Japan from the 350 million dollars earned in 1993 to 500 million dollars in 1994. Exports to Japan of marine products, including frozen shrimp, fish, and squid, have already almost doubled over 1992. Duong called for more Japanese investment in Vietnam, especially in infrastructure. He said there is a particular need for equipment from Japan that can be used to improve the quality of Vietnamese products for export. The official also said his country must endeavor to attract greater numbers of Japanese tourists to earn badly needed hard currency. Assessing the "privileges and shortcomings" in Vietnam's trade relationship with Japan, Duong said the privileges include their relative geographical proximity and their dramatically improved political ties. He said the shortcomings include problems with the quality of processed Vietnamese products. "To some extent we cannot meet the strict requirements of this market," he said. "We have to improve our quality drastically, otherwise we cannot enter." Duong pointed to "keen competition" from other countries like China, Thailand and Indonesia which export similar products.
