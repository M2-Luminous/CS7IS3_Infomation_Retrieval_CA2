The Canadians have ended their tour of duty in the mainly Muslim enclave (?and been relieved) by Dutch troops. But protesting Muslims kept the Canadians from leaving their compound this weekend. The Muslims see the Canadians as their protectors and don't want them to leave. The departure of the Canadians is also being blocked by Serbs surrounding Srebrenica. They claim the Canadians' heavy-duty vehicles will tear up the road and are preventing a UN convoy sent from Visoko from reaching the area. [passage omitted]
