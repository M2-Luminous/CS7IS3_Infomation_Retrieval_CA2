The international community must say clearly whether it considers it more important to restore peace or to keep the sanctions in place, Karadzic said. If it is more important to the international community to keep the sanctions, then their main aim is to exhaust the Serbs economically, militarily, and politically, and not to restore peace. The talks, which lasted about one and a half hours at the British residence [in Belgrade], were also attended by republic of Srpska vice president Nikola Koljevic, assembly chairman Momcilo Krajisnik, and Bosnian Serb foreign minister Aleksa Buha. According to Karadzic, they discussed the possibilities of reaching an agreement on a cessation of hostilities and an overall political settlement, as well as on the current situation in Gorazde and Brcko. Karadzic said that the Serb side was ready to cooperate with the contact group if the group was preparing a new conference on Bosnia, adding that he would have a meeting with them tomorrow, but he expressed doubt as to whether the group had enough authority and could adopt a more flexible stance. Asked if there was a fresh approach to the conference, Karadzic said that the new joint standpoint of the international community was still undefined. If one listens to Kinkel, one could see that the international community, above all the European states, are not united regarding the solution to the Yugoslav crisis, Karadzic said. The international community, as Karadzic said, has to abandon the concept of defining the territories by percentages. Percentages are meaningless. We are prepared to give five percent of the [Bosnian] territory for the urban core of Sarajevo, which amounts to half a percent. That is why we propose talks on the viability of two new states, Karadzic pointed out. He reiterated that the Serbs wanted their state and that in the name of peace they were prepared to make such a territorial deal that would ensure the viability, i.e. the economic and military defensive capacity of their own [Bosnian Serb] state's borders as well as the borders of the Muslim-Croat federation. According to Karadzic, the issue that is unacceptable to the Serb side is bringing the Serb corridor, i.e. Posavina [northern Bosnia], into question. Stressing that the corridor is a vital issue for the Serbs because of the encirclement [Serbs in Krajina and Bosnia are encircled by Muslims and Croats] and defense of the borders, Karadzic reiterated: We will not accept any changes in Brcko's status but we fully accept a cessation of all hostilities and we have offered the Muslims a cease-fire in the Brcko area. If the Muslims do not accept, the Serbs will proclaim a unilateral cessation of hostilities and will not respond to the attacks except in the case if they were really endangered. UN monitors will be able to make their own judgements in such cases. The talks with Hogg, as Karadzic said, clarified the Brcko situation, while it had been agreed in yesterday's talks with UN envoy Akashi that three to four observer teams be stationed on the Serb side in the vicinity of that town in order to report accurately to the international community on who was carrying out offensive operations. Asked what the objective of the attempts to adopt a new UN resolution on the creation of an exclusion zone around Brcko precisely at a time when preparations were under way for a new conference on Bosnia was, Karadzic replied: All this is aimed at exerting pressure on the Serbs. If we correctly view the creation of an exclusion zone around Brcko, this would mean that the Muslims and Croats would have to withdraw their heavy guns to a distance of 20 km from that town. However, we have been in Brcko since the beginning of the war. Life is going on normally there, schools are open, stores as well, and the frontline is far away, Karadzic explained. There is no need to create an exclusion zone around Brcko because the Serbs are not asking for anyone's protection, he added. But if someone believes that the proclamation of an exclusion zone would imply that the Serbs would have to leave Brcko, they should know that this will not happen and that we will defend our right in the corridor at all costs, to the last Serb in the republic of Srpska. As far as Gorazde is concerned, Karadzic believes that the crisis is over but that the only sensitive issue now is the safety of Serbian civilians. This should be resolved through the presence of the Serbian police, working in close collaboration with and under the supervision of the United Nations. There will be no other Serb forces in the agreed three km radius, and this should also apply to the Muslims, the republic of Srpska president emphasized.
