Cardoso has also chosen former Deputy Euclides Scalco (Parana State) as the national coordinator of his electoral campaign. Scalco will in turn designate the respective regional coordinators. The program will be completed by 21 May when the PSDB national convention will officially nominate Cardoso as its presidential candidate. Serra will be assisted by a team of aides. Serra, who is expected to seek a Senate seat for Sao Paulo State, is considered to be one of Cardoso's closest and most influential friends. If Cardoso is elected president, Serra is likely to become his finance minister. Serra understands Cardoso's political thinking better than anyone else. Their relations are often marked by disagreement and tension. In addition to drafting the government program, Serra will serve as a type of permanent adviser to Cardoso. Scalco's appointment seeks to assuage the wrath of the leftist wing of the PSDB over the alliance that has been almost concluded with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] and over the virtual choice of Deputy Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes -- son a former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes -- as Cardoso's running mate. Scalco has always been identified with the left wing of the PSDB. His first task will be to confer with the PSDB blocs that oppose a coalition with the PFL. [passage omitted]
