He spoke of the need to reinforce commercial relations between our country and the United States. According to the candidate, relations between the two nations should not revolve around drug trafficking alone. [Begin Pastrana recording] We cannot continue to maintain relations based solely on the issue of drug trafficking. Trade between the two countries is on the rise, and I believe it is important for us and for the United States to reinforce that commercial trade, increase our participation, and not continue to base our relationship on drug trafficking alone. [end recording] Foreign correspondents from the United States, Mexico, Argentina, and Spain met this morning with Andres Pastrana and Luis Fernando Ramirez. During the encounter, Pastrana affirmed that a peace process must begin with the insurgent groups during the next administration.
