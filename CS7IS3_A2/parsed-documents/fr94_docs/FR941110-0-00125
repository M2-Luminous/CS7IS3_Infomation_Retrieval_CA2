FR941110-0-00125 FR941110-0-00016 Comment: The consensus of those who commented on §488.334, with the exception of the following two commenters, was that there is a definite need for educational programs for facilities, residents, and their representatives. The two commenters stated that it was unrealistic to expect the States to conduct periodic educational programs for the staff and residents of facilities either because of the cost, because they felt the requirement was already met when surveyors interviewed residents, or because the appearance of objectivity would be jeopardized. Response: The regulatory provision requiring the States to conduct periodic educational programs stems from a statutory requirement at sections 1819(g)(1) and 1919(g)(1) of the Act. The concept that the requirement is met when surveyors interview residents is not acceptable for two reasons: First, surveyors do not interview every resident. Secondly, the responsibility of a surveyor is to survey nursing homes and not to have attention deflected to educate staff and residents as to regulations, procedures, and policies. In fact, even if surveyors were to attempt an educational task, time and money constraints would prevent them from being able to provide complete information to staff and residents. As to the appearance of objectivity being jeopardized, this is not an issue since the Act requires that States assume this responsibility. However, irrespective of the Act, there is no reason why a State's educational program, explaining the Federal requirements, should jeopardize the State's objectivity in exercising its survey function. We believe that well-informed staff and residents contribute to nursing homes' being able to achieve and maintain compliance. If the implementation of training programs is followed by a pattern of increased facility compliance, one can just as easily conclude that providers and their clients are becoming more knowledgeable about the requirements to which they are subject, than that surveyors are losing their objectivity. Comment: Several commenters recommended that State educational programs for consumers be expanded. Several commenters suggested that we require State survey agencies to involve ombudsmen in the development of educational programs and in the planning and implementation of additional training of residents. Another commenter suggested that we require State agencies to give NFs access to training programs for State surveyors. Several commenters suggested that we conduct joint continuing education programs for providers and surveyors. A few commenters recommended that we make HCFA's inservice training programs available to facilities. Another commenter recommended adding to this regulation that the State make available to staff and residents documents related to current regulations, procedures, and policies. Response: Sections 1819(g)(1)(B) and 1919(g)(1)(B) of the Act require that States conduct educational programs for facility staff and residents (and their representatives) regarding current regulations, procedures and policies of the long-term care survey process. We include ombudsmen as representatives of residents. Such information will be provided during educational programs as they relate to the content of the program. Such regulations, policies, and procedures are also releasable under the Freedom of Information Act, and can be requested outside of the scope of the educational program. There is no statutory requirement to include ombudsmen in the development, planning, and implementation of educational programs and we feel that each State should develop its own program regarding these activities. A State may or may not choose to include ombudsmen in the development of its program. In any case, we are interpreting the Act to include ombudsmen in educational programs as representatives of residents. The suggestion has been made that providers be permitted to attend survey training courses. Traditionally, we have had no provisions for accommodating all providers interested in attending; our resources are taxed enough by simply trying to provide timely training for surveyors. However, being able to offer surveyor training universally to providers at their own cost may help improve understanding and cooperation between surveyors and providers. We are therefore seriously considering changing our policy to allow this. Comment: Two commenters representing consumer groups, suggested that §§488.303 and 488.334 be expanded to require State agencies to provide education to residents and their representatives in a variety of additional areas such as •How to participate in assessment and care planning. •Residents' rights. •Rights to rehabilitation and other services. One of these commenters also recommended that States work with residents and family councils to: •Solicit recommendations prior to any changes in the requirements. •Evaluate the effectiveness of the survey process. •Receive consultation prior to and during imposition of remedies to determine their effectiveness. •Receive consultation prior to determining whether to grant a waiver of nurse staffing.
