This has been caused by an unpaid electricity bill. It is not for the first time that the problem of payments has emerged. It is not the company's debt which is at issue; the funds have not been provided from the state budget. The Government is intending to consider, in the nearest future, the problem of state radio and television -- specifically volumes of broadcasting and necessary funding. We do regret, on our part, that our listeners will be unable to listen to Russia's Radio on its usual frequency, due to the fact that these problems are as yet unresolved.
