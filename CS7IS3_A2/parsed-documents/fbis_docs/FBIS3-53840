[Sha'th] I think that progress was made today and yesterday. I cannot say it is progress in substance, but in method. Progress in method sometimes opens the door for progress in substance. We always began from the starting point. When we resume talks, we also begin from the starting point. Therefore, the talks were haunted by a ghost called the crossings problem. Today, I think we agreed on the exact points of agreement and disagreement in the problem of the crossings so that we will not again start from zero when talks begin, whether in Taba or on a higher level when the leaders or foreign ministers meet. This, in my opinion, is the basic progress made. This progress is represented in the two sides' readiness to agree to the points of agreement and disagreement so that we will not start afresh when we discuss the issue of the crossings once again. We might later say the problem is not one of crossings, but of the points that are still controversial. Progress also continued vis-a-vis the issue of civil administration. I think that except for the Paris negotiations, which will determine the method of transferring power in economic issues, only the water problem remains. I do not want to downplay the importance of the water problem; it is a difficult problem in the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is difficult for the Palestinians, especially in Gaza. It is the only remaining problem and needs to be solved. All the rest deals with the method. Hence, we can really say that by the end of tomorrow nothing will practically remain except the issue of water. [Abu-Zayid] If no agreement is reached in Taba, will the issue of border crossings be discussed in Oslo or elsewhere? [Sha'th] I do not know what will exactly be discussed in Oslo. What is certain is that these negotiations are continuing. If Oslo presents an opportunity to solve some problems, we will naturally seize that opportunity. Nevertheless, these negotiations are continuing. Next Monday, delegations of the Security and Civilian Affairs Committees will meet as usual. [Abu-Zayid] What do you expect from the Peres-'Arafat Oslo meeting this week? [Sha'th] The meeting is basically Arab, that is, the aim of going to Oslo is to pay tribute to late Norwegian Minister Holst. We--President 'Arafat and I--are going there to take part in his funeral. Minister Peres is also going there to offer his condolences. But there will be an opportunity to meet. [Abu-Zayid] Will that opportunity be enough to benefit from this meeting and reach an agreement? [Sha'th] That might be possible. If this happens, I will undoubtedly be happy. The Norwegian ambassador here told me: Holst's soul will rejoice if you reach a peace agreement even during his funeral because he lived and died for peace. Consequently, Holst's soul will not be distressed if you seize the opportunity of his funeral to get closer to peace. [Abu-Zayid] Will 'Arafat today ask for an Egyptian intervention to bring the Israeli-Palestinian views closer? [Sha'th] The Egyptian intervention in the negotiations is always desirable by us and apparently by the Israeli side. There has been no objection to this constructive role by Egypt. Therefore, President 'Arafat's meeting with President Husni Mubarak will certainly be an important meeting during which President 'Arafat will fully brief President Mubarak on developments and ask for an Egyptian backing of the peace process. [Abu-Zayid] Will the Palestinian side take part in the Washington talks and who will lead the Palestinian delegation? [Sha'th] I do not know if anyone has been selected to lead the Palestinian delegation to Washington or at least to attend the meeting the heads of delegations will hold in Washington shortly. However, I think it might be Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat because he was deputy chairman of the previous delegation led by Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. Consequently, it is logical to have him there, but this depends on President 'Arafat's decision.
