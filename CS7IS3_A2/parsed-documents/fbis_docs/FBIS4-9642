FBIS4-9642 "dreeu083_h_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 HUNGARY Radio, TV Chiefs on Radio, TV Chiefs on Financial Situation 94CH0225A Budapest PESTI HIRLAP in Hungarian 26-27 Mar 94 p 1 94CH0225A Budapest PESTI HIRLAP Hungarian CSO [Text] It is common knowledge that the cabinet at its Thursday meeting considered the requests of the public-service media for budgetary grants, but decisions on the requests were deferred. According to the government spokeswoman's news briefing, the cabinet considered the operations of the media too expensive because, as she put it, incomprehensibly huge requests amounting to billions of forints have been presented for several objectives. We interviewed the media chiefs about the special-purpose grants. Gabor Nahlik, vice president of Hungarian Television [MTV] vested with full presidential authority, said that among the requests his institution presented there were indeed items bearing price tags running to billions, but they were for objectives essential to MTV, in view of parliament's failure to make provisions for them in this year's budget. These objectives included: the conversion of color TV broadcasting from the SECAM system now used, to the PAL system that conforms to the European standard; compensation for the higher transmission charges due to public-service TV programs that could not be financed through sponsors or from revenue generated by commercials; and a budgetary supplement to the subscription fees that were an uncertain source of revenue. Laszlo Csucs, the vice president of Hungarian Radio vested with full presidential authority, claimed that it could be safely said his institution was not placing a heavy financial burden on the government. Even after parliament's failure to make provisions for Hungarian Radio in this year's budget, the government had given Hungarian Radio special-purpose grants of only 104 million forints, whereas Hungarian Radio's operating budget totaled nearly 6 billion forints. The vice president also said that it was strange for the government spokeswoman to lump together in her briefing the financing of Hungarian Radio with that of MTV and Duna TV respectively. In Hungarian Radio's case there was no question of incomprehensibly huge requests amounting to billions; Hungarian Radio had requested merely 346 million forints in all, to support foreign broadcasts and Hungarian Radio's ensembles. There could be no doubt that the request was justified, Laszlo Csucs pointed out. Foreign broadcasts were in the national interest. And the ensembles, besides serving the radio, also enhanced the nation's prestige with their world-level performances and augmented the nation's cultural assets.
