In an interview with Radio London yesterday, al-'Anani explained that the Palestinian side believes that the economic agreement should be implemented following an agreement on Gaza and Jericho while the Jordanian side believes it should precede any Palestinian-Israeli agreement. Dr. al-'Anani said that Jordan has had economic relations with the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 and that this relationship needs to be organized under the canopy of the new framework. That is why there is no reason to postpone such a reorganization until after the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho negotiations. Dr. al-'Anani denied that the disagreement between the two sides stems from the fact that the Palestinians want to have a central bank of their own that will supervise the banks that open in the West Bank. Al-'Anani said that the agreement stipulates that banking arrangements included in the agreement will remain in force until the end of the transitional period, or the establishment of a central Palestinian monetary institution, whichever takes place first. Dr. al-'Anani emphasized that the PLO should coordinate with Israel before coordinating with Jordan because any agreement reached between Israel and the PLO directly affects Jordan. [sentence as published] Dr. al-'Anani said that the conclusion of an agreement between the PLO and Jordan will have a positive impact on the process of negotiations as this will reassure people that Jordanian-Palestinian relations will be organized and clearly defined relations based on sound foundations. Al-'Anani affirmed that Jordanian-Palestinian coordination is very important, and that is why they should not be exposed to the political ups and downs that accompany the negotiations. The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement that was finalized two months ago stipulates the reopening of the Jordanian banks that were operational in the occupied territories in 1967. The agreement also tackles trade between the two sides and attempts to invigorate them, and covers investments, infrastructure contracts, free zones, and transit operations.
