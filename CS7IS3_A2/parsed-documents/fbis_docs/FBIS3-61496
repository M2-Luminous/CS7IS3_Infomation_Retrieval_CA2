A container with approximately 20 m[.sup]3[/] exploded with the escape of uranium. A radioactive track with an area about 100 km[.sup]2[/] was formed in the terrain. An initial reconnaissance was made for determining the general direction of transport and fallout of radioactive substances, followed on 12-13 April by a detailed survey of the snow-covered terrain at 1:100 000. The direction of the survey runs was virtually perpendicular to the axis of the radioactive track; each run was 20 km long. A map shows the polluted area. The energy release of the radioactive products was estimated at 4700 �R x km[.sup]2[/]/hour. The total quantity of radioactive products beyond the limits of the industrial site of the plant was estimated at 530-590 curies. It is shown that in the most polluted central part of the track with pollution levels 300 �R/hour or more the accumulated dose of gamma radiation from the radionuclides detected at the time of the survey (ruthenium-103, ruthenium-106, zirconium-95 and niobium-95) will not be more than 1 roentgen during the first year. During subsequent years there will be little gamma radiation from radioactive pollution. Figures 2.
