The contents of the document were made public yesterday. The document states that the letter was given to Zeroual by the FLN delegation last Saturday. It should be noted that that meeting between the president of state and the FLN delegation was not announced by either the office of the president or Mehri's party. It is also worth noting that the FLN waited until dialogue had resumed before announcing its official stands on the overall situation in the country. In its letter, the FLN sticks to its stands regarding the existing institutions, which it still considers to be illegal. "The government alone, with institutions that are paralyzed or at a standstill and whose authority is diminishing every day, is incapable of bringing the country out of this complex situation because it is isolated from society," the FLN document emphasizes. A resolute supporter of a rapid return to the electoral process and the elected institutions, the FLN feels that it is impossible to "defer the real political solutions required by that complex situation without exposing the state and society to collapse and division." The HCE's [Higher State Council's] management is considered "a failure in every area." "It is essential to change that policy," the FLN notes in its letter to Zeroual. The change must take place with the help of "the country's influential political forces." That is what the FLN means by its fetish formula "serious and thorough dialogue." The FLN's letter clearly identifies those forces, although they are not mentioned explicitly. According to the document addressed to the chief of state, the FLN Political Bureau feels that "the parties that emerged during the legislative elections of 26 December 1991--regardless of any disagreements as to their results--are now destined to assume special responsibilities." To put that in clearer terms, it means, according to the FLN's logic, the three fronts: the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], the FFS [Socialist Forces Front], and the FLN. Mehri's party occasionally returns to the attack with the proposal that was made and rejected in the days of the HCE: to call a meeting of the "major parties"--or what it regards as the major parties. The FLN considers it "an essential task" to invite those parties, which it does not name, "to a common meeting that will be announced to the people." But to salve its conscience, the FLN also says that "by no means does this mean ignoring other opinions, marginalizing other political or social forces, or excluding them from that dialogue." The FLN says it is in favor of enlarging the dialogue but not diluting it. The objective of national dialogue, the FLN emphasizes, "is to reach agreement on solutions likely to bring our country out of the cycle of violence, ensure serenity in all homes, and restore to the state its constitutional and legitimate framework as that derives from the people's choice." The FLN feels that "the chances for the success of national dialogue still exist, although they are growing slimmer." Prior conditions must be met, the FLN says. Among those conditions, the FLN is convinced of the need to "create an indispensable climate of detente so that all the political and social forces can go along with it, support it, and prepare to take responsibility for its results." In other words, the FLN is asking for nothing less than a continuation and further development of the so-called pacification measures that were initiated by the HCE and expanded--when Zeroual became chief of state--by releasing the prisoners in the southern camps and the two FIS leaders, among other things. The idea of calling up reservists to support the security forces in maintaining order and protecting property and people from terrorist acts, as mentioned by the minister of interior, apparently does not appeal to the FLN, which views the measure as "a serious sign of the persistence of a policy of confrontation and a new step further involving the ANP [People's National Army] in a confrontation that prevents it from assuming its role of arbiter and wise guarantor of the hoped-for agreement among the parties to dialogue."
