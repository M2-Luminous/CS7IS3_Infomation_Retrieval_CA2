Events Behind Official Protocol of Russian Premier's Visit to Italy"] [Text] Moscow-Rome-Vatican City-Moscow -- Last night Russian Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin returned from a visit to Switzerland. As you know, he went there 29 January straight from Fiumicino Airport (Rome) after visiting Italy. Now that all has ended well, I can talk about a sensation of which everyone was unaware, apart from a few people responsible for getting the high-ranking official to the location of the visit and back, but first a word about a few other events that occurred during Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Italy. A group of Russian journalists arrived at Ciampino military airfield near Rome half an hour before the main delegation from Russia. Preparations to receive the eminent visitor were in full swing here. The carpet had already been laid, blue-uniformed employees were moving a square carpet from place to place trying to find the right spot for it, and guardsmen in parade dress and bandsmen formed up in front of the small building. As soon as the special Russian Tu-134 touched down, everything came to life: Policemen started running around following their commander's orders, our security service sprang into action, and officials walked down the carpet to where the airliner was intended to come to a halt. We journalists were taken to a symbolically chained-off area and two guards were posted next to us. Viktor Chernomyrdin and his wife came down the ramp and the solemn ceremony began. We were above all struck by the absence of local mass media representatives. This caused us some surprise. The new schedule for the official visit which we were handed at the airport listed the following among the party to welcome the Russian premier: Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta and his wife; F. di Roberto, Italian ambassador to Russia, and his wife; G. di Lorenzo, head of Italian Diplomatic Protocol, and his wife. These people are not that high-ranking. The following question involuntarily arose: Does this not smack of some disregard for our head of government? In response to my puzzled question, an embassy spokesman said that it all depends on the host country and different states have their own protocol. And, as for Italian journalists, they simply might not have been allowed in. In a word there was no sensation. A motorcycle escort accompanied Viktor Chernomyrdin to his residence -- the Grand Hotel. This is undoubtedly a high-class hotel. But a more fitting place could have been found for the premier of a country like Russia, for instance, the Villa Abamelik [name as transliterated], the residence of the Russian ambassador to Italy. We saw that this villa is one of the most respectable addresses during a reception given by the Russian ambassador. Set in vast grounds with evergreens, flowerbeds, and elegant old buildings. Inside there are paintings, tapestries, and gilded walls and ceilings. Viktor Chernomyrdin's modesty probably prevented him availing himself of what is indeed a mansion fit for a czar. Two hours after his arrival Viktor Chernomyrdin was scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister C.A. Ciampi at the Villa Madama. It is situated on one of the highest points in Rome, the Monte Mario. There were just a few minutes before the talks began. Russian and Italian journalists had already assembled to cover the important meeting. One by one automobiles arrived with officials. Then suddenly a police car got stuck on the gravel in front of the building. There was some confusion among the onlookers. After all, the Russian premier's motorcade was due to arrive at any minute. However, to journalists' chagrin, everything went without the longed-for sensation. The police pushed the car out of the way. The talks with Prime Minister Ciampi were more than successful. He promised support for Viktor Chernomyrdin when the question of Russia's joining the club of leading industrial powers is discussed during the coming G-7 summit in July. This statement made at a press conference has serious foundation. After all, this time Italy is chairing the G-7. That is, Rome's attitude to the Russian premier's visit is extremely serious and committed. A real sensation was brewing after the talks. Valentin Sergeyev, head of the Russian prime minister's press service, unexpectedly summoned an INTERFAX representative (I don't know why the choice fell on what is effectively a private agency although correspondents from the state-owned ITAR-TASS and RIA "Novosti" were also there) and urgently asked him to carry a strange report via agency channels. It accused Italy's CORRIERE DELLA SERA of publishing an article which cited Viktor Chernomyrdin as saying "I give the orders in Moscow." Valentin Sergeyev described this stunt as a "hopeless venture" [dokhlaya koshka]. He was convinced that it was planned by people wanting to drive a wedge between the Russian president and premier. The head of the press service awaited the reaction of local journalists and even asked us to get them to organize a briefing in order to deal a worthy rebuff. However, there was no reaction from anyone. There was no sensation. But many people agonized over another question: Why did Italian President Scalfaro not receive Viktor Chernomyrdin? The meeting was scheduled for 27 January. But it transpired that the president's father had died and so he had to postpone his conversation with his eminent Russian visitor. When he met Viktor Chernomyrdin, Scalfaro apologized at length and stressed that these talks are very important for him. A visit to Vatican City and an audience with Pope John Paul II were scheduled for day two of the visit. Having obtained special visas we arrived in the Vatican ahead of schedule. We were led through countless rooms, past formed up Swiss guards, and down secret corridors. In every office there was a guard in a colorful uniform. When anyone appeared he would stamp his foot and pike sharply, making some intricate movements and frightening those present since we did not entirely realize the significance of his actions. It turned out that this was how he welcomed eminent visitors. We went through a narrow passageway to the door of the Pope's personal library. Some time later the doors opened and Pope John Paul II himself came out to meet us. He greeted us in Russian. A few seconds later Viktor Chernomyrdin came in from the opposite side with members of his delegation. They then closeted themselves with the Pope. A one-on-one discussion took place. Everyone was impatient to hear the news. We looked at the ceilings painted by Raphael and the tapestries executed in accordance with the great artist's sketches. Time went by. According to protocol the visit was to have lasted 30 minutes. A conversation with Vatican State Secretary A. Sodano was scheduled for later. But the meeting only ended about an hour later. We were given permission along with the delegation to bid the Pope farewell and shake his hand. There was a breach of protocol. I was told by the Russian mission in the Vatican that this was an unofficial visit. What is more, it is the first ever visit of its kind at this level. And, despite being a strictly private meeting, all the requisite honors involving the Swiss Guard were performed. The Pope showed tremendous interest in Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit. According to informed sources, the sensation with regard to the extended audience was planned by the Vatican itself in order to thus show its great respect for Russia's head of government. But Viktor Chernomyrdin's entire schedule was thrown out by half an hour. Yet the remaining meetings took place at the highest level. By and large there were no deviations from protocol during the visit. Everything planned in Moscow was carried out with the exception of certain rearrangements. There were, if I can say this, sensations too. Nevertheless no journalists were aware of the main one, which occurred literally a few hours before leaving Vnukovo-2. The point is that, before an aircraft is provided for an official trip, it is carefully checked over -- given a run through. A special Tu-154M aircraft was scheduled to be used for the Italian visit. As usual, it was tested in accordance with procedure. The state commission then met. It examined the functionability of all the airliner's systems. The investigation was carried out with reference to the materials provided by the government commission investigating the crash near Irkutsk. Since the aircraft scheduled to fly to Italy was the same type as the one that crashed. It emerged during the discussion that there are a host of contentious issues regarding this aircraft. In particular, it was necessary to see that the so-called TA-6A auxiliary power unit was in good working order and check that there was no failure in its combustion chamber components. This regrettably proved impossible to do. There is still no technology to perform these checks. And it was this component that, according to preliminary information, was the cause of the Irkutsk crash. Had this flight gone ahead and this assembly been in disrepair there might have been a fire. So, in order to preclude the danger, the state commission decided to replace the Tu-154M with a standby aircraft.
