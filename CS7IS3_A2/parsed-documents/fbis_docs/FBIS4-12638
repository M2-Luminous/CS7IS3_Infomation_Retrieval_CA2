The newspaper asks if a mission by two NATO planes conducted once every few months is sufficient to end two years of bestial aggression against the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The paper recalls the "limited" air strike that NATO planes directed against Serbian forces besieging Sarajevo a few months ago to force them to pull back their heavy weapons from Sarajevo's immediate vicinity. Despite that strike, the paper writes, Serbian forces continued to return the weapons that they pulled back earlier so as to use them to kill as many of Sarajevo's inhabitants as possible. The world must be puzzled by the inability of the United Nations and the UN Security Council to discipline a state as small as Serbia, the paper says. AL-AKHBAR asks: What if the aggressor were a stronger nation and one with more clout than Serbia? The paper points out that the Bosnian tragedy, coming after the Cold War, was a test of the so-called new world order. The results have been disappointing, AL-AKHBAR concludes.
