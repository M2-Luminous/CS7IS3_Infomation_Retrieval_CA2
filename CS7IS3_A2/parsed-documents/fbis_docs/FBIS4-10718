D day is today, as the old debt titles will be exchanged for the restructured debt bonds. This means that the last four agreements are no longer valid, and Brazil will come to pay the renegotiated debt, which is made up of five kinds of different bonds. These bonds can even be used in the privatization program. According to the new agreement Brazil will have up to 30 years to pay approximately $51 billion, of which $35 billion must be paid to 800 foreign private banks. In the negotiations with the creditor banks Brazil obtained two unprecedented concessions: First, the payment of the guarantees in installments, a clause which until now had never before been obtained by any country. From a total $4.6 billion that the country must pay, Brazil will disburse $2.8 billion today. The remaining $1.6 billion will be paid in four installments over 2 years. Another triumph for Brazil was closing the deal without first obtaining IMF approval, as foreseen in one of the clauses. Despite the efforts by former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who travelled to Washington last month, IMF approval was not obtained. After consulting all the creditors the steering committee of creditor banks reported that the closing of the deal was being effected independently from IMF approval. Central Bank President Pedro Malan, who has been responsible for the debt negotiations over the past two years, said in New York today that the current agreement ends the chronic problem of the foreign debt. His advisers say that in the next six years, until the interest on some of the bonds begins to be paid, the Brazilian Government will be able to heave a sigh of relief and gain the time to stabilize the economy. But Brazil still has other concerns in the foreign field. The agreement with the Paris Club, which groups official creditors, depends on an agreement with the IMF. The Brazilian Government also needs to reach an agreement with the Dart family, the greatest non-financial private creditor of Brazil. The Dart family holds $1.4 billion worth of old debt titles, and it does not accept the exchange conditions proposed by Brazil. Brazil fears that the Dart family may file a lawsuit demanding the immediate payment of the debt, or that it may prevent the exchange of the debt documents today. Pedro Malan, who yesterday arrived in New York, did not want to confirm that everything was ready for the exchange of the debt titles. In order to protect the Brazilian reserves deposited abroad, the Central Bank has instructed the banks that operate with exchange to deposit the surplus of the reserves purchased abroad in the name of the Brazilian American Merchant Bank, a Bank of Brazil subsidiary headquartered in the Cayman Islands, a fiscal paradise safe from legal actions.
