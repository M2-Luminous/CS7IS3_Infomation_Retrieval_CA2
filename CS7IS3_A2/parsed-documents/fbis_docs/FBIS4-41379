Can one predict the preference of the people? [Hryb] Today it is still difficult to predict which one of the six candidates will be elected. The candidates represent various political options -- from the extreme left to the extreme right; discussions are under way. However, the results are a great unknown. [Boczkowska-Cretenand] A few months ago you introduced a new Constitution in Belarus. How broad will the sphere of powers of the new president be? [Hryb] We did introduce the Constitution; however, one cannot say that it is new. Before that there was a constitution of the Belarusian Soviet Republic. If one speaks about a new Constitution, one assumes that there used to be an old one; however, since March we have had the first sovereign Constitution of Belarus. The president will not be new, either. He will have superior representative and executive powers. In other words, it will be a strong presidential authority. He will be elected by the entire nation. [Boczkowska-Cretenand] If the people elect a president that comes from a communist party, what will be the political and economic consequences of this? [Hryb] It is hard to tell; however, I think that this will cause serious problems. [Boczkowska-Cretenand] What kinds of problems? [Hryb] In relations with the leaders of Eastern and Western Europe, as well as the United States. [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Can it impede the economic reforms as well? [Hryb] It is possible in a way; however, the presidential candidate from the communist party claims that his election will not affect the continuation of economic reforms. [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Are you an advocate of a monetary union with Russia? [Hryb] I do not deny that there is a possibility of introducing such a union, based on the experiences of the European Union, which has been discussing this problem for some time now. A monetary union may give many economic advantages. However, this issue should still be analyzed. My country does not have an answer to this question yet. It is still too early. [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Does Belarus have legislation encouraging foreign investments? [Hryb] Yes, it does. These are regulations, enacted in the autumn of last year, which concern ownership rights, the law on enterprises, on foreign investments and investors. It is a whole legislative packet that favors investments. The advantageous conditions are known to Polish businessmen investing their capital in Belarus. They are under protection, and they are making profits. [Boczkowska-Cretenand] You said in Crans Montana that the West is imposing restrictive barriers on Belarussian flax. Do you think that the West might open its markets more broadly for products from Eastern Europe? [Hryb] I think that access to the markets in Europe should be free and based on competition. Just like Poles, we would also like to have a free market. Why are the countries of rich Europe afraid of our poor market, our goods, and our quality? [Boczkowska-Cretenand] How do you perceive the problem of security in our part of Europe? [Hryb] I believe the security problems should be resolved by strengthening independence. We should be sovereign and maintain good relations with our neighbors. The "Partnership for Peace" does not guarantee security to its members. [Boczkowska-Cretenand] However, it is the first step on this road... [Hryb] Nevertheless, between the first and the second step there is a long distance, and it is not at all certain that the second step will be made. The road from the "Partnership" to membership in NATO is long. Membership of the East European states in NATO will make it even more difficult for this organization to make decisions. Therefore, it must change its statute. We are not against the "Partnership for Peace"; however, first we must solve our economic problems.
