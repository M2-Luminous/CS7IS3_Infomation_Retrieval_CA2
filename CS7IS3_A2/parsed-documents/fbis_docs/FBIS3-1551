The accord was signed by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Chinese Premier Li Peng and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who arrived here this afternoon for a working visit, attended the signing ceremony. Under the agreement, both sides support Suzhou municipality and the Singapore consortium to form a joint venture to develop an industrial park (township) in Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province. The area for the first-phase development is eight square kilometers. The project is designed to develop a modern industrial park of considerable size, with modern industries as the main structure, and new and high-tech as the leading sectors, complemented by service industries and public welfare services. After the ceremony, Li Peng and his wife met with Prime Minister Goh, Senior Minister Lee and his wife. The decision by the two governments to develop the Suzhou industrial park constitutes a major event in Sino-Singapore ties, Li Peng told the guests. This has provided a new pattern for the economic cooperation between the two countries, Li Peng noted, adding that it is of great significance in deepening the bilateral cooperative ties of friendship. Calling Goh and Lee old friends of the Chinese people, Li Peng voiced appreciation of their efforts in promoting the development of these bilateral ties of friendship. In the past two years, Li Peng said, the relations between China and Singapore have been developing smoothly and the two countries have conducted fruitful cooperation. The conclusion of the agreement in a relatively short period of time demonstrates the sincerity of both sides, Li Peng said, adding that there will be much to be done after the agreement was signed. The Chinese premier referred to the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area as a place propitious for giving birth to great men, with favorable investment environment and labor of good quality. He voiced the conviction that with the support of the two governments, the industrial park would achieve fruitful results. Briefing the guests on China's economy, Li Peng said that since last year, the country has received an unprecedented amount of foreign investment, with an increasing part going to infrastructure and some expanded into the service industries. China is opening its market even wider to the outside, Li Peng said, adding that it welcomes cooperation of every kind with entrepreneurs from Singapore and other countries. Goh said that he was pleased to attend the ceremony here and meet Premier Li Peng. The signing of the agreement reflects the common aspirations of the two sides and marks the new development of the bilateral economic cooperation, Goh said. Singapore hopes the park will yield concrete fruits soon after its operation and that it is willing to make joint efforts to this end with the Chinese side, Goh said. Also in the afternoon, the two sides signed an agreement on the adoption of Singapore's economic and public administration experience in the development of the industrial park. Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore's Senior Minister Lee attended the signing ceremony. In the evening, a consolidated commercial agreement for the industrial park was signed.
