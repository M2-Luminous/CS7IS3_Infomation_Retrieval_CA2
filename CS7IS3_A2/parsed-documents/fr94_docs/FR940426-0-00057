The amendments specify the information that registered investment advisers that are sponsors of wrap fee programs must provide to prospective clients in these programs. The amendments are intended to provide prospective wrap fee program clients with important information regarding the cost of the programs and the services provided. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Eric C. Freed, Senior Attorney, (202) 942&hyph;0726, or Robert E. Plaze, Assistant Director, (202) 942&hyph;0721, Office of Disclosure and Investment Adviser Regulation, Division of Investment Management, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') today is adopting amendments to: (1) Form ADV [17 CFR 279.1] under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80b&hyph;1 et seq .] (the ``Advisers Act'') to require advisers that sponsor wrap fee programs (``sponsors'') to file with the Commission as part of Form ADV a document (the ``wrap fee brochure'') containing certain disclosures about the sponsor and its wrap fee programs in a narrative (rather than check-the-box) format; (2) Rule 204&hyph;3 under the Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.204&hyph;3] to require sponsors to deliver the wrap fee brochure to current and prospective wrap fee program clients in lieu of the disclosure document they are required to deliver to other clients and prospective clients; and (3) Rule 204&hyph;1 under the Advisers Act [17 CFR 275.204&hyph;1] setting forth the requirements for updating the wrap fee brochure. I. Discussion On January 13, 1994, the Commission issued a release proposing amendments to Form ADV and related rules under the Advisers Act (``Proposing Release'') to improve the quality of brochure disclosure that clients of wrap fee programs receive. 1 A wrap fee program provides an investor with two types of services: investment advisory services and execution services for a single ``wrap'' fee, usually a percentage of assets under management. Among the advisory services typically provided are asset allocation, portfolio management, and monitoring of the portfolio management services. 2 Other ancillary services, such as custody of client funds and securities and client reporting, are also provided. The Commission proposed that the sponsor of a wrap fee program provide the wrap fee brochure to prospective clients of the program in lieu of the brochure the sponsor currently is required to provide to other advisory clients. 3 The Commission also proposed requirements for disclosure to be included in the wrap fee brochure. The Commission received thirty comment letters in response to the proposed amendments. 4 1 Investment Advisers Act Rel. No. 1401 (Jan. 13, 1994) [59 FR 3033 (Jan. 20, 1994)]. 2 See Proposing Release, supra note 1, at Â§I. 3 An adviser has the option to deliver to prospective advisory clients a copy of Part II of Form ADV, which consists primarily of a series of questions relating to the adviser's investment advisory services answered by checking the appropriate boxes, or a narrative brochure containing, at a minimum, the information required by Part II, Paragraph (a) of rule 204&hyph;3 [17 CFR 275.204&hyph;3(a)]. 4 The comment letters, as well as a comment summary prepared by the Commission's staff, are available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room in File No. S7&hyph;2&hyph;94.
