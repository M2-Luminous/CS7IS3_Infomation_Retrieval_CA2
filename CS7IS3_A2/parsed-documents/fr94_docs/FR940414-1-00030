ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This is a proposed regulation under the Clean Water Act to limit the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States and into publicly owned treatment works by existing and new facilities that formulate, package or repackage products containing pesticide active ingredients. This regulation proposes effluent limitations guidelines based on ``best practicable control technology (BPT)'', ``best conventional pollutant control technology (BCT)'', ``best available technology (BAT)'', new source performance standards (NSPS), and pretreatment standards for new and existing indirect dischargers (PSNS and PSES, respectively). The existing effluent limitations guidelines based on the achievement of BPT are not being changed by this proposed regulation. EPA is also proposing to establish a new subcategory which applies to refilling establishments whose principal business is retail sale. DATES: Comments on the proposal must be received by June 13, 1994. EPA will conduct a workshop covering this proposal, in conjunction with a public hearing on the pretreatment standards portion of the proposal. The workshop will be held on June 7, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. The public hearing will be conducted from 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. on the same day. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in writing to: Ms. Janet Goodwin, Engineering & Analysis Division (4303), USEPA, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. The workshop and the public hearing will be held in EPA's Auditorium, Waterside Mall, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC. Persons wishing to present formal comments at the public hearing should have a written copy for submittal.
