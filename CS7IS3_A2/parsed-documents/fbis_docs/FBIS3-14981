One of these issues is the introduction of the post of president as the head of state and executive branch. The official results will be made known at 1800. With regard to the president -- who is eligible for this post and how they will be elected -- by nationwide elections or by people's deputies in this Oval Room? -- the Supreme Soviet should adopt an appropriate law. This extremely important issue concerning presidential elections is now in the hands of the people's deputies. [passage omitted] Before discussion of the agenda for today's session, the Supreme Soviet was addressed by Chairman Mechyslaw Ivanavich Hryb. Here is an excerpt from his address: [Begin Hryb recording] For some time now, especially after my election to the post of Supreme Soviet chairman, some media, in particular the papers SVABODA [in Minsk] and IZVESTIYA, started publishing reports that do not correspond to the facts. These publications compromise me as a man and the chairman of the Supreme Soviet. Esteemed People's Deputies! I want to assure you: It is not a question of my inability to defend my dignity and honor, to obtain justice in a legal way through the courts, and to punish the guilty. By the way, it happened once with regard to the SVABODA newspaper. The question is that I do not have time to bring any action in the courts. Therefore, I am forced to address you, People's Deputies, respected electors, and citizens of the Republic, and assure you that my program and my demands for establishing order and discipline in the Republic, as well as to strengthen the fight against crime are not liked by everyone. However, I assure all citizens of our Republic that I will not retreat from this course. [end recording] [passage omitted]
