[Sha'th] Good evening. [Mu'addi] What is your comment on the incident that took place in Hadera today? [Sha'th] We can feel only pain and sorrow for the continuing innocent civilian victims in the ongoing conflict in which scores of the sons of our people in Hebron and Gaza have been killed, and the same holds for the victims from the sons of the Israeli people in 'Afula, and Hadera today. We always say we face these operations with anger and denunciation because they strike only innocent civilians on both sides. We say the only way to stop this violence on both sides is by quickly signing the peace agreement and really implementing it on the ground. This will create new conditions, end all violent acts from both sides, and abort all the attempts to torpedo the peace agreement. Our position on this subject is firm and unchanged. I pray for almighty God to help us reach a quick peace agreement that protects the sons of our people everywhere, and that protects Israeli civilians everywhere, in order to reach lasting and just peace. [Mu'addi] Progress in the Palestinian-Israeli talks took place yesterday, and this incident took place today. Do such incidents influence the peace process? [Sha'th] We can either bow to these incidents and allow them to obstruct the peace process, or we can expedite the peace process in order to stop these incidents. I believe the second option is better. We should create conditions on the ground that make it impossible for these operations to continue, or at least make them very difficult. I feel pain whenever an incident targets civilians. This was my feeling after the Hebron and Gaza incidents, and it was the same yesterday concerning the incident that took place in the al-Wahidi house in Ramallah. I have this feeling any time the sons of our people suffer as a result of the continuation of this situation. I have the same feelings toward the families of those who were killed in Hadera and 'Afula. [Mu'addi] Did the Israelis and the Palestinians have contacts over the past few hours to prepare for the resumption of talks next Sunday? [Sha'th] We have constant contacts. I think we will begin new talks next Sunday morning. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much. [Sha'th] Thank you.
