FBIS4-67147 "jptdd020__l94012" JPRS-TDD-94-020-L JPRS Narcotics 5 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA BRAZIL Investigation Into Links Between Illegal Lottery, Drug Investigation Into Links Between Illegal Lottery, Drug Trafficking Halted PY0605021394 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 5 May 94 p 8 PY0605021394 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO Portuguese BFN [Text] If it is left up to the Military Police [PM] to investigate the connections between the illegal numbers lottery and international drug trafficking, District Attorney Antonio Carlos Biscaia may become frustrated. The investigations have stopped and, according to sources from the PM Secret Service (P-2), anyone who insists on investigating on his own could be punished. Authorizations for cars and agents necessary for operations that must be carried out in Bangu, Campos, and Angra dos Reis--where there is a strong indication of links between illegal lottery kingpins and drug traffickers--have been canceled. Biscaia, who does not trust the civilian police, is unable to investigate any charges of drug trafficking links due to lack of support from the PM. The P-2 agents have not even analyzed a telephone book confiscated in an illegal lottery kingpin's home in Praca da Se, Bangu, which contains telephone numbers of the Cali cartel in Colombia, the main drug trafficking cartel in the world. According to secret service sources, the PM alleges that such operations are meant to politically harm former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola and current Governor Nilo Batista. The information leaked by an accountant for illegal lottery kingpin Castor de Andrade to the PM secret service--which links Fernando de Miranda Iggnacio, Andrade's son-in-law, who is detained at a Polinter [Inter-State Police] precinct, with Colombian drug traffickers--could also not be confirmed, because the P-2, with the dismissal of Lieutenant Colonel Marco Antonio Paes de Oliveira, has practically been dismantled. The most active P-2 agents were transferred to other units or given anticipated vacations. According to the same sources, any evidence of the links between the illegal lottery and drug trafficking could strengthen the district attorney's position and, on the other hand, weaken the state government and PDT [Democratic Labor Party] politicians mentioned in the lists of the illegal lottery kingpins. To worsen the situation, the Federal Police is on strike, and the information about passport numbers, and arrivals and departures from the country, cannot be checked out, not even by the prosecutors. For this reason, and to gain time, Biscaia is concentrating on the charges of active and passive corruption which require only the analysis of computer diskettes and accounting books confiscated from the illegal lottery kingpins, and which list the names of politicians, prosecutors, judges, journalists, artists, and athletes.
