The disease was diagnosed a week ago in two petty officers and an able seamen while the 3,500-ton ship was visiting Gibraltar. They were taken ashore and later flown home after hospital treatment. A second rating fell ill at sea and was airlifted to Lisbon on Tuesday. Liverpool is at present anchored off Spithead, seven miles from Portsmouth, and has been ordered to remain there until Friday so that the health of the 280 crew can be monitored. A number of sailors suffered stomach upsets after leaving Gibraltar but preliminary tests suggest the illness has not spread beyond the four cases. "Viral meningitis is not life-threatening, but we are taking all possible precautions," said a Navy spokeswoman. Liverpool, which has only recently completed repairs to her hull and radar systems after an accident in Bahrain harbour last year, abandoned a planned visit to Norway and exercises in the North Atlantic to return home for the medical checks.
