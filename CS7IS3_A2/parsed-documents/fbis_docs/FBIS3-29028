[passage omitted] In his White House speech, Clinton said the time for bitterness was over and now was the time for a new beginning between Hanoi and Washington. This is indeed laudable and the US president could not have said it better. The reconciliation process was a long difficult one for the United States due to the great bitterness the Vietnam War had caused among the American people. At that time it was perceived that a communist regime had beaten the free world superpower of the day, and this did not go down well with the American people. When the embargo was extended after 1975, its purpose was to squeeze more information from Vietnam regarding the American MiAs. [missing in action] Veterans groups and families of the MiAs were of course very emotionally involved, just wanting to know what happened to their loved ones. Hence there was a great deal of pressure on a number of US administrators to keep the embargo intact until there was a full accounting of the missing servicemen. [passage omitted] For the Vietnamese to forgive and forget is also laudable. It has to be remembered the extent to which the Vietnamese have suffered from the ravages of war. Since 1946 they have fought five wars almost continuously, and nearly 10 percent of the population of about 71 million is totally disabled. Interestingly enough, one of the key questions on the minds of many is to what degree the issue of trade played a part in the presidential decision. Clearly, American companies have been represented in Hanoi for a long time but the embargo has always prevented them from assuming a full role in the booming Vietnamese economy. Because of this they have been forced to stay on the sidelines while European, Australian, Japanese, South Korean and Hong Kong companies have been able to get a good head start on them. Obviously, this factor has been the main point of consideration, though in answering questions from reporters Clinton said the trade question did not influence his decision. Unfortunately, the lifting of the trade embargo is not quite the same as the normalization of relation between Washington and Hanoi. Normalization usually involves the exchange of ambassadors and other diplomatic ties and these were certainly not a part of the current presidential decision. However, it can be assumed that Vietnam will be seeking diplomatic ties with the United States. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Hanoi has been looking for a guarantor against China's expanding role in the region and sees Washington now being able to play the part. The establishment of a US liaison office in Hanoi is indeed positive development and this must be seen as the first step on the path towards normalizing ties between the two countries. With the lifting of the trade embargo, the United States and Vietnam can now look forward to a better future. This is indeed a good omen for the beginning of the new lunar year next week because, for the first time in decades, Vietnam is not at war or in conflict with any country.
