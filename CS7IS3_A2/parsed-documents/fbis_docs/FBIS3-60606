Top secret. However, the defense council convened by President Mitterrand yesterday at the Elysee Palace [president's office] at 1700 certainly is a major test for the present cohabitation. The participants were -- besides the head of state -- Prime Minister Balladur, Defense Minister Francois Leotard, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery, the chiefs of staff, Admiral Jacques Lanxade, General Amedee Monchal (Army), General Vincent Lanata (Air Force) and Admiral Coatanea (Navy), Deputy General to the Armament Authority Henri Conze and the secretary general to national defense, Admiral Lerche. The agenda included the White Paper on defense which the government would like to publish in January and the preparation of the bill on the military program for the years 1995-2000 that should be discussed by parliament next spring. In fact, the most important issues facing the council were the French position vis-a-vis NATO and the future of the French deterrent force, the trends of which should be determined for the next 10 or 15 years by the White Paper. Francois Mitterrand, who did not want to be directly involved in the preparation of the White Paper requested by Edouar Balladur, could give his support to it if it does not contradict his fundamental options in the field of defense. This is the reason why this defense council was organized -- another council should take place late in December or early in January -- so that the head of state can examine the final drafting of the document. The Elysee and the government point out that the French policy toward NATO is developing without jolts in cohabitation. The joint opinion -- in view of the NATO summit on 10 January -- is that progress will have to be made in affirming the necessity of a European defense body, through the Western European Union. The complementarity and the autonomy of decision of such a body vis-a- vis the Atlantic Alliance will have to be clearly defined. In the same way, if the government, and to a smaller extent, the president wish to participate more actively in the NATO structure, it is out of the question to come back under the integrated command of the Organization, which France wishes to see deeply reformed. The nuclear issue was much more intricate. The majority in government, mainly the RPR [Rally for the Republic] -- already opposed to the moratorium on nuclear tests decided by Francois Mitterrand -- recently seemed to support a possible development of the French doctrine to a "strong vs. the weak" deterrence which implies the use of miniaturized nuclear weapons called "beheading weapons." This development is totally opposed to the position of Francois Mitterrand, who advocates leveling strike force in a context of "strict sufficiency" with the objective of reducing world arsenals and fighting against proliferation. The government will probably fix dates for the tests which he deems must be resumed in limited number, while waiting to control the situation. On the other hand, Francois Leotard, with the support or at the request of Edouard Balladur, recently stated -- in public and on several occasions -- that France rules out the possibility of heading for a "doctrine of use". In this field, attention is given not to break the consensus. But it is legitimate to wonder to what extent Edouard Balladur supports a policy of a thorough modernization of the nuclear arsenal, since it is quite obvious that he does -- and will not in the coming years -- have the necessary budget for this purpose.
