Seiran Oganian said Azerbaijan lost a large amount of weapons including one aircraft, more than 60 units of armor (36 of them tanks), 12 artillery pieces and three rocket launchers and a large amount of other weaponry. He said as many as 36 Azeri troops were taken prisoner, some of them mercenaries from other countries. The official put the Karabakh army's losses over the same period at some 300 dead. He said that Armenian forces had also lost 25 units of armor but these were replenished at the cost of tanks and army vehicles captured from Azerbaijan. On the relative calm on the front lines, Oganian said this followed an unprecedented toll of casualties, exhaustion and frustration by the Azeri army. He says Azerbaijan's initial successes in the early stages of the latest offensive due to its preponderance of troops and weapons were temporary and had soon been neutralized by Armenian troops.
