Since the massacre of fasting worshipers in the al-Khalil mosque, the Zionist regime has resorted to a policy of suppression and persuasion in a bid to limit reaction to the tragedy inside occupied Palestine. However, these policies have not yielded the results that Tel Aviv wished. The Zionist regime's decision to release 500 more Palestinian political prisoners yesterday, as well as the disarming of some extremist Palestinian [as heard] groups and the payment of compensation to the families of the martyrs of the tragedy at the Ibrahimi shrine, are among the persuasive efforts that the Zionist regime has resorted to hoping to prevent the Palestinian Muslims from spreading the intifadah. The suppression of Palestinian demonstrators who were protesting the massacre of the worshipers in the Ibrahimi mosque, which has resulted in several deaths and injuries, are among the terrorist acts that the Zionist regime hoped would end the reactions to the recent tragedy. Political analysts believe that the Zionist regime's policies of persuasion and suppression have not yielded the results that Tel Aviv wished but have further clarified the nature of this regime. This regime, which has claimed that it does not have even one political prisoner and that all prisoners are under criminal charges, has displayed contradictory behavior with the release of 1,300 Palestinian prisoners in the past few days. This step by the Zionist regime, with which it is trying to limit the wave of rage from the Palestinian Muslims, has revealed that the Zionist regime's allegations on Palestinian prisoners are not true, since according to the Zionist regime's penal code criminals cannot be released without approval from the cabinet. Also, the Zionist regime's efforts to suppress the Palestinian demonstrators, which has resulted in hundreds of deaths and injuries, has only resulted in its disgrace. By massacring the Palestinian Muslims in the streets and alleys of the occupied territories, this regime, which stated that the tragedy at the shrine was perpetrated by an insane person, has revealed an aggressive nature that is not very different from that of the allegedly insane criminal.
