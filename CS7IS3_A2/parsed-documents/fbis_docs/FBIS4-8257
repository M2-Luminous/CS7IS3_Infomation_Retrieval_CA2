Immediately after the election, the CMKOS Assembly, comprising representatives from individual unions proportionately to their memberships, met at its constituent session. It is to elect four CMKOS deputy chairmen. After the November 1989 "velvet revolution", Falbr became the chairman of the Bohemian-Moravian Trade Union of Service Workers. He briefly held the post of deputy chairman of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and was the last head of Czechoslovakia's largest union organization, the Czech and Slovak Confederation of Trade Unions (CSKOS). He held the post even after Czechoslovakia's split on January 1, 1993, as the CSKOS continued its operation to help solve the problems of the labor market and joint Czech-Slovak economic relations. In November 1993 the CSKOS disbanded, and its two successors, the independent Czech (CMKOS) and Slovak chambers, were established. Falbr continued his union activities. He contributed to the integration of three trade unions, those of service area, gas industry, and foreign trade workers, into the UNIOS trade union, of which he was elected chairman in mid-February 1994. Falbr, a doctor of law, was born on September 29, 1940 in Chester, Great Britain, where his father served in the Czech air force unit. Falbr's mother was Spanish, which may have contributed to Falbr's good knowledge of foreign languages. From 1968 to 1970 Falbr was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. From 1963 to 69 he taught Spain and English at the Interior Ministry's School of Languages. Falbr is married and has a son and a daughter.
