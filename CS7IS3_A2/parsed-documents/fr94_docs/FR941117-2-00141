Expenses of a Company that could not be attributed directly to any one portfolio would be allocated to each portfolio based on the relative net assets of the portfolio or as otherwise determined under the supervision of its directors (``Company Expenses''). Expenses attributable to a portfolio but not to a particular class would be allocated on the basis of the relative net asset value of the respective classes in the portfolio (``Portfolio Expenses''). Each class will bear certain expenses attributable specifically to such class, as set forth in condition 1 (``Class Expenses''). The net asset value of all shares of a portfolio would be computed on the same days and at the same times. 6. FIRMCO or another service contractor may choose to reimburse or waive Class Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses waived or reimbursed may vary from class to class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and are expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or waive Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same portfolio. 7. In addition, FIRMCO or another service contractor may waive or reimburse Company Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of Company Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Company Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of a portfolio according to the relative net assets of the classes. Company Expenses and Portfolio Expenses apply equally to all classes of a given portfolio. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Company Expenses or Portfolio Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same portfolio. 8. Applicants propose that share exchange privileges may be available to shareholders to permit (a) the exchange of shares of one portfolio for shares of another portfolio, (b) the exchange of shares of an equity portfolio or a fixed income portfolio for shares of a money market portfolio (or vice versa), and/or (c) the exchange of shares of one class of a portfolio for shares of another class of the same portfolio. Any exchange of shares will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. 9. Shares of some classes of shares subject to a CDSC (``Convertible CDSC Shares'') could automatically convert into shares of non-CDSC shares (``Non-CDSC Shares'') after a prescribed period following the purchase of Convertible CDSC Shares. Shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid with respect to Cnvertible CDSC Shares will also be Convertible CDSC Shares. These shares will convert to Non-CDSC Shares on the earlier of a prescribed period following the date of such reinvestment or the conversion date of the most recently purchased Convertible Shares which were not acquired through the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions. 10. Applicants also request an exemption to permit the Companies to impose a CDSC on redemptions of shares of the Company, and to waive the CDSC under certain circumstances. No CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation, on shares acquired through the reinvestment of income dividends or capital gain distributions, or on those shares purchased more than a specified period prior to redemption. In determining whether a CDSC would be payable, it would be assumed that shares, or amounts representing shares, that are not subject to a CDSC would be redeemed first and other shares or amounts would be redeemed in the other purchased. No CDSC will be imposed on shares purchased before the effective date of the requested order. 11. Applicants also request relief to permit each Fund to waive or reduce the CDSC in certain circumstances. Any waiver or reduction will comply with the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d&hyph;1 of the Act. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio of securities. Applicants believe that by implementing the multiple class distribution system, the Company would be able to facilitate the distribution of their shares and provide a broad array of services without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs. Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights in the manner described above is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders.
