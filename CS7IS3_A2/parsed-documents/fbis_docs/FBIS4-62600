A Monday [16 May] appeal to the Ukrainian president, parliament and Supreme Court says that in order to preserve the territorial integrity of the country foreign interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine should be rebuffed and an armed conflict provoked by separatist moves by the Crimean authorities prevented. The document points to the illegality of the actions of the Crimean president and parliament, disregard for the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar communities and the policy of separation from Ukraine. The document also claims that the Black Sea Fleet is used for pressurizing Ukraine. "In these circumstances the process of withdrawal of nuclear warheads under the trilateral agreement should be stopped," RUKh believes. Also on Monday RUKh sent a message to the CSCE and the UN Security Council that claims that the present situation became possible as a result of direct and constant interference of Russian Government bodies in the affairs of a neighboring country contrary to all declarations of the Russian president and other top leaders about the observation of the principles of inviolability of frontiers and guarantees of territorial integrity.
