ACTION: Advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM); extension of comment period. SUMMARY: This document announces an extension of the comment period on Notice 94&hyph;4 entitled, ``Overflights of Units of the National Park System'' (59 FR 12740; March 17, 1994). This comment period is extended from June 15, 1994, until July 15, 1994. The extension responds to the request of the National Parks and Conservation Association (NPCA) and is needed to permit NCPA, and other affected parties, additional time to develop comments responsive to Notice 94&hyph;4. DATES: The comment period is being extended from June 15, 1994, to July 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: As stated in Notice 94&hyph;4, comments should be mailed, in triplicate, to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;200), Docket No. 27643, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591. All comments must be marked: ``Docket No. 27643.'' Comments on this notice may be examined in room 915G on weekdays, except on Federal holidays, between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David L. Bennett, Office of Chief Counsel, AGC&hyph;600, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;3473, or Michael M. Tiernan, Office of the Solicitor, Department of Interior (DOI), 18th and C Streets, NW., Washington, DC 2040, telephone (202) 208&hyph;7597. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 17, 1994, the FAA issued Notice No. 94&hyph;4, entitled ``Overflights of Units of the National Park System.'' Notice No. 94&hyph;4 sought comment on general policy and specific recommendations for voluntary and regulatory actions to address the effects of aircraft overflights on national parks. By a request dated May 12, 1994, the NPCA asked that the comment period be extended 30 days. The NPCA explained that, unlike the airtour industry and other vested interests that have formed cohesive groups with streamlined communications systems, its 400,000 members are individual citizens who share an interest of protecting and preserving the national parks and national park values and are reliant on periodic contact with the NPCA. It indicated that the additional time would allow it to make the contents of the notice available to interested members, and allow it sufficient time to digest the notice and draft and file comments. In order to give the NCPA and its members additional time to prepare comments, the FAA finds that it would be in the public interest to extend the comment period by 30 days. Accordingly, the comment period is being extended to July 15, 1994, to afford all interested persons the opportunity to comment on this notice. Issued in Washington, DC, on June 10, 1994. Harold W. Becker, Acting Director, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration. Michael V. Finley, Acting Associate Director, Operations, National Park Service.
