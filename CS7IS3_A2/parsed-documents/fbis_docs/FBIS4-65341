Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, is considering a response to questions put by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, and channelled to London through Dublin. He will publish his answers this week, but is expected to regard many of the points as matters for negotiation once the IRA gives up violence. Official sources made clear that the reply would be determined by an assessment of whether the list amounts to a genuine attempt to clear up misunderstandings or ambiguity. The move has rekindled hardline Unionist suspicions that the Government is prepared to engage in dialogue with the republicans before they have agreed to a permanent end to violence. The Government denies this. Since the declaration was signed five months ago the Government has refused repeated Sinn Fein requests for formal clarification though some ministerial speeches have been interpreted as attempts to address republican concerns. Anger among some Unionists that the Government should even contemplate answering Sinn Fein's points will have added to Sir Patrick's determination to give no impression of succumbing to republican demands for detailed amplification of the declaration. He will argue that some of the issues raised have already been amply dealt with in ministers speeches and statements. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said: "Once again we have a Government that lies and deceives, a Government that tells us one thing and does another." More moderate Unionists were prepared to back the Government's willingness to respond to the questions, provided the answers made clear that there would be no further accommodation of Sinn Fein without a permanent cessation of violence. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said that while the IRA was merely engaging in a further ploy with no real intention of ending terrorism, it was "a good thing that their bluff will be called and all will be revealed." Mr Ken Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said: "The Government should indicate to Sinn Fein one overriding pre-condition -- an unconditional end to violence." But with progress on the declaration held up and the separate political process suspended until after the European elections, some Unionists fear that frustration at the lack of progress will bring overtures to Sinn Fein from London and Dublin. Mr John Taylor, MP for Strangford, accused the Government of "playing the tune" of the IRA and said the province had lost confidence in Sir Patrick. The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, told Irish radio from America where he briefed President Clinton at the weekend: "There is a price to be paid for peace and all parties to the conflict in Northern Ireland should see it that way and make their contribution towards removing all the blocks." Mr Adams told a meeting in Dublin that he wanted an end to the clarification debate "so we can all move the peace process on to the next stage."
