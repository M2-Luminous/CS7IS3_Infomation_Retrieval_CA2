FR940825-0-00042 FR940825-0-00012 The alternative proposed in both environmental assessments was to authorize the continued use of U.S. Highway 191 by commercial vehicles, but to prohibit the transport of hazardous materials on U.S. Highway 191 through the park. Local deliveries and removal of hazardous materials would be allowed under permits and conditions established by the superintendent. This alternative would significantly reduce the potential of a hazardous material spill in the park, yet would not cause significant economic impacts to local communities or the trucking industry that would result from a complete ban on commercial vehicles. Other concerns identified and evaluated in the environmental assessments included potential impacts to wildlife, visitor safety, and visitor experience created by the continued presence of, and noise levels created by, commercial traffic on U.S. Highway 191 through the park. These impacts were determined to be minor and temporary in effect. The NPS found that continued use of the highway by commercial traffic, excluding the transport of hazardous materials, caused no significant impact to resources or to the experience of park visitors. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was published in the Federal Register on September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48336). Based on this discussion, the NPS is today publishing final regulations as discussed below. Purpose for Regulation The historical and current use of U.S. Highway 191 by commercial vehicles through Yellowstone National Park is in conflict with 36 CFR 5.6. With the existing levels of interstate and local commercial vehicle traffic on U.S. Highway 191, there is significant public concern about the potential for hazardous materials spills in the park resulting from motor vehicle accidents. The general purpose of the regulations is to authorize the use of U.S. Highway 191 through the park by commercial vehicles; to prohibit the transport of hazardous materials on U.S. Highway 191 except when permitted under certain conditions; to delete out-of-date sections of the special regulations for Yellowstone related to speed limits and trucking permits; to establish general procedures for issuing permits to commercial vehicles operating on all park roads; to prohibit operating without a permit or in violation of a term or condition of a permit; and to provide for the suspension or revocation of a permit for failure to comply with a term or condition. Analysis of Comments NPS received 125 timely comments on the proposed regulations during the comment period from September 15, 1993 to November 15, 1993. The majority (116) of the comments came from individuals, many of whom stated they live or own property in or near the Big Sky, Montana, area. Nine comments came from organizations or government entities. Of the total comments, 117 expressed general support of the proposed regulations and 8 expressed opposition. Of the 117 comments in favor of the proposed regulations, 72 expressed support without qualification. Twenty-eight expressed qualified support with a preference that a complete ban on commercial trucking on U.S. Highway 191 be imposed. This issue has been very controversial since public meetings were first held in 1987. Many local citizens have wanted a total ban on trucking through the park in order to reduce trucking outside the park near Big Sky, while the trucking industry has wanted no change whatsoever in the historical use. Considering the diverse, polarized points of view on this issue, the preference stated in this group of 28 comments is not unexpected. A number of these comments also mentioned concerns about the speed limit and encouraged NPS to actively enforce the speed limit. Eight comments expressed qualified support for the proposal with a primary preference for a speed limit less than 55 mph for trucks. NPS believes that a reduced speed limit was adequately reviewed in the 1992 environmental assessment that determined that an aggressively enforced 55 mph speed limit would address safety, operational, and environmental concerns and would be consistent with the purposes for which the roadway was established. NPS intends to actively enforce the speed limit to the extent that staffing allows.
