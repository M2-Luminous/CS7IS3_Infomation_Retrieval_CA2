The conflict within the PDP is not at all naive, and it involves two irreconcilable currents. Both claim to have the right to the name PDP. The radical faction, according to the statements, doesn't intend to negotiate with the group of delegates and ministers, it considers them "old communist personnel," "Gligorov's men," "participants in the silky communist transition of Macedonia." The intention of the radicals is to create Albanian "cultural" institutions in Macedonia, "without entering the Macedonian political space." What is not clear is whether they have parallel institutions in mind, as well as the question for or against autonomy to the Albanians, except for the fact that such projects as "Ilirida" in the past were ridiculous. What is not only of great concern to the members and PDP fans, but also for Macedonia in general is the struggle for the name of the party. The radicals are not alone in having no intention of forming, that is registering, a new party with another name or a suffix to the name PDP, but are also resolute in fighting for the name until the end. Even if the state, or the competent bodies, don't allow them to enter the Fall elections with their candidates under the name of PDP, they have announced that they were backed by "an enormous membership, which should mean something," and that there was a "counter project" planned, as Djaferi stated, if such a decision is taken by the authorities. And if the state takes such a decision, it is clear that the actions will be outside the institutions. Taci added they had all the facts on their side, and if the police tried to solve the dispute "anything may happen." It seems that these statements were certainly meant to warn of the possibility of arousing the people, which certainly represents the worst and most dangerous variant, an experiment that has taken place in other regions. How large the membership is and who the "people" behind them are cannot be divined, however, in some chance situations, a statement about an alleged "hunt against the Albanians" can sometimes be sufficient to invalidate all the political efforts for coexistence. In a situation where the delegates and ministers are continuing their political engagement in the institutions of the system, we can conclude that the goal of the radicals is to discredit the people in authority and in the institutions, in order to force the delegates and ministers to retire from the government. The example of the Tetovo assembly is very characteristic. A normal police action in which a number of Albanians were arrested for the illegal possession of arms and explosives became a political problem. The assembly convoked a session on that topic, it invited Ministers Frckovski and Gosev, it even demanded the presence of President Gligorov. The delegates connected this case regarding the 10 accused with the creation of a paramilitary army, although the competent bodies said it was not the case and that the police would perform their duties no matter which nationality was involved. Of course, is there a country in which a local authority discusses a number of people caught with arms, asks for their liberation, and moves the process in another direction? There are opinions that the Tetovo assembly is testing its possible future activities as a parallel institution (parallel parliament). It is worthwhile mentioning that the PDP delegates in the Tetovo assembly are 90 percent dedicated to the radical group, headed by the head of the delegate group. They are working under the direction of Taci's and Djaferi's group. Some sources claim that the session dedicated to the arrested Albanians and attended by the PDP ministers had the unique goal of discrediting them as representatives of the authority that is "carrying out arrests," so as to make them retire from the government, thus increasing the possibility of actions outside the institutions. Due to the intensified actions of the radicals, there is evidently increased nervousness among the delegates' and ministers' group, which is trying hard to create a new image in the period before the elections by saying that the authority is supported by Taci's group (following the session with the government), issuing information about the arrested Albanians, and accusing the authority of which, by the way, they are a part. Before that it demanded that the court decide about the legitimacy of the PDP, and, because of unfavorable reactions among the Albanian radical political factors, it withdrew the charges. Apparently the delegates' and ministers' group is making mistakes in the new situation, which is not the case with the radicals. The basic mistake is that it is trying hard to show itself in a different light and be what it is not. As long as it is so, the radicals will be on the offensive.
