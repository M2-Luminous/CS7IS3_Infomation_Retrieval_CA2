FR940628-0-00040 FR940628-0-00017 Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In addition to the changes made to part 682 based on public comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary has revised the regulations to include technical changes made by certain legislation, as stated above. It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations in accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. However, since these changes merely reflect statutory changes in the regulations and do not establish substantive policy changes, public comment could have no effect. Therefore, the Secretary has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that public comment on these amendments to the regulations is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. Assessment of Educational Impact In the notice of proposed regulations, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations in this document would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
