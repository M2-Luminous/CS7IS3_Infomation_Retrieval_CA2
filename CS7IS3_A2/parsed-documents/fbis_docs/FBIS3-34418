This was the fourth tripartite session in this connection. It is surprising that the three countries should decide to hold such sessions to examine the situation in Iraq and to express their concern over the [word indistinct] there, when they are not ready to allow an Iraqi Government representative or representatives of the Iraqi opposition or Iraqi Kurds to attend these sessions. Apparently, the objective behind the tripartite session of the Iranian, Turkish, and Syrian foreign ministers is to examine the possibility of reaching a common stance on a possible dismemberment of Iraq. For some time, these three countries have been paying lip service to safeguarding Iraq's territorial integrity and shed crocodile tears for it without having specific proof that Iraq is being dismembered. This, when both Iran and Turkey still covet part of Iraqi territory and sometimes repeat their territorial claims on part of it. But the three countries have not been plunged into concern and fear out of the threat of Iraq's dismemberment. The concern and fear stem from the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan and the intensification of the justice seeking struggle of the Kurdish people elsewhere in Kurdistan. The three countries do not consider the intensification of national and freedom seeking beliefs and the consolidation of national feeling among the Iranian, Turkish, and Syrian Kurds to come within the framework of the growing world trend that seeks democracy, but try to portray that all this stems from the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan. Thus, the Kurdish problem in general and the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan in particular are portrayed as an important and common problem for these three countries. Iran, Turkey, and Syria rule over part of Kurdish territory and the Kurdish people throughout Kurdistan are striving to achieve their national and just rights. The three countries that control part of the Kurdish territory do not favor the fulfillment of the Kurdish people's aspirations and objectives in each part of Kurdistan. You can see clearly how the [words indistinct] allegedly shedding tears for Iraq's unity and integrity stem from the growing trend of the Kurdish people's freedom seeking movement. The Islamic Republic, which has been [words indistinct] and suppressing the Kurdish people for over 15 years [words indistinct] for the Iraqi Kurds. In relation with this, Tehran scorns the Turkish Government for allowing the United States and its allies to use Turkish bases to support Iraqi Kurds. The Turkish Government, which for years has denied the existence of several million Kurds in eastern Turkey and has had to admit this existence because of domestic problems on the one hand and the West's public opinion on the other, has taken no serious step to ensure the national and political rights of the Kurds in Turkey. And finally, not only is Syria refraining from granting the just rights of the Syrian Kurds, but it is also trying to annihilate their national identity. It has always pursued the policy of crushing and decimating the Kurds. Thus, the historic enmity of Iran, Turkey, and Syria toward the Kurdish people throughout Kurdistan leaves no doubt that the various sessions among the three countries' foreign ministers are not meetings to exchange views on the general situation in Iraqi Kurdistan, but an effort for more cooperation in their opposition and hostility to the formation of a Kurdish country within the framework of Iraq and an effort to find ways to suppress the Kurdish people elsewhere in Kurdistan. In the current situation--in which the world's support for the Kurdish people can (?prevent) these three countries from showing more (?hostility) against the Kurdish movement in the various parts of Kurdistan--the [word indistinct] of the Kurdish people throughout Kurdistan to uncover behind the scene agreements and plots being hatched by these three countries is very opportune. In addition to these agreements, the regimes of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey are implementing a special joint agreement. Also, Iran, Turkey, and Syria have decided to continue their sessions and their plotting against the Kurdish people in future. Undoubtedly, any joint effort by these three to crush the Kurdish people will meet strong reaction worldwide, including among the supporters of the Kurdish people. These three countries should understand that suppressing and plotting against the Kurdish people cannot solve the Kurdish problem. Experience has proven this. [Word indistinct], in addition to dozens of domestic problems, these three governments are united as far as machinations against the Kurdish people go. There are many signs, particularly those seen recently, that this unity and these machinations are intensifying and that these three countries are moving toward a common attempt against the Kurdish people's interests. For this reason and to thwart any plot against the Kurdish people, the public and humanitarian organizations and forums should be better informed. The Kurds should [words indistinct], adding to their self- confidence. Consider the fear and concern felt by the three countries. This clearly shows that the Kurdish movement is intensifying [words indistinct].
