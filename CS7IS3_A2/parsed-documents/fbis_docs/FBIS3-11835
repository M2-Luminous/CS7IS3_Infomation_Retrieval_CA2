This law that took 14 months to be approved by Congress was implemented on 9 March after its publication in the official gazette. In the opinion of the law's authors, the instruments that outline the future of Chile's environmental actions are inspired in an integrating approach capable of granting, without going into details, key and generic guidelines for all national environmental problems. In other words, the easiest path was chosen, taking into account that with rules at hand it is easier to solve problems and progressively tackle each of the situations the country must face in this field. This will be done through the respective regulations that will be implemented over time. The basic law is divided into 94 articles in addition to three transitory articles. It consists, basically, of a series of definitions and principles regarding its importance, in administration and institutional instruments that will allow its implementation, and in a system to define responsibility for damaging the environment. This new law includes (discarding the idea of codifying in a single text the various important regulations in force regarding the environment in Chile) two main instruments that will make its implementation feasible. National Environment Commission (Conama) executive secretary Rafael Asenjo referred to these instruments: Key Instruments The main instrument is the System for the Assessment of the Impact on the Environment [Sistema de Evaluacion de Impacto Ambiental -- SEIA] that, according to Asenjo, in addition to its preventive nature regarding Chilean production activities, deals with the international competition demanded in sustainable development. It includes procedures for the establishment of standards for emissions, quality, and environmental terms, giving the productive sector (either public or private) full autonomy to choose its own technology to attain these goals. It also includes prevention or decontamination plans, whatever is needed, that can resort to market instruments such as a "permit for negotiable emissions." Here again, the law grants business people the freedom to reach agreements among themselves for the fulfillment of environment quality standards for a specific area. Rafael Asenjo said: "Once rules for the use of this mechanism have been defined, we believe it will greatly contribute to a progressive, gradual, and sustained reduction of pollution levels." This chapter also includes plans for the handling of natural resources, the improvement of the National Wild Areas System protected by the state, and the citizenry's participation, especially regarding their right to be kept informed on environment-related studies. New Public Service The second instrument of the law is of an institutional nature. In fact, Conama ceases to be an advisory commission to become a public service, with legal status and its own patrimony. Its main role will be to integrate and coordinate the environmental activities of all sectors of the public administration that have any say in the matter. The executive council formed by 10 ministers and the Conama executive director also is created. This organization, in turn, will operate in a decentralized manner through respective regional environment commissions (Coremas) and will act as a horizontal structure at the government level that will be supervised by the president of the Republic through the ministry secretary general of the presidency, a privileged interlocutor between the government and the community. Moreover, Conama will be in charge of revising and periodically (every five years) updating the regulations issued regarding various subjects. In this case, surveillance will be absolutely by sectors, except in the case of complaints, in which case this service is in charge of making sure the law is respected. In this regard, it should be pointed out that people may approach the city halls authorized to hear the complaint and channel it to the respective Corema or the main office if necessary, under threat of a court ruling if it fails to do so. Regional Model In one way or another, this law contains and expresses the principles "whoever contaminates pays" (in other words, whoever contaminates must include in his costs what it will cost to decontaminate), as well as the "gradualism" and "realism" principles. Rafael Asenjo said: "This is the result of having explicitly tackled the subject from an integrative and comprehensive viewpoint for the first time in Chilean law." Therefore, he added, when we start to apply the law "we will take a necessary quantitative step forward in our country's environmental activities." In this sense, Asenjo believes that there is a more optimistic future for Chile, noting that the laws dictated during the past years by the Latin American countries have not followed this model. He commented that despite the huge economic and human resources they have earmarked, their environmental problems have not been reduced. "We believe the reason for this failure in the region has been the attempt to solve everything at once with the same law and having created a fully sectorial institutional scheme that has lead nowhere and caused the various ministries to compete with each other," Asenjo commented. Specific regulations are necessary now to start applying the environment law.
