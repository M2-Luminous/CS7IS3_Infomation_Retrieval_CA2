Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid briefed the three envoys on the Arab League Council resolution from its recent meeting to support the Libyan stand in the Western-Libyan Lockerbie crisis and the Council's adoption of a proposal to try the two suspected Libyan nationals before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said after the meeting that Libya took a flexible stand when it agreed to the trial of its suspected citizens before a neutral body. He said that the proposal adopted by the Arab League Council at its recent meeting calls for the travel of a Scottish court and judges to The Hague because the U.S. plane crashed over the Scottish town of Lockerbie and the law to apply in such a case is that of the country where the incident happened. The Arab League chief said that Scottish law is more flexible than English law, which only stipulates two outcomes of a trial: either guilty or not guilty. He added that he proposed at the meeting to have the Security Council issue a resolution transferring the Scottish court to The Hague in order to begin the trial of the Libyans suspected of involvement in the Lockerbie case. He stressed that Libya is responsive and eager not to escalate the Libyan-Western crisis since such an escalation will have grave consequences for Libya, the neighboring countries, the Mediterranean Sea countries, and even the European countries, which will not be happy with the imposition of an embargo on the export of Libyan oil.
