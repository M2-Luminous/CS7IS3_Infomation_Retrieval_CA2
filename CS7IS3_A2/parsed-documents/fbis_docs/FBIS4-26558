The China-appointed think-tank will also study a systematic plan for thousands of mainland children with Hong Kong parents to return to the territory. The PWC's social security group ended a two-day session in Beijing yesterday to draft a working agenda for the next six months. The PWC social security group local leader Rita Fan said an alternative to the SAR passport could be needed for residents who had not gained permanent residency by living in the territory for seven years. While details were yet to be finalised, Mrs Fan said the documents would probably apply to people who use Document of Identity (DI) as their travel papers. Under the present system, about 1.5 million Hong Kong people hold British Dependent Territory Citizen (BDTC) passports and are able to apply for British National Overseas (BNO) passports. Those who were not born in the territory, but obtained right of abode after living here continuously for seven years, can use the Certificate of Identity (CI) as their travel documents. They are not entitled to apply for BDTC passports. People living here who have not yet fulfilled the seven years continuous residence requirement can use their original passport or a Document of Identity (DI). Mrs Fan said BNO and CI holders would be entitled to apply for passports issued by the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. But DI holders-might not qualify. The PWC would also focus on the fate of at least 75,000 mainland children who will be allowed into Hong Kong after 1997. Under the Basic Law ethnic Chinese children born outside the territory to Hong Kong permanent residents will have right of abode in the territory. While the Hong Kong government has extended the number of children allowed into the territory each day there are still fears of a flood of immigrants on 1 July 1997. Mrs Fan said the PWC needed to make arrangements to allow the systematic arrival of children in Hong Kong after 1997.
