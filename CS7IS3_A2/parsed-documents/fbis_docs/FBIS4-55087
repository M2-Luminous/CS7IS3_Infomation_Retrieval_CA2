Details concerning the borders of the Herzegovina cantons are to be worked out today. Last night our delegation put forward several proposals as to possible solutions, after which the Croatian delegation asked for a break in order to conduct additional consultations. Even though these are delicate matters, the delegations are expected to complete this part of the job today, and then approach the agreement concerning the package, which includes the number and borders of the cantons, and the distribution of the ministerial positions in the government and the functions in the federation.
