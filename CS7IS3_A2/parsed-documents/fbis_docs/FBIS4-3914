However, experts predict a tough time for banks in the coming months if the inching up of prices isn't brought under strict control. At the end of March, bank savings topped 1,662.5 billion yuan ($191.1 billion), up 35.8 per cent from the corresponding period last year. The monthly growth rate reached a high of 6.8 per cent in February, compared with 2.5 per cent in January and 2.77 per cent in March. Wang Zhiqiang, a savings official for the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said the growth rates are among the highest in recent years and mark a big improvement from March 1993, when private savings plunged because of high inflation, illegal schemes for raising capital, and low interest rates. Wang attributed the growth to high interest rates and the government's continuous efforts to bring order to the country's financial system. "Actually," Wang said, "the strong momentum appeared last May when the central bank raised interest rates to reverse the decline in bank savings." Wang said the decision by the People's Bank of China to peg the interest rates for deposits with fixed terms of more than two years to the inflation rate also helped diminish depositors' worries over losing the real value of their savings. Meanwhile, with pay reform spreading across the country, many government units raised employees' salaries during the quarter. Most of the extra income has been set aside in bank savings, Wang said. In addition, many investors disappointed by the sluggish stock market are turning to banks for a safe place to keep their idle cash. Also, to prevent too much capital being drained away from savings and treasury bonds, the People's Bank of China has decided to suspend the development of investment funds. "Overall, China can still expect a steady growth in bank savings this year," Wang said. "But the pace may slow down." He said individual savings may decline in the second quarter because of the sale of 87 billion yuan ($10 billion) worth of treasury bonds, which began on April 1 and will end on June 30. "The treasury bonds, with their increased liquidity, shortened term and higher interest rates, are selling well across the country. This will no doubt siphon off a considerable part of the bank savings," Wang said. High inflation is another big threat to savings, he said. The inflation rate in the first quarter was 20.1 per cent, and even surpassed 30 per cent in some cities such as Haikou. At the same time the interest rate for one-year bank deposits remained at 10.8 per cent. If not narrowed, the gap may trigger a consumer buying spree that would soak up a lot of ready cash. "If the price hikes continue, it will be a very difficult time for banks," Wang said. In fact, rising prices at the end of last year sparked a buying binge especially in big cities, and led to a slowdown in the growth of bank savings. Meanwhile, Wang said that with the country taking strides in housing reform, more government units are selling homes to employees. This, in turn, means that people will spend more for housing and draw down bank savings, he said.
