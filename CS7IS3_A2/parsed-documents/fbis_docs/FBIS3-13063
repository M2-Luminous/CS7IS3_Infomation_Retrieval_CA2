The paper did not say if the March 2 attack in the Sunni-majority town of southeast Iran close to the border with Pakistan caused any casualties or damage. But it said security forces had arrested several members of the group "Sahab army" who had admitted responsibility for the attacks. It was the first time that the fundamentalist Wahhabi group, which has close links to Saudi Arabia and is based in Pakistan, has been publicly blamed by Iranian authorities for an attack in Iran. Numerous attacks on the Shiite community in Pakistan have been attributed to the group. Zahedan with 350,000 inhabitants is one of the main Sunni towns in Iran, a country where 80 percent of the population is Shiite. At least six people were killed in violent clashes between Sunni demonstrators and security forces in Zahedan last month during a protest against the destruction of a Sunni mosque in northeast Iran, reliable sources said. The Iranian media has since January warned of the risk of attacks in the region by Wahhabi fundamentalists, charging that they were backed by Iran's main armed opposition movement, the Mojahedin-e Khalq.
