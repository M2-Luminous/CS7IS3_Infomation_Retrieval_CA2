FBIS3-10475 "drlat045__a94013" FBIS-LAT-94-044-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 March 1994 ANNEX Cuba U.S. Handling of Human Rights Issue Viewed PA0203022394 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 0940 GMT 28 Feb 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA0203022394 Havana PRENSA LATINA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [By Carlos Fazio] [Text] [No dateline as received] -- A method used by the United States over and over again is to make use accustomed to de facto situations. A typical and current example is the "Strong Roads 94" operation throughout Latin America. Using the excuse of building schools and rural roads, the Pentagon is filling the region with soldiers. The goal is to get our people accustomed to the U.S. military presence in the area in order to transform local armies into police forces under Washington's centralized command. A subject that was once in vogue had the same fate: human rights. During the James Carter administration (1977-1981), the United States started to use the human rights issue as a foreign policy instrument. It did this by using a large-scale apparatus of propaganda and reiterations. Since then and every year, the occupant of the Oval Office, acting as a self-imposed judge, jury, and executioner, drafts reports on the observance of such principles in the world, issues "certifications," and punishes transgressors by withholding economic or military aid. This policy, however, has a weak side. In all cases, the human rights arena exists abroad. That is, they do not apply to the United States. That is the getting-accustomed [acostumbramiento] part. Given that the reality differs from the situation reported by the hypocritical media, which is subordinate to the "rumor mills" of the State Department and Pentagon, issues like human rights have become real boomerangs that have hurt the apostles of the White House. This is so because men such as Noam Chomsky, inside the empire, and Gregorio Selser, in Latin America, for years, have denounced the double standard of this scrutinizing and horrifying policy that locates the bad, the ugly, and the dirty living abroad and describes them as outlaws who deserve to be condemned. This comes to light because the Autonomous University of Sinoloa, in Mexico, is presenting a reedited book by Selser (who passed away) entitled The Violation of Human Rights in the United States [La Violacion de los Derechos Humanos en Estados Unidos]. The first edition, which mysteriously vanished, dates back to 1989. It is, however, completely valid today. Many 1989 human rights violators have intensified their actions in the United States today. Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, Moral Majority, Unification Church, Aryan White Resistance, among others, which were denounced by Selser in his book, continue to show no mercy to Blacks, Hispanics, and American Jews. Police violence against minorities, which was brought to the fore in 1991 with the Rodney King case -- a colored man who was brutally beaten by four white policemen -- was repeated in the case of Lorenzo Colston, a black man who was shot in the butt on 29 September 1993 with a Magnum 357 by a white policeman, who was just acquitted. Paradoxically, Colston could be sentenced to 28 years in prison for attacking this policeman. Selser's work summarizes the lengthy chain of discrimination, persecution, hostility against minorities, and ethnic conflicts -- now they are in vogue in Chiapas, the Venezuelan Perija mountain range, the Ecuadoran high plateau, and the Brazilian Amazon region -- like those of the Mohawk Indians in the Sain Regis-Akewasasne Reserve along both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border. There is no doubt that if Don Gregorio were alive today, he would be reporting on Washington's flagrant violation of Article 14 of the Human Rights Declaration that reads: "In case of persecution, every person has the right to request asylum and enjoy it in any country." The Haitians, for example, are locked up in a prison of terror by a U.S. blockade under the UN umbrella. Even the "boat people" who manage to escape the island are detained on the high seas by U.S. marines and turned back to the Raoul Cedras regime. This policy of summary interdiction and repatriation is not only racist but also exposes the cynicism of Washington's so-called "humanitarian policy." The participation of expert John Saxe Fernandez in the presentation of Selser's book, besides being a homage deserved by the master, will give us a closer look at this situation. In recent times, a favorite target of this situation have been Mexicans who aspire to work in the mecca of capitalism. Walls, ditches, and sensors are part of the new humanitarian methods used by border patrols against those trying to win freedom.
