[Ono] I am Ono from YOMIURI SHIMBUN. The issue of North Korea's nuclear development was a major item on the agenda of the Japan-China summit talks. The prime minister himself has expressed deep concern over the issue. Prime Minister, you held a series of meetings with Chinese leaders. I would like to ask you how the Chinese leaders view the present situation regarding North Korea's nuclear development, and how China will exercise its influence on North Korea. Prime Minister, you have said that the Japanese Government will deal with the issue of North Korea's nuclear development within the framework of the Constitution. If the issue is referred to the UN Security Council, and the council decides to impose economic sanctions against North Korea, what sort of actions will Japan take? [Hosokawa] North Korea refused to allow nuclear inspections of certain nuclear sites by the IAEA, and as a result nuclear inspections by the IAEA ended insufficiently; the North-South working-level talks ended with no agreement being reached. I am deeply concerned over this situation. As for economic sanctions against North Korea, I would like to refrain from making any specific comment at this moment. As a general rule, I think if the UN Security Council decides to take some kind of sanctions, Japan for its part will also have to take responsible action. As regards North Korea, China is its most friendly nation, and my understanding is that the role to be played by China is very important and great. [Aoyama] I am Aoyama from KYODO NEWS SERVICE. Prime Minister, I would like to ask you about human rights in China. Speaking at a welcoming banquet hosted by Premier Li Peng, you stressed human rights as a universal value. I assume you made the remark out of consideration for the positions of both China and the United States. Since the issue of human rights affects the livelihood of ordinary Chinese people, I would like to ask you to explain the issue of human rights in China in a manner that we can easily understand. I would also like to ask you if China needs to improve its human rights record. Prime Minister, what do you think of China's position regarding the Untied States' deamnd for improving human rights in China that it is an intervention of China's internal affairs? Prime Minister, you mentioned human rights in the welcoming banquet hosted by Premier Li Peng, but did not raise the human rights issue in China at the official summit talks. Did you not raise the issue out of some consideration? [Hosokawa] You asked me about human rights in China. I would like to answer your question by explaining why I mentioned human rights at the banquet yesterday. Our substantial talks began yesterday. From the outset of the banquet yesterday, substantial talks without protocol have already begun. During the substantial talks, human rights in China was raised for discussion. During the banquet, Premier Li Peng explained to me about what he and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher discussed. In response, I told him that each nation should make its own efforts to deal with the issue of human rights which has universal value, and I do not think China has objection in this respect. You asked about the issue between the United States and China, but I would like to refrain from commenting on it. You asked if violations of human rights exist in China. I think you asked the question with China's recent detention of dissidents in mind. I also would like to refrain from making any comment about that. [Shimada] I am Shimada from NHK. I would like to ask you about China's military expenses. ASEAN member nations and other neighboring countries of China are expressing their concerns about continuously growing Chinese defense budget. China is explaining that the inflation and other matters are the causes of the increase. However, some people point out that Japan's economic cooperation will be consequently linked to the expansion of or be used for defense expenses in China. Do you feel that the concerns were dispelled by the series of meetings? [Hosokawa] The question is about the trend of China's military expansion. Probably, the Chinese military expenses grew due to the current state of its military equipment, inflation rate, and foreign exchange rate. Improvement of military personnel's living standard may be involved in it, too. Replacement of old military equipment was the main cause of the increase. I do not think it will immediately become a threat to Japan. At any rate, the most important thing is that China should make efforts to increase openness of its military programs and this will lead to assuring a sense of security and improving trust in China in the international community. I believe it is very important for China to disclose its military programs to the rest of the world. In this regard, I believe the Chinese leaders and I share the same understanding. The reporter, who asked the question, also pointed out that various types of aid from Japan may be used for military expenses. Regarding the economic cooperation, I have candidly explained to the Chinese leaders that in connection with the outline of its recent official development assistance, the Japanese people are increasingly interested in China's increasing defense expenses. I believe that the Chinese leaders understood this point. [Unidentified Japanese official] Three Japanese reporters have asked questions so far. Now, we will give Chinese reporters a chance to ask questions. Since all the faces look alike, I will ask Japanese reporters not to raise your hands. [Unidentified Chinese reporter] Earlier, you referred to the Sino-Japanese economic ties. Judging from the recent movement, various European and American businesses are rapidly making inroads into the Chinese markets. Also, China is planning to build five subway systems, three bullet train systems, and the Sanxia dam. What are your views of these projects? Can you explain not as a representative of industries but as a politician. Also, can you tell us what kind of relations do you want to establish with China in the future? [Hosokawa] I had discussions with Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji during a lunch with him this afternoon. At that time, Deputy Premier Zhu said that economic power of Japanese industries has become weak. Premier Li Peng pointed out the same thing during a dinner last night. I myself felt the same. I frankly told them what I felt when I arrived in Beijing. There are so many Volkswagens in Beijing. I told them that I felt Japanese companies may not be exerting enough efforts to sell Japanese cars in China and that because of that, Japanese companies may need to do some soul searching. Anyhow, I think Japanese companies need to exert efforts. The amount of trade between Japan and China was about $37.8 billion dollars last year. This is about three times as much as that of 1972. The amount of Sino-Japanese trade changed significantly each year in the last 10 years. on average, however, it increased by more than 10 percent each year. Amount of bilateral trade will exceed $70 billion in 2000 and reach $190 billion in 2010 if the trade between Japan and China continues to grow at the current rate. Deputy Premier Zhu Rongji said today that the amount may become more than that. However, the figures I have just quoted were results of calculations based on the current growth rate. Moreover, the total amount of Japanese investments in China was $5.170 billion as of the end of September last year. More than third of that amount was invested after 1992. This tells us that the scale of economic relations between the two countries is larger than bilateral ties between any other countries in the world. I believe that it will be very important for both countries to maintain such large trade relations. Economic relations between Japan and China have changed from vertical ties [suichoku kankei] of the past to horizontal cooperative ties [suiheiteki kyoryoku kankei]. Both countries' ties with international economy became stronger than before. It is very important for Japan and China to promote cooperation as responsible partners for the world economy. I am confident that the future of economic relations between Japan and China will be bright. [Reporter] I am Sun Dongmin from RENMIN RIBAO. I would like to ask about relations between China and Japan. The purpose of your visit to China is to foster future-oriented relations between the two countries. It is often said that answering the question on how to handle and perceive historical problems between the two countries is the starting point to establish friendly ties. To establish future-oriented relations, how should the two nations handle historial problems? Or how should they make efforts to resolve them? I would like to ask you about these. [Hosokawa] When I took office last August, I disclosed my views on historical problems between the two countries in my inaugural speech to Diet. At my meetings with Premier Li Pend and President Jiang Zemin, I said that I will make further efforts to nurture future-oriented bilateral ties on the basis of self-examination of the past history. In response, the Chinese leaders expressed their approval. I am fully aware that Chinese people still have negative feeling. As I said at the outset, I have been talking about this feeling since last year. [Live coverage ends with the news conference in progress]
