Among the objectives are pushing ahead with the development of Haicang, a district set aside for Taiwan investors, implementing some special policies for free ports and increasing industrial output. As a pilot reform zone, Xiamen has developed an overseas-oriented economy, with manufacturing industries as mainstay. According to the blueprint, Haichang will be constructed into a multi-functional area with urban districts, petrochemical plants and harbor. Technology is being updated in engineering machinery, rubber and pharmaceutical industries. Motorcycles, audio components, containers and glasses, all newly-launched projects, will go into production within the year.
