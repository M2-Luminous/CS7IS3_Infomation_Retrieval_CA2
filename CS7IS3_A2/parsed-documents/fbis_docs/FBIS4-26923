While an apathetic public is prepared to let Legislative Councillors decide the future course of the territory's constitution, an exclusive SUNDAY MORNING POST poll also reveals a majority believe Mr Patten's job here is now done... whatever the outcome of the vote. Government House last night rejected the poll's findings, with spokesman Mike Hanson saying: "The Governor has a very full agenda in the final three years and Mr Patten will be staying here to see it through." But it is bound to be a blow to Mr Patten, who today launches a last-minute campaign to swing wavering legislators round to his political blueprint. The SUNDAY MORNING POST telephone survey of 1,013 people reveals 52 per cent of those polled believe Mr Patten no longer has a useful role to play here. Thirty-two per cent disagree and the remaining 16 per cent are unsure. It also reveals that most people believe China will dismantle whatever electoral model legislators endorse this week, with a small majority saying Beijing is justified in doing so. But the overwhelming impression is of a lack of interest in the final chapter to the two-year-long political reform saga. Few people have any preference for Mr Patten's bill, or the amendments legislators have suggested. Writing in today's Sunday Morning Post, Mr Patten attacks in particular the Liberal Party's "1994 package" -- the only rival electoral model considered to have any chance of success. He accuses the party of putting forward proposals "which, to put it gently, remove some of the uncertainty from the outcome of the democratic process". "There are serious doubts about the fairness of the arrangements proposed by the Liberal Party," he warns. The poll, conducted by Hong Kong Polling and Business Research [PBR] last Wednesday and Thursday, found only 15 per cent of those surveyed were interested in the outcome of this week's debate, while 69 per cent were not, with 16 per cent unsure. The Governor admits, in today's article, that he "detects a weariness" among the public on the refortms issue. Most admit the debate matters for Hong Kong's future: 55 per cent of respondents said it did, while 14 per cent disagreed, with 31 per cent unsure. But few seem to care which political model is voted through. Only 14 per cent want to see the Governor's proposals adopted, while 13 per cent support the Liberal Party's "1994 package", proposing smaller functional constituencies and a four-sector election committee, similar to that contained in the Basic Law. Fifteen per cent backed independent legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing's bill for a fully directly elected Legislative Council, while one per cent supported other models. However they were far outnumbered by the 56 per cent who had no preference. An overwhelming 68 per cent are convinced China will carry out its threat to dismantle the council in 1997, while only 17 per cent disagree, with 15 per cent unsure. More worryingly for the Governor, 36 per cent believed China would be justified in doing so, while 35 per cent disagreed, with 29 per cent unsure. Mr Patten's personal popularity also remained low: with an average score of 5.6 -- measured on a scale from one to 10 -- lower than that recorded in previous polls. "This shows the Governor's popularity has yet to bottom out," said PBR managing director Citi Hung Ching-tin, who conducted the survey, which had a 54 per cent response rate. The Liberal Party last night hit back at the Governor's attack, saying Mr Patten should leave the decision in the hands of Hong Kong people, rather than entering the political fray. "Six million people will still be here after Mr Patten has left." said party spokesman Howard Young, who will propose the "1994 package" in the council on Wednesday. "I think he specifically attacked us because our amendment has a better chance of passing than any other. But he should not be taking sides. He should remain neutral. "We are seeking to protect the stability of Hong Kong. We do not want a complete change in the system in 1995 or 1997," Mr Young added. In other poll findings, eighty-three per cent said Hong Kong needed a human rights commission while 10 per cent objected to its creation, with seven per cent unsure. Sixty-nine per cent said the Government should lift its ban on formal contacts between civil servants and members of the Beijing-appointed Preliminary Working Committee. Only seven per cent wanted to continue the prohibition, while 24 per cent expressed no opinion. Fifty-six per cent said they would vote in September's District Board polls.
