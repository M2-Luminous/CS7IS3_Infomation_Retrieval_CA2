This presupposes creating the possibility and finding a way to include the Serbian [words indistinct] generally solving the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus the agreement is very valuable in terms of the cessation of combat activities and the establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are necessary conditions for making political decisions that would ensure lasting peace in the region. We want to point out in particular that we expect on the basis of the text of the agreement, along with the devising of more efficient mechanisms and instruments, the full protection of human rights, the return of the refugees, and the establishment of a state based on the rule of law. The agreement requires the active and honest engagement of all political factors and the creation of a political consensus to find the best constitutional solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the same time, the outline of the preliminary agreement on establishing a confederation between the Republic of Croatia and the Federation is a significant step and a serious basis for a principled normalization of relations with the neighboring republics, which will at the same time make it possible for Bosnia-Herzegovina to integrate itself more easily into European cultural, economic, and political currents. Therefore, we demand of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina the broadest political consultations and the opportunities for full participation in creating constitutional solutions, reads the public statement by the Social Democratic Party of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
