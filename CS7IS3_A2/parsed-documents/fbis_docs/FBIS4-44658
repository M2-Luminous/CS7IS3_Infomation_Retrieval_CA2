This first section links Frankfurt, Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava and Budapest, as well as branching into Croatia, Slovenia and Austria. Some 3,700 km of cable have been laid, and the final project is expected to cover 14,000 km in all. Trans Europe Line (TEL) is likely to eventually reach as far as Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Moldavia, and talks are currently in progress on a possible extension to Moscow and to Helsinki, according to Deutsche Telekom Director Gerd Tenzer. Around DM700 million is being invested in the project, the consortium for which includes 14 telecommunications companies. Deutsche Telekom first floated the idea of a trans-European cable network in 1990. The various West European telecom companies, such as BT, France Telecom and Belgacom which are involved are not equity partners in the project, but will be buying transmission capacity on the network to cover their needs. "Germany sees itself as the hub of East-West communications in Europe," declared Mr. Tenzer, and explained that there was a need in East Europe for 60 million telephone connections, representing investment totalling US$150 billion. The Deutsche Telekom spokesman also explained that TEL is not a German foreign investment set-up, but that each country was financing infrastructure work on its own territory by means of bank loans or partnership agreements. Deutsche Telekom, on the strength of its wide experience in modernising the former East German networks, is offering its know-how, but will be entitled to transmission rights only for the cable actually laid under German soil. Mr. Tenzer stressed that existing cable systems running into East Europe are completely outdated. Apart from TEL, Deutsche Telekom is also working on some 30 other projects to develop communications sytems in East European countries and is currently in talks with the Russian company Rosttelecom on construction of a digital system to link 50 Russian cities with some 50,000 km of fiber optic cable.
