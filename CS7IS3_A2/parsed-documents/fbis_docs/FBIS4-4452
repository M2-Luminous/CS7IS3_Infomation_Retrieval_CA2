All senior government officials and military leaders in the Senate, including Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak and Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit, gave solid support to the opposition's controversial draft, criticized by government MPs as plagued with errors and "dictatorial" clauses. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai tried to play down the government's embarrassing failure, but calls mounted even within, his coalition for a House dissolution to stop what was described as a dangerous Senate-opposition conspiracy to bring back the "NPKC [National Peacekeeping Council] shadow". Many government MPs, academics and political action groups called the development a "silent coup" by remnants of the National Peacekeeping Council, which seized power in 1991. A bloody pro-democracy uprising the following year disintegrated the junta. The present Senate was appointed by the NPKC and has strongly opposed the Chuan government's attempts to whittle it down in size and reduce senators' powers. The opposition, which took a promilitary stand prior to the 1992 upheaval, proposes maintaining the status quo while slightly increasing the size of the upper House. Prime Minister Chuan said he did not expect any major political change. "I have said all along that changing the Constitution is not the government's duty. It's Parliament's," Chuan said. "The government has only 193 votes, which are not enough (to unilaterally pass government-sponsored amendments)." The joint sitting of Parliament voted 369 in favour of passing the first reading of the opposition's draft bill, against 194 abstentions -- mainly government MPs with a few senators. The meeting then was adjourned, with threats to shoot down the government's eight amending bills today. Chuan said he would not take action against Defence Minister Wichit who supported the opposition's draft. "I have told non-MP government officials that changing the charter is not an administrative matter and they were free to use their judgement," he said. But other government MPs talked about a House dissolution, which some of them believed was imminent. "I don't know what is going to happen next," government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa told reporters. "This is a bad situation." Ominous signs for the government came as soon as Parliament began an extra-ordinary session to deliberate charter reform yesterday morning. The Senate-opposition alliance outvoted government MPs, moving the opposition draft charter to the top of the agenda and sidelining the administration-sponsored amendment bills. A tumultuous debate ensued. Government lawmakers outlined one "flaw" after another in the opposition's proposed charter and attacked Parliament President Marut Bunnak for violating parliamentary rules by not giving Parliament enough time to study the Senators and opposition MPs responded by accusing the government of jumping the gun by assuming that the Senate was not wanted by the public. After the opposition's draft sailed through its first reading, Parliament set up a special panel of 45 members to vet the bill over the next month. Government representatives are outnumbered by opposition MPs and senators on the panel. Parliament adjourned until 10 am today, when it will consider the government bills. The Phalang Tham Party reemphasized its belief that Chuan should dissolve Parliament if charter reform proposals become deadlocked. But sources who attended the party's meeting yesterday said members were of an opinion that Chuan would be unable to justify a House dissolution and should instead resign. "We are proud of the Senate," said Chat Phatthana leader Chatchai Chunhawan. "I think the Senate voted for us because we are sincere with the people." Ratsadon leader Chaiphak Siriwat said the bureaucrat-dominated Senate's move meant the Chuan government had lost control of the bureaucracy and should resign. Solidarity MP Khanin Bunsuwan, a government whip, said the opposition, in its "blind attempt" to topple the coalition, had been "used" by the anti-reform Senate. Senator Somphop Hotrakit warned the government to withdraw the eight bills from Parliament or they would be rejected by senators today. "We, senators, aren't slaves. We have warned the government not to trample on others' dignity," Somphop said. "The military obviously wants its power back," said Phalang Tham spokesman Sutham Saengprathum. "The goverment will have to do something. But only the prime minister can say where the way out is. My duty is only to apply to run in an election." Solidarity leader Uthai Phimchaichon said though the government had lost face, it was the opposition which would later suffer a major political backlash. "The ones who cheat will lose," he said. Opposition leader Praman Adireksan was buoyed and adamant. "You I asked me whether the opposition's draft fulfills the wishes of the people. My answer is you must understand that this Parliament represents the people. Everything passed by this Parliament has passed a democratic process," Praman said. Nine pro-democracy groups deplored yesterday's development and vowed to campaign to publicize the "bad points" of the opposition draft. Some of the movement's leaders suggested Chuan dissolve Parliament but others wanted the charter reform process to be completed.
