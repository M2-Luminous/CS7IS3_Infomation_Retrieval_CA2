FR940118-0-00007 FR940118-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 27 CFR Part 70 [T.D. ATF&hyph;353; CRT&hyph;92&hyph;07] RIN 1512&hyph;AB26 Delegation of Authority To Accept Checks and Waive Penalties AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury. ACTION: Treasury decision, final rule. SUMMARY: Authority delegation. This Treasury decision expands the responsibilities of the ``Chief, Tax Processing Center'' by giving the chief the authority to accept checks and waive penalties. It also removes certain regulations dealing with tax collection activities under 27 CFR part 70 that have been determined to be outside of the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nancy Bryce, Tax Compliance Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226, (202&hyph;927&hyph;8220). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 1, 1972, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) was established by Treasury Department Order No. 120&hyph;01 (formerly Order No. 221). This Order transferred from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the newly-formed Bureau the functions, powers and duties relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives laws. The Order specifically stated that ``all existing activities relating to the collection, processing, depositing, or accounting for taxes *␣*␣* shall continue to be performed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to the extent not now performed by the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division *␣*␣* until the Director shall otherwise provide with the approval of the Secretary.'' ATF assumed responsibility for the collection of taxes imposed by subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code in July 1987, by means of Treasury Decision (T.D.) ATF&hyph;251, and adopted provisions in 27 CFR part 70 similar to those found in 26 CFR part 301 which concerned the deposit and assessment of taxes. The remaining collection functions with respect to taxes administered by ATF were transferred by way of T.D. ATF&hyph;301, at which time ATF adopted regulations similar to those used by IRS relating to the examination, assessment, and collection functions. These provisions are also found in 27 CFR part 70. Under existing regulations, the regional directors (compliance) are authorized to accept checks and waive penalties associated with the collection of taxes administered by ATF. This final rule amends 27 CFR part 70 by vesting the authority to accept checks and waive penalties with the Chief, Tax Processing Center, in addition to the regional directors (compliance), in order to ease the burden on the regional directors (compliance), simplify the waiver process for taxpayers, and permit the more efficient functioning of ATF's tax collection activities. This final rule also removes the following regulations dealing with tax collection activities that have been determined to fall outside of ATF's authority: 27 CFR 70.166(a), 70.201, 70.211, 70.212 and 70.487. Paperwork Reduction Act The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to this final rule because no requirement to collect information is imposed. Regulatory Flexibility Act The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatory flexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this final rule because the agency was not required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law. A copy of this final rule was submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 7805(f). No comments were received. Executive Order 12866 It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action, because (1) it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Administrative Procedures Act Because this final rule is a rule of agency management that merely transfers the authority relating to the acceptance of checks and waiver of penalties, it is unnecessary to issue this Treasury decision with notice and public procedure thereon under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2) and (b)(B) or subject to the effective date limitation in 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
