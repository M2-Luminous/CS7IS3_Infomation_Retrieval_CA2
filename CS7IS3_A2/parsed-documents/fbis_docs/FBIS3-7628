According to data available at the General Bureau of Textile Industry, it grew 30 percent in the first two months of this year or more above the same period last year. The output in 20 odd days of March was 2.4 million metres more than that in the same period last month. That period in March witnessed a 19 percent gain in spinning yarn output. Korea meets the demand of the population for textiles with home products from long ago. With his scientific penetration into the limitation of cotton production and favourable condition of chemical fibre production in the country, the great leader President Kim Il-song put forward a wise policy of building an independent and modern textile industry by correctly combining textile industrial branches using chemical fibre with those using other fibres, with stress laid on the former. And he set forth a policy of developing large scale central industry and medium- and small-sized local industry in parallel and has wisely led the work for its implementation. Today the nation's textile industry has developed into a versatile and mighty industry with chemical fibre, cotton, wool and silk textile sectors, which are equipped with uptodate technology and firmly rely on domestic raw materials. Hundreds of large and minor spinning and textile mills are operating in Pyongyang, Sinuiju, Sariwon, Hamhung and other parts of the country. 30 metres of textiles went to each head of the population already in 1970 in the country where per capita textile output was 14 centimetres before the liberation in August 1945. The annual textile output jumped to more than 800 million metres in the Second Seven-Year Plan period (1978-1984). In the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan (1987-1993), modern and high-speed textile equipment was introduced and new equipment was installed at the Pyongyang textile combine and the Kusong, Sariwon and Kaesong textile mills, laying a solid foundation for sharply increasing textile output.
