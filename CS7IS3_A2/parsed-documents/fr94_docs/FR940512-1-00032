FR940512-1-00032 FR940512-1-00009 50 CFR Part 676 [I.D. 050494A] Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of availability of amendments to fishery management plans and request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS announces that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 30 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and Amendment 34 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) for Secretarial review; comments are requested from the public. Amendment 30 would raise the sablefish Community Development Quota (CDQ) reserve allocation limit from 12 percent to 33 percent. This action is intended to allow total allocation of the sablefish CDQ reserve. DATES: Comments on the FMP amendments must be submitted by July 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on the FMP amendments must be submitted to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, 709 W. 9th, room 453, Juneau, AK 99801 or P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802, Attention: Lori J. Gravel. Copies of the amendments and the regulatory impact review prepared for the amendments are available from the Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Lepore, Fisheries Regulations Specialist, Alaska Region, NMFS, at 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management Council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon reviewing the plan or amendment, immediately publish a notice that the plan or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in determining whether to approve the amendment for implementation. Amendment 30 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI would raise the allocation limit of sablefish community development quota reserve for qualified applicants from 12 percent to 33 percent. The 33 percent limit would ensure that NMFS would be able to allocate 100 percent of the sablefish CDQ reserves to qualified CDQ applicants. Implementation of Amendment 30 would not change the amount of sablefish available for harvest by fishermen participating in the Pacific halibut and sablefish individual fishing quota program. The sablefish CDQ reserve, 20 percent of the annual fixed gear total allowable catch of sablefish for each management area in the BSAI, would be the same under the proposed action as it is under the current FMP text. Amendment 34 to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA would correct the inadvertent inclusion of the CDQ program in that FMP by removing and reserving Section 4.4.1.1.8 Community Development Quotas. Copies of the amendments may be obtained from the Council (see ADDRESSES ). Dated: May 6, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director of Office of Fisheries, Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11495 Filed 5&hyph;9&hyph;94; 2:26 pm] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;P
