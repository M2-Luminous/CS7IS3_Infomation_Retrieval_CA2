His post has been taken by Indrek Kannik, hitherto an adviser to the foreign minister. Evidently Juri Luik will leave his post as head of delegation at the talks with Russia, since, according to the Estonian side, his new post will not allow him to conduct talks with "a mere ambassador of the Russian Federation." Luik and Kannik are recent graduates from the Tartu University Journalism Faculty and members of the Estonian student community; they are 27 years old, and have not yet settled down to married life.
