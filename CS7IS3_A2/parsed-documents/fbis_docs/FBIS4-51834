According to the survey, conducted through Food Agency offices in 47 prefectures in April, the Food Agency reported 430 cases of illegal rice dealings from October to March, a 2.7-fold increase over the year before. Of the total, administrative action was taken against nearly 50 cases. In Japan, rice is kept under government control and is distributed only through licensed wholesalers and retailers. In one case, the Food Agency sought legal action against a rice dealer in Toyama Prefecture for selling rice through unauthorized sales channels, a violation of the Food Control Law. The survey showed that at least two agricultural cooperatives, one in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, and the other in Shizuoka Prefecture, were found to have sold rice outside government-controlled channels. In some 40 cases, the agency issued administrative notices ordering dealers to abide by the law. The survey showed that 14 of 50 retailers and supermarkets across the nation were found to have ignored the agency's instructions to sell bags of mixed domestic and imported rice. Thai rice was found to be unpopular among Japanese consumers, and wholesalers were forced to buy back unsold Thai rice from retailers at a discount rate, the survey showed.
