[Armali] Well, I hope things will not reach that extreme, but we are very likely to reach it if the current situation continues. It must be stressed that the Israeli Government has a particular responsibility for today's events -- this Hebron butchery. First, it is the Israeli Government that settled the colonies everywhere in the occupied territories after 1967 in violation of all international conventions and rights. Second, the Qiryat Arba' colony where the most fanatic settlers live was supported and established by the Israeli Government of that time, i.e., 15 years ago. But the worst is that the same government tolerated the creation of militias among the settlers and the arming of the settlers. We have seen just how some people can stroll with impunity among the civilian population with their weapons. Those conditions made it possible for the perpetrator of the Hebron slaughter to do what he did with the unquestioned complicity of several other people. Because this is absolutely.... [Lambrechts, interrupting] Mr. Armali, I was just about to ask you this question: Do you think this massacre was perpetrated by one man only? [Armali] Absolutely not. When you look at the number of the victims and the injured -- which might exceed 130 people -- it is absolutely certain that only one perpetrator was involved. [Lambrechts] Do you think the Israeli Armed Forces or Government should have disarmed the Israeli militias and settlers? [Armali] Definitely. The Israeli Government must see to it that security is enforced in the occupied territories through its security forces and it should not encourage the creation of militias and armed groups, the result of which can be seen today. On the other hand, the Israeli Government has shown just that it is unable to ensure security in the area of the holy places, be they Christian or Muslim, not only in Hebron but also in Jerusalem. The Hebron mosque, for example, was the responsibility of the Israeli soldiers. [Lambrechts] Yes, one will remember that the Hebron mosque is also an Israeli and Christian religious place. [Armali] You are right. After today's sad events, the whole international community must be concerned about the [security of] other holy places in the Palestine. [Lambrechts] Mr. Armali, do you -- as PLO representative to Belgium -- think the peace negotiations with Israel are in jeopardy. Are you ready to sit down at the same table as Mr. Rabin? [Armali] This is one of the most serious threats since the signing of the 13 December peace accord and the hopes for peace that it brought to both populations -- Palestinians and Jews. Unfortunately, since that historic date, all the deadlines set in the Oslo agreements have not been met. Furthermore, the Israeli prime minister repeated over and over again that there is no sacred date. This has increased the frustration among the Palestinian public. And today 25 February, the Palestinians are being repressed still by the Israeli Armed Forces. Over 11,000 Palestinians are detained still in Israeli prisons and the date for the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho is still not known. Things must move along quickly. I must stress this is the last chance for the peace process to continue. As we know, the U.S. Administration has decided -- with the approval of Mr. 'Arafat and Mr. Rabin -- to convene.... [Lambrechst, interrupting] We will raise this issue in a few seconds. But the PLO demands -- and this is important to mention -- international protection in the occupied territories. The possible presence of UN troops or U.S. or British soldiers has even been envisaged. Does it sound realistic to you? [Armali] Yes, of course. Because these territories are occupied, the UN Security Council, which is expected to meet at any time now, will have to examine the issue and decide to send U.S., European, or other international troops to protect the Palestinian population because it is not clear whether the Israeli Government really wants to make decisions to disarm the settlers. We have no other option left. As long as the settlers are armed, today's tragic events can happen again. And it could give a fatal blow to any hope for peace. In order to secure this peace process that was initiated with so much difficulty, a decision must be made as quickly as possible to ensure the protection of the Palestinian civilian population which is still under occupation. [passage omitted] [Lambrechts] Mr. Armali, what do you specifically expect from the U.S. side? [Armali] What we always have requested from Washington: A greater presence and a more active role in the ongoing negotiations. [Lambrechts] Does President Clinton's proposal go in the right direction? [Armali] It was accepted by the PLO and I hope that today's tragedy will convince many people -- mainly on the Israeli side -- that the deadlines set [in the peace negotiation process] must be pushed forward and that the withdrawal from the occupied territories is necessary. This is a unanimous request from the international community, so that the Palestinians can take their destiny in hand and continue to serenely negotiate this final and long-lasting peace for which we all long. [Lambrechst] Thank you for being our guest tonight Mr. Armali.
