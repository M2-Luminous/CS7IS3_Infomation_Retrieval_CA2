The meeting took place yesterday -- it started in the Kremlin and finished up in a presidential city residence. The fact that the president decided to personally check out the views of the industrial bosses shows that Yeltsin's displeasure with the progress of reform has really reached a critical point. More than a dozen industrialists were invited to attend the meeting. According to information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY from the presidential press service, they included Vladimir Kadannikov, general director of the AvtoVAZ car plant; Aleksandr Dondukov, general director of the Yakovlev Design Bureau; and Aleksey Sharkov, general director of the Uraltransmash plant. Although initially it was expected that the Russian government would be represented at the level of deputy prime ministers, the premier himself arrived in the Kremlin. The meeting focussed on three main subjects: centralized credits, mutual nonpayments, and bankruptcies. Boris Yeltsin started the conversation by stating that the political situation in Russia is getting more stable and that normal conditions for investment have already been created. These words, however, did not elicit great enthusiasm in the audience. The Russian industry leaders who have managed to live through reform were asked to familiarize themselves with eight draft edicts on "improving economic health" that the president is going to sign in the near future. The edicts deal with what Boris Yeltsin sees as the three most important problems of the Russian economy. In addition, KOMMERSANT-DAILY learned, they also cover matters concerning relations between the president and the government. Initially, the president planned to sign one blanket edict as early as 19 May, but after the meeting with Viktor Chernomyrdin he decided to split it into a number of more specific documents. Presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told journalists even before the meeting began that Boris Yeltsin opposes centralized credits: "Given on a large scale, they lead to inflation." According to Kostikov, Yeltsin also believes that bankruptcies cannot be avoided altogether because supporting the enterprises that are "obviously unviable would be to burdensome for the state." How the edicts "ran by" the industrialists is not known yet. It is clear, however, that the president's turning to them for advice in itself, which does not look like a simple political gesture (otherwise a statement on its results would certainly have been adopted), proves that Yeltsin is seriously dissatisfied with the government's performance, although excluding Viktor Chernomyrdin personally, Kostikov said. Commentary by the Economic Policy Department The last official meeting Boris Yeltsin held with Russian industrialists took place in the fall of 1991. At the time, on the eve of price liberalization and a drastic change in economic policy, the president's guests included members of the Industrial Union deputy faction, which was made for the most part of state enterprise directors. KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondents who attended the largely symbolical meeting noted how confidently the president felt among economic managers, who demonstrated to him their political conformism, apparently the last trump card of the old economic elite that retained some vestiges of political clout thanks to the existence of the Congress of People's Deputies. At the end of 1991, the president and Yegor Gaydar, a rising political star, needed to insure themselves against resistance from directors when discussing what was then the main question of economic policy: granting the president extra powers to carry out economic reform. Without them, the Gaydar team's plans could not be put into practice. Having won the confidence of provincial economic managers, Yeltsin subsequently also received the requisite powers at the Fifth Congress. What is it that the president and his new star, Viktor Chernomyrdin, are trying to insure themselves against this time around? Evidently, the key question for them is post-voucher privatization and the related tide of bankruptcies that will engulf the largest manufacturing enterprises in the first place. Without drastic layoffs they do not stand any chance of surviving. In this situation, the president would like to make the directors his allies, not an enemy who, as ZIL director Yevgeniy Brakov once remarked, are ready "to bring people onto the streets under any banner." Both the Kremlin and the White House fear that this could happen once the edicts on resolving the nonpayment crisis, described by spokesmen for the authorities as "a tough, imperative document," go into force. After all, all talk by the country's leaders with the economic elite about "boosting investment activity," taxation policy, and customs regimes boils down to one simple business principle: "Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours."
