ACTION: Reopening of comment period on proposed rule; notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: On October 22, 1993 (58 FR 54702), EPA published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that would revise the National Contingency Plan (NCP) consistent with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA). The public comment period for the NPRM ended December 20, 1993. EPA received several letters requesting a comment period extension. To accommodate these requests and obtain additional input concerning the NPRM, EPA will hold a public meeting at which interested parties may present their concerns for EPA's consideration in finalizing the NCP. EPA is today reopening the comment period until the day of that meeting. DATES: EPA must receive all comments on or before January 14, 1994. The public meeting will be held on January 14, 1994, from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate to Emergency Response Division, Attn: Superfund Docket Clerk, Docket Number NCP&hyph;R2/A, Superfund Docket, room M2427, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. The meeting will be held in EPA's Region 10 office, located at 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Morris, Emergency Response Division (5202G), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460, (703) 603&hyph;9053. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Public Meeting Meeting attendees should send a letter by telephone facsimile by Monday, January 10, 1994, stating attendees' names, addresses, affiliation, and telephone numbers, to Richard Norris, EPA Emergency Response Division, at (703) 603&hyph;9116. Those who do not have a facsimile machine may telephone (703) 603&hyph;9074 and leave a message containing the information requested above. Attendees should submit in writing any additional comments they wish to add to the public record in the event that time does not allow for all comments to be presented orally. Additional written comments may also be submitted to the EPA docket, if commenters do not wish to attend the public meeting. Written comments should be submitted in triplicate either at the public meeting or to: Emergency Response Division, Attn: Superfund Docket Clerk, Docket Number NCP&hyph;R2/A, Superfund Docket, room M2427, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Summary of Proposed Rule The proposed revisions (58 FR 54702) include the creation of Area Committees and Area Contingency Plans; a National Response Unit to assist in coordinating spill removal resources, personnel, and equipment; and U.S. Coast Guard District Response Groups to assist On-Scene Coordinators and maintain Coast Guard response equipment. In addition, the NPRM includes criteria and procedures for responding to discharges that result in substantial threats to public health or welfare; procedures and standards for preventing, mitigating, and removing worst case discharges; and a new provision addressing spills of national significance. EPA also proposed to revise subpart J of the NCP, which provides for a Product Schedule that lists dispersants, bioremediation agents, and other miscellaneous oil spill control substances. The subpart J revisions would reflect new dispersant effectiveness testing and acceptability criteria. Dated: December 29, 1993. Elliott P. Laws, Assistant Administrator.
