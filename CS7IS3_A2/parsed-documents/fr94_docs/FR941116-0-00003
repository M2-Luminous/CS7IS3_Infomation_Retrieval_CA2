FR941116-0-00003 FR941116-0-00001 As a result, the Board's General Counsel will play the same important enforcement role for Architect of the Capitol employees as he does for GAO employees. Charges of discrimination or retaliation will initially be filed with and investigated by the Board's General Counsel. See §29.8 below. If the General Counsel concludes that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the employee's rights have been violated, the General Counsel will represent the individual before the Board, unless the individual elects not to be represented by the General Counsel. §29.9(d). This access to professional representation is a significant procedural benefit. The General Counsel is not, however, a ``gatekeeper'' who can limit an employee's right to present his or her case to the Board. If the General Counsel does not find reasonable grounds to believe that there has been discrimination or retaliation, the employee may still pursue the matter before the Board on his or her own or with private counsel. Under the procedures applicable to GAO, the Board's General Counsel may also initiate proceedings in his or her own name before the Board seeking corrective action, disciplinary action, or a stay of a personnel action, where the General Counsel concludes that there is reason to believe that a prohibited personnel practice (including prohibited discrimination) is occurring or has occurred. See, 4 CFR Part 28, Subpart G. The Board's General Counsel will also have this same enforcement authority with respect to alleged discriminatory practices within the Architect of the Capitol. See, §29.12 below. Some other notable features of the new part 29 are summarized below: 1. Definition of ``Employee of the Architect of the Capitol'' (§29.2): The term ``employee of the Architect of the Capitol'' is specifically defined in the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act. See, Pub. L. 103&hyph;283, sec. 312(e)(1)(A). That definition is restated in the Board's regulations. It includes all employees of the Architect of the Capitol, the Botanic Garden, and the Senate restaurants. It does not include House of Representatives garage or parking lot attendants. ``Employee'' encompasses not only current employees, but also applicants for employment and former employees when certain specified requirements are met. Every time the term ``employee of the Architect of the Capitol'' or ``employee'' is used in the regulations, it includes all the individuals covered by the definition in §29.2. 2. Description of the Board's jurisdiction over claims of retaliation (§29.3(b)): The Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act prohibits ``intimidation of, or reprisal against,'' any employee because of the exercise of a right under the Act. See, Pub. L. 103&hyph;283, sec. 312(e)(2)(B). In order to assist employees in knowing what actions are covered by this term, the regulation enumerates four particular kinds of retaliation claims that may be brought before the Board. This list is patterned after the language of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2000e&hyph;3. Using Title VII as a model is appropriate because the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act itself refers to Title VII to provide a definition of what constitutes unlawful discrimination. See, sec. 312(e)(2)(A). 3. Exhaustion of administrative remedies (§29.6): The Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act states that an employee may not file a charge with the Board until that employee has first filed a complaint of discrimination with the Architect of the Capitol and exhausted the remedies provided by the Architect for the resolution of such complaints. Public Law 103&hyph;283, sec. 312(e)(3)(A). The Board's regulations define what constitutes exhaustion of those remedies. The Board will consider the Architect's internal procedures to be exhausted when either of the following occurs: (a) The employee receives a final decision on his or her complaint; or (b) 120 days have passed without the issuance of a final decision by the Architect. This latter provision is important to ensure that employees have a meaningful right to present their claims to the Board, while witness memories are still fresh and effective relief can be fashioned. The same provision is contained in the Board's regulations applicable to GAO employees. See, 4 CFR 28.98(b)(2). It is also comparable to the procedures followed in the executive branch for appeals of discrimination claims. See, 5 CFR 1201.154(b)(2); 29 CFR 1614.108(f). The Board appreciates, however, that this provision may work a hardship for complaints that are already pending before the Architect of the Capitol on the date that these interim regulations are adopted. For such pending cases, it may be difficult for the Architect to issue a decision within 120 days because it had no prior notice that the Board would consider administrative remedies exhausted after that point. To ameliorate this problem, the Board is adopting a special rule applicable only to charges filed with the Board's General Counsel prior to March 1, 1995. Such charges may still be filed with the Board's General Counsel after the passage of 120 days if no final decision has been issued by the Architect of the Capitol. However, once the charge is filed, the Architect may, upon request, obtain a deferral of proceedings on the charge for up to 60 days in order to permit the Architect to issue a final decision on the claim. This special rule will not apply to charges filed with the General Counsel after March 1, 1995, and will not be included in the Board's final rules. 4. Class Actions (§§29.6 and 29.8): These regulations permit an employee to file a charge as representative of a class of employees of the Architect of the Capitol. GAO employees currently enjoy this right, as do executive branch employees. See, 4 CFR 28.97; 29 CFR 1614.204. In interpreting the ban on discrimination in Federal employment contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia held that executive branch agencies must accept class complaints and provide class relief in appropriate circumstances. Barrett v. U.S. Civil Service Commission, 69 F.R.D. 544 (D.D.C. 1975). A similar interpretation of the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act is justified, as it essentially extends the Title VII ban on discrimination to the Architect of the Capitol.
