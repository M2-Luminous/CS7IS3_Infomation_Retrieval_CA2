This unit of 1,100 men is to relieve the Canadian soldiers currently in the area. The battalion may be able to leave as early as mid-February. The Dutch Government yesterday received a further request from the United Nations to send the 1,100 Dutchmen to Bosnia. The soldiers' job will be to protect the population in the Muslim enclaves and ensure the safe transport of humanitarian aid. An earlier mission by Dutch quartermasters failed when the Bosnian Serbs refused their entry. The Dutch battalion had been due to leave for Bosnia at the beginning of the year. Military circles say the reason the Dutch are now being allowed in is due to NATO's threat to use air strikes to ensure the relief of the Canadians. At the Defense Ministry, however, they are not so sure Bosnia's Serb fighters are not still going to block the work of the quartermasters or the arrival of the battalion, despite the fact that leaders Karadzic and General Mladic have now agreed to the relief of the Canadians by the Dutch. The quartermasters need 10 days in order to inspect locations for the encampment of the men in the reinforced battalion. The Dutch unit consists of 800 men from the light mobile brigade and 300 support troops. The light mobile brigade has armored vehicles with heavy machine guns, mortars, and TOW [antitank missiles] and Dragon antitank rockets. The mandate is to return fire in self-defense. Ter Beek described this as `robust' action in the Dutch Parliament. The arrival of the light mobile brigade will bring the number of Dutch soldiers in and around the former Yugoslavia to almost 3,000.
