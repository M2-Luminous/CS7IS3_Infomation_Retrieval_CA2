The country spent 2.700 billion pesos, equal to the dollar, to subsidize this field in the sugar cane and non-sugar cane sectors that underwent transformations at the end of 1993, when state farms where converted to cooperatives. During a news conference, the secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation maintained that in the past quarter the tobacco sector surpassed its production goal in the manufacture of tobacco for export by 125 percent. Meanwhile, tourism grew by 30 percent. Regarding the parliamentary debate on the reorganization of internal finances announced for 1 May, he indicated that the measures to be taken will be political and not technocratic. Ross said that these decisions cannot be made behind the workers' backs given their affect on millions of people and the benefits and sacrifices that almost the entire nation will have to make. He indicated that a great deal of suggestions were made during the more than 80,000 meetings recently held throughout the nation and in which more than 3 million workers participated. Ross admitted there were different points of view and different criteria for some issues, but everything was taken into consideration during the labor union debates, called parliaments in the workplace. The workers' meetings began to show results, according to Ross, when decisions were applied on efficient productivity and savings that have immediate effects on the economy. For Ross, this is part of a group of measures implemented in the past months, such as the turnover of thousands of hectares of state-owned lands to workers for the organization of Basic Productive Cooperation Units. The creation of such units was of the greatest political and social scope as it changes production and distribution relationships established since the triumph of the Revolution in 1959 and which have benefited more than 1.1 million workers, he added.
