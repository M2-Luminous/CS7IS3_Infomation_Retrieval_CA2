The Spanish Government decided in December to reduce its aid to Equatorial Guinea by half and cancel all its assistance programs to the official bodies, notably aid to the radio and television and training scholarships to the Armed Forces following the expulsion of Diego Sanchez Bustamante, Spanish consul general in Bata, the country's second most important city. Mr. Bustamante was accused by the Equatorial Guinean authorities of "interfering in the country's internal affairs." After being recalled for consultations, the ambassador returned to Malabo on 1 January with a message from his government to President Teodoro Obiang Nguema. The contents of the message were not revealed, the radio explained. Speaking before the Equatorial Guinean press after an audience with the head of state, the Spanish diplomat stressed that his country wants to maintain relations with Equatorial Guinea but that the latter must consider Spain's stand on the security of its citizens in the country, human rights, and the democratic process in Equatorial Guinea.
