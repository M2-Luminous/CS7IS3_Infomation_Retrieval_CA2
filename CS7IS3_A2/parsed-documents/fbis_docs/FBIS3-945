A little before 1000, President Nicephore Soglo of Benin, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, Abdou Diouf of Senegal, Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali met on the ninth floor of the Central Bank of West African States building around the current chairman of the Union, Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore. Cote d'Ivoire is represented at the summit by Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan, and Togo is represented by Economic and Finance Minister Doh Franck Fianyo. Since mid-morning, the heads of state of the UEMOA are discussing the new body which will be charged with channeling the aspirations for integrated development of the seven member countries. Two months after the CFA franc devaluation, it is necessary to merge the experiences of all the states and to establish some general code of conduct. The tension strongly expressed by various parties must be interpreted as the natural expression of the general disarray which followed the Dakar measure. According to Nicephore Soglo, in a memorandum making the rounds in the corridors of the conference, to cope with this measure each state must be ready to give the full measure of its national intellect, its work, its courage, its self-denial, and its high sense of sacrifice. The combination of efforts at the national level goes hand-in-hand with the contribution of development partners. This explains the presence of French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, the representatives of the World Bank, and the IMF. The issues relating to backup measures will be reviewed. UEMOA states will ask their Western partners to accelerate the release of funds under the structural adjustment facility. From Paris, in particular, the UEMOA states would like to know to what extent the promised annulation of the debt will be effective. Today, it is difficult to prejudge the results of the Ouagadougou meeting but a collective option will be affirmed: the need to work individually and collectively to reinforce the economic fabric. This is how the interministerial council sees the light at end of the tunnel for the member states. Soumaila Cisse, the Malian minister of finance and economy, spoke about the devaluation. [Begin Cisse recording] Our heads of state have signed in an absolutely responsible manner and the finance ministers must assume responsibility for the devaluation and take the corrective measures required. We have a duty to communicate and explain to our workers and all the social strata of the population so that things turn out well. This is what I refer to as assuming responsibility. Assuming responsiblity means having all the people behind the leaders of the African states in order to take up the challenge that has been given to us. At the time when other zones are meeting -- the European Community, the North American Free Trade Area, bringing together the United States, Canada and Mexico -- we must unite and reinforce our cohesion, or else there will be no future. This is what I mean by assuming responsibility for our situation. [end recording]
