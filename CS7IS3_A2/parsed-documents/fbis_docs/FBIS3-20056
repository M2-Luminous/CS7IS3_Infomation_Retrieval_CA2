The dispersal of many gatherings by the police was largely peaceful. In the evening, city and the police spokesmen told journalists that a total of 40 persons were arrested. Apart from two, whose arrests were not because of the demonstration, they have been released again. Kurds in Germany and abroad had called for a mourning march for two women who had burned themselves in Mannheim last Monday in protest at the oppression of their people in Turkey. In the evening, Mayor Gerhard Widder (Social Democratic Party of Germany) said that the city had banned the demonstrations because the safety of citizens and demonstrators had not been guaranteed. During strict checks, which the police had instituted along all major roads leading into Mannheim in the morning, arriving Kurds had been told so. According to the latest experiences, a high potential of violence and new self-immolations had to be expected. Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social Democratic Party of Germany) stressed that it was expected that up to 40,000 Kurds would answer the call. Therefore, it had been agreed with the other laender that checks would be held and Kurds recognized as participants in the banned demonstration would be prevented from continuing on their way. This led to far fewer persons coming than had been feared. The Federal Border Police (BGS) had stopped the entry of Kurds at the borders, such as at the three-country corner near Aachen. Police pointed out that, during the checks, more than 250 knives, machetes, cudgels, and blank-cartridge pistols were seized. This shows that acts of violence would have been possible. The tactic of dispersing gatherings for demonstrations, but countering escalations led to the fact that no one was injured and the only material damage caused was to two cars. The strong presence of the approximately 2,700 officials of the BGS and police from Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate, and Bavaria was also quite impressive. The police stated that, despite the strict checks and the many people turned back, as of noon, Kurds -- 10,000 in the end -- kept entering Mannheim. Slogans were repeatedly shouted against the Turkish Government, but also against the German Government. Some people in the crowd were arrested. Batons were not used. In the afternoon, the Kurds withdrew to the edge of the city, from where they departed in the evening, after those arrested had been released and a minute of silence had been observed.
