This is a political movement that unites hundreds of thousands of citizens. A whole number of political organizations have united within it. We interviewed UGC General Secretary Zurab Zhvania. [Khidashvili] The union was already created some time ago. What report will the UGC general secretary deliver at the congress? [Zhvania] It has been three months since the UGC was founded in the large hall of the Philharmonic building [Tbilisi]. This initial period witnessed the growth of the organization. Our union was created on the basis of that charge that existed in Georgian society, a charge that was set off with the desire to prevent that catastrophe that was really threatening our state and society. However, a serious organization would not have been able to exist on emotions alone. We can say today that we have managed to create solid structures around these emotions, not only in Tbilisi but throughout Georgia. I think that interesting people have joined the union and a single and coordinated nucleus has emerged. Those persons have also emerged who will be unable to fit into the mainstream of our organization. However, at the same time, people with different political experience have united and they now represent a single unified organization. [Khidashvili] The union has an organized structure and all those qualities or features that are characteristic of a ruling party. Does the union have its own ideology? [Zhvania] I would like to emphasize that the UGC is not an organization based on a single specific ideology. If we use traditional European terminology, we could be called a political movement more than a party. This means that our doors are open to everyone who wants to cooperate with us. At the same time, we have managed to create a solid political nucleus that will become even stronger in the future. It is precisely this nucleus that ensures the strength and stability of the organization. If it is possible to define our ideology in one word, it is statehood. Our ideology -- our main aim -- is to create a solid, strong state that will ensure the safety and well being of each citizen and the prospects for his free development. We base ourselves most closely on traditional liberalism, although our ideology is broader than this. [Khidashvili] Your opponents assert that the UGC has assumed the functions of an executive body. What do you say? [Zhvania] It would be difficult for me to cite an example of the UGC fulfilling the functions of an executive body. If our opponents mean that active members of the union are trying to contribute toward resolving the bread problem and exposing sabotage in the power engineering complex, and, in general, are trying not to view in a passive manner and joke about the destruction of the country but are personally making their small contribution to the common cause so that our lives can at least be a little better, I do not think this constitutes gross interference in the functions of the executive body. This can be called more civic responsibility. We are a union of citizens and the main concern of our members is civic responsibility before society and the state. This probably should not be a subject for discussion. There are people who believe that our existence today is something to joke about. Others believe it is better today to make one's own contribution to improving the situation. However, everything will probably be decided by the people. [Khidashvili] The politician Zurab Zhvania hails from the "Greens." What qualitative links are there between the "Greens" and the UGC? [Zhvania] I remain a Green. However, I must say frankly that the situation that has prevailed in Georgia these last two years has made it practically impossible to resolve the serious economic problems. It is superfluous to speak about preserving forests and producing environmentally friendly goods in a society where complete chaos reigns and where a person's life means nothing. This is precisely the reason why we have united with people from other political persuasions: To create a space where Greens, Christian- Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, and so forth can freely exist. There is today no space in Georgia for civic life. Our union will create this space. [Khidashvili] You pointed out at a recent news conference that there are many issues in the government's policy with which you disagree. What precisely are these issues? [Zhvania] These would make a very long list. It is more difficult to list the issues on which we do agree. I personally find the existing attitude to economic reform unacceptable. I can state directly that the governing bodies are committing sabotage; they are disregarding every sensible initiative. Moreover, a real war has been declared against private structures and private business, which is threatening us with catastrophe. I find unacceptable the view that we can do nothing to save the coupon and, therefore, we have to enter the ruble zone. Both I and our economic experts can see large resources that will enable us to strengthen the coupon. It, indeed, cannot become a hard currency. However, we believe that it can be stabilized on condition, first and foremost, that the problem of privatization is resolved and many other issues are quickly settled. The main thing that I find unacceptable is the corruption that characterizes our government. I firmly believe that the time will soon come when all will be made to answer for "incorrectly" drawing up contracts for the sale of wheat or gasoline, for the "incorrect" distribution of humanitarian aid, and so forth. Let no one think that they will be able to hold onto the property that they have acquired through [misusing] their position. [Khidashvili] Do the UGC and you yourself support the reformist Cabinet of Ministers and, in general, the so-called "shock therapy" for the economy? [Zhvania] They often joke here in Georgia that this period is a shock, never mind any kind of therapies. It is difficult not to agree with the public on this score. Our economy really is in need of therapy and it would be good if it were to become something necessary and not something akin to surgical intervention. The main thing is that a united team should enter the government, each of whose members will act by proceeding from a single position and within the framework of a common program. Such a team will not appear before the elections. Therefore, our union's position is as follows: The most odious members should leave the government prior to the elections and the government should become more respectable, although a reform-minded team can realistically come to power only after the elections. [Khidashvili] Eduard Shevardnadze is the chairman of the UGC. Does this factor have symbolic importance or does it signify full support for the head of state's policies? [Zhvania] This is not a symbolic factor. I want to emphasize that we do not view Eduard Shevardnadze as the head of state; he is our political leader, a person who is creating new political traditions in Georgia and forming the principles of a new moral pragmatic policy. It is from this angle that the union's members view Eduard Shevardnadze as a politician. We are convinced that he will fulfill a unique role in the history of Georgia. [Khidashvili] Will the UGC participate in the future elections and how will its program differ from those of the other parties? [Zhvania] Of course, it will take part. As for its program, it will be formed on the basis of that document that will be adopted at our congress. There will probably be serious discussions on individual issues in this program. We will adopt a basic document on whose basis all other documents will be formed, including the election program.
