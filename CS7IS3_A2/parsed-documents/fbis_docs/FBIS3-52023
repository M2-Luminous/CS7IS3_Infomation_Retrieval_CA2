The demonstrators expressed their support for the resolutions issued by the so-called "Congress of the Northern Citizens' Group" [Congres del Colectivo de Ciudadanos del Norte] recommending a military tribunal assume power. In its 26 January session, the Chamber of Deputies did not discuss the resolution proposed by the northern citizens group. They thought it was "irrelevant" and instead announced the Chamber is working on a proposal asking President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, currently in exile in Washington, to appoint a prime minister. Aristide was overthrown on 30 September 1991 by a group of military officers headed by General Raoul Cedras. Following a traditional practice begun in the days of Francois Duvalier's dictatorship, the demonstrators were transported in vehicles from distant parts of the country to the capital. This time, the groups traveled in state-owned buses. Commenting on the demonstration, Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde said the fact that Haitians cannot reach an agreement to end the crisis "is sad." Monde added, "we will never yield under pressure." Meanwhile, deputies have asked the leaders of the demonstration to assume their responsibility to prevent threats against the parliament. The demonstrators demanded parliament be closed because, according to them, "it is not complying with its mission."
