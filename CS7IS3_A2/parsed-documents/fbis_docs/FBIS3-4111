Years of robust growth in air travel have created a shortage not only of pilots and air controllers, but of aviation fuel. Indeed, last year airports in a dozen cities including Fuzhou, Harbin and Chongqing had to restrict fuel use, forcing flights to be delayed or cancelled. Now, major construction of refueling facilities is under way across China to boost aviation fuel supply and shipping capacity. And overseas oil investors, eager to pry open the lucrative Chinese aviation fuel market, will take an active part. To accomplish this the China Aviation Oil Supply Corp (CAOSC), the country's sole supplier of fuel, is preparing to turn three of its seven regional branches into Sino-foreign joint ventures. Letters of intent were agreed on late last year for setting up joint ventures with British Petroleum in North China, France's ELF in East China, and the Netherlands' Vitol in Central and South China. The three regional branches, which account for 80 per cent of the corporation's profits and half of its employees, are responsible for supplying fuel to China's busiest air traffic areas. Bai Zhijian, president of CAOSC told Business Weekly that poor refueling capacity and congested railway transport have crimped the supply of aviation oil, posing more obstacles to speedy development of civil aviation. The CAOSC's bold strategy is imperative if the huge amount of capital needed to modernize the supply and storage system is to be raised, Bai said. Foreign know-how and managerial skills will also help make the corporation more competitive, he said. "The co-operation projects will enter the substantive stage if we get final State approval," Bai said without elaboration. But he did say that Chinese will control the ventures' tangible and intangible assets like market access and good will while the foreign firms will put up cash but will hold smaller stakes. CAOSC is seeking 4 billion yuan ($460 million) from investors to upgrade old refueling equipment and build new systems throughout China by the turn of the century. Last year, the completion of nine oil depots, like the one at Beijing Capital Airport, augmented storage capacity by one-third to 840,000 cubic metres. New oil pipelines with a total length of 37 kilometres were also put into service. "But the current storage capacity is still far short of demand," Bai stressed. So high on this year's schedule is construction of bases in Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beihai to handle imported fuel, which is surging in to fill the gap in domestic supplies. Each base will consist of oil jetties, pipelines and depots, and is tailored for the long-term needs of the country's northern, eastern, southern and southwestern regions, respectively. Bai said that work on the Tianjin base will begin first, in June. It will involve building a 140,000-cubic metre oil transfer farm in Tianjin Harbour, burying a 52-kilometre pipeline to the oil depot at Tianjin Airport, and laying another 132 kilometre pipeline to Beijing Capital Airport.
