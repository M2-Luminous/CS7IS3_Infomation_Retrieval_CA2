FR940412-0-00029 FR940412-0-00006 The International Mass Retail Association, the National Grocers Association, the Food Marketing Association, the Building Owners and Managers Association International, a regional commercial real estate association, 37 State and local government agencies, and four businesses expressed concern that detectable warnings would pose a tripping hazard to other pedestrians and supported the suspension. Commenters who opposed the suspension stated that concerns about the safety of others are speculative and unsubstantiated. Several manufacturers commented that there have been no reported incidents of trips or falls attributable to their products. A bank and a retail store chain stated that they had installed detectable warnings on curb ramps at their sites and had received complaints from wheelchair users and elderly customers. Only one commenter, a local school district, reported that an adult and some students had tripped while running over a curb ramp with detectable warnings. The Federal Transit Administration and Project ACTION of the National Easter Seal Society have recently sponsored a research project on detectable warnings which among other things tested detectable warnings on curb ramps for safety and negotiability by persons with mobility impairments. Bentzen, B.L., Nolin, T.L., Easton, R.D., and Desmarais, L., Detectable Warning Surfaces: Detectability by Individuals with Visual Impairments, and Safety and Negotiability for Individuals with Physical Impairments, Cambridge, MA: Transportation Systems Center (1993). The study tested a variety of detectable warning materials with 40 persons having a wide range of physical disabilities. The participants included 15 persons who use mobility aids with wheels (power and manual wheelchairs, and three- and four-wheeled scooters); 18 persons who use mobility aids with tips (canes, crutches and walkers); and seven persons who do not use any mobility aid. The participants travelled up and down ramps that were six feet long and four feet wide with a 1:12 slope, the maximum slope permitted by ADAAG for new construction. Detectable warnings were installed on the entire six foot length of the ramps. For comparison, participants also travelled up and down a brushed concrete ramp of the same dimensions. Subjective and objective measurements were collected. Of the 40 participants, the objective data showed that: •14 participants (35%) exhibited no difficulty negotiating the ramp; •19 participants (47.5%) exhibited few difficulties; and •7 participants (17.5%) exhibited numerous difficulties. The latter group included four persons who used manual wheelchairs; two persons who used walkers with wheels (rollators); and one person who wore leg braces and used a quad cane. A physical therapist who observed the participants reported that persons using no mobility aids performed consistently well on all the ramps with detectable warnings and that even those with protheses or braces showed good negotiability. Persons using power wheelchairs, and three- and four-wheeled scooters demonstrated few, if any difficulties, on any of the ramps with detectable warnings. However, four of the five manual wheelchair users exhibited numerous difficulties negotiating the ramps with detectable warnings, including exerting additional effort to go up the ramps, and the small, narrow front wheels getting caught in the groves between the domes. Participants using canes, crutches, or walkers were observed to have the most difficulties on the ramps with detectable warnings. Mobility aids with small tips (canes or walkers) appeared to get caught between the domes or lay on an angle between the grove and the dome, causing the participant to feel less stable. Participants who used crutches with larger tips appeared more safe and generally negotiated the ramps with detectable warnings better than those who used canes or walkers. The research project report recommended that ``given even the moderately increased level of difficulty and decrease in safety which detectable warnings on slopes pose for persons with physical disabilities, it is desirable to limit the width of detectable warnings to no more than that required to provide an effective warning for persons with visual impairments.'' The report suggested that a standard width of 24, 30 or 36 inches be established for detectable warning surfaces and indicated that such widths would provide an effective stopping distance for 90 to 95% of blind persons and persons with low vision. Durability, Maintainability, and Cost Many of the commenters who supported suspending the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools also expressed concern about the durability and maintainability of detectable warning materials, especially under certain climatic conditions (e.g., snow and ice, and the need for snow and ice removal). One commenter stated that a member of the ANSI A117 Committee recently visited the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system and observed a 50 to 60% ``failure rate'' with the corners of the detectable warning titles ``turning up and creating tripping hazards.'' The commenter also cited a magazine article on the use of detectable warnings in Japan as evidence that they are prone to breakage and deterioration. Manufacturers of various detectable warning materials responded with information about their products. Carsonite International, the manufacturer of the detectable warning materials used in the BART system, stated that in its ten years of experience, it is rare that the product or the adhesive fails. Where loosening or delamination has occurred, it was due to a failure to properly prepare the substrate. Carsonite International also submitted a letter from BART stating that annual costs for maintaining the detectable warnings at its 34 stations are $10,800 for materials and 8,160 hours of labor.
