"b) The city of Buenos Aires will be granted a special constitutional status that will recognize its autonomy and its own legislative and jurisdictional powers." (From the Basic Points of Agreement of the pact signed in Olivos by President Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin) The measures contained in the Olivos pact have already begun to unravel. The bone of contention is none other than the autonomy of the Federal Capital and its new legal status. Apparently, government officials are trying to "block" the legal and economic independence of the city and leave alone only the direct election of the mayor at the Constituent Assembly in Santa Fe. President Menem himself urged the squabbling factions in the Buenos Aires Justicialist Party (PJ) to end their fighting and put off decisions on the future plan. The "provincialization" of the Federal Capital would inevitably bring with it the creation of new local institutions, the drafting of a metropolitan constitution, the formation of a local police force (the neighborhood precincts would come under the jurisdictions of the city), and a new local judiciary, plus the possible replacement of the Deliberating Council by a Buenos Aires legislature. But what is especially upsetting to more than one sector of the national government, particularly the Economy Ministry, is that it will not be able to refuse to turn over the lion's share of its funds to a new "city state" with full autonomy. No Buenos Aires politician doubts that this is "the debate that will come on the heels of the Constituent Assembly." The leaders of the metropolitan PJ who are part of the president's inner circle would be willing to tolerate the emergence of a "chief of government" elected by popular vote. "What they cannot stomach," claim some former Grossists, "is that on top of that, the new mayor would have control of the huge budget of the new province." Even Carlos Corach, the number-one candidate to represent the capital at the Constituent Assembly, told LA PRENSA that he does not agree with the formation of a metropolitan judiciary or a local police force. "That would result in more useless bureaucracy," he declared, expressly contradicting the paragraph of the Olivos pact that states: "...the city of Buenos Aires will be given a constitutional status that will recognize its autonomy and its own legislative and jurisdictional powers." "Here it is evading an internal debate within the PJ," says Simon Lazara, spokesman for Raul Alfonsin, when asked about the possibility that the Radicals' agreement with Menem may fall apart. While it is an open secret that within the Buenos Aires PJ there is "an internal power struggle between Corach and Ruckauf to control the capital," when it comes to the issue of the city's autonomy, the minister agrees with the legal and technical secretary that "it is not necessary" for the city to have its own police and court system. "What they are forgetting," whispers a former Justicialist deputy, "is that they will not be ministers or government officials for the rest of their lives; they will not last 100 years." On the other hand, Alfonsinist Jesus Rodriguez, a deputy who favors the pact, promised that at the Constituent Assembly "we will defend our neighbors, because I do not trust the Menemists when they talk about autonomy." This issue, about which the Justicialists have clearly not reached a consensus (although they do not admit that in public), will be the subject of a meeting next week between the PJ deputies and Constituent Assembly candidates, both those in the capital and those in Buenos Aires Province. There they will try to forge a united position so that there will be no more contradictions, at least not in public. "The Name Is Mine" It should be noted that Governor Eduardo Duhalde recently brought up the "identity crisis" that Buenos Aires residents would suffer if the city were to keep its current name. It was then that he proposed the name "Santa Maria" for its third incarnation, after it has achieved full autonomy. "All the patrol cars that used to say `Buenos Aires Provincial Police' now say `Buenos Aires Police,' to get people used to the idea of Buenos Aires in the district," the distressed governor explained to Buenos Aires PJ Deputy Jorge Arguello, author of the first autonomy plan for the capital. Despite the "psychological crisis" the residents of the metropolitan area may suffer, on this side of General Paz no one, Justicialist or Radical, is willing to give up the label "Buenos Aires City," which will inevitably set the stage for confrontations here and there in the future. Some suspicious types speculate that what really bothers Duhalde is "the emergence of a man who will be as strong as he is as governor of what until now has been the country's most important province." The chief of government, a title agreed upon by the Radical Civic Union (UCR) and the PJ, will be politically and economically powerful enough to negotiate on an equal footing on issues such as the exodus of "the 6 million people who come into the capital each day to be treated at Buenos Aires hospitals." To top it all off, Deputy Enrique Benedetti, a De la Rua political operative, did not hesitate to give LA PRENSA this diagnosis: "This is another `leak' in the pact. First there is Levene, who does not want to give up the [Supreme] Court; now we have the autonomy issue. The next thing you know, they will say that Menem's reelection will not be for one term, but will be good for the rest of his biological existence." [Box, p 5] Everyone Wants To Be "Chief of Government" Being elected top leader of the Federal Capital by popular vote is the pinnacle of politics for more than one Buenos Aires official, regardless of party affiliation. The matter has sparked more than one internal feud. The list includes those who secretly yearn for the office, as well as those who have already announced it loud and clear. Among metropolitan Justicialists, former Grossists and Menemists are fighting over the right to be the elected "figure"; everyone from recent PJ acquisition Adelina Dalesio de Viola to Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan (PAMI) Director Matilde Menendez, and including Legal and Technical Secretary Carlos Corach, Public Function Secretary Claudia Bello, and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, wants to take Bouer's place in 1995. After the recent elections in the capital and the dimming of his presidential prospects, Radical insiders say that Senator Fernando de la Rua has expressed a desire to wear the mayor's sash. But the man who opposed the pact will not have a smooth road ahead of him. Alfonsinist Deputy Jesus Rodriguez has already secretly begun pulling his political strings to enter the race for the same job. The appearance on the scene of Socialist Councilman Norberto Laporta, who swept the metropolitan elections last 3 October, has dashed more than one private hope. "El Chichon" [the jolly one] has reportedly taken the idea so seriously that many say this was the real reason why he declined to enter into an alliance with the Great Front. "With the race for the city leadership so close at hand, he could not risk having his image tarnished," Socialists assert with conviction. There is also optimism in the front. The person who emerges as the "best of the candidates" is former Prosecutor and Councilman Anibal Ibarra. The opinion polls indicate he is a man to be reckoned with, especially since he was so instrumental in exposing irregularities in the PAMI. Another person rumored to be vying for a position on the list of possible candidates is retired Brigadier General Osvaldo Cacciatore, who made no secret during his unsuccessful campaign for deputy as a member of the metropolitan Democratic Center Union (UCeDe) that he would like once again to hold the office that was once his. [Box, p 5] Third Incarnation A series of legal steps must be taken before the city can be declared "autonomous." - It must be approved by the National Constituent Convention. - After that the second stage will begin, the local constituent process, when limits will be set and terms will be defined. - If Article 3, Paragraph 27 of Article 67, and Paragraph 3 of Article 86 of the National Constitution are amended at the convention, the way will be clear to advance toward autonomy. - Until autonomy is declared and the new institutions of Buenos Aires City are installed, Congress will continue to be the local legislature. - After the Constitution is amended, Congress will pass a law calling an election for delegates to a Buenos Aires Constituent Assembly. - Each party will have to draw up a city model to present to the people, set in motion an electoral process, elect delegates to the Constituent Assembly, draft the constitution of the autonomous city, and once it is approved, set in motion the institutional process. - The Deliberative Council will be replaced by a legislature of the new city. - It will have a special constitutional status. - It will continue to be the nation's capital until Congress passes a law transferring that status; it may or may not declare the capital to be federal. - Although there is a general consensus on autonomy, the debate will begin with what city model each party will offer. Moreover, it will have a direct impact on the quality of life of the citizens. This is a foundational stage, the most important one since the city was federalized in 1880.
