One of them is what has been occurring in Chapare: clashes between Rural Mobile Patrol Unit agents and coca growers. Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar has pointed out that Law 1008 is being strictly complied with, and that the clashes that have been taking place in Chapare are essentially a result of the fact that new coca plantations have been found. [Begin Aranibar recording] This conflictive situation in the Chapare region is a result of the national government's decision, which has been channeled through the appropriate Ministry of Government organizations and the National Secretariat for Social Defense, to comply with Law 1008 with regard to illegal coca growing in the Chapare region. Coca has recently been planted in the region, and this violates Law 1008 and harms the international commitments made by Bolivia. [end recording]
