The TDN last week randomly polled a total of 2,455 Turks in five provincial centers and two towns, questioning them on popular confidence in the economic package announced by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on April 5. Three questions were put. A majority of those polled said they did not believe the economic measures would solve the country's economic problems and said they have no confidence that the state will participate in the "sacrifice" which the government has asked the people to make. A majority also said that despite these deficiencies, the ailing economic situation would not lead to an interruption of the democratic order by the military. Asked whether the "package" would solve Turkey's problems, 63.42 percent of those questioned said "no," while only 34.46 percent replied positively. Those who did not believe the package would be of any use numbered 1,557 against the 846 people who expressed confidence in it and 52 people, or 2.12 percent, refused to comment. When asked whether they believed the state would make the necessary sacrifice for the package to work, a majority of 71.28 percent, or a total of 1,750 people replied, "No." Only 638 of those polled, 25.98 percent, said, "Yes," while 67 refused to comment. Of those polled, 102 (4.17 percent) refused to comment on the question: "If this package does not solve the problems, will there be a military coup?" But the majority gave a clear "no" (65.94 percent, representing 1,619 people). Only 734, or 29.89 percent, believe there will be a military takeover. In the Turkish capital of Ankara, of the 1,055 people randomly polled in several districts, including downtown Kizilay and Ulus, over a period of two days, 65.9 percent of the citizens said they did not believe the package would solve their problems and 70.9 percent said they did not believe the state would make any sacrifices. While 56 percent said a failure of the measures would not lead to a military coup, 35.8 percent said it would. In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, of the 577 people polled, 48.8 percent said the new economic package would not solve Turkey's problems, and a mere two percent more (50 percent) said that it would. As in Ankara, a majority said there would not be a coup--representing 79.8 percent of the polled. Results in the Aegean port city of Izmir were similar among the 418 randomly polled, with 74.4 percent saying the measures would not work, 77 percent saying the state would not make sacrifices and 71.5 percent saying there would not be a military coup in the case of failure. Of the people polled in the southern touristic resort city of Antalya and the western industrial city of Bursa, 69.5 percent said they did not believe the measures were any solution to Turkey's problems and 74.7 percent said they did not believe the state would make any sacrifice--as it has promised to do. About the likelihood of a military takeover, 62.1 percent said they did not believe it likely. In the resort towns of Bodrum and Marmaris, where the TDN has offices, 61.7 percent of those polled said the economic package would not solve Turkey's problems, 68.5 percent said the state would make no sacrifice and 64.5 percent said they did not believe the military would intervene when the package failed. Comments: Those questioned in all of the cities where the TDN public opinion poll was conducted expressed a deep lack of confidence in the government's economic package mainly because they do not trust the state will make its share of the sacrifice. Some of those who refused to comment said they still did not know the contents of the package, while the main criticism was directed at government waste of its own resources. In the main, the comments reflected a lack of trust in state organizations and administrations, with criticism such as: "They always promise, but never do what they say," and "First they should make sacrifices and then ask the people to do the same." One widely heard view from those who believe that a military coup can take place in Turkey was based not on a possible economic failure but on the possibility of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party coming to power. A majority of those who fear a coup may take place commented that this would happen only if the RP came to power or there were attempts at establishing Shariat rule in Turkey. Some of the comments on the possibility of a coup by those polled were as follows: "If Shariat comes there will be a coup." "There can never be another coup in Turkey." "If a coup is staged this will thrust us back by ten years." "There will be a popular revolt, not a coup, if the package fails." Among those polled, there was also a feeling in favour of "making a change", and some responded by saying that all establishment parties had been tried and it was now time to try the Islamic experience. The TDN poll also revealed, once again, that when questioned on military coups and the armed forces, a considerable number of Turks are still reluctant to comment.
