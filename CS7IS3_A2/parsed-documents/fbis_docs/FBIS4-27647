FBIS4-27647 "dreas107_b_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 Mongolia MONTSAME Carries Press Review for 2 Jun MONTSAME Carries Press Review for 2 Jun BK0306073694 Ulaanbaatar MONTSAME in English 1209 GMT 2 Jun 94 BK0306073694 Ulaanbaatar MONTSAME English BFN [Text] Ulaanbaatar, June 2 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- It is likely that the composition of the government's team would be changed by resigning of some of its members judging from some publications of the newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" and the newspaper "UNEN" issued by the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party [MPRP]. If the central official press "ARDIYN ERH" on its first pages is demanding in the editorial to undertake serious measures in tackling properly the cabinet of ministers up to removing from the composition of some its members, the "UNEN" is directly naming those ministries and departments which leaders have been viewed to quit their ministerial posts. In substantiating its criticism the "UNEN" resorts to the arguments put forth by the democrats voiced during the days of a political hunger strike in April for the resignation of the government. The "ARDIYN ERH" is quoting the General Secretary of the ruling MPRP B. Dashyondon as saying that it is quite possible to provide changes in the team of the government. The "ARDIYN ERH" of today calls the name of the Minister of External Relations T. Gombosuren devoting him a whole page in today's issue. Holding his post T. Gombosuren managed to outlive three premiers namely D. Sodnom, S. Gungaadorj and D. Byambasuren. Among the writers of the country the pursuit for the year's state prize is carrying on. The prize is awarded annually on the eve of the main holiday of the country being the Naadam which is celebrated in July. The "ARDIYN ERH" publishes an article by Doctor L. Tudev who is standing for conferring all the candidates excepting D. Maam, a writer who three years ago headed the alternative writers' organization. At the conference held in Cairo of foreign ministers of nonaligned movement countries Mongolia released a memorandum on the issues under discussion as an official document of the conference which is provided in today's issue of the newspaper as well. The newspaper informs that Mongolian businessmen still continue in order to make their own profit betraying the national interests of the country. The fact that two years ago the U.S.A granted the most favourable terms nation's status to Mongolia has lead to the growing interest arose on the part of many Hong Kong's firms to Mongolia. During the last period several attempts to bring into the country of finished production with forged documents on their manufacturing in Mongolia for reselling on the U.S. market have been revealed. The newspaper reports about one of such cases where there are involved in some firms of China and Hong Kong. The newspaper "UNEN" carries an interview with member of the steering council of the MPRP, chairman of the Standing Committee of the parliament N. Bayarsaihan. The main topic of the interview is the progress in reference to the economic reformings, its outcome and prospects for near future. N. Bayarsaihan acknowledges that the aim of the government being to check the decline in production, and attain stabilizing of the situation for a two-year-long period has not been fulfilled. He is in favour of intensifying the privatization of state-owned property. So far the most of national wealth is still nobody's. Moreover there have been formed some groupings interested in retaining such a case in order to dispose as they think fit of this no man's property, said N. Bayarsaihan. To corroborate this statement, he quotes the names of joint stock companies with prevailing state-owned property pattern.
