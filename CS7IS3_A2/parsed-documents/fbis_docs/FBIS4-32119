Some 15 soldiers went approximately 250 meters inside our country's territory and seized heights and the most significant strategic points on Cupino Brdo and Podrzikonj near Kriva Palanka. The soldiers of our northern neighbor now control the highest peak on Mount Straza. The information from the field is that for the whole past month there have been some major movements on the Serbian side, that tents have been put up and trenches dug on Macedonian territory. In the absence of official information from the Defense Ministry, the local inhabitants are gripped by fear and anxiety, even though so far no incidents have occurred apart from the seizure of our territory. The Macedonian Army soldiers' task is just to observe the Serbian military "breach." This is not the first time that regular units of the Serbian Army have violated the territorial integrity of our country. There has been a series of incidents in the last three to four months, which announced what is now actually happening. The border with Yugoslavia has some disputed zones that have been avoided by the Macedonian side and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. These zones were not defined by the border commissions, and now more relaxed times and a calmer atmosphere are expected in order to resolve them. The Serbian side knows this, too. However, it is keeping up the tension by making open threats to peace and security. Serbia has not stopped demonstrating its force on Macedonia's northern border. It does that when its warplanes fly over our territory, when its disguised soldiers capture our border troops, and when they do not allow UNPROFOR units to use the roads along the Macedonian border zone. It would be naive to believe that this latest serious incident is not part of a strategy that is breaking through on several fronts. The entry of the Serbian soldiers onto our territory just before the beginning of the census coincides with the open threats by the political associations of the Serbs in Macedonia to boycott the census because of their "not regulated citizenship status" and because allegedly "85 percent of the Serbian population" has not been provided with citizenship documents from the Interior Ministry. At the same time there are claims that "surnames are being changed, particularly of Serbs who have lived in Macedonia for a long time." On the other hand, the Serbian Orthodox Church and its "administrators for Macedonia" "recommend" that the Macedonian Orthodox Church ultimately return to its "canonic mother," reinforcing its threats with border provocations. All this, supported by part of the Serbian state press, which uses the strongest symbols, archaic pictures, and mythological formulas ("Serbian country," "autochthonous people," "old homes," "graves of Serbian soldiers") is aimed not only at providing an excuse for the "warmongers" but also at creating a psychosis in Serbia about danger, which is the only possible way to maintain the ruling oligarchy. That is why the comments of the military leadership of Serbia on the incident near Kriva Palanka was so dismissive: "It is something that Macedonian journalists have made up." Just as the Bosnian model was also a "journalist's invention": provocation -- incident -- military conflict. Facing this great Serbian military pressure it is strange that the Macedonian Government, the Defense Ministry, and the General Staff of the Macedonian Army are taking such an attitude. It is true that the minister responsible and chief of the military leadership are outside the country, but the public cannot be left without relevant information in such cases. We do not know if the international bodies have been informed about the incident, which could exert pressure on the Serbian state leadership to withdraw their soldiers from Macedonian territory. The issue of the disputed border regions should be resolved as soon as possible, but only through negotiations. No other argument can fill in the "geographical holes." Unless the Bosnian war mania has come down to the south.
