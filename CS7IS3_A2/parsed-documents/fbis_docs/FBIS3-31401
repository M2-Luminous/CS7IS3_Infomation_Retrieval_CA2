The delegation Tudjman was head of was seen at the Otopeni Airport by a honor mission led by Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu. The head of the Romanian diplomacy said that "to his mind, the visit was an extremely important moment in the relations between the two countries, an opportunity to show Romania's preoccupation to transfer the good relations it had with former Yugoslavia to all the republics created following the breaking of Yugoslavia. We are very satisfied with the discussions conducted here, we signed the first treaty with a country from former Yugoslavia and the exchange of views we had on the prospects of finding a solution to the crisis in Yugoslavia has been very interesting for us. We are very satisfied and we hope that will be a moment marking a speeding up of our ties with Croatia and with all the republics of former Yugoslavia."
