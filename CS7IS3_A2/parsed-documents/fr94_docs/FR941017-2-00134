FR941017-2-00134 FR941017-2-00078 Office of Thrift Supervision [No. 94&hyph;221] Monthly Median Cost of Funds Index AGENCY: Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. ACTION: Notice; request for comment. SUMMARY: Since 1982, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) or its predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), has collected data from savings associations for, and published, the Monthly Median Cost of Funds (MMCOF) index. This index is available for adjusting the interest rate on adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs). The MMCOF has become less important to the mortgage lending industry since development of the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index and the One Year Treasury Bill Rate Index. At the same time, as the OTS-regulated portion of the thrift industry has contracted, the MMCOF has been based on data from a significantly smaller number of institutions, representing a smaller portion of mortgage loans. The OTS is currently evaluating the direct cost to the industry of supplying data for use in calculating the MMCOF and the indirect cost to the industry of OTS committing resources used to calculate the MMCOF. The OTS is considering whether it should: cease publishing the MMCOF; or modify the scope of the MMCOF to increase its usefulness or reduce the cost to savings associations. Potential modifications include expanding the number of reporting institutions to include all OTS-regulated savings associations or decreasing the reporting universe to a statistically valid sample of OTS-regulated institutions. If the OTS were to cease publishing the MMCOF, section 402(e)(3) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), requires the agency to designate acceptable substitute indices that could be used for adjusting ARMs currently based on the MMCOF. After reviewing available indices, OTS found that the Quarterly Average Cost of Funds Index (QCOFI) and the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Index appear to be acceptable substitute indices. Both of these indices are readily available for adjusting ARMs and have demonstrated a strong correlation over time to the MMCOF. If the agency determines to stop publishing the MMCOF, it anticipates providing a transition period of one or two quarters before releasing the last MMCOF.
