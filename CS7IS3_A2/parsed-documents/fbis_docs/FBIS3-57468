A Place Will Be Found in the Bloc for Many, But Not for Russia"] [Text] Vilnius -- "NATO cannot now accept states which are not in complete accord," the well-known Ukrainian writer Dmitro Pavlychko, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's Commission for Foreign Affairs, has stated. "Hence, in my view, we should first undergo schooling in accord all together, not separately. We must create complete harmony in East and Central Europe." Dmitro Pavlychko made this statement during his tour of Baltic countries, where he held talks with the heads of the Lithuanian and Latvian parliaments and leaders of committees and commissions, ministers, and opposition leaders in those countries. His tour, the mass media reported, had one aim: the creation of a Baltic-Black Sea alliance or, to be more precise, joint work on the juridical basis for such an alliance. Lithuania and the other Baltic countries, Pavlychko believes, need to look south and break out of the circle to which they have been assigned. So an effort is clearly being made to create a Baltic-Black Sea alliance. What role in this is allotted to Russia -- a state which has outlets to the Baltic and the Black Sea? Ukrainian parliamentarians expressed no opinion on this question. But it was answered back in December at the "Baltic Cooperation and Security" conference by former Estonian Defense Minister Juri Luik (now foreign minister). Expressing his support for the creation of a unified security concept for the Baltic countries, Luik called for the formation of a military-political alliance of the Baltic states without the participation of Russia, but involving Ukraine.
