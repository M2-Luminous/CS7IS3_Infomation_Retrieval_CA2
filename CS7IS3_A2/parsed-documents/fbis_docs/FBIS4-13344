This came in a message he sent to the Press Syndicate in reply to a note he received of late from Ibrahim Nafi', chairman of the Press Syndicate, requesting the prosecution's interference to protect guarantees of journalists who were arrested recently. The Press Syndicate Board charged that the prosecution had violated such guarantees recently. "All the prosecution members are fully aware, and have proper understanding, of all rulings and laws, including the authority of the press and criminal procedures," asserted the chief prosecutor. "The prosecution is keen on implementing laws out of its responsibility and duties without the need for anyone to draw its attention to that," he affirmed.
