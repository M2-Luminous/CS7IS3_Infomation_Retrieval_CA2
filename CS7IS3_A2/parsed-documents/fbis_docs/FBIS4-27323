Commenting on this, a negotiator for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] criticized the demand as follows: 1) The Kantor demand goes against the Japan-U.S. accord to "rule out target figures"; and 2) each auto dealer is supposed to be free to make the decision whether or not to deal in foreign-made models, and the government must not intervene in their business affairs. The MITI negotiator noted his concern over Kantor's remark, saying: "Even if the framework talks are resumed, the two nations may fall into the same dilemma." The Japanese Government agrees on using the number of dealers in foreign cars as one of several "objective criteria" to evaluate the openness of the Japanese auto market. However, Japan says the criteria must be used to review present circumstances and past records, and Kantor's demand for "future commitment" is nothing but a demand for a numerical target. In the bilateral accord on the resumption of the framework talks, a commitment on auto sales was drawn up on the same lines as one on the mobile phone market. The MITI negotiator, however, said: "While the government does have control over access to the mobile phone market, auto sales is a liberal industrial field run by the business sector. The government exercises very different authority in each field." The United States has been demanding that Japan honor its commitment to increase the number of dealers in foreign cars. Japanese negotiators feel Kantor's remarks indicated the United States has no intention of changing its negotiation policies even after the latest accord. Some quarters in the government are voicing frustration with the bilateral accord on the resumption of framework talks, saying: "The accord was made hastily. Consequently it is inadequate and may be open to misinterpretation by the United States."
