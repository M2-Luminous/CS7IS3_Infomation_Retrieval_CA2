Speakers at the symposium held at the Ministry of People's Armed Forces said that the policy of modelling the whole Army on the chuche idea which Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, put forward by applying the programme of modelling the whole society on the chuche idea to Army building is a programme of Army building, the first of its kind in the history of the building of the revolutionary Armed Forces of the working class, and a great programme which makes is possible to successfully accomplish through generations the chuche cause of Army building pioneered by the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song. Noting that the programme of modelling the whole Army on the chuche idea is an immortal militant banner that must be constantly upheld by our People's Army, they said this is because the programme clearly indicates the general aim of building the revolutionary Armed Forces of the working class, the aim of imbuing the revolutionary Army with the revolutionary idea of the leader, and thus makes it possible to build up the People's Army into the Army of the leader and the Army of the party, both nominally and virtually, and the revolutionary Army flawless in its political and military appearance. The speakers at the symposium held at the Ministry of Public Security said that Comrade Kim Chong-il has built up the public security organ into loyal ranks imbued with the chuche idea and singleheartedly united around the party and the leader, into invincible ranks with spiritual and moral traits and qualities as political defenders of the party by successfully applying the policy of modelling the whole Army on the chuche idea to public security. The vitality of this great feat performed by the dear leader is clearly proved in the fact that the public security organ is smashing all manoeuvres of the enemy at every step and reliably defending the security of the party, the state and the people in the practice of the class struggle in our country, under the rapidly changing world situation today, the speakers noted.
