Li met with Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb, president of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, and Frank Swaelen, president of the Belgian Senate, over bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. The Chinese official arrived in the Belgian capital on Tuesday [17 May] for a five-day visit. During the meeting, Li said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1971, bilateral cooperation has developed considerably in political, economic and trade fields. The Chinese leader pointed out that there have been more exchanges of high-level visits between the two sides while bilateral economic and trade relations have been increasing. Since there is great potential and prospects for Sino-Belgian cooperation, said Li, China hopes both sides will make joint efforts for more cooperation. At the request of the hosts, Li gave an outline of China's political system reform, its socialist democratic politics and the People's Political Consultative Conference. Swaelen said that Belgium is opening up to Asia since the center of the world's economy is moving towards the region. He noted that China has an important role in Asia and will be more and more influential in the world economy and international affairs. Li's visit to Belgium shows that China attaches great importance in developing relations with Belgium, he added. Belgium is the last leg of Li's five-nation European tour, which has already taken him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.
