Traffic has resumed in the area, where businesses had remained closed yesterday because of the prevailing tension after an exchange of gunfire. No gunshots have been heard by journalists. This return to normalcy follows President Pascal Lissouba's message warning all Army and police officers against any act that "would jeopardize the peace process and the security of people and property." Former President Denis Sassou-Nguesso's supporters are opposed to the deployment of security forces in the district, fearing that this could serve as a pretext to attack the residence of the former head of state, who has been living for several months now in his native village, Oyo, 600 km north of Brazzaville. According to the police, the security forces were deployed in Mpila to check the activities of armed robbers, who have been attacking goods trains.
