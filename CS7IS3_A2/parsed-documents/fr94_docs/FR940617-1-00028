(ii) The head of the contracting activity may request an overhead should-cost review for a business unit which does not meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(i) of this subsection. (iii) Overhead should-cost reviews are labor intensive and require participation by the buying activities, contract administration, and contract audit elements. The extent of availability of military department, contract administration, and contract audit resources to support DCMC/DLA-led teams should be considered when determining whether a review will be conducted. Overhead should-cost reviews generally shall not be conducted at a contractor business segment more frequently than every three years.
