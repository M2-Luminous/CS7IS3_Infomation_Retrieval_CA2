I went to Pishan County's Keketiereke Township and saw the silhouette of a small child herding sheep on the Gobi sands and witnessed other children selling food and drinks in the restaurants. I became very depressed. On a fiercely hot day last September, the township party committee vice secretary Yang Yaorong [2799 5069 2837] and two of the village cadres spent almost a day "grabbing" 12 students and taking them back to the schools; they were all hot and sweaty. When they got to the section of the village road where corn grew tall and dense on both sides, suddenly there was a whistle, and the naughty children scattered. The quick and agile ones disappeared among the bushes; only three scared little girls did not run off. They just sat there and cried. They would rather die than go back to school. Since 1981, the township's 19 schools have yet to complete their enrollment plans. The middle school enrollment rate is below 50 percent. Where are the children who should be attending school? In the bazha [1572 2089], one often hears the young voices of children in the restaurants and shops selling goods and calling out. They look only 12-13 years old. On the road to town, those driving the mule carts selling kindling and livestock are almost all children. Why aren't these children attending school? What are their parents thinking? Most peasants believe that so long as their children can read a few words and do some simple arithmetic, it is good enough. As for going to school to become workers and cadres, they don't even dare to dream. As a result, young people who should be keeping company with books and knowledge are keeping company with sheep and mules. At one time, poverty brought nothing but misery and sorrow to the people around here. People long to be rich. Their desire to make money keep them very busy, so busy that they drag their little boys and little girls, who have no interest in learning anyway, down with them. It is difficult to recruit students and even more difficult to reinforce them and keep them there. The township recruited a class of 30 first-year middle school students last year; 11 did not show up after registration, and 12 dropped out later for various reasons. The township tried a new measure to counter the recruitment problem a couple years ago: Each household had to guarantee sending one student to school; they were rewarded with one year of free service plus 30 yuan; those who did not comply would be fined one year's free service plus 30 yuan. When that measure was first implemented, it helped, but it did not take long for the peasants to figure things out: One child could raise five sheep in a year, and if they fined me one sheep, I would still have four, not to mention their dung for fertilizer; I would still come out ahead work even with the fine. Later, as the voice of "easing the peasants' burdens" grew louder and louder, the village had no choice but to abolish its "local policy," and enrollment dropped again. The ultimate goal of education is to improve the nation's overall quality so that people can escape ignorance and poverty and embark on the road to civilization and wealth. But to an ordinary peasant who is so sick and tired of being poor and who does not even have the most basic guarantees of survival, what good is education? In my opinion, to keep education from slipping away in these backward regions, besides continuing to strengthen guidance and increase input, perhaps we should change the area's existing mold of "pure education" to "quality education" that is more compatible with the realistic local conditions, so that the students can directly serve the village economy and social development as soon as they leave school.
