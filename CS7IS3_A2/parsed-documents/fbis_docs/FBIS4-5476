Among them 14,000 hectares are planted with rice and 3,000 hectares with peanuts. In the most productive year, the district can produce 63,000 tonnes of grain. Its per capita in grain is 260 kg. People in the district also engage in fishing, salt production, and livestock breeding. "However, after six years of implementing Resolution No. 10 on the contractual system, only 65 percent of households in the district earn enough grain for self-consumption. The remaining 35 percent face a grain shortage and numerous difficulties due to poverty, among them more than 11 percent experience hunger [dqois] from five to six months." What is the main causes of hunger and poverty experienced by the abovementioned 35 percent of the district's households? Through our studies, we found that these households had insufficient capital, used poor cultivation methods, while the cost of production was too high and the price of rice was relatively low in the market. "Indeed, more than half of the 35 percent poor households are short of capital; they have too many children, most of them are in poor health. Worse still, they could not pay their debts to the local agricultural cooperative year after year." To overcome these difficulties, the district must strive to encourage the peasants to plant new high-yield rice and peanut varieties to attain an average rice yield of 45 quintals per hectar and peanut, 20 quintal per hectare. The district must also strive to plant more soybean and sweet potatoes on its fallow land to attain a production target of 70,000-80,000 tonnes of grain by the year 1997. The goal of the district is to overcome hunger by 1998, reduce the number of poor households by half, and help 40 percent of the total households in the district lead a better life by the year 2000. "The struggle against hunger and poverty is a difficult task. It requires coordination from various sectors and branches while efforts must be made from the top to the lowest level. It is necessary to carry out this struggle in close association with the implementation of the family planning program to reduce the population growth rate of the district from 2.4 percent at present to 1.7 percent in the year 2000."
