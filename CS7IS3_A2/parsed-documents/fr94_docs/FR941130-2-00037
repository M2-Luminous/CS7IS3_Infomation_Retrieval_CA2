OMB Number: 3060&hyph;0438 Title: Transmittal Sheet for Cellular Applications for Unserved Areas Form Number: FCC Form 464 Action: Revision of a currently approved collection Respondents: Businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses) Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement Estimated Annual Burden: 20,000 responses; .166 hours average burden per response; 3,320 hours total annual burden Needs and Uses: In CC Docket No. 90&hyph;6, the Commission adopted its initial rules and requirements for the processing, filing selection of unserved area applications in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service. These rules were later refined in CC Docket No. 92&hyph;115 in which the Commission conducted a comprehensive revision of Part 22 rules. The procedures for processing cellular applications were soon thereafter revised in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252. In this proceeding, the Commission determined that it would also use competitive bidding to select among certain mutually exclusive cellular applications. A two phase licensing scheme for accepting applications for unserved area applications is used. In Phase I, applications are filed during specified filing windows for any unserved area that may exist on frequency blocks within each market. In Phase II, unserved area applications are processed using a 30-day notice and cut-off procedures. Applicants must submit a transmittal sheet, FCC Form 464, in addition to other filing requirements. FCC Form 464 is designed to facilitate application intake and other processing functions by serving as a cover sheet to the application. The applicant must certify on the form that the application is complete in every respect and contains all the information required by the Commission's cellular rules. The information on the transmittal sheet must match exactly the information on the jacket of the microfiche and on the cover of the application. Application filed with an incorrect or previous transmittal sheet will not be accepted for filing. FCC Form 464 is used only in Phase I of the licensing scheme. In Phase I, applicants need not initially file the paper original with the application. The paper original must be filed seven days after the release of the public notice announcing the applicant as the winner and include a full sized map. For Phase I filings, applicants must file the original or master microfiche and one microfiche copy and a reduced copy of the map should be depicted in the microfiche and contained in the paper original. The microfiche must be a signed copy of the application, be properly labelled and enclosed in a properly labelled envelope. The FCC Form 464 has been updated to replace references to FCC Form 401 with FCC Form 600. Other minor changes have been made to coincide the form with the revised rules. The information collected will be used by FCC staff to determine whether the applicant is qualified legally, technically, and financially to be licensed as a cellular operator. Without such information the Commission could not determine whether to issue licenses to the applicants that provide telecommunication services to the public and therefore fulfill its statutory responsibilities in accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Federal Communications Commission. LaVera F. Marshall, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29445 Filed 11&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;0l-F
