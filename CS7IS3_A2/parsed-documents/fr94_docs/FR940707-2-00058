This ICR is a renewal of an existing information collection. Abstract: Under Section 3002(a)(5) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), EPA has established a hazardous waste manifesting system to assure that hazardous waste is designated for and arrives at a treatment, storage or disposal facility (TSDF) permitted under RCRA Subtitle C. The information collected in this system includes the completion, submission, and recordkeeping of the manifest itself, completion and submission of discrepancy and exception reports, notification of hazardous waste discharges in the event of an accident, and primary exporter manifest requirements. This information will be collected from large quantity and small quantity generators of hazardous waste, hazardous waste transporters, and owner/operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities. The information will be used to: (1) Provide notice to hazardous waste transporters and waste management facility workers on the risks posed by the wastes being handled; (2) track shipments from generator to facility; (3) assist emergency response personnel in determining appropriate responses to accidents; and (4) complement facility inspections to determine compliance. Burden Statement: The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 46 minutes to 1.3 hours per hazardous waste shipment for generators, 16 minutes to 1.8 hours per shipment for transporters, and 17 minutes to 6.5 hours per shipment for TSDFs. This estimate includes all aspects of the information collection including time for reviewing instructions, gathering the data needed, reviewing the collection of information, and submitting the information. Respondents: Generators, Transporters and Handlers of Hazardous Waste. Estimated Number of Respondents: 223,173. Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent: 1. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 434,944. Frequency of Collection: As needed.
