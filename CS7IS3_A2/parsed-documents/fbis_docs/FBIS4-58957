He said the supply situation in all districts was stable, and that the citizens were able to move about smoothly and safely. He denied all the distorted reports being put out by the secessionist al-Ahmar clan concerning the situation in Lahij Governorate, in a desperate attempt to mislead local and foreign public opinion and to obfuscate the defeats it has suffered at the hands of the forces of unity and national alignment -- and at the hands of the heroic sons of the governorate. He discussed the stupid acts being perpetrated by the remnants of gangs from the secessionist al-Ahmar clan, who are shelling the villages in the governorate's districts, causing heavy losses in life and property to the peaceful inhabitants. He praised the sincere humanitarian efforts being made by doctors and health workers at the Ibn Khaldun Hospital in treating wounded children, women, and old men who had been directly targeted by the vanquished gangs of the bloody al-Ahmar family.
