Peasants rely totally on tractors to till these areas, which are located mostly in the provinces around Tonle Sap Lake. According to Mr. Liang Sam-hat, head of the agricultural machine tool directorate, "by mid-June, only 85,000 hectares, or 35 percent of the plan, had been tilled. It is expected that by the end of the season, that is, at the end of June, only about 50 percent of the total acreage will be tilled. This is a cause of great concern for it might lead shortages in the food supply for next year." Due to insecurity, tractors could not carry out their operations. "In some provinces where there are vast areas for planting floating rice, such as Banteay Meanchey, the Khmer Rouge have forced the tractor owners and landlords to pay them taxes. This is why the tractor-operators in this province could till only 45 percent of the planned 70,000 hectares. In Battambang Province, only over 20,000 out of the planned 55,000 hectares were tilled so far. Kompong Thom Province could till only 4,000 out of the 24,000 hectares." Presently over 2,000 imported tractors, of which 90 percent belong to the private sector while the remaining 10 percent were imported through various international organizations, are distributed to various state agricultural services. The farmers like to use the much cheaper tractors made in the Soviet Union and China, which are as good as those made in Great Britain and the United States. At the recent National Assembly meeting, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh said that the Royal Government plans to build a tractor factory with loans from foreign countries. Tractors to be produced by this factory will be sold to farmers at the cheapest price with an aim to promote rice production, particularly in the floating-rice zone.
