Terminal Four and roads around the airport were reopened during the night. Some early morning flights were cancelled and others diverted before the terminal was opened. People inquiring about British Airways arrivals were advised to ring 081 759 2525. A statement from the airport said: "Due to the closure of one runway, delays are likely on other inbound and outbound flights." "Passengers can be assured that this morning's incident is being contained within Terminal Four and that their safety remains a top priority." It said the airport usually used only one runway during the night. The southern runway was being used from 10.30pm last night. The last plane to take off was at 11.25pm -- 35 minutes before the incident. The last plane to land was a mail flight which touched down on the northern runway at 00.34am. The latest incident follows a warning by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams yesterday that there could be another attack like Wednesday's IRA strike on the airport, when four mortar bombs were fired from a vehicles in a car park at the Excelsior Hotel, on the Heathrow's northern border.
