The source added: "It is possible that we will need one or two more months to transfer the territory to the Palestinians smoothly." Meanwhile the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is continuing to prepare for the withdrawal. Many reserve units have recently received call-up notices for February and March to implement "rainbow" plan -- the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal and redeployment plan. IDF sources say: "We are continuing with the redeployment without any connection to the political negotiations. We want to attain a situation wherein we will be able to efficiently implement any political plan on short notice." The military source confirmed that the IDF has sent call-up notices to transport, supplies, and other logistic units. He explained, however, that the implementation of the plan is dependent on the political echelon's approval. The IDF has also completed its preparations for the release of more than 3,000 Palestinian prisoners in case a significant breakthrough is made on the Palestinian track. Among those slated to be released are sick and elderly prisoners, women, and prisoners who are not members of rejectionist front organizations and "who do not have blood on their hands." The Finance Ministry has approved an allocation of 350 million shekels for IDF redeployment following its withdrawal.
