Hwang Chang-yop, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly, unofficially arrived in Beijing on 15 January for an eight-day visit to discuss this, the source said. Hwang, who was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly--a position which actually controls the North Korean nuclear issue and foreign affairs--in December 1993 among high-ranking North Korean officials, will also discuss President Kim Il-song's visit to the PRC with the PRC side, according to the source. It is known that through Kim Il-song's visit to the PRC, which is expected to immediately follow Hwang's PRC visit, Kim Il-song will make a final discussion with high-ranking PRC officials on North Korea's PRC-style opening policy which has already been decided by himself. The PRC-style opening policy decided by North Korea will be the special economic zone-style adopted by the PRC. North Korea has decided to make Najin and Sonbong region the first special economic zone and already concluded legislative procedures for the opening of the region in relation to the development of the lower Tumen river. In relation to the opening-up policy decided by North Korea, Hwang, who began his unofficial visit to the PRC from 15 January, is scheduled to visit Guangzhou and Shenzhen which are special economic zones in southern PRC. The Beijing source also said that the ROK Government is known to be aware of the trend of North Korea's policy and is considering to open a liaison office in Najin or Sonbong through the UN Development Program after North Korea announces its opening up. The source said that in a meeting attended by Kim Il-song, North Korean authorities already made such a decision to declare a PRC-style opening up policy as a result of an internal discussion on the choice of policy direction after the resolution of the nuclear issue, and that North Korean high-ranking authorities already began drawing up plans to implement the opening-up policy for the era after the resolution of the nuclear issue.
