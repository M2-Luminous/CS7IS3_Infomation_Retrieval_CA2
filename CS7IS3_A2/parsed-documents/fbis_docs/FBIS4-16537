Before his departure, he gave an interview to INTERFAX. According to Kozyrev, if NATO had consulted Russia prior to carrying out air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, another way could possibly have been found to warn the hotheads among the Bosnian Serbs to halt the shelling of Gorazde. At the same time, together with our partners we could, perhaps, have found a possibility to warn the other side, the Bosnian Muslims, who are clearly provoking the Serbs, the minister said.
