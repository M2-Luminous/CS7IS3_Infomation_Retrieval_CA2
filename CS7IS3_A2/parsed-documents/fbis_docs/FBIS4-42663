The U.S. official had a meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias this evening that lasted for one and a half hours. Nimetz will go to Skopje tomorrow. [Begin Foivos Karzis recording] Foreign Minister Papoulias and U.S. Presidential Envoy Nimetz had a meeting of a rather exploratory nature this evening, in view of the new round of contacts in New York. Nimetz confirmed that he was not bringing any new ideas. On the other hand, Papoulias expressed the view that the meeting between Nimetz and [FYROM President] Kiro Gligorov tomorrow in Skopje will be important. The possibility that Nimetz will return to Athens after his contacts with the Skopjean leadership remains open. In that case, Papoulias said, we will have a clearer picture of the situation. Papoulias expressed the hope that the meetings he and [FYROM Foreign Minister] Stevo Crvenkovski will have with Cyrus Vance and Nimetz in New York between 14 and 17 June will be the final round of deliberations on the Skopje issue. In any case, it is indicative that Nimetz's agenda this time was clearly more limited, as he did not meet with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou or Yeoryios Papandreou, deputy foreign minister in charge of Greek-American relations. This morning, Papoulias briefed President Konstandinos Karamanlis on the developments in the national issues and described the scenarios of a triple name for Skopje as unrealistic. [end recording]
