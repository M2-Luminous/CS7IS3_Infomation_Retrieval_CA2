This was stated by Yeltsin in Bonn on Wednesday [11 May] before beginning political talks with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl that will focus on the modalities of the troop withdrawal, among other things. After an unusually cordial welcome between Yeltsin and Kohl, the Russian president said he was confident Germany would help his country even after the conclusion of the troop withdrawal. Russia wants to be a member with equal rights in all European organizations. He was hoping that, with the beginning of the presidency in the European Council on 1 July of this year, Kohl would advocate Russia's access to these institutions. Russia is Germany's most important neighbor, Kohl said. The chancellor, who addressed Yeltsin with the familiar "du," said wisdom and vision were the preconditions for making the right decisions in a world that is undergoing dramatic changes. It was Germany's desire that Yeltsin and his reform policy be successful. "This success is a success for Europe and the Germans."
