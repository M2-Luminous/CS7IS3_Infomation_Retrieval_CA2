Saunders] [Text] Port Elizabeth Feb 16 SAPA -- All obstacles in the way of an inclusive democratic settlement have been removed by the concessions the African National Congress' [ANC] National Working Committee took on Wednesday [16 February], Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa said. Speaking to Port Elizabeth's business community at a function on Wednesday night, Mr Ramaphosa briefed about 60 guests on the committee decision to provide for greater regional powers and a double ballot system to meet the demands of the Freedom Alliance. "This is the best offer they can expect to get and we expect them to respond positively," he said in answer to a question. "If they respond in the negative, then we know all they are interested in is disrupting the elections to frustrate democracy and to have a civil war. We will not allow any party to disrupt our march to democracy, or to disrupt the elections. Then strong and hard measures will have to be taken against them." But Mr Ramaphosa said he preferred negotiations. "We have made this gesture of conciliation today (Wednesday) so that there should be no more talk of civil war or violence." Saying the ANC recognised that the Zulu king should have a place of honour as monarch in the province of Natal, Mr Ramaphosa added: "The ANC is doing this to show it is not irresponsible on the future of South Africa...To show we want an all-inclusive settlement. We have built a house of democracy. We expect them to come and live with us in this house now that we have made these alterations." Commenting on the Eastern Cape, Mr Ramaphosa said this was the forgotten part of the country. "It's like the government just closed its eyes to the Eastern Cape and walked away. We must address unemployment throughout the country, but I would say especially here in the Eastern Cape." Mr Ramaphosa said the ANC had been in touch with the government on Wednesday to inform them of the committee's decision and they would hold a bilateral meeting in Pretoria on Thursday to discuss it further. The multiparty conference would reconvene either on Monday or Tuesday. "We will try to persuade all other parties that this is the right decision so that we can have peace in our country. We then expect parliament to meet in the course of next week," said Mr Ramaphosa. After that the registration date for parties would be extended for parties which had not yet registered.
