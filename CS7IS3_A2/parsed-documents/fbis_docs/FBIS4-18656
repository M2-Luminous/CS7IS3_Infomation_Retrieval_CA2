Ever since the Downing Street Declaration in December, it has been made abundantly clear to the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, that it can enter the democratic process only when it unequivocally and permanently renounces violence. Sinn Fein's aim in calling this ceasefire was clearly to try to put pressure on the Government to fudge this fundamental precondition. That indeed has been its intention all along; hence its repeated call for London to "clarify" the declaration. Dublin, however, has already provided Sinn Fein leaders with ample clarification, and the Sinn Fein leadership can now be in no doubt what the declaration means. They have admitted several times that it offers a real chance of progress for Ulster, yet cannot bring themselves to abandon their old boast that they will eventually force their way to the peace table with a ballot box in one hand and an Armalite in the other. We have before expressed concern that the Irish government, in its eagerness to get peace talks moving, would allow Sinn Fein to think that it could somehow avoid the absolute necessity of renouncing violence. It is therefore very welcome that over the past week Dublin has stood four-square with London and condemned outright this latest attempt by Sinn Fein and the IRA to drive a wedge between the two governments on this crucial issue. It may nevertheless take some time before Sinn Fein finally accepts that it must renounce violence once and for all. It may never accept as much. A 72-hour respite from murder and maiming, though welcome in itself, can do nothing to hasten the negotiations which the British and Irish governments still hope will flow from the declaration. But many in the various constituencies that Sinn Fein and the IRA seek to cultivate -- in Northern Ireland itself, in the South and in America -- are urging them to respond constructively to the declaration. And that seems to be giving them serious pause for thought about their terrorist campaign. Both governments must keep up the pressure by continuing to refuse them any form of talks until they forswear terrorism for ever.
