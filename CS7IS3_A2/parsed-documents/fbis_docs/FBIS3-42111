He is the co-author of a 1992 newspaper article together with chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov on Russia's development of binary weapons leading to the latter's arrest on charges of divulging a state secret. Fedorov who is one of the witnesses in a closed trial in Moscow, says that there is still a shroud of secrecy not only about new generation weapons but also obsolete toxic agents which are no longer produced or have been destroyed either in part or in full. Thousands of tons of the Agent Orange type chemical weapons were produced at a chemical plant in Ufa between 1965 and the late 1970's, Fedorov said. He spoke of having evidence that the weapons were tested in the Primorskiy, Krasnoyarsk and Krasnodar regions and in the northern Caucasus. These must have been sprayed but the government is still reluctant to declassify the secret information, Fedorov said. In his words, decomposition of the weapons leads to the formation of dioxins, a substance that is hazardous to human health.
