The ROI will also field joint candidates for the local elections, which follow a few weeks after the general elections. The ROI hopes to win five percent of the vote so that it can enter parliament and defend the Romanies' interests. In parliament the Romanies would seek to tighten laws against the propagation of racist or fascist ideology, to lower unemployment and promote education for Romanies. The parties in parliament today have no interest in the Romanies' lot, the ROI says. The Romanies in Slovakia have not acquired the official status of a national minority, only that of an ethnic group, Romanies leaders say. They estimate there are some half a million living in Slovakia, 220,000 of whom have the right to vote. The ROI is aiming for 180,000 votes, which would be enough to get seats in parliament. The umbrella group comprises the ROI Union, the Romany Integration Party (SIR), the Romany Social Democratic Party (SNSR) and the Romany Congress and will be supported by the Romany Democratic Movement (DHR) and the Romany Party of Democratic Union (SDUR).
