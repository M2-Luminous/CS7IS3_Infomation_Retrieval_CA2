This has been the hardest blow dealt to drug trafficking this year. Judge Juan Jose Galeano headed an operation conducted in Lomas de Zamora, Buenos Aires, during which police found more than 50 kg of cocaine that had been "artistically" hidden inside five wooden doors that had been carefully constructed for this illegal act. This operation led the Federal Police to raid the "Buenos Aires" warehouse in the Pompeya district, where they found 15 similar doors with dozens of bricks of cocaine inside. According to Police Inspector Norberto Ruiz, who was in charge of the operation, the "merchandise" had been brought from Jujuy in a station wagon belonging to the freight company "La Sevillanita." Ruiz reported that neither those responsible for the warehouse nor the freight company managers were apparently involved in smuggling the drugs. The operation was the fruit of "four months of investigations," Ruiz pointed out. He added that the agents assigned to the operation hadn't slept for 48 hours. According to reports the merchandise kept at the "Buenos Aires Warehouse" was to have been picked up by a drug trafficker identified as Adrian Flores. This name, however, could be false. Judge Galeano said he was "very satisfied" with the results of the investigation, and praised the policemen's performance in helping solve the case. When the policemen took apart the doors, they realized that 8 kg of highly pure cocaine were hidden inside each door, though some doors were heavier than others. The court officials pointed out that more raids and arrests will result from the operation, because the gang probably has connections in Jujuy Province and in other regions of the country.
