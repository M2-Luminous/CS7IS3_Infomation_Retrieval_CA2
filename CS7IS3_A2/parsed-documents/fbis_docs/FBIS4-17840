For the Sake of the State"] [Text] At the news conference in Kiev, leaders of Ukraine's Socialist Party were not as confident as Communists, but they did not look too depressed either, as, according to them, they had received 15 mandates in the parliament. Moreover, leader of Ukraine's Socialist Party and twice [dvichi] deputy O. Moroz stated that the party had been faced with two variants of choosing their further fate. First, a variant that would be advantageous for the party, which does not have a single representative in the power structures and may, therefore, quietly assume tough opposition to the present authorities that have nothing much to be proud of. However, the Fourth Extraordinary Congress of Ukraine's Socialist Party voted for the other unremunerative variant in accordance with which the party, for the sake of building the state and preventing the economic collapse, will seek contacts with all political forces capable of constructive compromise. In O. Moroz's opinion, the main result of the elections is an open regionalization of our society in terms of political convictions: The west -- in favor of Nationalists and National Democrats; and the east, center, and south -- mainly supporting left-wingers. "Not a single presidential candidate can bring all of these moods to agreement," said O. Moroz and acknowledged the fact that National Democrats (Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka] and the Ukrainian Republican Party) are also worried by the radicalization of the right-wing center. O. Moroz tactfully failed to note that the same had happened to the left-wing center. Nominated as a presidential candidate, O. Moroz openly said this about his goals: "If we win, we will implement the program of the Socialist Party. We will build an independent and strong democratic state with a socially oriented economy. We will build a people's democratic republic." He also pointed out that Socialists were not against privatization in general, but that they protested against its today's antipeople variant, which does not promote economic efficiency, but enriches a small group of dodgers.
