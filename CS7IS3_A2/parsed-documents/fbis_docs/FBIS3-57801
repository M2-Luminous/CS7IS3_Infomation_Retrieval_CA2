Finland's negotiating tactic has been to waste as little gunpowder as possible on the easier issues so that there would be enough of a charge left to defend interests of national importance to us in the farm sector and rural policy. This in itself also problematic negotiating tactic and the order in which issues are being dealt with seem to have produced the false impression on some people that Finland's negotiations are progressing too well and that we are not defending our interests in Brussels as determinedly as the other countries engaged in negotiations. But then they forget that for Sweden, for example, agriculture is not a particularly problematic negotiating issue. Sweden is probably closer to the conclusion of negotiations than Finland, even though superficially this does not yet seem to be the case. The starting shot for the negotiations on agriculture will, in a manner of speaking, be fired tomorrow, when the EU Commission for the first time officially assumes a position on Finland's goals for its farm sector. According to preliminary reports on the preparations being made by EU officials that have leaked out, the Commission is adopting a very negative position on our goals for agriculture, especially the transitional periods and a regional subsidies for South Finland's farmers. Since the Commission's position is to be made public very soon, the wisest thing for politicians to do would be to wait for it, not to go ahead and jump to all sorts of conclusions on the basis of reports and conjectures that are still inaccurate anyway. Unfortunately, many politicians, from the foreign minister to the presidential candidates, have hastened to make rash statements about one another and Finland's prospects in the negotiations. A broad consensus seems to be in jeopardy just when it is most sorely, in fact really needed for the first time. Hardly anyone assumes that Finland's grandiose goals for agriculture could be accepted as they stand. They are certainly acceptable as a starting point for negotiations. The status of agriculture affects national interests that are felt to be important. This will by no means be a pushover for Finland. In a speech he delivered in Strasbourg last week, President Mauno Koivisto uncompromisingly nailed down interests of vital importance to Finland. According to Koivisto, the transitional periods and the EC's present forms of support alone are not enough for Finland. The Community must also adapt the goals of its own agriculture policy to the special conditions prevailing in Finland, not just the opposite. This means, for example, new forms of support within the compass of which there will also be room for South Finland's grain farmers. It is impossible to agree to equating them with Central European farmers. Presumably, this will also be understood in Brussels. It would be even better understood if we were a bit more patient on the home front until the final positions are settled on.
