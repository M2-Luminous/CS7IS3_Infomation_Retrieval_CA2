The agreement came in talks between Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, and his German counterpart Rita Suessmuth here this morning. Qiao expressed his satisfaction with the growth of bilateral relations since the two countries established diplomatic ties. He said recent years have witnessed rapid progress in bilateral ties, not only in economic trade, but also in culture, science, technology and education. Bilateral ties have progressed to a new stage especially after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited China last year, Qiao said. Qiao noted the growing relationship between China's NPC and the German Federal Assembly, explaining how two German vice-presidents visited China in the past and he is now the first NPC chairman to visit Germany. He expressed the belief that his visit will achieve successful results. During the talks, Qiao formally invited Suessmuth to visit China at a time convenient to her. Qiao also gave a full account of China's reforms and opening to the outside world, its economic construction and its legal system. He said over the past 15 years, China's economy has developed rapidly and people's living standards have improved greatly. The Chinese people can express their views freely, he stressed. Extending her warm welcome to Qiao, Suessmuth spoke highly of China's economic growth and progress in safeguarding its stability. Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC standing committee, participated in the talks.
