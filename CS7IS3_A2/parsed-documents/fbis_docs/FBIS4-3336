In a greeting letter sent to the meeting, Vice Premier Li Lanqing represents the State Council and congratulates the successes achieved since the promulgation of the law 10 years ago. He says in the letter: The past decade was a period in which the Patent Law was implemented along with the policy of reform and opening up. During this decade, China's formerly nonexistent patent system has developed rapidly from a small one into a big one. After the law was amended in 1993 in particular, the level of China's protection for patents has basically reached that of the world. This law not only has implemented the party's policy of respecting knowledge and intellectuals and significantly aroused the zeal of scientists, technicians, and the masses to engage in inventions, but also has created a good legal environment and good legal conditions for carrying out reforms, opening up to the outside world, bringing in foreign capital, and launching joint ventures and cooperative projects. Li Lanqing continues: As economic and scientific-technological competition has become increasingly vigorous among countries today, protection for patents and intellectual property rights has become increasingly important, and governments of all countries are attaching great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights. This issue has become an important part of all countries in promoting foreign economic relations, trade, and diplomacy. The Chinese Government also attaches great importance to this issue, and the "Decision on Strengthening the Protection for Intellectual Property Rights" which the State Council will soon promulgate will be instrumental for China to intensify its efforts in protecting patents and intellectual property rights in China. Thus, as our reforms continue to proceed, our opening up policy continues to broaden, and our socialist market economic system continues to improve, we must waste no time in intensifying our efforts in protecting patents and intellectual property rights. We must intensify our efforts in publicizing and enforcing the Patent Law and in supervising its implementation, energetically heighten the whole society's patent awareness, especially the awareness of leading cadres of departments in charge of science, technology, economic affairs, and trade. We must make sure that issues relevant to patents and intellectual property rights are placed high on our agendas. Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and president of the Supreme People's Court, attended and addressed the meeting. He said: In the last decade, not only have we had a rather comprehensive Patent Law, which is up to advanced international standards, as well as other supporting regulations, but we have also made conspicuous and substantial headway in areas governing patent application, patent authorization, and patent protection. In a sense, the market economy is an economy based on law. The Patent Law is an important law for safeguarding the order of the market economy and protecting fair competition. The trend of development over the past several years shows that people have become increasingly aware of the importance of using legal measures to safeguard patent owners' legitimate rights and interests, to stop patent infringements, and to prevent patent disputes; and that tasks in protecting patents have become increasingly arduous. Ren Jianxin urged people's courts and patent offices at all levels to work even closer, train more personnel specializing in patent protection, intensify efforts in handling cases about patent infringement, strictly punish patent violators, and fairly handle each and every case of patent dispute so as to safeguard China's patent system and create a new situation for patent protection. Present at the meeting were Fei Xiaotong and Wu Jieping, vice chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee; comrades in charge of the NPC Committee for Education, Science, Culture, and Health; comrades in charge of the NPC Standing Committee's Law Committee; comrades in charge of relevant departments and committees of the State Council; and representatives from legal circles and some enterprises in the capital.
