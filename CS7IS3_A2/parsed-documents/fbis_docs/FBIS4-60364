Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen is at the Knesset. Good evening 'Imanu'el. What is the meaning of the Israeli threat to defer the negotiations? Is it not a fact that the Gaza and Jericho autonomy are not going to be deferred? [Rosen] Since it is obvious to everyone that the Gaza and Jericho agreement cannot be taken back to square one, Israel is threatening with whatever it can. But since no date has been set for the next stage of the negotiations, the so-called early empowerment [preceding two words in English] in the West Bank, the threat is not too critical or daunting. Tonight we heard Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser, utter some very intriguing criticism, which can be interpreted as criticism of the prime minister himself. Neriya told us tonight: They are picking on trivial things; you cannot expect 'Arafat to reiterate his commitment every day; everyone is aware of the importance of the spoken word in the Arab world. Neriya further said: They are being swept by public trends, perhaps even by the right wing. [passage omitted]
