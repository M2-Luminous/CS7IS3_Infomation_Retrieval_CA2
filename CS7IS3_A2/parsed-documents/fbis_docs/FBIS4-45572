Thanong was travelling in a six-wheel truck with another man when police at a checkpoint in Chiang Rai's Mae Chan district signalled them to stop. The vehicle allegedly drove through the barricade. Police chased the vehicle, which they later found abandoned. The two men were running away. Thanong was arrested but his comrade is still at large. The weapons were found in the back of the truck hidden under a pile of pumpkins.
