FBIS3-76 "cr00000018594001" 30 March 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-044--PERSIAN GULF ARAB LEAGUE: BOYCOTT COMMITTEES LEAK REPORT Arab boycott offices will soon submit a report to the Arab League, according to a dispatch from Damascus published in the Kuwaiti daily AL-WATAN, alleging that the Israeli Government plans to take advantage of its Arab neighbors in comprehensive fashion. The dispatch enumerates the ways in which the plan is taking shape, and complains of U.S. and other governments' acquiescence to it. The Kuwaiti Arabic-language daily AL-WATAN carries an article from Damascus on 9 March 1994 by Safwan al-Bunni which summarizes a report the correspondent obtained which is purportedly to be submitted by the offices of the Arab boycott of Israel to the Arab League ministerial session "next month." Al-Bunni says the report reviews Israel's economy and Israeli moves to end the boycott. He claims the report will aver that Israel is striving for "a strategic political security plan which will "...permit Israel, quantitatively a small, weak country, to be a strong, large country with the stamp of a regional great power." He further quotes it as saying, "Israeli thinking is shifting to a superpower strategy with the goal of transforming itself into a regional superpower, which it would not be able to do without the solid start that it achieved with the implementation of projects described at the time as very ambitious." The report states that the necessary conditions for national security are military power supported by economic power, according to al-Bunni, and also claims Israel is trying to obtain U.S. aid in currency instead of goods, because of its belief that this type of investment will enable it to experience "a second industrial revolution." The report to the Arab league warns, says al-Bunni: That Israel turned to the arms trade in the Eighties because of the tremendous profits to be gained there, which were necessary to continue operating its military industries. That Greenpeace charged that Israel's production of methyl bromide for pesticides has caused 3 percent of the hole in the ozone layer and that its Bromine plant in the Negev Desert produces one third of the world's supply of this chemical. That an Egyptian diplomatic document claimed that Israel "still continues to steal water in the occupied territories in the Syrian Golan, southern Lebanon, and Jordan That the same Egyptian document said the Israelis are researching the water table near the Egyptian border and that they are planning to build 32 dams, "beginning at the headwaters of the Nile River in Ethiopia." That a joint U.S.-Israeli project will enable Israel to expand in the Mediterranean, that Israel is intensifying its exploitation of Jordan and Litani River waters, and that it is also making progress on the proposed Mediterranean-Dead Sea canal. That Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has affirmed that "Unified Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, is not negotiable, and is not on the agenda of the Israeli delegation's talks with the Palestinian delegation." According to al-Bunni, the report terms the 1982 law annexing Jerusalem and establishing it as Israel's capital as "the strategic guide for Israeli public policy" no matter which party leads the country. Turning to the Arab boycott of Israel itself, Bunni says that the report states that the United States has attempted to break it by various means, citing in particular remarks in March 1993 by Edward Djerejian, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs, to a Congressional committee that Secretary of State Warren Christopher had emphatically urged the Arab governments to end the boycott. The report also cites Jewish Agency sources on the poor prospects for significant immigration from the Commonwealth of Independent States and U.S. data on the emigration of Israelis to the United States over the last six years. The report, Bunni says, concludes by outlining the U.S. position on the boycott--that ending it is a positive move that supports the peace process--noting that the Japanese, Korean, and German Governments have bowed to U.S. pressure in the last two years, allowing their companies to do business in Israel.
