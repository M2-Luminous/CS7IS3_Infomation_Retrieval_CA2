Even the Prime Minister's acceptance of May 19 as the date of his meeting with President Clinton is being interpreted as a meek nod to the Americans' dictates. The government has only itself to blame if this impression gains ground in the context of the two-day meeting between Indian and US representatives at London. Despite the loud denials by the Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr R. L. Bhatia, two things are clear. The London meeting was a suggestion from the US carrying the force of an unrejectable proposal and the agenda of the meeting did pertain to the US insistence on India accepting a multilateral process for disarmament and regional security in South Asia. The May 19 summit is quite obviously designed to announce India's concurrence with the launching of the multi-lateral process, also known as the 5 + 2 + 2 Conference, without Mr Narasimha Rao giving the appearance of having been forced into it by deviating from India's declared nuclear policy of the past two decades. The camouflaging and sugarcoating may have been worked out in London where the Indian and American teams are giving shape and structure to the concept. India has refused to consider earlier proposals for regional security and de-nuclearisation of South Asia and has so far not accepted the 5 + 2 + 2--five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany and Japan and India and Pakistan--on the ground that nuclear disarmament is not a regional issue but a global problem. To be fair to the Government, Mr Narasimha Rao has so far yielded less ground on the nuclear policy front than on the economic front. In both, the options for India are not too many. Yet again, accepting to meet in a third country to chalk out a bilateral summit agenda defies logic, whatever the logistical advantages the authorities may have conjured up. India can duck the issues but cannot dare defy the superpower initiative. As far as domestic political fall out is concerned, Mr Narasimha Rao's negotiating skills are to be sharpened to successfully duck the issues. It can be done in two ways. First, India can ask for an enlarged conference on the problems of global arms control and rope in Russia, North Korea, Iran and a lot else into the proposed multi- lateral process. There is no dearth of Indian expertise and knowledge for this line of action. The second option, possibly less objectionable to the opposition at home, is to avoid any kind of specific commitments -- there are any number of technical details to be sorted out -- on the NPT and regional security proposals. The second option is not only available but also exercisable.
