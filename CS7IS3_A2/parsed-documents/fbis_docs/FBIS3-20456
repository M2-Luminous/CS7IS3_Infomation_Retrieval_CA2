Sharpening Political System Controversies (Part Two of Two) -- The Drafting Committee Passes the Two Ch'a [Ch'a Chi-ming and Cha Liang-yung] Plan, for Which Lu Ping and Li Hou Claim Not To Have Cast Supporting Votes Two months later, the [Basic Law] Drafting Committee met in full session at the Huayuan Hotel in Guangzhou, with its theme being to examine and vote on all drafts of the Special Group, in preparation for the Second Advisory Draft of the Basic Law. It was decided at this meeting that, in addition to voting one by one on the terms proposed by the Special Group, the Drafting Committee would first obtain the stipulated number of joint signatures, and then might set forth additional draft resolutions beyond the Special Group's drafts. Prior to this meeting, I had suggested to Ji Pengfei the possibility of holding a meeting of the Drafting Committee's party members, to reach a party consensus. Ji Pengfei had barely heard my suggestion when he told Li Hou and Lu Ping to individually "notify" the Drafting Committee's party members. The balloting showed an unexpected result, in that Cha Chi-min's [2686 3444 3046] motion was passed. Cha Chi-min's plan added four terms to Cha Liang-yung's plan for "examining" procedures for general elections by the whole people for the Fourth Session of the Chief Executive and the Fifth Session of LEGCO. These four terms were: 1) it must be approved by the majority of the legislators; 2) it must be endorsed by the Chief Executive; 3) it must be approved by the NPC; 4) it must be endorsed by a vote of over 30 percent of qualified voters. While Cha Chi-min's motion had certainly not aroused attention in advance, it was close in thinking to that of certain Drafting Committee members on the mainland and in the Hong Kong superstructure at the time, so that its passage was not unexpected. But when the public controversy over Cha Liang-yung's plan arose, with many holding it to be too "conservative," the two "Cha" plans were combined, turning out to be even more "conservative," which was certainly not expected by the Chinese leadership. After the Cha plan was passed, Lu Ping told Li Chu-ming [2621 2629 6900] that he had not guessed that Cha Chi-min's revised plan could win the two-thirds support, and that he had not voted in support of it. Li Hou also told reporters that he had abstained from voting. At this plenary session of the drafting committee, certain proposals of the special group were not approved, such as the motion on the SAR Government's fiscal policy, which did not win a two-thirds vote of the committee members in attendance, so was returned to the special group for redeliberation, and the proposals by committee members, such as T'an Yao-tsung [6223 5069 1350], on labor welfare, which were also not passed. It was guessed that the fiscal policy motion failed because it was voted against not only by several Hong Kong Drafting Committee members with close connections to the British Hong Kong government, but also by mainland committee members. The original plan of this draft had shown concern that the British Hong Kong government, in its 12 years of rule before its withdrawal, might change its past fiscal policy, by changing its tax rates and overreaching itself to build more public facilities, which would add more profitable construction-contract opportunities for British firms, while putting a heavier burden on Hongkongers. While the Basic Law could not interfere in fiscal policy during the British Hong Kong administration's tenure, it could still have a political impact to restrict it somewhat. As to this provision, not only had the British Government called for its revision more than once through diplomatic means, but certain drafting committee members from Hong Kong with close connections to the British Hong Kong government had also repeatedly proposed amendments to it in special group meetings. Certain mainland drafting committee members also dissented with it, their main concern being that it would tie the future SAR government's "hands," keeping them from acting in line with future realities. So while its failure was unexpected, it was also understandable. But the failure to pass of the labor welfare motion was very hard to understand. As the Hong Kong Drafting Committee members were weighted toward industrial and business circles, their votes against it were understandable. But as the mainland drafting committee members were mostly Communist Party members, their voting not in favor of it, but rather against it or abstaining, was unexpected. The substance of this motion was the right of Hong Kong workers to strike, as well as matters such as collective bargaining between labor and capital, and the establishment of a central accumulation fund. As the PRC Constitution did not have a provision on strikes, some advocated that Hong Kong should not either. But I supported the "left faction" labor union view, advocating that the Basic Law should list the right of Hong Kong workers to strike. Prior to this plenary session of the drafting committee, I had discussed the matter with Ji Pengfei, noting that Hong Kong was a capitalist world where strikes were a very important weapon in struggles between labor and capital. While strikes are a method of last resort that should not be applied lightly, we should not deprive workers of this important right. Collective bargainaing is also very important, as it is the only way to enable workers to rely on their united strength to obtain successful terms in negotiations with capital. Moreover, as most Hong Kong workers were not organized, with "left," "center," and "right" labor unions decentralizing working class unity, collective bargaining laws and regulations as grounds for negotiating with capital could relatively increase organizational might. Of course, in resolving labor-capital disputes, it is also necessary to adhere to the principle of [protecting] the rights of both labor and capital, by not overdoing things. As Hong Kong's labor welfare was insubstantial, with no retirement safeguards, the central accumulation fund was a legitimate demand for resolving the matter, so that we should have supported it in principle. While a central accumulation fund would certainly be hard to implement, it could be accomplished through flexible means. Unless the Basic Law included this principle, it would be impossible to safeguard workers' elementary rights, with the decreased worker support for the Basic Law being unfavorable to Hong Kong's social stability and prosperity. While Ji Pengfei had endorsed all of this at the time, the motion still was not approved. After this meeting, Ji Pengfei called a meeting of the party's directors, deputy directors, secretaries, and deputy secretaries to discuss the meeting, where all were essentially satisfied with the outcome of the balloting, as most of the motions that should have passed did, while the ones that we hoped would not basically did not. While Cha Chi-min's bill was unexpected, it was certainly not the final plan, so could still be amended through certain procedures. As to the fiscal policy, Li Hou and others took the initiative to suggest striving to amend certain words, and then asking for another vote. As to the labor welfare proposal, I asked Ji Pengfei, Li Hou and others to work on persuading mainland committee members to support it in future voting, especially emphasizing that "the Basic Law must not disappoint Hong Kong workers," which Ji Pengfei agreed to. But after the 4 June incident, at the final Plenary Session of the Drafting Committee, when the Basic Law draft was voted on, the item on "collective bargaining" was still not adopted. As I had already been declared retired and transferred back to the mainland at the time, I was no longer taking part in the internal meetings on Hong Kong and Macao hosted by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, so had no way of knowing really why this item was not adopted.
