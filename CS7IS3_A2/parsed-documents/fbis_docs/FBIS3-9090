Last night and this morning the Serb aggressors opened fire on all defense lines in the Bihac part of the battlefield and on the Grmusa-Srbljani plateau. Several defenders were killed in the bestial shelling. Karadzic's terrorists intensified combat actions in the Bihac region zone of responsibility of the Croatian Defense Council, particularly in the [name indistinct] part of the battlefield, where they tried to infiltrate commando units. The units were routed in an energetic action by our fighters, but unfortunately several of them were killed in the fighting. Actions by joint forces of the paramilitary formations of the Kladusa autonomy and chetniks from the so-called Krajina continued last night. Using 120-mm mortars, mountain artillery pieces and antiaircraft weapons they continued destroying the area of Cazin, and the villages of Skrivaja, Viskovac and Hatici. A large number of defenders and civilians, who are still fleeing this area from Fikret's demented blood-thirsty phalanges, were killed in this round of fighting. Also last night, Karadzic's terrorists, using howitzers and mortars, shelled Bihac, Cazin, and their suburbs. Two people were seriously wounded; eight others suffered only minor injuries. Fresh material destruction is considerable.
