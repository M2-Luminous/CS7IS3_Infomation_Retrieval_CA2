Consequently, the major world powers should have played the expected role in the face of the mass murder operations carried out by the occupation troops and the settlers, who are backed by the Tel Aviv government. The paper adds: We expected decisive and serious measures to put an end to the policy of murder, terrorism, and forced expulsion that Israel is practicing against our people in the occupied territories. The paper blames the world's big powers for not taking serious measures against the Israelis, who have continued to commit more massacres and terrorist acts. The paper stresses that in order to see a successful end to the peace process and the achievment of its desired objectives, an end must be put to the Israeli disdain for international legitimacy and its resolutions. These resolutions should also be implemented, particularly those relating to the complete and comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. The paper stresses that peace will remain distant from the region as long as Arab territory remains occupied. The paper concludes by saying: The facts of the conflict in the region should be dealt with in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. Only in this way can peace be established and the region escape the state of tension that it has been living with for half a century.
