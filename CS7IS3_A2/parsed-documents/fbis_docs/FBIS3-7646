Minister Kim was in Beijing as a member of the official suite of President Kim Yong-sam presently on a state visit to China. As an initial project of joint environmental programs, the two countries would soon inaugurate a joint Yellow Sea study team to work out ways to control Yellow Sea contamination. In the aeronautical area, South Korea and China would jointly develop knowhow on airplane design with a view to producing mid-sized airplanes in a joint scheme.
