Delivering his government work report at the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress, Li said that British colonial rule in Hong Kong is coming to an end and that no force can stop that. The day is drawing near when China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, he said. As it has been doing all along, the Chinese Government will go on preparing for a smooth transition and smooth transfer of government in both places, in accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region and relevant resolutions of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, the premier said. Li noted China and Portugal have cooperated well on the question of Macao. However, talks between the representatives of the Chinese Government and the British Government on arrangements for 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong have terminated, a consequence for which the British side must bear full responsibility. In accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, he said, the preliminary working committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has begun its work. Li urged the preliminary working committee to unite with Hong Kong compatriots on the broadest basis and do good preparatory work for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its first government and legislature. In the part of his report subtitled "Promoting the Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland," Li said China shall follow unswervingly the principle of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems." After reviewing the progress of relations between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits, Li Peng said, "we maintain that differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits should be settled through increased contacts and consultations." "It is the common aspiration of all the Chinese people to achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland, any act or attempted act of secession, no matter in what form, will be in vain," he said. Li Peng said, "we place high hopes on the Taiwan authorities and still higher hopes on the people of Taiwan. We hope the Taiwan side will attach great importance to the overall interests of the nation and join us in developing relations across the straits and working for peaceful reunification."
