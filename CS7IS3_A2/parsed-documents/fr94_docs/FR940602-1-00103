There are differences in the permitting process for new and interim status combustion facilities, which stem from the original composition of the regulated community in 1980 when EPA first promulgated the RCRA Subtitle C regulations. At that time, Congress granted existing facilities interim status if they complied with notification and application requirements, so they could continue operating while pursuing a permit. Anyone proposing a new facility now had to obtain a permit prior to construction. This distinction between existing and proposed facilities led to differences in the permitting procedural requirements for combustion units. For example, existing combustion facilities that have interim status must conduct a trial burn prior to permit issuance, whereas proposed facilities must obtain a permit before they may construct the combustion unit and then conduct a trial burn. a. Current trial burn procedures for permitted combustion facilities. The trial burn procedures for new combustion units are currently set forth in §270.62(b) for incinerators, and §270.66(c) for BIFs. These regulations require new hazardous waste incinerators and BIFs to submit trial burn plans with their initial Part B permit applications. The actual trial burn is conducted after: (1) The public has reviewed and commented on the permit application; (2) the permitting authority has reviewed and approved the permit application; and (3) the facility has constructed the combustion unit. The permitting authority uses the results of the trial burn to determine whether a facility can meet the applicable performance standards and, if it does, to establish the final operating conditions in the permit that enable the facility to comply with those standards. The facility or the permitting authority must initiate changes to the trial burn plan through the permit modification procedures in §§270.41 through 270.42 (see Section B. Permit Modification Procedures). The permitting authority must approve any modifications before the facility can implement them. Where results of a trial burn show non-compliance with performance standards, a facility would typically be required to either: (1) revise the trial burn plan to test new conditions; or (2) submit a request to the permitting authority to modify the permit to permanently exclude the conditions that resulted in non-compliance. Both the permit review/ determination process and the permit modification process have built-in opportunities for public involvement, including procedures for appealing decisions made by the permitting authority. b. Current trial burn procedures for interim status combustion facilities. The trial burn procedures for interim status combustion units are currently in §§270.62(d) and 270.66(g). These requirements are not as detailed as the requirements for new combustion facilities, although it is common practice for owners/operators of interim status facilities to follow many of the requirements for new facilities. For example, the interim status regulations in §§270.62(d) and 270.66(g) require facilities to submit the results of the trial burn before permit issuance, but do not explicitly state that facilities must receive permitting agency approval of the trial burn plan before conducting the burn. The procedures for interim status and new combustion facilities differ in other areas. Contrary to permitted facilities, interim status facilities do not have a permit during the trial burn stage; thus, the permit modification procedures do not apply. As a consequence, the permitting agency currently does not have the same authority to regulate post-trial burn changes by interim status facilities as it does for new combustion facilities, especially in the case of incinerators [BIFs are more highly regulated under interim status]. Unlike the requirements for new facilities, there is no opportunity for public involvement in the permitting process for interim status combustion facilities until after the facility has conducted the burn and the permitting agency issues the draft permit. EPA believes that many of the requirements for new combustion facilities are appropriate for interim status facilities; the Agency proposes to change the regulations to apply some of these requirements specifically to interim status facilities. It is the Agency's intent, in changing the regulations, to ensure protection of human health and the environment and provide a greater opportunity for public involvement in the permitting process. 4. Discussion of Proposed Permitting Requirements for Trial Burns EPA is proposing to consolidate the permitting procedural requirements for interim status combustion facilities by moving the incinerator and BIF interim status permitting requirements, found in §§270.62(d) and 270.66(g), to proposed §270.74. In addition, EPA is proposing to amend these requirements to make them more equivalent to the permitting requirements for new combustion units. EPA believes that consolidating the permitting requirements for interim status combustion facilities and distinguishing them from the requirements for permitted facilities will simplify the interim status trial burn process. The consolidation and movement into proposed §270.74(a) and (b) will not change the majority of the regulatory language in the existing provisions. However, EPA is proposing additional language that will make interim status permitting procedures more consistent with new facility permitting procedures and expand the opportunities for public participation. EPA is also revising provisions for submitting data in lieu of a trial burn, §270.19 for incinerators and §270.22 for BIFs, to reflect actual Agency practice. As currently written, this waiver, which the permitting agency can grant to either permitted or interim status units, could be seen as relatively open-ended; yet, in actual practice, permitting authorities have allowed facilities to use the provisions only under a narrow range of circumstances. EPA believes that granting the waiver only under a narrow range of circumstances is appropriate for the reasons discussed below and, therefore, is proposing to revise this provision to specifically restrict application to this narrow range. This revision to the regulatory language will ensure consistency among permit writers. It could also benefit facilities in the following way. The proposed rule will make explicit the strict circumstances under which a permitting agency will grant a waiver. Once a facility knows these circumstances, it will not misuse its resources in compiling a waiver request that the permitting agency will not grant; instead, the facility can focus its resources on developing a trial burn plan. EPA is concerned that units constructed at different locations at different times, or with slight design or operating differences, may not perform in an identical manner. For example, if the locations are at different altitudes, the differences in atmospheric pressure could affect the performance of the units. In addition, there would likely be different operators running the units at different locations; thus, the units may not be operated in an identical manner. The Agency believes that the theory of submitting data from other units in lieu of conducting a trial burn is sound; however, sufficient data is not available to ensure that the theory could be applied to real world situations without imposing strict limitations. EPA believes that most combustion units will need to conduct trial burns in order to develop operating conditions that ensure compliance with the performance standards. To this end, EPA is proposing today to codify EPA's current policy by making the following changes: (1) Replace ``sufficiently similar'' with ``virtually identical''; and (2) specify that the units must be located at the same facility. The ``data in lieu of'' provision, therefore, would not apply to mobile treatment units when moved from site to site, since they would not be located at the same facility.
