Organisers were hoping for between 100,000 and 300,000 supporters on the march through Paris in a demonstration called before Thursday's Constitutional Court ruling annulled a controversial education bill that granted unlimited use of public funds to the country's private, mainly Roman Catholic schools. The court ruled that the central article of the bill was unconstitutional because it upset the balance between the state and private school systems. The protest was expected to attract teachers, students and parents' associations, trade unionists and freemasons as well as socialists and communists. The court ruling was the left's first victory over the conservative premier since its crushing defeat in general elections last March, and the opposition Socialist party hopes to use the march as a springboard to revive its political fortunes. In an effort to soothe passions unleashed by France's long-running "school wars," Balladur indicated Friday that he wanted to launch a public debate on "the future of the public education system," its funding and organisation. Socialist leader Michel Rocard is eager to capitalise on the win as his party prepares for a series of conferences aimed at building a broad centre-left coalition ahead of next year's presidential election. Rocard termed the ruling a "victory" for the left and renewed his calls for a big turnout on Sunday. Balladur, who had come under fire from both left and right after the education bill was rushed through the senate last month in the middle of the night, beat a hasty retreat after the court ruling. Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said it would be "imprudent" to submit a new education bill for the moment while Education Minister Francois Bayrou called for "dialogue" and said he wanted to "restore the self-confidence of the state education system."
