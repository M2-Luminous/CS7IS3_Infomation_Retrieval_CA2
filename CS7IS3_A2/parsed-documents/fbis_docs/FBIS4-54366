Shipments also scored the first growth in four quarters with a 1.9 percent climb, MITI said. But the readings do not mean Japan's industrial activity recovered fully, a MITI official said, citing seasonal factors in the reporting quarter. In the January-March period last year, industrial output also turned higher as corporations stepped up manufacturing activity before closing their book March 31, the official said. Inventories dropped 1.9 percent in the first quarter for the second straight quarterly fall. The inventory-to-sales ratio declined 4.2 percent, the first decline in three quarters, MITI said.
