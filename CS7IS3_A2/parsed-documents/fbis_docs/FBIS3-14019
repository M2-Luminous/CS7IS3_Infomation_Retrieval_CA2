This agreement was expressed in the joint communique issued by the foreign secretaries of both countries in Islamabad on 3 January after the two-day talks. Mr. Shaheryar Khan, Pakistan's foreign ministry secretary, said that additional talks at any level will be hold only after the situation in occupied Kashmir improves and the practice of human rights violation is ended. Mr. J. N. Dixit, the Indian foreign secretary, referred to his meeting with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on 2 January in his briefing to the Indian news correspondents and hinted that he expected the prime ministers of India and Pakistan to meet in the near future. To pave way for the leaders' meeting, one or two divisions of the Indian army now in Kashmir will be transferred to another area. There is also the possibility of giving permission to the representatives of some international human rights agencies to visit Kashmir and stay in Srinagar. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has decided to call a conference of the leaders of Indian political parties this month to see how far India should move towards conciliation when the Pakistani prime minister visits Delhi. The Indian prime minister will also discuss the proposal suggested by the United States, Europe, and Japan to put Kashmir under UN administration and establish a caretaker government under a UN appointed administrator with representatives from all Kashmiri groups in this proposed conference. A Kashmiri leader who supports independence of Kashmir has returned after finishing his jail term in Belgium. He is busy assuring Pakistani leaders that the proposed independent Kashmir will have the same relationship with Pakistan as is between a younger and elder brother. Although it was Pakistan's prominent lawyer S.M. Zaffar who defended and won freedom for Amanullah Khan, chairman of Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), from the Belgian jail, the JKLF members believe that moral support from more than one Western nations played an important part in this release. The JKLF chairman appeared in Islamabad when the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan were holding talks, and began to publicize his proposal of an independent Kashmir through his speeches and statements in the newspapers. Mr. Amanullah Khan said in an interview that Pakistan was not in a position to get all of Kashmir through diplomatic pressure or the use of strength. That is why the JKLF is demanding an independent Kashmir. The JKLF believes that the proposed independent Kashmir will always be a friend of Pakistan and it will have the same attitude as of a younger brother. The younger brother will want to have a defense pact with the elder brother and will assure that river water coming from Kashmir will always keep the great land of Pakistan green and fertile. Referring to historical records, the JKLF chairman recalled that when Quaid-e Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah had talked about the independence of states, he had presented the case of freeing former Hyderabad in the U.N. Security Council and had recognized the right of states to independence. Dr. Mehbub-ul Haq, a former finance minister in Pakistani government, is also in Islamabad after visiting the United States. He is advocating putting Kashmir under UN administration for the interim period. When the announcement to hold talks with India at foreign secretaries level were made while the curfew was still imposed in Srinagar's Hazratbal shrine and human rights were still being violated rampantly in occupied Kashmir, the rationale was given that the consortium of the nation that was to issue aid and loan to Pakistan was meeting the following month and Pakistan's request would be considered with full sympathy. Despite any progress in the talks that concluded on 3 January in Islamabad, since our government has promised to continue this series of talks, it is expected that we will be rewarded and new loans worth two or two and one-half billion dollars will be approved. It should be remembered that our foreign ministry had announced India was being given a last opportunity through the Islamabad talks. The leaders of Pakistan should not make statements on declare positions that they cannot keep or make promises they cannot fulfill. Such caution will assure that Pakistani people are not embarrassed again. Pakistan perhaps is relieved to hear that the Indian foreign secretary did not refuse to discuss the Kashmir issue. He was also pressured as the United States, some European nations, and Japan had insisted on starting discussions on Kashmir. India could not deny their order. These nations are investing nine billion dollars annually in India and it was important to obey them to make sure the investment continued to flow in. Perhaps India will tell these investors that the order to start negotiations has been fulfilled and it is their responsibility now to admonish Pakistan and prepare it for some understanding. The two points of understanding that are being publicized are mentioned in beginning of this article. Kashmir is basically the problem of the Kashmiri people and the majority of them live in occupied Kashmir. The people of that region are the ones that are fighting and making all kinds of sacrifices. It would be appropriate if Pakistan finds out from the freedom fighters if they approve the idea of an independent Kashmir or a Kashmir under the UN administration. There are 37 groups in occupied Kashmir and they have formed the All Parties Hariat Conference. If the United States convinces most of the groups in this organization to let Kashmir be put under the UN administration, it would be impossible for Pakistan to retain its declared stand after that. Pakistan will have to change its stand and face the embarrassment that will go with it. If the majority of the conference insisted on a referendum, then it will be important to know whether the proposed referendum will be limited to the choices of joining India or Pakistan or will there be additional options. If the Kashmiris are the ones who will give the opinion and the decision on Kashmir's future will be made according to their wishes then it is their right to increase the choices for a referendum. The United Nations will also have to accept their wishes. The United States will be very happy if the Kashmiris decide to remain under the United Nations for five or six years before the referendum is taken. India will not be any less pleased as it would get rid of a major problem. *
