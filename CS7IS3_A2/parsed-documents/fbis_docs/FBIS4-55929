In his opinion, the news items have nothing to do with reality, are "outrageous and directed against the state's interests." Kolodziejczyk added that this is not the first time when such a thing happens prior to his important foreign visits. He recalled his meeting with the German minister of defence. Now, Kolodziejczyk is going to leave for Brussels to meet NATO defence ministers and talk with the U.S. secretary of defence and the Baltic states' defence ministers.
