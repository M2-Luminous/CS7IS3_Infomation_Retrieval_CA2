A more serious programme of cooperation is needed to correspond to Russia's status and special conditions in which we will carry out partnership with NATO," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said. In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday, Kozyrev said that "our cooperation cannot be the same as with middle and small European countries." "We believe that there must not be deviation towards NATO-centrism or NATOmania. With all our respect for that organisation we proceed from the fact that it is only one of many which exist on the continent," Kozyrev said. He said Russia will present NATO at the end of May with its own concept of European security. The minister stressed that this will not be an alternative to the Partnership for Peace. Russia's position on that matter will be outlined by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at a meeting with NATO defence ministers on May 24, Kozyrev said.
