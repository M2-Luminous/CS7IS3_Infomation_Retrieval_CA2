FBIS TRENDS-I4Apr94-Russia-US Moscow Condemns NATO Gorazde Strike, Lack of Consultation Moscow Condemns NATO Gorazde Strike, Lack of Consultation SUMMARY Stressing their pique at NATO's failure to consult with Moscow in advance of airstrikes against Bosnian Serb positions, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, government officials, and legislators from across the political spectrum have condemned the raids as ill-advised and likely to escalate the bloodshed in Bosnia. Media commentary echoed these sentiments and warned that the NATO actions could adversely affect Russian internal politics and U.S.-Russian relations. END SUMMARY Yeltsin was strongly critical of NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde and accused NATO and the United States, in particular, of failing to consult in advance with Russia. Yeltsin said in an 11 April press interview that "I have insisted and I insist now" that "questions such as bombing strikes against Serbian positions must not be decided" without prior U.S.-Russian consultations. He told reporters that during a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton early that morning he had made the same point about consultations "again and again." Insisting that any such action should be taken only "in accordance with UN decisions," Yeltsin complained that the telephone call had not clarified whether the UN Secretary General had given the "go-ahead" for the strikes and declared that Russia, "without a doubt," wanted the Security Council to discuss the issue (Ostankino TV, 11 April, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 April). Stressing Russia's preference for continued negotiations, Yeltsin told reporters in Madrid on 12 April that a settlement in Bosnia "must come through political negotiations and not through force" which could lead to "everlasting war" and that the blame for such an outcome would "rest with those who took the decision" on the strikes. At the same time he noted that the shooting in Gorazde had stopped and expressed the hope that the bombing "will not, after all, lead to greater confrontation and greater bloodshed." Continuing to display annoyance at what he termed "discrimination against Russia," however, Yeltsin emphasized that consultations would be held with the UN Secretary General and President Clinton "so that this does not happen again" (Moscow TV, ITAR-TASS, 12 April). Other Government Reaction Other Government officials displayed similar irritation at the lack of consultation and expressed fears that the air strikes would jeopardize the peace negotiations and lead to a wider conflict. Notably some officials criticized the Serbs as well as the Bosnian Muslims: -- Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called the air strikes "a big mistake and a great risk." He told reporters that Russia was "worried" that the air strike decision "was made in a hurry" without considering "possible consequences," noting that this was why consultations were needed. Warning like Yeltsin that the air strikes could result in an "escalation of the conflict instead of its suppression," he said he had "expressed his profound concern" to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that the world could be "engulfed in an exchange of blows" and had urged the West "to display the utmost restraint." Pointing to diplomatic efforts with the Serbs made by special envoy Vitaliy Churkin, Kozyrev called the air strikes "especially annoying" because by 2 April he claimed there were "already signs of a political settlement" (ITAR-TASS, 11 April). -- Churkin criticized the UN and NATO for failing to consult with Russia about their actions. Warning that UN and NATO "interference" in the conflict was leading to a "greater confrontation," he said that he was trying to work with the Bosnia Serbs "to bring together the fragments of a Bosnian peace settlement." Churkin accused the Muslims of being the first to "initiate combat activities in Gorazde" despite the fact that it was a UN "safety zone," but also faulted the Bosnian Serbs for misleading him as to their intentions (ITAR-TASS, 11 April). -- Ministry press spokesman Grigoriy Karasin stressed that Russia "will never reconcile itself to the role of a so-called junior partner, who is informed after the event about such decisions." He said Russia was "opposed to the practice of being consulted only to obtain a yes" (Moscow radio, 12 April). -- Interfax (11 April) cited an unnamed "high-ranking diplomat" as saying that Moscow's reaction to the bombardment of Serb positions "will be tough" if it discovered that the strikes could have been "avoided." He complained that Russia was not a "banana republic" and as a permanent member of the UN Security Council would not accept being informed about decisions to use force in Yugoslavia as a "fait accompli." He also claimed that the Muslims had "provoked" the Serbs' military actions in Gorazde and that attacks on the Serbs would only "make them unwilling to negotiate." An 11 April Russian Foreign Ministry statement complained that Moscow had been informed of the air strikes only "after the event" and said Russia continued to await "full information" about what has happened from the UN leadership. The statement called for the implementation of "urgent measures" around Gorazde including the deployment of UN forces, the withdrawal of Serbs from their present positions, and the demilitarization of the area, including the disarmament of Muslim forces (ITAR-TASS, 11 April). Legislature Condemns the Attack Predictably, the Russian legislature, many of whose members have for months been attacking the government for cooperating with the West on Bosnia and for giving insufficient support to the Serbs, opposed the NATO air strikes. Leaders from across the political spectrum voiced disapproval: -- Yeltsin supporter and Federation Council chairman Vladimir Shumeyko called the strikes "unjustified at this point" and criticized the United States for openly showing support for one side while "punishing" the other side (ITAR-TASS, 11 April). -- Duma Speaker and Agrarian Party member Ivan Rybkin issued a statement on behalf of the Duma demanding "an immediate end" to NATO's "unilateral, unsanctioned use of force," complaining that NATO has "easily ignored not only Russia's view," but also the "achieved agreements," and that its action "threatens to ruin" prospects for a peaceful political settlement (ITAR-TASS, 12 April). -- Sergey Shakhray, co-chairman of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES) charged that conducting the air strikes without consulting Russia was a "slap in the face" to Yeltsin and would have an adverse effect within Russia, creating, indirectly, a "telling strike against Russian reforms" and benefitting "the national patriots" (Moscow radio, 12 April; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 13 April). -- Former Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin, a member of the moderately reformist Yavlinskiy bloc and chairman of the Duma's international affairs committee expressed "disappointment" at the "very unfortunate, badly timed" strikes which had occurred just when Russian diplomatic efforts were bringing results. He faulted the lack of "preliminary consultations" with Russia and called for convening the UN Security Council to determine if the attacks were in line with UN resolutions. While admitting that some Serb commanders "may have been at fault," he warned that the air strikes will "unavoidably complicate" the situation (ITAR-TASS, 12 April). -- The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), whose leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy had called for the bombing of NATO bases in Italy in retaliation, denounced the air strikes, warning of the possibility of unleashing world war in the Balkans and stating that the "Russian people support their Serb brothers" (ITAR-TASS, Interfax, 11 April). Media Reaction The Russian media across the political spectrum expressed regret at the air strikes, with most commentary expressing anger that Moscow was not consulted in advance, (See box) and some warning that NATO's actions were becoming a factor in Russia's domestic political struggle: -- The pro-Yeltsin newspaper Izvestiya tried to present a balanced view, expressing strong doubts about Serbian actions, but also warning that NATO's response would have unfavorable consequences for Russia. A front-page 12 April report filed from Belgrade maintained that the NATO attack "was to be expected." Saying that Russia had "repeatedly warned" the Bosnian Serbs, who had been "attacking" Gorazde for "the past two weeks," of the "danger of the situation," the article charged that the Serbs had assured Russia that there would be no "exacerbation of the situation," but "immediately broke their word." Another article the same day trenchantly observed that Belgrade only began extolling "Slav unity" after sanctions against Serbia were introduced and claimed that Serb diplomacy was mainly directed at pitting Russia against the West. A 13 April Maksim Yusin article titled "NATO Resolve and Serb Stubbornness Put Russian Diplomacy in Difficult Position," stressed that events are "taking a most undesirable turn for Moscow." Claiming that Russia had been "winning one diplomatic victory after another" when the stress was on negotiations, Yusin claimed that the Kremlin's ability to influence the situation was "very limited" once NATO-Serb hostilities began. Yusin warned that Russia's relations with the West "would be put to a new test" if NATO carried out more military operations, but he nonetheless concluded that Yeltsin "attaches too much importance" to ties to the United States and Western Europe to "put them at risk over the Serbs' inflexibility." -- A 13 April article in the independent reformist newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta condemned what it saw as the West's one-sided approach favoring the Bosnian Muslims and complained that the West is "apparently little concerned about the internal political complications" from such actions both for the Bosnian Serbs and in Russia. -- A 13 April article in the mass-circulation newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda titled "NATO'S Order: Kill the Serbs," faulted the U.S foreign policy for its "insolence" in demonstrating "unthinking support" and "clear favoritism" toward the Muslims, claiming that the U.S. "inability to compromise" had placed it "on a par' with the Bosnian Serbs. The article suggested that the air strikes were a reaction to Russia's "surprisingly flexible and fresh" diplomatic approaches, which had caught Washington "unawares" and charged that Washington, by "constantly" declaring "Russia must not abandon us," has "placed Russia in a difficult position." -- The pro-communist newspaper Pravda predictably adopted a shrill tone in a report titled "25 Minutes of War. World War III?" In a transparent effort to invoke Slav solidarity, the article quoted a Bosnian Serbian Orthodox priest, who, as a U.S. F-16 "Phantom" flew overhead, said "it is NATO, not God who is above us today" and "behaving as if it is above God." He asked why foreign aircraft were "roaring over Slav land," and charged that the UN is becoming "NATO's hostage." After complaining that the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact left no one to stop the bombing, the article asked if the "Balkan fuse" "lit by the flame of the Kremlin 'perestroyka'" would once again explode? Outlook Yeltsin and other government officials are clearly angered by NATO's lack of consultation prior to launching airstrikes against Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde, in part because the use of military force threatens to jeopardize Russia's role as a mediator with the Serbs in negotiations, but more importantly because this appears to indicate a continued refusal on the part of the United States to treat Russia as an equal partner. Apparently convinced that U.S. officials knew in advance of the Gorazde strike, the Russians regard the lack of prior consultation as a severe slight. Moreover, NATO's actions give ammunition to domestic critics of Yeltsin's policies of cooperation with the West. Box State Television Reaction Russia's two major state-run television networks, Ostankino and Russian Television (RTV), have run commentaries more critical of the NATO bombings than Russian official reaction. On 12 April RTV's Vesti aired a commentary by G. Shakhov which used the NATO bombings to argue against Russian participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative asserting that the airstrikes call into question NATO's suitability as a partner. Shakhov charged that U.S. President Bill Clinton "admitted" at a White House press conference that he had not informed Russian President Boris Yeltsin of the imminent airstrikes that were then "in preparation," which, according to Shakhov, created the impression that "the United States has decided to independently determine the fate of the peoples of Bosnia." This occurred, according to Shakhov, despite the fact that during the recent crisis in Sarajevo, it was a Russian diplomatic iniative which helped to avoid tragedy. It was this very initiative, according to Shakhov, which evoked the "irritation" of "certain circles" in Washington. As a result, these "circles" have decided to act henceforth "without any consultations with Russia." Shakhov concluded by questioning Russian participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative with a NATO which "ignores Russia's role as a great power and openly supports one of the sides to the [Bosnian] conflict." * This commentary was the third in a series of recent commentaries by Shakhov taking aim at the U.S. for unilateral foreign policy moves in areas which Russia considers to be within its sphere of influence. For a discussion of the other two, see the FBIS Trends of 6 April 1994, pages 23-25. Ostankino's Vladimir Grigoryev began his commentary by citing an editorial from the French newspaper, Le Monde. According to Grigoryev the editorial charged that NATO, which was formed as a restraining "shield," had become a "punishing sword," and that the airstrikes entailed a "radical change" in NATO's doctrine and strategy. Grigoryev then cited the Washington Post which, he claimed, asserted that despite NATO claims that the bombings were authorized by UN resolutions, this was a mere "pretext" for the "widespread and massive use of military air power." Noting comments by the U.S. officer in charge of NATO forces in Southern Europe to the effect that the airstrikes had destroyed three tanks, Grigoryev questioned why he did not take into account the "victims among the civilian population" and asserted that the airstrikes took place just as "signs of a possible political normalization" of the situation around Gorazde had appeared. He cited remarks by both Yeltsin and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev that there had been no prior consultation with Clinton or NATO officials and asserted that the bombing had taken place "in violation" of previously held agreements. He concluded by noting a UN announcement that henceforth airstrikes could take place without preliminary consultation with UN officials and asserted that this statement means "nothing but a further escalation" of the conflict.
