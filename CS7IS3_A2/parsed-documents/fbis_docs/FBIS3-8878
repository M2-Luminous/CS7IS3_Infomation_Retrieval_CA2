How do you view this new conflict between the president and your newspaper? [Cristoiu] Even if the decision belongs to the General Prosecuting Magistracy, I believe this is a new stupidity of the Cotroceni [Romanian Presidency], namely using this pretext to start a new campaign against the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. Let us not forget that there are most tense relations between our newspaper and the president. We have been under criminal investigation for quite some time following a personal request of the president and we were penalized, meaning that our journalists can no longer attend news conferences held at Cotroceni Palace, as if it were President Iliescu's personal property. Maybe this is a new pretext used to start a campaign against our newspaper. If a newspaper such as EVENIMENTUL ZILEI can intercept a telephone call from Cotroceni Palace, this means that any dumb spy can listen to what is being discussed at Cotroceni and find out even more about the head of the state! President Iliescu is taking his revenge on the person who drew his attention to this fact. This act of ours also has the purpose to drawing the attention of the public to the chaos currently prevailing in Romania. [Badicioiu] Mr. Cristoiu, it has been indicated that there is a person at Cotroceni Palace who supplies information to the EVENIMENTUL ZILEI and, now, there are attempts to eliminate this person... [Cristoiu] There is no such a person. Nobody is supplying us any secret information because, as a matter of fact, such a person would be useless, considering that the decisions taken by President Iliescu are taken by him alone, so we should have a person hiding inside the president's head, a sort of small devil, who could tell us what goes on in the president's head. We get our information through our specific means. Mrs. Nicolaescu, who was answering the phone, had a behavior that is unqualifiable for a person who is the chief of the cabinet of the head of state, meaning that she allows herself to make idiotic comments. Thus, instead her being removed from office, this criminal investigation was started against us! [Badicioiu] How do you view this formulation in the law on state security? [Cristoiu] Only now, we are beginning to realize that when the law is implemented, there are all kind of loopholes in it that allow evasion of the law. The same holds true for this law on state security. We are accused of disseminating information of a secret nature. I believe that this is the most aberrant affirmation possible, because when a newspaper can disseminate information of a secret nature, it means that the respective information has not been protected. Therefore, the first measure to be taken would be to protect such information. Instead of those who fail to protect such information being punished, those who publish them are attacked. Certainly, I agree that a high Army official should be punished if he supplies secret information to somebody. However, if the press got hold of this piece of information, I fail to see why it has to be punished rather than those who were entrusted to keep the respective information secret! [Badicioiu] Do you believe that the messages published in your paper damaged the image of the president? [Cristoiu] No, I do not think so. I believe that things are much simpler than that. Considering that I am aware of the state of affairs at Cotroceni, I understand how things work there. For the president, that was the greatest eulogy on his birthday because we were the only paper that published something positive. None of the pro-presidential newspapers bothered to report on the president's birthday. I believe that if I had worked with the DIMINEATA [presidential paper] I would have been given an award because I, using my own means, published a whole page -- just imagine! -- full of positive messages. I believe that Mrs. Nicolaescu made a big fuss and, just like Desdemona, complained to the president, and he, being a sensitive person when it comes to female company around him, got very angry. Probably, if we had not reported what the lady was chattering about, nothing would have happened. I believe that, from the president's viewpoint, it was some of the most successful reading for Ion Iliescu. Now, President Iliescu has to prove that he has a feeling for drama because, when a newspaper in Romania can intercept what is being discussed at Cotroceni, it means that the system of national defense is in the worst possible shape. Considering that humor often mixes with the tragic side of things, the president should close the entire affair and start taking internal protection measures. In any event, we have done an immense service to the president, because we drew his attention to the fact that, in spite of all the money that the electorate gives him to ensure his protection, talks in the Cotroceni Palace can be intercepted any time by anybody who wishes to do so.
