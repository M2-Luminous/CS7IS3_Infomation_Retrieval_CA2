At this meeting, attended also by a delegation from the Azerbaijan Republic, documents prepared on the smuggling of narcotic substances across borders, additional changes to the staff structure of liaison services of the Council of Border Troops Commanders, mutual principles of the material-technical equipment of border troops, the submission of an accounting of the 1993 costs of liaison services and a draft of costs for the first quarter of 1994, plans of the Commanders' Council and and their liaison services for the first half of this year, the time and places of regular meetings of the Commanders' Council, and other important questions were discussed. In connection with this, our correspondent met with Major General Iskender Allahverdiyev, Deputy Minister of National Security and commander of the border troops, and interviewed him. He said: "The Council of Border Troops Commanders will meet once a quarter and discuss questions pertaining to borders. Since the Azerbaijan Republic has also joined the CIS, it is natural that we participate in the planning of this organization. At present, Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Azerbaijan have established their own border troops, and other states of the former USSR are in the process of doing so. The need for our participation at this meeting also stems from the fact that borders between the CIS states are porous, and the organization of the defense of borders with non-foreign states cannot but disturb each of us. Certainly this disturbance also pertains to us, and one of the issues discussed at the Council's Ashgabat meeting was on the protection of state borders under conditions of mutual cooperation." The establishment of material-technical equipment on the borders was also widely discussed. As is known, the basic equipment used in protecting the borders is produced in Russia and other states. From this point of view, for the best organization of our borders, we have to cooperate on reaching compatibility with the CIS states. Finally, the passage of narcotic substances, weapons and other contraband products across borders was an important question of interest to all the states. Discussion of this question, which is not within the power of any one state to solve on its own, also aroused great interest among meeting participants. It remains to say that there is no foundation for the rumors being spread on the stationing of troops from another state on the borders of the Azerbaijan Republic. As for the recent quick visit to Baku of Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of Russian border troops, this had nothing to do with the issue. His journey was in connection with our borders with Russia. In general, Russia believes that we can protect our own border. [Seferli] General. Quite some time has passed since the border troops in our republic were established. What is the situation today? [Allahverdiyev] Certainly, in spite of all the difficulties, we are making progress and the border troops have been created. It goes without question that had there been no war, we would have been able to do this job much faster. Our zealous and brave specialist officers in the national army are fighting the enemy. Hopefully, after the war is ended the majority of them will return to the border troops. Our young officers are also maturing. There is a special faculty at the Bak All Forces Commanders' School which is training border officers. We are participating closely in its operations. From next year, more young officers will be sent to border detachments and take part in the creation of border troops. [Seferli] Our borders in the occupied territories have been destroyed by the enemy. As the result of brave attacks by our soldiers, a significant portion of our borders with the Islamic Republic of Iran have been liberated. How will the repair work in these territories be conducted? What kind of help will the CIS states offer? [Allahverdiyev] In fact, some of our borders are in very bad shape, but this is not to say that our borders cannot be protected. There has to be the technical means, meaning technical equipment, channels of communication, etc., for border protection. In the opinion of most of the participants at the meeting, barbed wire should not be strung across the borders again. Borders have to be protected in a civilized manner, as in the European countries. There is no doubt that there has to be political and economic stability in our countries for this; the appropriate laws have to be prepared and normal conditions for the protection of borders have to be created. In the border zone liberated from the enemy, engineering and technical equipment and buildings have been considerably damaged, and in some places buildings have been burned to the ground. Our border troops, in conjunction with our national army, have been restoring our borders as soon as they have been liberated. I would like to make use of this opportunity to say to your readers that the protection of borders is a matter for the state and all its people. If we do not believe in each other, on the contrary, if we hurl inappropriate accusations at each other, if we make our work more difficult, we will be unable to achieve the desired result. All of us, whether at the state level or at the level of the normal citizen, must help in the protection of our borders and help our border troops. All of us are obligated to give this help.
