In a statement on Friday CP MP Fanie Jacobs said the CP offices had received a large number of complaints from parents of first year students, who alleged their childrens' attendance had been brought about by a "form of intimidation". He said the university had defended the organisation of the meeting as being "voluntarily", but had also acknowledged the state president's speech was within the framework of first year students' welcoming and orientation programme. First year students were obliged to take part in orientation programmes during the orientation period, Mr Jacobs said. The university's irresponsible and insensitive conduct had raised the polarisation among parents to breaking point, he said. Tax payers' money, which kept universities running, had been abused to the benefit of Mr de Klerk and the National Party [NP] which seriously violated the principle of equal treatment of political parties, he added. In view of the unjustified promotion of the NP, the CP and Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] would soon apply to the university authorities to be granted the same opportunity to address first year students. Mr Jacobs also challenged Mr de Klerk to address a public meeting in the Potchefstroom town hall within the next few weeks which, he said, would indicate how little the state president's support was in the Western Transvaal.
