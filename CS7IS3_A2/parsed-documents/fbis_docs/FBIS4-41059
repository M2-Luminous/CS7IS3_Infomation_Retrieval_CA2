With only 221 votes for it, the draft, which was amended after its second reading a few days ago, failed to overcome the 226-vote hurdle. The major disagreement is the defence spendings. The Duma wants to keep them at the 40-trillion rouble level, while the upper chamber, the Federation Council, wants to increase the appropriations to 55 trillion.
