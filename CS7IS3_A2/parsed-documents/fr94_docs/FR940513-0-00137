FR940513-0-00137 FR940513-0-00034 The Commission's Light Bulb Rule currently requires manufacturers to disclose watts, light output in lumens and average laboratory life in hours for incandescent lamps, based on operation at the lamp's stated design voltage. 60 EPCA, as amended by EPA 92, on the other hand, states that: ``Labeling information for incandescent lamps shall be based on performance at 120 volts input, regardless of the rated lamp voltage.'' 42 U.S.C.A. 6294(a)(2((C)(i) (West Supp. 1993). 61 The statutory language and the comments received raise two issues that the labeling rules must address concerning voltage. First, should the rules require that the design voltage always be disclosed, or that the design voltage be disclosed only if it is other than 120 volts? Second, what labeling information ( i.e., which disclosures) must be based on tests conducted at 120 volts (regardless of the design voltage)? 60 16 CFR 409.1 n. 1. 61 Neither the EPA 92 amendments to EPCA nor the legislative history of the EPA 92 amendments define more specifically the labeling disclosures for incandescent lamps that must be based on operation at 120 volts. Virtually all the comments that discussed voltage agreed that it is an important element that affects operation of lamp products. Several comments agreed with the Commission's proposal to require that voltage be disclosed if the design voltage of the product (the voltage at which the product was designed by the manufacturer to operate) is other than 120. 62 None suggested that disclosure of voltage in labeling is necessary for lamps with a design voltage of 120. 63 62 See, e.g., NEMA (Supp), G&hyph;10, 10&hyph;11; ACEEE (Tr.), 38; Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 1; Philips (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 1. 63 See, e.g., ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 1. The issue of the voltage at which the required disclosures of watts, light output, life and energy efficiency should be based was the subject of considerable discussion during the Workshop. 64 Several industry representatives supported requiring disclosure of wattage, light output in lumens, and average laboratory life based on operation of the lamp at its design voltage, if the design voltage is other than 120. 65 They suggested that only the energy index ( i.e., lumens per watt) should be disclosed at 120 volts regardless of the lamp's design voltage. They argued that only the efficiency measure is covered by the requirement in EPCA that labeling disclosures for incandescent lamps be measured at 120 volts. 66 Other commentors contended, however, that for general service incandescent lamps the labeling rules should require that wattage, light output, life and energy index disclosures be made at 120 volts because most purchasers operate lamps at 120 volts and performance claims should be based on a uniform standard. 67 64 See Tr., 35&hyph;65. The discussion of this issue throughout the comments and Workshop transcript usually was directed specifically at general service incandescent lamps. In some instances, it was unclear whether the comments were meant to apply also to other lamp types. But, there are no references to this issue specifically pertaining to compact fluorescent lamps. 65 NEMA (Tr.), 39&hyph;40, 54, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 19&hyph;21 (the Commission views these statements as NEMA's final position on the issue); Osram (Tr.), 41, (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 2. See also Angelo, G&hyph;1, 2 (but note that Angelo later recommends disclosures at 120 volts in the Workshop at Tr. 57); GE, G&hyph;2, 7, (Ans.), 1; Osram (Tr.), 41, 58&hyph;59, (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 2; ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 1 (ACEEE, too, later recommends in the Workshop that all disclosures be at 120 volts, (Tr.), 59); OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 7; WA SEO, GG&hyph;18, 1. 66 In its supplemental comment, NEMA stated: A question was raised at the Workshop as to whether the last sentence of section (sic) (324(a)(2)(C)(i) of EPCA) should be interpreted to apply only to energy efficiency labeling or to all items required to be disclosed under the Commission's regulations. There is no published legislative history interpreting this provision. However, NEMA representatives were involved in extensive discussions with energy efficiency organizations and congressional staff over the language of the Energy Policy Act. Throughout those discussions, everyone's attention was focused on how best to educate consumers to select the most energy efficient lamp. NEMA representatives sought inclusion of the requirement that all lamps' efficiency ratings be based on a comparable operation at 120 volts. NEMA's objective was to prevent some manufacturers or importers from disguising low efficiency lamps by claiming efficiency ratings at voltages greater than 120 volts. NEMA was concerned that if a consumer faced 120 and 130 volt lamps in the same store, it be clear that the 130 volt lamp would be substantially less efficient when operated at 120 volts (Tr. 40&hyph;41). NEMA did not intend to force manufacturers to cease production or alter existing ratings of higher voltage lamps for use in niche markets. Thus, in construing section (sic) (324(a)(2)(C)(i)) of EPCA, NEMA urges that the provision be fairly read in the context of the legislative discussions and that congressional intent is best served by requiring that only lumens per watt measurements be based on 120 volts operation. NEMA (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 20&hyph;21. See also GE (Supp.), G&hyph;9, Ex. 4; Osram (Tr.), 51&hyph;52 (most purchasers do not see mix of products based on different voltages on store shelves, but purpose of the statute's requirement was to require efficiency be based on constant voltage for situations when mix of products were on shelves at same time). But see NEMA, G&hyph;3, 45 (``Section 324(a)((2))(C)(i) of EPCA requires that labeling information for incandescent lamps be based on performance when operated at 120 volts input, regardless of the rated lamp voltage. The Commission's regulations should expressly require manufacturers of incandescent lamps to disclose all performance characteristics when operated at 120 volts, regardless of the rated voltage.''). 67 See MN DPS, GG&hyph;9, 2; NEPS (Tr.), 44; LRC (Tr.), 44, 54&hyph;55; Angelo (Tr.), 57; ACEEE (Tr.), 59; IES (Tr.), 62.
