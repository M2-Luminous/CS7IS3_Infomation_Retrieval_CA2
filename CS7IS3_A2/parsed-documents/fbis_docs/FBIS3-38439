Speaking to reporters on his flight back to Rome from Vienna, Ciampi said that it was "very easy to predict" that interest rates will continue to fall this year, although not as much as they did in the last three quarters of 1993. "Between April and December of 1993," Ciampi said, "interest rates fell between four and five points. Today they are at 7 to 7.5 percent. At this rate, they should drop to below 3 percent this year but I fear that will be difficult." How interest rates go will depend on what happens in Italy and abroad, he added. "I think that none of us in April thought it would have been possible to cut interest rates in just eight months to today's levels." Asked whether his government planned additional austerity measures to reduce the deficit in the near future, Ciampi replied that the first public finance report will be available in March. "At that time we will see what changes need to be made.... At this time I have no indications because it is not easy to have any after the first month of the year." Continuing recession in Europe however will certainly have negative effects on Italy's primary surplus, Ciampi said. Lower interest rates can reduce the burden of debt servicing but in March, "and only in March," Ciampi stressed, will it be possible to compare forecasts to reality.
