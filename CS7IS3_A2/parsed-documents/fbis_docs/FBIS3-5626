FBIS3-5626 "dreas046_a_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-046 Document Type:Daily Report 9 March 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Reportage on Kajima-Nakamura Scandal Continues LDP Demands Kajima's Statements OW0903143594 Tokyo KYODO in English 1049 GMT 9 Mar 94 OW0903143594 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday [9 March] demanded that the Justice Ministry submit statements from a former vice president of Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, to a parliamentary panel in an apparent bid to block an arrest of a former construction minister for alleged bribery. The LDP's requests, made at the House of Representatives Steering Committee, also include questioning former Fair Trade Commission (FTC) Chairman Setsuo Umezawa as a witness. Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who left the LDP earlier Wednesday, could be arrested as early as Thursday for his alleged receipt of a 10 million yen bribe from construction giant Kajima Corp., Diet sources said. The committee brought the prospect of Nakamura's arrest closer when it met Wednesday to listen to Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki and a top ministry official concerning the case, the sources said. The LDP, however, questioned the way prosecutors are charging Nakamura and criticized a prosecutor's reported assault case against a suspect in connection with investigations into a corruption scandal involving contractors. Committee Chairman Keiwa Okuda also called for the ministry to turn in a "framework" of Kiyoyama's statements. The ministry refrained from giving an immediate answer. Okuda told the session the legislature needs to reach a decision as soon as possible, the sources said. Nakamura, 44, a member of the House of Representatives, is suspected of accepting the 10 million yen bribe in January 1992. The closed committee meeting, which began shortly after midday, reviewed documents supplied by the Justice Ministry detailing the allegations against Nakamura as well as relevant legal provisions, the Diet sources said. Mikazuki and the head of the ministry's Criminal Affairs Bureau, Mamoru Norisada, attended the meeting. Mikazuki told the committee that Nakamura has rejected repeated requests to turn himself in and may destroy evidence related to the case. Committee sources quoted Norisada as saying prosecutors now have enough evidence of Nakamura's involvement in the case, including statements from Kiyoyama, 67, who was arrested again Tuesday on suspicion of giving the 10 million yen to Nakamura. Nakamura allegedly received the money as a reward for using his influence to help prevent the FTC from lodging a criminal complaint with the prosecution against contractors for bid-rigging in Saitama Prefecture. Kiyoyama allegedly asked Nakamura, who was a senior member of the LDP's construction lobby, to pressure the FTC not to file a complaint with prosecutors against a bid-rigging cartel involving Kajima and 65 other construction firms. Norisada told the committee that the FTC had attempted to carry through criminal proceedings against the contractors, but Nakamura had pressed it to abandon the attempts. Norisada was quoted as saying that Nakamura continued to demand that the FTC abandon the case despite the commission's repeated refusals. Committee sources also said that Norisada told the committee the 10 million yen Nakamura allegedly accepted was a "large sum, different from sums normally given on special occasions like New Year." If the prosecutors' request is approved by the committee, the lower house is expected to hold a plenary session as early as Thursday to decide whether to give the go-ahead to Nakamura's arrest, political sources said. Parties within the ruling coalition and the opposition Japanese Communist Party are expected to agree to the arrest of Nakamura, the sources said. LDP head Yohei Kono said Tuesday the LDP will not pursue party interests in considering the prosecutors' request to arrest Nakamura. On Tuesday, the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa asked the lower house to decide on the request. Diet permission is required for the arrest of parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late January. Prosecutors applied Tuesday for a warrant for Nakamura from the Tokyo District Court, which sent a document to the cabinet urging it to apply for Diet permission on Nakamura's arrest. Nakamura's lawyers have said he is determined to "fight with prosecutors," even if he is arrested.
