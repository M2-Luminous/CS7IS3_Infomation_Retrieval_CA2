With regard to operations and administration, the analysis was conclusive: Proceedings for taking witness testimony are handled inadequately, there is no proper training in questioning techniques, there are not enough investigators to back up prosecuting attorneys, there is a lack of timely information on prosecutions, and serious deficiencies in the preliminary investigation units mean that cases may remain in the initial inquiry stage for months. In a conciliatory tone, Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Sintura, Bogota Regional Prosecutor's Office Director Jorge Enrique Bautista, Bogota Sectional Prosecutor's Office Director Jose Haxel de la Pava, Bogota Technical Corps Director Luis Fernando Velez, and trial attorneys studied the problems and pledged to seek solutions. First, the prosecution officials gathered at the Educational Extension Center of Colombia heard complaints aired by the attorneys, led by criminal law specialist Antonio Cancino. They acknowledged that the problems stem from the lack of trained personnel and the failure to realize that there is a new accusatory system in place in Colombia. These were the main topics of discussion yesterday. Questioning Witnesses The trial attorneys claimed that the proceedings for taking witness testimony are almost never conducted by a prosecuting attorney, and they complained that even though the proceedings should be regarded as a single process, each session is conducted by a different clerk. Thus, if five witnesses are to testify in a case, each one is heard by a different official, and often that official does not know the background of the case. As a result, according to the trial attorneys, some incongruous decisions can be made. In some cases, the attorneys alleged, the person who is supposed to do the questioning ends up asking the witness to give a narrative of the case. "Many officials say to the witness, `Tell me something about the case so I can ask you questions,' and consequently, when the prosecuting attorney reads the transcript, he finds holes and anomalies that he must clear up by calling in the witness again and taking his testimony personally." Preliminary Proceedings "With the advent of the Prosecutor General's Office, everything became a preliminary proceeding. Now, even when there is a known suspect, the prosecutors begin the process as if they were still in the inquiry stage, with no suspects. They take up to six months to go through preliminary proceedings before they finally decide that there is enough evidence to file charges against the suspect." This assertion by a criminal attorney reveals that there is a crisis in the operation of the Preliminary and Permanent Investigation Units. According to the attorneys, many investigations are carried out almost entirely in these units, and then by the time charges are filed and an attempt is made to find the suspect, he has already fled. A prosecutor in the Bogota special unit acknowledged that he has discovered a very common error in this preliminary investigation unit, and that is the opening of an investigation without sufficient evidence against the accused. "In this case, the opposite of what the attorneys are complaining about occurs," he said. "Sometimes the prosecuting attorneys in the preliminary investigation unit decide that because the victim was able to name the suspect, he has to be called in for questioning, and of course formal charges have to be filed, when in fact they have not checked to see if this is an unfounded accusation." Clerks The trial attorneys revealed that a high percentage of the 1,030 attorneys surveyed by the Bar Association believe that the new Common Clerk's Office is a failure. These clerk's offices, which are part of the new structure of the Prosecutor General's Office, consist of an executive clerk and several deputy clerks whose job is to handle the administration of case files: filings, notices, etc. These offices, complain the attorneys, have turned the prosecuting attorneys into "faceless bureaucrats," because everything related to a prosecution is discussed with the clerks, who are generally not familiar with the facts of the case. The attorneys also complained about problems created by the inadequate organization of cases. Thus, they explained, to find a case file at a Common Clerk's Office, it is necessary to have three numbers: the internal reference number, the unit case number, and the assignment office intake number. In addition, the attorneys say, some employees at the clerk's office are very rude at times. "The issue of the clerk's offices," said spokesmen for the trial attorneys, "is the sticking point in the Prosecutor General's Office. And we are the only ones who are aware of that, since we are on the other side of the railing." As for the Regional Prosecutor's Offices, which are responsible for drug trafficking and terrorism cases, the criticism focused on poor initial processing of cases. According to the attorneys--and this was acknowledged by the Prosecutor General's Office--many cases are poorly identified in the system. Sometimes, only the first defendant's name appears, and codefendants are listed as "others" in the files. As a result, trying to find the case file for one of those "others" can be a Herculean task. The Technical Investigation Corps With regard to the Technical Investigation Corps (CTI), the attorneys noted that it is a subdivision of the Prosecutor General's Office that has very limited technical, human, and financial resources to meet the needs of the prosecutors and of the investigations that are carried out all over the country. The trial attorneys complained that the Prosecutor General's Office has issued a directive instructing prosecutors to use only the services of CTI agents whenever possible. Nevertheless, the shortage of personnel makes this almost impossible. In Bogota, for example, there are 59 investigators working on all the prosecution cases under way in the 317 Departmental Prosecutor's Offices. [Box, p 11A] Prosecutor General's Office Responds The representatives of the Prosecutor General's Office who participated in the debate welcomed the criminal attorneys' proposals and admitted that there are errors that must be corrected immediately. Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura stated that there is a great shortage of Judicial Police investigators, not only in the CTI, but also in the National Police and the Administrative Department of Security (DAS). For now, however, the government has said that no new positions can be created until 1995. The official admitted that there are very few employees trained in the techniques of questioning witnesses. "Sometimes," he said, "the questioner asks the witness two or three very simple questions and then asks him if he has anything more to add, just because he has to close the proceeding." He went on to say that total quality courses have already been implemented so that employees of the Prosecutor General's Office can begin training. As for the problems in the Common Clerk's Offices, the deputy prosecutor general stated that in the next few days, a pilot program will begin in the clerk's offices. This program, called Plan Chrysalis, includes the completion of a data processing system, as the current system is inadequate. In this regard, the director of the Regional Prosecutor's Office of Bogota, Jorge Enrique Bautista, said that there have been data processing problems in the regional prosecutor's offices since the beginning, and as a result, it is often difficult to find case files or to determine the status of a case. He noted, however, that a new system is being devised under the auspices of the Social Studies Front (FES). Referring to the problems of incompetence or irregularities committed by employees, Sintura urged the trial attorneys to file complaints with the Treasury Inspector's Office so that those responsible can be identified and punished.
