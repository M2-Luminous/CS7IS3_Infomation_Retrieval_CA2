ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This action proposes restrictions or prohibitions on substitutes for ozone depleting substances (ODSs) under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. SNAP implements section 612 of the amended Clean Air Act of 1990 which requires EPA to evaluate and regulate substitutes for the ODSs to reduce overall risk to human health and the environment. Through these evaluations, SNAP generates lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes for each of the major industrial use sectors. The intended effect of the SNAP program is to expedite movement away from ozone depleting compounds while avoiding a shift into high-risk substitutes posing other environmental problems. On March 18, 1994, EPA promulgated a final rulemaking setting forth its plan for administering the SNAP program, and issued decisions on the acceptability and unacceptability of a number substitutes. In this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), EPA is issuing its preliminary decisions on the acceptability of certain substitutes not previously reviewed by the Agency. To arrive at determinations on the acceptability of substitutes, the Agency completed a cross-media evaluation of risks to human health and the environment by sector end-use. Today's action proposes new additions to the list of controlled or prohibited substitutes. As described in the final rule for the SNAP program, EPA does believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required to place any alternative on the list of prohibited substitutes, to list an alternative as acceptable only under certain use conditions or certain narrow end-use applications. EPA does not, however, believe that rulemaking procedures are required to list alternatives as acceptable with no limitations. Such listings do not impose any sanction, nor do they remove any prior license to use a substitute. Consequently, EPA is adding substitutes to the list of acceptable alternatives without first requesting comment on new listings. Updates to the acceptable lists are published as separate notices in the Federal Register . A comprehensive compilation of all listings will be published annually.
