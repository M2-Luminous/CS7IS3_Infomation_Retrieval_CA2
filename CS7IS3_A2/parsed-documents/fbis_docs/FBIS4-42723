Of course, we are still a long way away from the 191,000 jobs created in the United States in the month of April alone. This is the first increase in three years. In the first three months of the year, salaried employment increased by 0.2 percent according to the final figures released by the Ministry of Labor. Not only is France creating more jobs than it is losing -- for the first time since 1990 -- but the final statistics have proven to be better than the provisional figures released in mid-May. Some 5,000 extra jobs have been listed since then. Moreover, UNEDIC [National Union for Employment in Industry and Commerce] is soon expected to downwardly revise the number of extra job-seekers expected in 1994. The tertiary sector, which since mid-May has been playing its role as a locomotive only very modestly, "is once again clearly becoming a creator of jobs," thanks to trade (up 1.3 percent for the nonfood retail trade) and service (up 2.4 percent for services to businesses). On the other hand, the manufacturing industry is continuing to lose jobs (down 0.6 percent), but at a more moderate pace than the preceding quarter (down 0.8 percent). Toward 1 Million Welfare Recipients By The End Of 1994 The number of unemployed people being compensated by UNEDIC should not be as high as forecast in 1994, which could encourage the implementation of an "active" policy by the unemployment insurance system to benefit employment, with the support of certain employees' unions. Whereas in March UNEDIC expected that it would have to compensate 210,000 extra unemployed people this year, this figure should end up being around 100,000. This slower rise should be reflected in a financial surplus in the unemployment insurance system that exceeds the two billion francs forecast for this year. The size of the "outgoings" as noted in UNEDIC registers can be explained by the fact that the "groups of unemployed people who entered the unemployment insurance system in 1991-1992 used up their rights to enter the solidarity insurance system five or six months ago," an expert explained. This upsurge in those leaving the system should not conceal the fact that the number of long-term unemployed rose 23 percent in one year and that the average duration of unemployment has now reached 279 days. Out of the 50,000 people who leave the unemployment insurance system every month, a little less than one-third join the solidarity insurance program financed by the state and another third or so find a job. The last third comes knocking on the door of the welfare office, a trend which has been rising. At the end of 1993, the Ministry of Social Affairs counted around 800,000 welfare recipients (up 18.1 percent in one year). At the current rate, they will number nearly one million by the end of the year.
