FBIS4-14540 "drsov063_u_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-063 Daily Report 21 Mar 1994 Latvia New `Political Union of Economists' Declares Platform New `Political Union of Economists' Declares Platform WS3003143194 Riga DIENA in Latvian 21 Mar 94 pp 1, 6 WS3003143194 Riga DIENA Latvian BFN [Article by Sanita Upleja: "New Party Established -- Political Union of Economists"] [Text] Riga, 20 March -- On Saturday [19 March], a group of economists of the Saeima [parliament] faction "Concord for Latvia," and their supporters gathered at the founding meeting of the Political Union of Economists [TPA]. At the meeting, the program and statutes of the newly established party were adopted. Edvins Kide, leader of the faction, was elected chairman of the board. Founders of the new party are members of the election bloc "Concord for Latvia -- Rebirth for Economy," "Union of Latvian Farmers," "Union of Fishermen," and the "League of Economy," along with representatives of small business. On the part of the Saeima faction "Concord for Latvia," the initiators of the new party were E. Kide, Jevgenijs Zascerinskis, Vilnis Edvins Bresis, Leonards Stass, Janis Lucans, Juris Janeks, and Irena Folkmane. As DIENA has already reported, from now on instead of one Saeima faction, there will be two independent factions. As the new party leader, E. Kide stated at the meeting that the new party, in contrast with the ruling coalition which represents the interests of big capital and the economic elite, will be situated "in the center of the political spectrum with a tendency to the left" and will represent the interests of mid-sized and small business. E. Kide declared that in the Saeima, TPA wants to represent the middle class, tradespeople, and intellectuals. Regarding similar programmatic options and their position on the political spectrum, TPA has decided to cooperate with the Democratic Party [DP], Democratic Labor Party, Latvian Social-Democratic Workers Party [LSDSP], and trade unions. Also during the municipal elections, TPA will create coalitions with LSDSP and the DP. E. Kide and other speakers repeatedly stressed that TPA is an economic party created on the basis of a club of economists, and that it stands for maintaining state property in strategic branches, social security, and equal rights for stateless people in the economy. The TPA program declares that the state president should be elected in a popular election and endowed with greater powers, and expresses the demand to separate legislative and executing power by adopting a law which will not permit individuals to serve as deputies and ministers at the same time. TPA emphasizes the need to achieve mutual understanding among citizens and proposes to issue a declaration of concord for society. Regarding the problem of citizenship, TPA declares that citizenship should be granted to those people who have lived in Latvia for the last 10 years and have a command of the Latvian language, though the last condition does not apply to elderly people and pensioners. In granting citizenship, priority should be given to permanent residents born in Latvia, except military personnel of foreign armies and their descendants, as well as to family members of Latvian citizens. For those who have been residing in Latvia since 4 May 1990, a steady quota system should be implemented for achieving Latvian citizenship. TPA rejects double citizenship and demands the establishment of a law determining that the state president, Saeima deputies, members of the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking state officials cannot be citizens of other states. Regarding foreign policy, the TPA is orientated toward a balance between East and West, emphasizing that our Eastern policy should be constructive rather than based on emotions. One of the main tasks of Latvian foreign policy, mentioned in the TPA program, is to normalize relations with Russia and the CIS. As for the security and sovereignty of Latvia, the main conditions for their fortification, in the view of TPA, is active work within the framework of the United Nations, CSCE, and the Partnership for Peace, as well as joining the European Union and the Council of Europe. In its program, TPA condemns centralized power and supports extending the role of municipal authorities, which should be affirmed in the Constitution. TPA demands that municipal authorities be given the right to initiate legislative acts in parliament. TPA declares that the number of local government electors should be expanded by granting voting rights to all permanent residents of Latvia.
