Director General Hans Blix said this in an exclusive interview with the KBS network on 17 June. He said he welcomed the promise North Korea has made to former President Carter that it will allow the inspectors who are now in Yongbyon to approach nuclear facilities without restricting their activities. Director General Hans Blix said, in particular, with regard to North Korea's replacement of nuclear fuel rods: At present, the five-megawatt atomic reactor is empty because its fuel rods have been removed. It seems that new fuel rods will be installed soon. He said: The inspectors in Yongbyon have been conducting various kinds of inspection activities, including installing monitoring equipment at the storage site of spent fuel rods and at reprocessing facilities without any restrictions. The inspectors work at any time and take turns working. Asked if he would be willing to have dialogue with North Korea, Director General Hans Blix emphasized that his duty is to inspect if activities comply with the nuclear accord, adding that the United States will discuss issues, including the normalization of relations, with North Korea through political dialogue.
