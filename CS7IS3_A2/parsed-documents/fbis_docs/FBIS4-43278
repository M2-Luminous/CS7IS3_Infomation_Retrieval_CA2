In reply to a question during his weekly news conference today, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman said the straining of relations between Turkey and Greece will not serve the interests of either country. Ataman recalled that during the NATO foreign ministers meeting held in Istanbul, the Greek foreign minister informed Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin that he shares Turkey's stand on this issue and will be pleased to see it implemented. Within this framework, Ataman stressed, Turkish planes flew over the Aegean without weapons for some time. Ataman continued: This gesture on the part of Turkey has not been reciprocated yet. This is extremely important, in that it sheds light on the Greek attitude. Under these circumstances, it is natural for us to take the measures we deem necessary in line with the flight security and operational needs of our planes.
