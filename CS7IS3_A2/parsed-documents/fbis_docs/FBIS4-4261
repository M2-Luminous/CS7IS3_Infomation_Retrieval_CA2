The current meeting, which was jointly held by the provincial party committee organization and united front work departments and the provincial government's nationalities affairs commission and personnel department, was to convey and implement the spirit of the national symposium on the training and selection of minority cadres and of central leaders' important speeches; sum up and exchange our province's experience in the work; and discuss how to do a good job of training and selecting minority cadres in the 1990's. Addressing the symposium, Liu Fangren, secretary of provincial party committee said: Guizhou is a multinational province. Minority nationalities constitute 34.7 percent of the province's total population. Training and selecting minority cadres has a bearing on the province's reform, development, and stability and the realization of the strategic goal of shaking off poverty, gaining prosperity, and achieving a well-to-do standard of living. We should have a full understanding of the importance and necessity of training and selecting minority cadres, sum up experience, consolidate what has been achieved in the work, do an ever better job of ideological work, and provide a solid and liable organizational guarantee for the province's reform, development, and stability and the realization of the second-step strategic goal. Liu Fangren stated: To meet the needs of the new situation of developing the socialist market economy, we should elevate the work of training and selecting minority cadres to new heights, place greater stress on improving the quality of minority cadres while expanding their ranks, give better training to minority cadres while doing a good job in the training and selection work, and strengthen the building of the ranks of minority cadres at the gross-roots units of the minority nationality areas while optimizing the leading bodies at all levels. In this regard, first of all, we should conduct education in the "two indispensables" and strengthen unity and cooperation between cadres of minority nationalities and those of the Han nationality. He also urged party localities and governments at all levels to put the work of training and selecting minority cadres on the agenda as an important task, personally take up the work, and continue to strengthen leadership over the work.
