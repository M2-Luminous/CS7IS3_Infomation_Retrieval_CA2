It also approved a resolution that was read by Idalina Valente, Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola deputy to the National Assembly. [Begin Valente recording] In its fourth meeting of the second legislature, the National Assembly discussed the government's Social and Economic Program for 1994. The implementation of this program is limited by the, war which continues to beset large sections of Angolan territory. In those areas, the effects of this program are likely to be felt only indirectly. For this reason, whatever progress is made over the course of this year to bring peace to Angolan territory must perforce facilitate the implementation of measures and policies mentioned in the government's program. The National Assembly believes that the strategy contained in the Social and Economic Program will, for its successful implementation, require a high degree of discipline and perseverance concerning the implementation of planned measures. It will also be necessary to adjust structure, organization, and the government's team to the program's principles and practices. The National Assembly believes that the program which was presented here is made up of a coherent set of macroeconomic measures whose rigorous and disciplined implementation should result in a significant short-term reduction in the inflation rate experienced in 1993 and a slowing down in the pace and level of national impoverishment, which has caused the citizens to face a serious increase in the cost of living. Nonetheless, only the continued implementation of that program and the correct integration into the macroeconomic program of the Public Investment Plan, as well as of sectorial programs can lead to medium term growth in production levels, which in turn should allow the economy to stabilize, help improve consumption levels, and ensure greater well-being for the people. In those terms and under the terms of Paragraph B of Article 88 and of Paragraph 6 of Article 92 of the Constitutional Law, the National Assembly hereby issues the following resolution: Point: The Social and Economic Program for 1994 is hereby approved. It was presented by the government, and it carried the following recommendations: A. By 10 May, the government must have presented to the National Assembly the Public Investment Program and sectorial plans to function as management tools for the 1994 program; B. As its basis for drawing up the Public Investment Plan, the government must seek a constant percentage sharing in accordance with the program that has been approved. The government must, however, make every effort to increase the forecast amount of 2.5 trillion new kwanzas by reducing expenses arising from diplomatic representation, scholarships abroad, and work trips, among other things; C. With regard to sectorial plans, they must reflect the Social and Economic Program's economic and administrative decentralization policies; they must reflect a correct adjustment of sectorial goals to the resources planned by General State Budget for 1994 and present a timetable for their implementation; D. The continuation of the process for restructuring the state entrepreneurial sector will be linked to the National Assembly approving the Law on Privatization. [end recording] This resolution approved with 102 votes in favor, none against, and 10 abstentions.
