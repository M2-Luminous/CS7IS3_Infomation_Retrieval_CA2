Before signing the document, Lennart Meri said that, in these critical times, state interest must prevail over personal and factional considerations. The president linked this requirement to the NATO summit meeting taking place at Brussels. The president said that innovations in the government have been made at the wrong time and in the wrong manner. Meri signed the resolution on changes in government staffing at the lectern in front of Riigikogu. The president preferred not to take questions from members of the parliament. The president's statement to Riigikogu in connection with the overhaul in the government's staffing is published in full in today's issue of P�aEVALEHT. Mart Laar: President's Speech Made Several Valid Points Prime Minister Mart Laar said at the press conference that he still does not know if `the president has declared war on him him or not.' "I have not declared war on the president," Laar maintained. Laar also recalled that at meetings held between the prime minister and representatives of parliamentary factions, before the government `overhaul' took place, "the president did not express his opinion in such scathing tones." "The president's speech in Riigikogu made a number of valid points, especially those referring to the tug-of-war between Estonia's fictional characters Andres and Pearu," Laar conceded. At the same time, Laar did not agree with the president's contention that the `overhaul' was undertaken at the wrong time, and in the wrong manner. Even presuming that Estonia is in for tough times, it would still be better to face them with a government that works in harmony, cooperates efficiently with the parliament, and can pass all resolutions effectively," the prime minister opined. "We still have huge gaps in our legislation," the prime minister said. Laar referred to the lack of several laws that would guarantee the balance of powers and added that passing the law for regulating the president's duties, now up for its second reading in Riigikogu, and the peace-time law of state defense, would make it possible to resolve the issues now being debated. Commenting on the crisis that ensued, Laar said that even legal experts from Germany had pointed out deficiencies in Estonia's constitution. "This is why it is possible that some changes will have to be made in the constitution," Laar said.
