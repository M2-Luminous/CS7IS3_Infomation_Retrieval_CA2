The report was presented by Vice Chairman Shao Ming on behalf of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee. The session maintains that the Standing Committee, in light of the requirements adopted in the resolution of the First Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress, has earnestly discharged its constitutional and lawful responsibilities and made new headway in all sectors on the basis of the work accomplished by the Seventh Anhui Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee. The work accomplished in 1993 as summarized in the report is factual, and the assignments set for this year are realistic and practical. The meeting has decided to approve the report. The meeting maintains that the Standing Committee should continue to adhere to the guidance provided by the party's basic line as well as by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; should follow through with the guidelines laid down by the 14th party congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, and the 10th Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial Party Committee; and should earnestly implement the party Central Committee's basic principle for this year's assignments. Focusing on economic construction, the Standing Committee should consider it its basic task to promote socialist democracy and build a legal system; should exert positive efforts in discharging all its constitutional and lawful responsibilities and authority; and should obey and serve the prevalent requirement of "seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development, and maintaining stability" so that its role as a permanent organization of the local state power organ can be brought into full play. The Standing Committee should consider it its top priority to intensify economic legislation, to display the spirit of reform, to promptly and efficiently draw up local laws and regulations, and to earnestly implement the province's five-year plan for legislation. The Standing Committee should intensify its supervision over the implementation of laws and other work, attaching special importance to inspecting and supervising law enforcement so as to safeguard the dignity of the law and uphold the authority of the law. The Standing Committee must continue to intensify the publicity and education of the legal system so the public will become more law conscious. It should forge closer ties with the deputies and the people, build the Standing Committee into a stronger body, work earnestly, and proceed with an exploratory spirit so as to make new contributions to Anhui's reform, opening up, and modernization.
