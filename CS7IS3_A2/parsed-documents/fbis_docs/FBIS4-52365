According to a senior Cambodian Minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Ranariddh has fired Sirivut from the post of FUNCINPEC secretary-general and given him the less influential post of vice president to the party. Loy Simchheang, the third vice president of the National Assembly, has been appointed to replace Sirivut as party secretary general. Ranariddh, the minister said, has been unhappy with Sirivut's siding with Finance Minister Sam Rangsi who has taken a strong stand against the activities in Cambodia of the Thai Bun Rong company. Sirivut, who is King Norodom Sihanouk's stepbrother, has been a keen supporter of Rangsi's economic polices and financial management of Cambodia's troubled economy. Both Rangsi and Sirivut have received the blessing of King Sihanouk in their endeavours and in recent weeks the two ministers have met often at Sirivut's office in the foreign ministry. On April 16, while celebrations of the Cambodian New Year were in full swing, Ranariddh summoned Sirivut to his home and told him that he was no longer the secretary general of the party, a post to which he had been appointed only early in the year. Ranariddh's move angered Sirivut who expected better treatment from the first prime minister. The following day, Sirivut was conspicuously absent from a ceremony at the Royal Palace during which ministers paid their respects to the king and queen on the occasion of Chol Chhnam Thmei (traditional Cambodian New Year). Sirivut, the minister said, was considering his position in the government as he had been shocked by Ranariddh's unilateral action, which was not submitted to the consideration of the higher ranks of the party. Sirivut has been a loyal lieutenant of Ranariddh's, even siding with him against the notorious Prince Norodom Chakkrapong, Ranariddh's step-brother and fierce opponent. Now Sirivut feels that his loyalty and support for Ranariddh has not been reciprocated by the first prime minister. In January this year, when Ranariddh was under strong pressure from the Cambodian People's Party to fire the finance minister, it was Sirivut's threat to resign as deputy prime minister and foreign minister which saved Rangsi. Sirivut and Rangsi have strong views about relations with Thailand and about the need to clean up the business environment established by Thai merchants in Phnom Penh. In their view, they have received strong support from colleagues in FUNCINPEC and the population of Cambodia, especially from those small traders affected by the long-running conflict with the Thai Bun Rong company over the Olympic market affair. King Sihanouk, who strongly supports the foreign affairs and finance policies of the two ministers, has gone out of his way to make public his blessing. In January, when Rangsi was in danger of being dismissed, the King wrote a letter congratulating him and his staff for their good work. In the same month, he elevated Sirivut to the rank of Sdech Kromkhun, making him among the most senior princes of the Royal Cambodian Family. Significantly, under the same Kret (Royal Decree), the King elevated to the same rank two of his sons -- Prince Norodom Sihakmoni, and Prince Norodom Chakkrapong. Both of these would side with Sirivut against Ranariddh in any confrontation among Royal Family members, observers say. Royal Palace sources declined to reveal the King's reaction to the removal of Sirivut from the influential party post. But one source said the king was "deeply concerned" by some recent actions.
