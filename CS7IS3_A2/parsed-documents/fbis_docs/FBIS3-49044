Lieutenant-General Francis Briquemont was due to end his term as military commander in Bosnia in July but Belgium said Tuesday it wanted to recall him, a move that was immediately condemned by a top Bosnian government official. A Belgian defence ministry official said Briquemont had agreed to return and would resume a post in his country's forces in Germany after leaving Bosnia before the end of January. In New York, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said the UN would not be perturbed by Briquemont's early departure from his post. "If he wants to be relieved, he will be relieved," said Ahmad Fawzi. Briquemont was in Zagreb on a visit and did not comment on his plans. Briquemont has been increasingly critical of the UN's inability to protect civilians and stop attacks on aid convoys, a point echoed by the UN Commander in the former Yugoslavia General Jean Cot, who complained Monday of humiliations suffered by international peacekeepers. Cot also said that UN troops were ready for an "offensive intervention" in Bosnia. Ejup Ganic, the number two to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, said Belgium's decision showed that the international community was not taking the crisis in his country seriously. Ganic said that personally he felt that as soon as a UN military official got to grips with the situation, he was replaced. French General Philippe Morillon, Briquemont's predecessor, was also recalled and had also been outspoken in his criticism of the inadequacy of international intervention in the stricken country. Briquemont recently demanded reinforcement of the 12,000 strong UN Protection Force contingent in Bosnia and said that he no longer bothered to read unheeded UN resolutions on the civil war. Ganic hinted that the recall might be to do with his criticisms of a peace plan dividing the country. He noted that Briquemont, like Morillon, had expressed the view that the partition of the country between the three warring groups was not a solution. Belgian diplomats said they hoped that Briquemont's replacement would also be Belgian but the appointment rests in the hands of Butrus-Ghali. [passage omitted]
