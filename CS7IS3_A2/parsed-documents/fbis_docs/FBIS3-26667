The United States Wednesday [9 February] formally recognized the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, saying it would establish full diplomatic relations with the republic once it pledged to try to resolve its differences with Greece. "We would like to believe that the text of the decision granting recognition might be used positively, but right now we don't know whether it will," Papandreou told reporters after a cabinet meeting. The recognition would encourage Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, who was "out of touch with reality," Papandreou said. He said the reality was that Greece could isolate Macedonia economically. The premier added that the U.S. recognition of Macedonia did not contribute to "normality." "In contrast," he said, "exerting pressure (on Skopje) for it to abandon its liberating designs would contribute." Replying to questions, Papandreou said that it was possible to hold a meeting of Greece's political party leaders on the Macedonian issue, to be chaired by President Konstandinos Karamanlis. Papandreou said that he was optimistic regarding the issue, adding that its solution required "patience, persistence and determination." He had recently developed a good personal relationship with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the premier said. However, he said, countries did not act on the basis of personal friendship or party identities; they acted on the basis of strategic interests as they saw them.
