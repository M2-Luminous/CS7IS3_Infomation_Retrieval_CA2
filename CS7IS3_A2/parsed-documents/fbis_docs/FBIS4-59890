The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] completed its pullout one week earlier than originally agreed upon in Cairo. This of course was carried out with the agreement of the PLO and the subsequent result is that only one third of the Palestinian forces slated to enter the area have indeed assumed their stations and the Palestinian Authority has yet to be established. Second, the first impression made by the Fatah units entering the Gaza Strip was better than many Israelis had initially feared. Now, however, things are not looking so good. Looting has become quite widespread in the Gaza Strip and many telephone cables, air conditioners, and other objects have been stolen. The Fatah army has no money. It cannot afford to purchase gas for its vehicles or even food for the troops. In several places, complaints have been received that soldiers are eating at restaurants without paying. The majority of the troops have not received sufficient training in police work. Third, if money does not arrive quickly from foreign sources, Israel may have to supply the Palestinians with urgent financial aid in order to pay for immediate expenditures. This sum could reach several million shekels. Fourth, there is a great deal of tension among Fatah operatives in the Gaza Strip who fear that they are being pushed aside by 'Arafat's veteran officers. The open tension between the Fatah activists and the police commanders occasionally precludes cooperation. On the political level, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has adopted a wait and see approach, while forbidding prisoners to sign any declarations of support for the peace process. Meanwhile, Fatah has failed to drum up support for an agreement on the establishment of new municipal councils in Nabulus and Hebron. These are all labor pains, of course. 'Arafat wants to differentiate between the Israeli withdrawal and the establishment of his authority. However, seeing as at the present time, there is no real authority in the Gaza Strip to replace Israel's partial control, difficulties can be expected even in the event of a best-case scenario.
