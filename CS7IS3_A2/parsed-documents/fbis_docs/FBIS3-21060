Their production is mainly labor-intensive and costly, their storability often very short, delivering them to the plants is also labor-intensive and costly, their effectiveness often limited, and the user has to be very knowledgable about them. Ciba-Geigy, which claims to be the leading firm in the plant protection market, has now introduced the first bioproducts ready for marketing in Germany to control pests and diseases biologically in commercial horticulture and tree nurseries which, according to Jakob Brassel, the director of the Ciba department for research and development on biological plant protection, signify a breakthrough in this sector. Whereas up to now biological control agents have accounted for only 1.5 percent of all pesticides worldwide, this percentage is expected to grow to 5 percent by the year 2000. By then Ciba wants to have developed a product line of biological pest and disease-control agents. Based on live elvers (nematodes), the bioproducts "Exhibit F27" and "Exhibit G25" that have now been introduced will be used in the cultivation of ornamental plants to control the larvae of small gnats [Lycoriidae] or of the dreaded Dickmaulruessler [a type of insect pest]. In 1992 Ciba concluded a worldwide developement and marketing agreement for nematode-based products with the American firm Biosys in Palo Alto, California, and it possesses the marketing rights for the whole world, with the exception of Japan. The nematodes are produced in the trillions in biofermenters, emptied into fabric hoses pervious to air, and in the process embedded in a natural, viscous biopolymer. The practical apportionment of 5 million units allows for a dosage that matches production with demand, even over smaller areas. The bioproducts are closely bound to the insect larvae to produce specific effects and are therefore absolutely compatible with plants and the environment. In connection with this, Ciba-Geigy stresses the fact that chemical plant protection will also be essential in future to ensure profits, especially with big crops like, for example, wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, and cotton. But in terms of integrated plant protection, the combination of biological and chemical agents is gaining in importance. Approaches involving genetic engineering may also offer ways of solving the problem.
