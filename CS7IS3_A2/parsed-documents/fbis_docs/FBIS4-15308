It has borne a closer resemblance to a brawl than to a debate. I watched him at length as he listened: motionless, impassive, taking the floor briefly just to clarify a point now and again in his monotonous, colorless voice, as if he hoped it would have a pacifying effect. It is late evening by the time that, surrounded by a group of swaggering youths with bulging jackets and submachine guns that do nothing for the line of their double-breasted suits, he reaches his office on the fourth floor of the former Institute of Marxist Leninism. [Chiesa] Eduard Amvrosyevich Shevardnadze, are you satisfied with your parliament? [Shevardnadze] (laughing heartily) We are learning. What do you expect? Demagogy rules the day, but you cannot make the transition from totalitarianism to democracy without going through this stage. [Chiesa] You were a leader in the USSR in 1989, in the days of the first relatively democratic parliament in Soviet history. Do you see any difference, any progress? [Shevardnadze] There is greater pluralism, but apart from that I would not say that we have come much further. [Chiesa] What balance can be drawn from the two years that have gone by since your triumphal return to Tbilisi? [Shevardnadze] It is a complicated balance. I am worried because we have not solved the main problem, that of the territorial integrity of the country. The economic situation is extremely serious. As you have seen, we have a very poor standard of living. On the other hand, we have managed to avoid the worst, civil war on a major scale. [Chiesa] Do you really regard this danger as a thing of the past? [Shevardnadze] We shall have serious problems, of course, but there will not be a civil war. And we have established a lot of relations with the outside world; we have emerged from our isolation. [Chiesa] The Shevardnadze effect ... [Shevardnadze] No, I have merely made a contribution. It was very important that they should recognize us and help us. The people here have reached starvation point. If it were not for outside aid, from Russia, Kazakhstan, and the European countries, we should now be facing the threat of physical extinction. [Chiesa] Nevertheless, opposition to you personally in parliament is very tough. They accuse you of losing Abkhazia, and what besides? [Shevardnadze] A lot of these youngsters just want seats to warm. From time to time I am tempted to go home and leave them to it. Then I think to myself: They are my people. I cannot just abandon them. I would like to make way for the younger generation, but they are just the offspring of the city intelligentsia. First we have to build a solid foundation for those to come. There are now more than 100 parties, all microscopic, without power. That is why I decided to promote the "Citizens' Union," a movement that sets out to unite the responsible forces. Then we shall approve the constitution and organize fresh elections. I am also trying to ensure that a strong opposition party takes shape ... [Chiesa] A two-party system? [Shevardnadze] Yes, two or three parties, but serious ones. [Chiesa] You are now president of parliament and head of state. Are you aiming for a presidential republic? [Shevardnadze] Yes. For strong presidential powers and a strong parliament to counterbalance them. [Chiesa] You have your eye on what is happening in Moscow, where the only powers, however, are presidential ... [Shevardnadze] Yeltsin wanted a constitution that would guarantee the integrity of the state, and he got it. Perhaps he failed to deliver democratic guarantees. I shall bear other people's mistakes in mind. [Chiesa] You have chosen Yeltsin and the Moscow democrats as your allies. What will happen if there is a changing of the guard in Moscow? [Shevardnadze] In spite of all the difficulties, Boris Yeltsin still has great potential. If he manages to remain in office for his full term, I think that people will have time to understand democracy better. [Chiesa] Tell me about your trip to the United States, where they are trying to remedy the decisions taken over the last few years. Did you get the impression that they understand what is happening in the former Soviet Union? [Shevardnadze] They are analyzing the situation. I cannot say that they understand it fully, but often we ourselves do not fully understand what is happening here. I told them that a reversion to the cold war between Russia and the United States must be prevented at all costs, because it would bring the most reactionary forces in Russia onto the scene, and that would be a catastrophe. [Chiesa] But I have the impression that there are some circles in the United States that want to cut Russia even further down to size. [Shevardnadze] Maybe, but I only met sensible people. [Chiesa] Anyway, there is no talk of UN blue helmets in Georgia. [Shevardnadze] My view is that the Security Council cannot declare itself helpless to act. The secretary general of the United nations is a decent politician, but he has little understanding of the problems of the Caucasus. The world at large has little understanding of them, and when it becomes aware of them it will be too late. It is worse than the Balkans here. [Chiesa] Anyway, the Americans will not be coming. Bill Clinton has made that much clear. Would you agree to Russian blue helmets? [Shevardnadze] I have set out three alternative options: firstly, the traditional scenario, involving several countries including Russia, and it does not matter if Russia accounts for 30 percent of the peacekeeping force or more; secondly, a Russian force under the auspices of the United Nations, although I doubt that this will be acceptable to the Security Council, and, thirdly, a request for Russian intervention, with observers sent by the United Nations. If all three come to nothing, there will be a war against Abkhazia. [Chiesa] What about a UN force without Russians? [Shevardnadze] No, it would make for confrontation between Russia and the United Nations, and there would be war in any case. There can be no final settlement of the dispute without Russian involvement. Indeed, I now bitterly acknowledge the mistake that I made when Abkhazia attacked and the Russians said, "We will send our troops in and reestablish order." I rejected their offer because I was convinced that we would be able to defend Sukhumi by ourselves. It was a mistake; I should have agreed. [Chiesa] Have you ever regretted your decision to come back? [Shevardnadze] I know I was crazy, but I knew what to expect. This is my country, and I want to share its fate. [Chiesa] They say you have become religious ... [Shevardnadze] I am a believer. I always have been deep down, even though communist ideology forbade it. [Chiesa] And how are your relations with Gorbachev? [Shevardnadze] We phone each other, though relatively rarely in recent times. I have always respected him. He is a great man, a moving force behind all these changes. We have also had our disagreements, but that does not diminish his merits. [Chiesa] Of course, he was the one who changed your life. [Shevardnadze] Yes. It came as a surprise. He called me and announced that he was going to put my name forward for a high foreign policy office, but he did not specify which. I objected that I had no experience. What I really thought was that he wanted to propose me as secretary to the central committee on international policy, but the next day he called me back and said distinctly, "We will propose a new office of major importance to Andrey Gromyko." I repeated that I thought it would be a mistake and that ministries such as defense, foreign affairs, and the KGB could be held exclusively by Russians. I added that I could not merely play an executive role. But he had already spoken to the whole politburo, and the decision had in fact already been taken. [Chiesa] With hindsight, how do you judge that decision? [Shevardnadze] I remember that the first time I went to the ministry, I was on my own. I had never been there before. I told the board: "Gromyko was like a great ship sailing the ocean, and in comparison Eduard Shevardnadze was just a dinghy, but a dinghy with an engine." They all laughed. That is how I began. And difficult decisions were taken, on Afghanistan, on tactical missiles, on strategic missiles. In the beginning it was easy, then the attacks began and we had to come out fighting. But Shevardnadze's handwriting was already clearly visible in those decisions. It was rather a thrill to see that what you said one day had actually happened the day after. The West met us halfway. Those were great, historic times. They were the best years of my life.
