FR941103-0-00003 FR941103-0-00001 The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period was prepared by the Vidalia Onion Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department of Agriculture for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Vidalia onions. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of Vidalia onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. The Committee met July 14, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $332,000, $69,050 more than the previous year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Travel & auto expenses, $6,000 ($4,000), liability insurance and bonds, $1,000 ($500), professional fees, $2,500 ($2,000), office supplies, $3,000 ($1,300), telephone, $4,000 ($3,500), Committee member expense, $1,000 ($500), contract management, wages, and salaries, $60,000 ($59,600), miscellaneous general and administrative, $1,000 ($500), research, $80,000 ($78,500), marketing, $132,000 ($82,500), and $4,250 for FICA employer, $13,500 for employee benefits, and $8,000 for contract outside labor, for which no funding was recommended last year. Items which have decreased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Equipment purchases, $3,000 ($4,500), office overhead, $3,000 ($12,900), and $150 in interest, and $250 for petty cash, for which no funding was recommended this year. The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per 50-pound bag or equivalent of Vidalia onions, the same as last year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 2,867,500 50-pound bags or equivalents of Vidalia onions, would yield $286,750. The Committee also anticipates shipments of 50,000 50-pound bags of previously unassessed Vidalia onions which have been in storage, which will yield an additional $5,000 in assessment income. This, along with $5,250 in interest income and $35,000 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve of $167,766 are within the maximum permitted by the order of three fiscal periods' expenses.
