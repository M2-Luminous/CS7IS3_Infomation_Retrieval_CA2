This morning the minister met the defense committee in parliament to say that Portugal's objectives for the NATO summit had been achieved and that the Lajes base [Azores] negotiations are on the right track. Lacalete Marques reports. [Lacalete] Barroso briefed the defense committee on the results of the NATO summit. The opposition also wanted to know the state of the Lajes negotiations. The minister spoke of cooperation and the wish to move away from the idea of financial quid pro quos, obtaining other types of support for Portugal. [Begin Barroso recording] The idea we wish to move away from is the idea of quid pro quos: The idea that we give the base and in return we receive a particular financial or other quid pro quo. No, the concept we want -- moreover because it is more in line with the dignity of a country such as Portugal, an active NATO and WEU [Western European Union] member -- is one of collaboration or cooperation toward a common objective that is Atlantic security, Western security. [end recording] [Lacalete] [passage omitted] As for the NATO summit, Barroso said that Lisbon's negotiating objectives were met and he explained what the Partnership for Peace accord meant for Portugal. [Begin Barroso recording] Partnership for Peace as an answer, I believe, is good, skillful, pragmatic, flexible, to the problem of knowing how to, on the one hand, respond to the security fears of the Central and East European countries, without, on the other hand, creating a new border in Europe with enemies further afield, namely Russia.
