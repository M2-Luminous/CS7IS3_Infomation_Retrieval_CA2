He said the current fighting there is a purely internal affair. He also said that Jordan believes in legitimacy as chosen by the Yemeni people and that when it mediated among the brothers in Yemen it did so at the clear request of all parties. Reacting to statements by some Yemeni Socialist Party officials who alleged that Jordan shipped weapons and military equipment to Yemen on board military aircraft, Dr. al-'Anani said: Jordan sent civilian aircraft to Yemen to evacuate Jordanian expatriates home after it became impossible for them to stay there because of the fighting and the eruption of fierce battles. At the same time, Jordan also used these aircraft to evacuate many citizens, families, and children from fraternal Arab and friendly foreign communities. Jordan was the only country to fulfill such a humanitarian role. The minister explained that because of the high insurance rate -- $500,000 --levied on civilian flights to fraternal Yemen, Jordan had to use and send C-130 military aircraft to rescue innocent civilians and evacuate Jordanians working in Yemen, as well as other nationals of brotherly and friendly states. He said: These aircraft were the only way to evacuate them and carry them back to the homeland. These flights were made in public and in full sight of all countries in the world, and in the presence of local, Arab, and foreign journalists. Dr. al-'Anani said it is not unusual or new for Jordan to engage in such humanitarian actions. Jordan has done this before, during the Gulf crisis when it received and hosted on its territory more than 1 million people, he added. The minister said he hopes the crisis in fraternal Yemen will end and the shedding of innocent blood among the brothers will stop, for the benefit and interests of the Yemeni Arab people and for the interests of the sons of the Arab nation.
