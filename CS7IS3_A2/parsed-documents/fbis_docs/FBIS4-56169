Financial adjustments and shock policies have been ruled out by the authorities because the effects on the population would be incomparably worse, according to Carlos Lage Davila, secretary of the Council of Ministers Executive Committee. Many parliamentarians have said the best technical solution must be politically feasible and consistent with the strategic goal of protecting the social accomplishments achieved over three decades. These measures, these sources say, must have the support of the majority of the people, hence the great effort recently made to extend the debate to work centers and encourage millions of people to directly participate in this process, popularly called workers parliaments. The issue was extensively debated by approximately 3 million workers, who attended more than 80,000 meetings held between January and March at their work centers to analyze the improvement of internal finances. With a fiscal deficit of more that 4.2 billion pesos (equivalent to U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate) and excess money in circulation amounting to approximately 11 billion, Cuban authorities are seeking formulas to correct Cuba's finances and economic feasibility and reduce the two indexes. Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon said there is a consensus that no single measure will perform the miracle unless it is accompanied by an increase in production and economic efficiency. What is more, we are trying to earn greater profits in state-owned companies, 69 percent of which are currently losing money, Alarcon admitted. Strengthening the national currency, encouraging work and production, and restoring the role of the salary are other goals the National Assembly could present in the special period of sessions to begin on 1 May.
