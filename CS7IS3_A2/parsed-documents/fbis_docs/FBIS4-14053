What do you have to say to your compatriots today, following this meeting with the U.S. secretary of state? [Husayn] I believe that the meeting was fruitful and useful. The climate of the talks was cordial and frank. Concerning the issue that is the focus of attention, it is the issue of peace. He [U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher] is obviously on his way to the region to activate things in a positive direction. I have learned that they [the Americans] have the same concerns we have concerning the fact that, for various reasons, enthusiasm for peace has recently suffered some setbacks. The parties concerned also feel this. Progress on a certain pivotal track has been very heartening. This is what I have to say as far as the issue of peace is concerned. As for another issue that we addressed, it is the issue of al-'Aqabah. It concerns the treatment of Jordan in a manner that could no longer be accepted or condoned. They have accepted our view. It seems that the issue is about to be resolved appropriately and satisfactorily. We expect.... [Malik, interrupting] Can we expect a change in the method of inspections? [Husayn] The blockade will be ended very soon. The ships that have been deployed there will be moved. A proper arrangement involving the use of a neutral party will be in place, something that we have proposed (?from the outset). [Malik] Sir, one last word on the fate of the peace process. Have you seen any new horizons for addressing the problem at this point? [Husayn] Sir, as far as I am concerned, the problem does not lie with the question of peace. For peace is undoubtedly a great objective. But, at the same time, one should contemplate the alternative should efforts fail, and should we fail to achieve anything. The peace I am speaking of is a durable, just, and comprehensive peace that future generations can accept. This is what we insist on and focus on. It seems to me that there are still great hopes for efforts to move in this direction. [Malik] Thank you, sir. [Husayn] Thank you, sir. [end recording]
