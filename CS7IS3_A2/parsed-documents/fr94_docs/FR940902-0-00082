FR940902-0-00082 FR940902-0-00010 Referrals of Eligible Applicants and Participants to Other Programs The final regulations further clarify the subject of referrals of both eligible applicants and participants due to confusion expressed by a number of commenters. The regulations, at §628.510(d) and at §628.530(c), specify the requirements for referral of eligible applicants and participants for whom available title II services are not deemed suitable or adequate to appropriate human service programs in the community. Section 628.510(d) deals with the situation in which an eligible applicant is referred to non-title II services during the intake process. Section 628.530 refers to referrals of participants, those individuals who have been determined to be eligible and have begun to receive objective assessment or other services. In the final regulations, both provisions are revised for clarity and to reduce the burden of documenting the referrals. Section 628.510(d) allows the SDA to conduct limited assessment of eligible applicants as a part of a determination of suitability, before they are enrolled as participants. The purpose of this pre-participation assessment is to enable SDA's to make more precise judgments as to the suitability of the applicant for participation in JTPA and/or additional services. The responsibility of the SDA at this point in the intake process is to assure that eligible applicants not suitable for title II participation are ``provided information on the full array of applicable or appropriate services that are available.'' (Section 204(a)(2)(A) of the Act) and that necessary arrangements are made for individuals to make contact with those services. Section 628.530(c) addresses referral of participants out of title II services. A number of commenters indicated concern over burdensome paperwork requirements for referral of participants to other than title II programs. The Department has addressed these concerns by amending §628.320(c) to permit referral decisions for participants with whom there will be no continuing relationship to be recorded in a partial ISS. No further tracking of such referred participants is required. Of course, where there will be a continuing relationship with the referred participant, §628.530(a) provides that the referral decision should be recorded in the ISS and that the participant's progress should be tracked. In the case of service providers who discover that an eligible applicant cannot be served by its program, §628.510(e) requires that service providers refer such individuals to the SDA for further assessment and referral. Clarification of referral responsibilities was requested by a number of commenters. In addition to the above explanations, §628.510(d) and §628.530(c) are revised to specify that no follow-up is required for referrals of eligible applicants or participants with whom there will not be a continuing relationship. Further, the Department wishes to point out that either an applicant or a participant may be referred out of JTPA at any time, if warranted by customer need or preference. Some commenters seemed to think that both an objective assessment and ISS ``must be completed'' prior to referral outside the program. Since both assessment and the ISS are presumed to be continually reviewed and evolving during participation, this assumption is not warranted. Job Search Limitations A fundamental change in section 204(c)(2) of the Act regarding program design is the requirement that job search, job clubs, and work experience activities be accompanied by other services that increase a participant's educational and occupational skills. This change reflects evidence that, in some cases, suggests that quick turnaround placement programs have minimal long-term impact when provided in isolation from other more comprehensive and intensive services. The Department's Inspector General, in a 1988 report, concluded that the number of JTPA participants on public assistance was only slightly reduced after completion of JTPA programs. On the other hand, The National JTPA Study found a 39% earnings gain for adult women from the provision of stand alone job search services. This new limitation reflects an overall thrust of JTPA to provide quality services to participants. For example, short-term job search assistance alone might result in a job placement for low-skilled individuals, but job retention is not likely without concomitant services aimed at increasing participants' needed basic or occupational skills. Accordingly, §628.535 codifies section 204(c)(2)(B) of the Act which limits the provision of stand-alone job search assistance, job search skills training, and job club activities to title II participants. ``Job search assistance'' itself is defined in §626.5.
