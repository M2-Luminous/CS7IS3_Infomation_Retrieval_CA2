Not unlike the period immediately following parliamentary elections, he does not seem to have any idea as to how he should coexist with the governing coalition. The president is not used to a situation in which he must impose limits on himself, because some spheres up high are excluded from the set of issues that can be disputed. Since meeting with the SLD Club, Walesa has been linked to the governing coalition by a network of interdependent relations. He keeps the promises made to the coalition (he has forwarded his draft constitution, his representative will participate in the work of the committee, SLD is taking over the deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries). However, he apparently does not feel very comfortable in this new situation. This was quite obvious at a meeting with the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] in Szczecin, and at a meeting of the Accord Forum in Gdansk, where Walesa did not have much to say to his supporters. The official truce with SLD, concluded before television cameras, has invalidated the main thesis that he wanted to talk about during his tour of the country. In addition, on some issues Walesa and SLD simply have "similar goals." For example, the National Council of Radio and Television [KRRiT] and public television in general. It cannot be ruled out that Walesa will achieve what he has not been able to achieve in any other way -- by appealing to the honor (of three KRRiT members and requesting that they hand in their resignations), through the method of "extending" the law (recalling Chairman Marek Markiewicz from his function), by expressing his dissatisfaction (Wieslaw Walendziak). Unless there is some change here (one cannot exclude the possibility that Walesa will not start defending KRRiT and Walendziak from the "conquest intentions" of SLD), SLD will make changes that the president will approve. The president's helplessness is becoming increasingly noticeable. Recently he has rarely had a chance to make a decision which to some degree would concern the governing coalition. He was the one to decide what should be done with the amendment to the law on the procedures for preparing and adopting the constitution. However, he really could not veto it -- because he had made a deal with Kwasniewski that the constitution issue would be excluded from any conflict areas, as well as because the bill includes a provision concerning a legislative initiative that he had been trying to pass. Soon, after the Sejm makes its decision, he will decide the issue of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] law. He will be able to take advantage of this decision as a propaganda move. If he vetoes it, he will earn the gratefulness of "Solidarity." The president has not been very successful recently in dealing with several issues. He was very active, and his behavior even had the characteristics of an election campaign. However, opinion polls suggest that exactly in the period of this activeness, his popularity was on the wane. Waldemar Pawlak turned out to be disloyal, by announcing self-governmental elections in line with the old Electoral Law and not waiting for the president to query the new one. Moreover, it turns out that Walesa cannot hope that someone will build a pro-presidential grouping for him, without his participation. BBWR is clearly not able to cope with this and is just waiting for the president to get involved. Existing groupings are looking for candidates for president; however, for the time being none of them want to back Walesa. Walesa cannot really rekindle an open conflict with the coalition soon because the promises which he has made are an obstacle here. Nor can he conclude a lasting peace with it because the president, who considers himself to be the guarantor of democracy, cannot make peace with a force which, according to him, threatens it. However, it can be expected that the president's conflict with the coalition will last. If Walesa does not have other possibilities of making the coalition's life difficult, there will still be the word conflict. Just like there is now. Walesa speaks about the necessity of reaching a balance, he announces a "play-off." He has quite considerable possibilities here, including the one that he is already exploiting: Presenting the governing parties as a threat to democracy and himself -- as the defender of this democracy.
