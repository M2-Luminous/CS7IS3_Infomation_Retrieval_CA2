The SNS particularly welcomes the decision on opening government offices in Belgrade and Zagreb. "This is a step forward toward establishing crucial conditions for mutual recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two states," said Milan Djukic, president of the SNS at a press conference held on Thursday [20 January]. He assessed as "positivie and extremely significant" that "for the first time in Croatian policy all forces are clearly opting for a peaceful solution to the crisis, and Presidnet Tudjman is talking about Serbian autonomy in the UN Protected Areas, although he has not as yet specified its nature." He nevertheless expressed certain reservations toward the latest Geneva negotiations, and said that, taking into consideration the differences and unprincipled attitude of Europe and the world toward finding a solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia, more significant results could not have been expected. "This gives all the sides involved in the conflict the chance to persevere in realizing their aims," stressed Djukic and added that this is "more than enough reason for continuing the war." Djukic reiterated the SNS's position that the global solution of the Balkan crisis lies in relations between Serbia and Croatia. He also said that the issue of "how to create an atmosphere of mutual trust" remains an open one. In Djukic's opinion, Croatia's main problem is the solution of the Serbian issue, which should be debated in the Sabor [Croatian parliament], along with other pressing issues of internal policy, as soon as possible. He added that it was "important for Croatian policy to opt for, and clearly understand that a compromise is the only solution open to it." "Croatian policy no longer has any time for mistakes," said the president of the SNS.
