The coalition is deeply divided over Japan's future political alignment. It is also doubtful whether a new coalition leader will be able to effectively tackle a horde of issues such as winning Diet (parliament) approval for the fiscal 1994 budget, implementing economic reforms, deregulating government controls on businesses and defusing Japan-U.S. trade tensions. As representatives of the seven ruling coalition parties ended talks today aimed at picking a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, discord among them over who should be chosen and how to choose is pushing an already fragile alliance to the verge of division. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest political force in the coalition, proposed holding a meeting of coalition leaders on Monday [11 April] to name a successor, party officials said. The SDP, new party Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) are fighting the proposal by Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government Party) to pick Hosokawa's successor through representative dialogue. The SDP told other coalition partners it was skipping the next round of talks, scheduled for this afternoon. Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, who is also chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa administration, has said that talks among party representatives are no longer functioning. He has proposed that coalition leaders meet to discuss the formation of a post- Hosokawa cabinet. Rivalry within the eight-month-old coalition has intensified over the selection of a successor since last Friday when Hosokawa abruptly decided to step down and take responsibility for dubious financial dealings, and for the month-long deadlock in the Diet over the state budget for fiscal 1994. Although coalition leaders agreed Saturday to pick Hosokawa's successor and to form a new cabinet by the end of this week, the SDP is resisting a move to name Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, one of the most promising candidates for the premiership, as new prime minister. The Shinseito party, led by Hata, and the Komeito party envision a new government made up of parties which are in full accords on key issues such as tax reform and the nuclear situation in the Korean peninsula. The SDP disagrees with this stand, saying that the top priority should be how to maintain the framework of a unified coalition and keep it in power. According to political analysts, in the event of a new realignment of political parties, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe and former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, both from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), may emerge as front runners for the premiership. Watanabe has maintained close relations with Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito co-leader and the main strategist of the coalition, even through Ozawa bolted the LDP last summer to form the Shinseito party. Appearing on television today with Hata and two other coalition leaders, Watanabe, also a former vice premier, signaled his willingness to run for prime minister if there are a "comfortable" number of LDP members who will support him. However, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama voiced skepticism about working together with the LDP saying, "there is no such possibility." Differences in political outlook among coalition leaders became clear one month ago when discussions began on coalition members forming a single party. Plainly put, the second act of Japan's political regrouping is now in progress. Act one was the fall of the LDP, which had dominated Japan's scandal-ridden political world for an uninterrupted 38 years, and the birth of the Hosokawa-led coalition government. There now appears to be two options for the second realignment, political sources said. One would be the formation of a triangular structure made up of the LDP, a group encompassing Shinseito and Komeito, and a third bloc comprising the SDP, the DSP, and Sakigake. The other option would lead to two large conservative parties, one led by the LDP and the other by newer conservatives. Power struggles between the Shinseito-Komeito-JNP [Japan New Party] camp on one hand and a group comprising the SDP, the DSP and Sakigake on the other has intensified as the former has tried to unify the coalition members into one party. They maintain that the coalition must unite as one party under a new electoral system to prevent the opposition LDP from recapturing power in the next general election. Some analysts have long predicted that the Hosokawa government was doomed because political reform was achieved in January focusing on the introduction of a new single-seat electoral system for the House of Representatives. After accomplishing this reform, Hosokawa charted new political terrain by proposing economic and administrative reforms as new policy goals. Since then, the coalition government has been troubled by internal divisions. The Hosokawa cabinet will remain as caretaker until a new prime minister is chosen by the end of this week. No matter who takes the reins of the new government, there is a bumpy road ahead for the ruling coalition.
