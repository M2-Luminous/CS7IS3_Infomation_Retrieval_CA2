The official told KYODO NEWS SERVICE that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev presented the proposal to his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen when the two met in Beijing the same day. The official said Kozyrev suggested establishing the zone on Greater Ussuri Island, known in Chinese as Heixiazi Island. The Amur river is known as the Heilong river in Chinese. If the Chinese side agrees to the proposal, it could serve as a "model" for resolving a border dispute between Japan and Russia over four islands to the north of Japan, the official said. The disputed islands are Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai islet group, all northeast of Hokkaido. They were seized from Japan by the former Soviet Union at the end of World War II. In 1991, China and Russia signed an agreement settling some of their differences over their common border in the east, but several portions remain in dispute, including islands in the Amur River, where Chinese and Soviet soldiers fought battles in 1969. The official said Kozyrev and Jiang agreed that Chinese president Jiang Zemin will visit Moscow for the first time in either October or November this year. The official said that prior to the visit, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit Beijing in May for talks with Chinese leaders, and Qian will then visit Moscow to finalize details of agreements to be signed during Jiang's visit.
