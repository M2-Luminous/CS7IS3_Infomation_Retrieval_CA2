The lack of sufficient resources in Russian rubles and other foreign hard currency is beginning to show. Many merchants, having earned these days their first thousands of drams, have encountered difficulties converting them to other currency and....closed their stores. Elbow-shoving queues form in state-owned stores, where the supply of goods is minimal. People are indignant that butter priced at 25 drams and sugar at 10 drams have been designated for unrestricted sale rather than being sold by rationing coupons. Let us point out, however, that these complaints are unfair, since the available quantity of these goods clearly was not enough to distribute them to the entire population through coupons. In some instances, however, both store employees and members of law enforcement also violate the rules of trading, creating chaos and confusion in the lines. This is doubly impermissible, since right now backing up the dram with available goods is a political as well as economic action. There also is a clear discrepancy, imbalance, between the official exchange rates of currencies set by the Central Bank (for instance, 15 drams for one U.S. dollar) and the "black market" rates, which are, it should be pointed out, more realistic (25-30 drams for a dollar). The banks, which are experiencing a shortage of foreign currency, set restrictions on sales of hard currency, trying to artificially hold down its exchange rate and not allow the dram to weaken. Wherever hard currency is sold at the official rate, colossal lines form immediately. Meanwhile, and precisely for the aforementioned reasons, prices rise continuously. While during the first days of the money exchange, Magna cigarettes could be purchased for 5 drams, and then later for 8-10 drams, now at this price, if one is very lucky, one can count only on Turkish cigarettes of a quality that is lower by an order of magnitude. Butter went from costing 45 drams a kilogram to 80-120 drams, and sugar--from 15 to 30. If the difficulties with the internal convertibility of the Armenian currency continue, before the year is out the republic may get its third bout of hyperinflation in so many months, empty store shelves, and total impoverishment of the population. With all the shortcomings in organizing the sales of butter and sugar reserved for the state trade network, I think that prices for these products will not gallop for a while. The government also should take immediate steps to organize pre-New Year sales of the greatest number of goods possible by coupons: this could bring down panic buying, and reduce the intense pressure on the consumer market. Under socialism, the cheerless scheme of the consumer market workings looked this way: there is money but no goods. At the initial stage of a transition to market relations, the picture changed dramatically: the population no longer has any money, while everything one can imagine in one's most wonderful dream has now appeared in the stores at high prices. Now the situation has become even more dramatic: empty pockets and empty stores. Are we moving further away from harmony?
