In his work report to the NPC, premier Li Peng announced that the Government would be providing special funds to large and medium- scale state-run enterprises and would exempt them from contributions to budgetary funds and energy and transport projects. But Wang Guoquan, a leading industrialist and a member of the standing committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said such financial privileges were only temporary measures designed to ensure stability in a transitional period. If enterprises continued to lose money for long periods of time and failed to improve their economic efficiency, Mr. Wang said the Government would have no choice but to let them go bankrupt. "Enterprises which solely rely on the Government's preferential policies without deepening their own reform will definitely sink and the Government will not keep providing them with aid," Mr. Wang told a specially convened press conference in Beijing. Mr. Wang said there was no contradiction between encouraging enterprises to take care of themselves on the one hand and continuing to provide them with subsidies on the other. "What premier Li meant (in his work report) is that enterprises should mainly rely on their own efforts to deepen reform of their operational mechanism but before that, in the transitional period, the Government has no choice but to offer them some preferential treatment so that we can ensure the livelihood of their workers." "These are only temporary measures," he stressed. However, independent analysts said "temporary" in this context could mean several years. A Western diplomat in Beijing said: "The social disorder which would result from have 30 million or 40 million workers laid off is enough to make anyone nervous and so it is understandable the Government wants to shore up these enterprises for the time being. And with one third of these enterprises loosing huge amounts of money, it will take several years before the state sector is finally ready to take the plunge," she said. Other observers said the Government's decision to provide additional funds to the state sector this year had been prompted by a wave of worker unrest over the past year. A local economist said: "The Government has clearly been rattled by the increase in strikes and disruptions to production caused by workers' protests." However, Mr. Wang said reports of numerous strikes in China had been exaggerated.
