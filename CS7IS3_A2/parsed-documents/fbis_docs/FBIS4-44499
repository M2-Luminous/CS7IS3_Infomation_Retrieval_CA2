Intensity of Beijing's Reaction Yet To Be Determined The diplomatic technique the CPC has used with the upper levels of Taiwan's government has reflected a low-key approach. CPC officials, through diplomatic personnel stationed in Malaysia, lodged protests, but these lacked any new content. After the event, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin's statement on where China stands on the issue also did not go beyond past statements, but pointed out that Lien Chan's so-called "vacation diplomacy" in essence is a new type of flower involving a "diplomacy elastically stretching to encompass real affairs," the goal of which is to have "two Chinas" and "one China one Taiwan." He expressed China's "resolute opposition" to this approach. On 2 January, Lien Chan arrived in Singapore, and the CPC adopted an look but not talk approach, perhaps being unwilling to cause problems for old friend Lee Kuan Yew. The CPC-controlled media remained silent, and Renmin Ribao and provincial level party papers did not report any news concerning this event. However, XINHUA's "reference dispatch" was different than others, and though it never directly published the official position, it provided a wide-ranging commentary on foreign media reporting and the bent of Taiwan and Hong Kong press commentaries, hence it is possible to ferret out the CPC's attitude on this event. The Hong Kong Taiwan edition of the "reference dispatch" for the first 10 days of January described Taiwan, and the CHINA TIMES, Joint Report, and NEW NEWS reports, editorials, and commentaries related to Lien Chan's visit all paid particular attention to Taiwan's "go south policy," and "go west policy," and the issue of Taiwan Singapore joint investment in Hainan became a focal point of commentary. Singing the Same Old Tune, Affirming Investment Hong Kong's leftist periodicals, though they did no news follow up on Lien Chan's trip, after the event (10 days after Lien had returned to Taiwan), took a comparatively "official" position, using commentaries to attack Taipei's "vacation diplomacy," not only several steps later than the Foreign Ministry statement, but also singing the same old tune, with not a shred of anything new. Hong Kong's newspaper commentaries, when discussing the results of Lien's visit to Singapore, were also brimming with affirmation and admiration. This was all due to the fact that news of Taiwan Singapore cooperation in investing in Hainan "has already received the approval of relevant quarters on Taiwan," and Taiwan authorities "are actively appraising the feasibility of this plan." The commentators believe that Lien's proposal to develop Hainan is "implementing a mainland policy by moving to take the initiative," and "there is no doubt that many investment opportunities will be provided to Taiwan businesses." The commentaries describe Taiwan business circle figures as having the following view on this trend: "it will help in bettering relations between the two sides, and develop the aspect of mutual benefit." "Association for Economic Promotion" Establishment Not By Chance At the same time as CPC officials are criticizing Taiwan for "vacation diplomacy," and going all out in engaging in a "one China, one Taiwan" plot, high level leaders on Hainan are not listening to the sounds coming from the center, and have made economic circles in Hong Kong and Taiwan focus attention on the announcement of the establishment of the "Hainan-Taiwan (Hong Kong and Macao) Association for Economic Cooperation" (abbreviated the Association for Economic Cooperation). This seems to manifest an attitude of "you in the `center' talk about political principles, and we will talk about economic benefits." This "Association" is by no means a makeshift creation of the Hainan provincial party committee. Earlier, in May of 1993, Hainan Governor Ruan Chongwu, during an interview with the Taiwan media, disclosed that tentative concept that the province was "strengthening cooperation with Taiwan." In July, concrete appraisals and preparations got under way. When the "Association" registered its establishment, though Taiwan only had two of the fourteen founding enterprises (Hainan had eight, and Hong Kong four), the provincial Taiwan affairs office had considerable influence among the players. It was decided to call the association "Hainan Taiwan" and not "Hainan, Hong Kong, Taiwan," a fact that appears to have significant import. The provincial Taiwan affairs office on its own facilitated the "Association" by stressing it is a "popular organization," and also indicates that Hainan does not wish to reveal its political essence. Vice Governor Mao Zhijun stated that if an enterprise wants to join the "Association," it must first support the unification of the "deeply loved motherland." In sum, Hainan Province, at the time it announced the establishment of the "Association," was clearly indicating that it was unwilling, because of central political principles, to abandon the benefits of Taiwan business investment in Hainan, and that its approach would be different from the way the CPC is handling Sino-British relations, which is pinning down economic projects, and from the approach six months ago of using economic sanctions against France to protest French arms sales to Taiwan. Provincial Party Committee Paying Close Attention to Effect of Lien Chan Lien Chan, when he met in Singapore with Prime Minister Goh, proposed the tentative idea of linking hands to develop Hainan and making Hainan into the economic hot spot of southeast Asia in a short space of time. The Hainan Provincial Party committee is playing close attention to news relevant to this and to the reaction on Taiwan, and in addition to strengthening the flow of information, provincial officials issued a directive on it to the Hong Kong Longtou Corporation (Huahai), requesting that Huahai use its "window" role, and thoroughly evaluate "the effectiveness of Lien Chan" on the trend of Taiwan investment in Hainan. The close attention paid by the Hainan provincial Party committee to Lien's visit to Singapore includes the following points: 1) The specific content of Lien and Goh's tentative plan to cooperate on investment in Hainan; 2) Singapore's support for Taiwan to become a "dialogue partner" of ASEAN, and the reaction to this in the region; 3) The concrete plan of the Taiwan side to "develop" Zhongnan Peninsula; 4) The situation in the past when Taiwan businessmen in Singapore jointly invested with new countries in the mainland market; 5) What specific actions and reactions Taiwan businesses have had, etc. Overseas Organizations Work To Coordinate Techniques "Huahai" Corporation is the top organization Hainan officials control in Hong Kong and Macao. Looking at the corporations's major achievements in the eight years since Huahai became stationed in Hong Kong, its diversified management, and the overall leadership of the province's small and large Hong Kong-based organizations and enterprises, the corporation's special advantages and position can clearly be seen. Businesses overseen by Huahai not only include trading, real estate, and financial businesses, but also visa brokers. Recently the affairs of the Huahai Corporation seem to have become even busier. The tentative plan for Taiwan and Singapore to jointly develop Hainan has brought a new turning point to the development of the island. The director of the Huahai Corporation says that in order to adapt to a foreign oriented economy, he welcomes potential investment in Hainan, tourism is riding a new high tide, and the Huahai-subordinate Hainan Tourism Corporation will be supplying a series of business tourist services convenient for Taiwan businesses, from plane chartering services to arranging complete full-service tours of Hainan, and consulting services to enhance Taiwan, and other foreign business investment. Huahai's external publicity material in particular stresses that Hainan supplies "on ground visas" for travelling traders, and for Taiwan and foreign businessmen staying for no more than 15 days this eliminates visa hassles. The special environment of Hainan Island makes it convenient for the Hainan Special Economic Zone to implement special preferential policies for foreign businesses. It is understood that central authorities have given Hainan even greater leeway. The Yangpu Development Zone, which has been controversial, going from being "patriotic" to "selling the country," has entered full bore into the process of attracting business, and the zeal with which Hainan Province is seeking foreign business investment is evidenced by the province's implementation of the "first approve the corporation, then on to the project" approach.
