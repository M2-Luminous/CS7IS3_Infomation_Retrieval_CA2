By the new system, the management of credit assets will be shifted from quantity control to qualitative control. The Shenzhen branch of the People's Bank of China, as a management institution, will provide loans according to the assessment of a number of factors including assets sufficiency rate, the ratio between deposits and loans, fluidity of assets and structure of loans instead of controlling the total credit line alone. Officials said that the reform, aiming to achieve standard, scientific and modern management in financial institutions, will help these institutions improve security, fluidity and efficiency of credit funds, thus establishing a flexible and secure monetary payment system. Experiments in such system started in 1992. Now the system is being applied differently to financial institutions of different ownerships. For state-owned commercial banks, assets risk management is applied with credit put under compulsory quota management while for regional, joint stock commercial banks, the risk management is put under supervision, with the credit quotas as mandatory. Only non-banking financial institutions have instituted the standard risk management of assets, with no credit quotas imposed.
