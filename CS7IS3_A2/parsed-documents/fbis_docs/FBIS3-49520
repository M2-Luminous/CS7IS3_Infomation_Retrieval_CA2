The letter stresses that Bosnia-Herzegovina's application will be considered and that all NATO members have been informed about this initiative. Partnership for Peace does not represent formal membership in NATO. It implies mutual obligations of NATO member states and those countries whose foreign and defense policies have the same aims as those of NATO member states. This idea was initiated by U.S. President Bill Clinton and, in the initial stage, it referred to some Central European countries that have already met the conditions for participation in Partnership for Peace. In his letter to Ljubijankic, Woerner expressed the belief that this year will bring peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was stated in a communique issued by the Foreign Ministry of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
