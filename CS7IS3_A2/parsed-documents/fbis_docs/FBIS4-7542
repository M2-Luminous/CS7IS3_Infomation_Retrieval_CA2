The UN peacekeepers were "virtually prepared" to take up positions between the antagonists in line with the ceasefire accord signed here Wednesday which comes into effect at 0700 GMT next Monday, the Canadian general said. Under the deal the two sides will withdraw their forces and heavy weapons along the confrontation line between the two forces: the Croatian army and Serb separatists who have proclaimed their own "Serb republic of Krajina" [RSK] on one third of Croatian territory. Mortars are to be withdrawn 10 kilometres (six miles) and artillery 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the confrontation lines by Monday at 0700 GMT, while the opposing forces are to move back one kilometre by next Friday at 0700 GMT, creating a two-kilometre buffer zone in which the UN forces will enforce the ceasefire. "We are a little short of resources, but our plans are taking this into account, we are aware of sensitive areas and we will concentrate our efforts on those sensitive areas," MacInnis said. UNPROFOR will redeploy forces currently elsewhere, notably Belgian and Jordanian troops temporarily withdrawn from Croatia to implement the ceasefire in Sarajevo. The 400 Russian paratroopers sent to Sarajevo from Klisa in eastern Croatia "will remain in Bosnia." The additional resources needed in Croatia -- where 15,000 peacekeepers are already deployed -- amount to four mechanised infantry companies, a mechanised infantry battalion comprising 1,000 men, four engineering companies comprising 600 men and a squadron of six helicopters comprising 200 men, UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig said. "The first difficult task will be... transforming what was written on the map to precise locations on the ground, the establishment of our joint (Serb-Croatian) commissions which will have the task of confirming on the ground precisely where those lines of separation are to be... a difficult if not impossible task," MacInnis said. The commissions are also to determine the number of Serb and Croatian police who under the accord are to be deployed in limited numbers between the two "separation lines." "We will have to go over the area point by point, village by village, town by town in order to determine the police presence for those areas. It's going to be a lot of hard work," he said.
