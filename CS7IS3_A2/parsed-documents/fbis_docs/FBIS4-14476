According to Admiral Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet, 95 percent of the military hardware had been withdrawn as of mid-March. The Baltic Fleet commander clarified that military hardware from Liepai will be withdrawn by 1 May of this year. Similar work is being carried out in Tallinn where the remaining artillery ammunition in the depots is outdated. However, the situation becomes more complicated because Tallinn harbor is covered with ice and shipments must be carried out by railroad.
