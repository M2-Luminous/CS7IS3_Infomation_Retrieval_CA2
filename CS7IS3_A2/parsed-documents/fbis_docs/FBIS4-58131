Mr. Qammuh, in an interview with the JORDAN TIMES , said the government's initial reading of the Paris agreement "shows that the PLO has gained more than anticipated...it is a step achieved." The documents, of which only excerpts were made available to the press, is reportedly 15 pages long and deal with the different aspects of the Palestinian economy in detail. "There are new areas and new grounds for Palestinian authority in the agreement," Mr. Qammuh said in reference to the accord, which was signed by Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and PLO negotiator Ahmad Quray' in a ceremony attended by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe at his ministry's headquarters in Paris. Mr. Qammuh pointed especially to the Palestinians gaining independent economic decisions over taxation, banks and currency, stamps and customs. He said the economic pact does not negate an economic agreement between Jordan and the PLO which was signed here in January. "The PLO-Israeli agreement is not in contradiction with the Jordan-PLO agreement," he said. He said Jordan views positively any improvement which promotes the independent economic decision of the Palestinians. But the minister's positive reaction was not shared by economists and other officials who said that the agreement amounted to the PLO sanctioning the holding of the Palestinian economy "hostage to the Israeli economy." The points which were positively received by Mr. Qammuh appeared to be the same as those that the critics picked up on to indicate a new Palestinian tilt away from Jordan and towards Israel. Critics of the agreement said its different articles were geared to the benefit of the Israeli economy creating an "economic integration between the Palestinian entity and Israel" and treating Jordan like any other Arab country dealing with the new Palestinian entity. Conceding that the agreement holds symbols of authority for the emerging Palestinian entity, the critics maintain that while the Israelis "are spend thrift with symbolism, they are stingy when it comes to the actual implementation." "There is not a single positive element in this agreement," one economist contended. The agreement, he argued, has singled out the Israeli shekel as the legal tender in the areas under Palestinian authority and "has dumped the Jordanian dinar with other currencies." According to the agreement, pending final arrangements, the Israeli shekel "will continue to constitute a legal means for payment in the autonomy's areas side by side with other currencies." Banks which were initially expected to come under the authority of the Central Bank of Jordan "are now going to be run by the Palestinian monetary authority which is still under an Israeli authority," the economist said. Where Jordan hoped to have an advantage, trade between the East and West Bank, Israel and the PLO had agreed to free movement of goods at what appears to be the same prices as those offered in Israel while placing Jordan in a situation where its exports to the territories will be taxed. "Jordan will be dealt with as if it is exporting to Israel," another economist said. A senior official defending the agreement said that the critics were looking at the agreement only from one angle and forgetting that this agreement is between Israel and the PLO and that that is "only one front" of the over all picture. "It is not a zero sum theory," said the official, who asked for anonymity. "Any improvement on the living and work conditions of Palestinians is good for us," the official said. He said that the opening up of trade between Jordan and the Palestinian entity, at any level, is an improvement on the current situation where "there is almost no trade." He said that the agreement provides for a favoured trade status for Jordan and Egypt ahead of other Islamic and Arab countries. "What is happening is that a new market is opening up across the border," the official said. "Instead of being fearful and criticising the situation from afar we should be ready to take advantage of the situation." "There can be no progress or success when we are crippled by fear," the senior official said. Under the Jordan-PLO agreement, the senior official said, it was expected that the Jordanian dinar was not going to be the main currency in the occupied territories and that the Central Bank of Jordan was only going to supervise the banks "until the time the Palestinians were able to establish their own monetary authority." "The agreement never said that Jordan will take over the monetary affairs of the Palestinian entity... It is still going to take some time before the Palestinans establish a monetary authority and the Jordan-PLO agreement stands until that time," he added. Critics, the official said, have to understand that "we in Jordan want them (the PLO) to have authority and to supervise their own affairs."
