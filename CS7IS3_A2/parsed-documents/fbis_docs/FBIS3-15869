They flew there for various purposes and with very dissimilar opportunities available to them, and hence it is quite impossible to assess by the same yardstick the success or failure of Ukraine's Leonid Kravchuk, Georgia's Eduard Shevardnadze, and Russia's Ivan Rybkin. This extreme closeness in time and space allows us to see more clearly which of its interests -- and in what way -- the last superpower is pursuing in that vast area that only recently was unfriendly, and which today is no longer hostile, is not yet friendly, and is -- it is not clear exactly what. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who for a long time was regarded in Washington as more or less persona non grata because of his stubborn refusal to acknowledge the legality of agreements on nuclear missile disarmament which he himself had signed, wanted not only to make a good impression, but to win the hearts of his sensitive hosts. That was why he took along Olympic figure skating champion Oksana Bayul, in whose company he went to the White House. This original idea proved surprisingly inconvenient. President Clinton had been too busy to meet with the Olympic champions among his own compatriots. For the U.S. President to receive Oksana, albeit as one of a state delegation, was a mistake which, ridiculous as it seems, could cost him many votes. The president of Ukraine, in whose territory, unfortunately, there is not much oil or gas, has reached the point of needing to trade in the only commodity he has which has export value: Ukraine's geopolitical location. He told the Americans that a strong and independent Ukraine could be an important buffer against any expansionist urges on Russia's part. In the absence of any clear laws on the protection of foreign capital, Kravchuk sought to entice businesspeople to try their hands in the renewed Ukraine -- on the strength of his firm word as president. The participants in the New York meetings raised no objection aloud, but all the same they were thinking of L. Kravchuk's remark to the effect that he does not intend to be a candidate in the presidential elections to be held in the summer. Politicians who are serving out their term without hope are known in America as "lame ducks," or, as we would put it, winged birds. This duality probably annoyed Kravchuk, who expressed the view, at one press conference, that Ukraine has more pressing matters on hand now than the presidential elections. Eduard Shevardnadze, head of Georgia: cordial but imperious, a little tired, but indefatigable, M.S. Gorbachev's loyal associate, has been to Washington and to Andrews Air Base many times. Speaking on behalf of his country of 5.5 million people, he performs miracles of inventiveness, keeping the diplomatic ball in the air. While giving Russia, the Russians, and the CIS their due, he put two requests to President Clinton. The first, naturally, concerns money. The White House is giving $100 million -- taking its possibilities to the limit. "Let Shevardnadze ask Congress himself, he will do better (than me)" -- President Clinton advised, half-joking, half-serious. Shevardnadze's second request takes a larger view. The Georgian leader asked the United States to send U.S. servicemen to the border with Abkhazia as part of UN peace-making forces. Clinton, naturally, refused. Point-blank. Whatever you do, don't send Americans to fight God knows where and God knows what for. But Shevardnadze is not the kind of person to take champion sportswomen to meet the President. And nor was he about to demand something from Clinton that the latter would never do. Shevardnadze wanted the U.S. President to lead a movement in the United States for the sending of "Blue Helmets" to Georgia, and he got what he wanted. Knowing very well that nothing is going to happen in the Caucasus without Russia, Shevardnadze is setting about the task of not excluding Russia, but ensuring international monitoring of its necessary and inevitable involvement in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. This kind of monitoring is only possible if the United Nations takes on the role of maintaining peace-making forces. Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Russian Duma, showed that the communist devil is not as black as he is painted, because he is no longer a communist at all, but a regular social democrat like the ones in Sweden or Austria. That is what many American newspapers said about the chairman of the State Duma, while the capital's WASHINGTON POST devoted an enthusiastic article to him, by its Moscow correspondent, describing the parliamentary speaker as a man who is capable, by means of his calmness, of restoring many people's confidence in his powers. Describing the long walks to school by the little boy in the countryside, and then his work on the kolkhoz, that newspaper says that the 47-year-old former Volgograd Oblast CPSU Committee secretary is most reminiscent of Abraham Lincoln, the celebrated American president, who was a woodcutter in his youth. The urbane, smiling speaker confidently denied charges that his Agrarian Party harbors antireform sentiments, sought to demonstrate that the Duma is ready and willing to cooperate with the president, and, most important, reaffirmed again and again his commitment to the foreign policy line which only recently was seen as probably Andrey Kozyrev's most heinous crime -- the line of partnership and cooperation with the United States.
