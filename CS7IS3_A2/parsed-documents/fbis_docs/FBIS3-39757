Who is letting down whom? This question is being asked increasingly often at present, a week and a half before the planned completion of the EU negotiations. Rumors are rife, and many are to do with the Finns' and the Norwegians' real motives and demands with regard to agriculture. In Finnish negotiating circles the view is that Norway is not battling particularly hard to achieve success on the most important issue: What sort of permanent support arrangements will be agreed for northern agriculture? There is also a feeling that Norway has begun too early to talk about compromises when it comes to transitional arrangements. The Norwegians have long been afraid that the Finns will forget their demand for reasonable transitional arrangements if they only succeed in achieving good permanent support arrangements. It is being said that as the result of a Finnish initiative the European Commission is now working to find alternatives to transitional arrangements for the food industry. These include investment support, debt rescheduling, and regional support. AFTENPOSTEN has been unable to confirm the truth of any of these rumors, but they are nevertheless interesting because they show the fragility of Nordic cohesion. There are also a number of obvious reasons for why the rumors have arisen. At last week's negotiating meeting the Norwegian trade minister opted for a strategy different from that of her colleagues from the three other applicant countries. She pointed to the fact that on the question of transitional arrangements for agriculture the EU has kept the door ajar for Norway. However, since then only very few have seen the gap in the door that Grete Knudsen saw. Most people think that the EU stood completely firm on its original demand that EU prices should be introduced on the day that Norway becomes a member. Outsiders took the Norwegian attitude to be that Norway accepts the introduction of EU prices from day one if it is possible to make exceptions for those farmers and that section of the food industry that simply cannot cope with such a rapid transition to the EU market. According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, this is to read too much into things. It is true that Norway has agreed to investigate the need for transitional arrangements for every individual product in the agricultural sector, but this investigation will show that we need protection in the vast majority of cases. Thus Norway is standing firm on the central principle -- of achieving a type of transitional arrangement different from those the EU has proposed. As far as permanent support arrangements are concerned, there is an obvious reason why Finland is suspicious of Norway's determination to stand firm: At present the EU is working with an arrangement that suits Norway much better than it suits Finland. A proposal for criteria that will determine new support arrangements has been drafted which, in crude terms, will mean that northern Norway, Trondelag, and the northernmost part of southern Norway can receive special support. The same criteria only provide a base for support for 3 percent of Finnish agriculture. The Finns therefore have major problems with accepting these criteria as a point of departure for the negotiations. In Norway the attitude is that with a few minor adjustments to the EU's criteria it will also be possible to cover important areas of southern Norway. Norwegian negotiators are therefore attaching importance to the fact that the EU is now actually prepared to create support arrangements that are specially designed for the farmers in the north. This was not the case from the beginning.
