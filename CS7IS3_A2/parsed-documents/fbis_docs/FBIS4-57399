FBIS4-57399 "drlat095_a_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-095 Daily Report 16 May 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba CTC Assemblies Process To Continue Through June CTC Assemblies Process To Continue Through June FL1605230594 Havana Radio Reloj Network in Spanish 1932 GMT 16 May 94 FL1605230594 Havana Radio Reloj Network Spanish BFN [Text] The subject of economic efficiency at each individual work center is at the heart of the discussions in the assemblies process being massively held by the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation] and its unions, as of today, in the same spirit as the recently held Parliaments in the Workplace. These assemblies began last month as pilot assemblies and will continue through the month of June, with the objective of avoiding marathons and favoring proper preparation of these meetings, which should be open and free of preconceived outlines. The national leadership of the CTC has told its unions to be demanding regarding administrative reports, which may not contain justifications, but must instead be very objective about what needs be done at the work center to (?prioritize) difficulties and achieve efficiency. (?To begin) the assemblies, last Monday's [9 May] TRABAJADORES editorial will be read. That editorial is about this process.
