One of them is how to bring the parties in the conflict fully to agree to what the foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, and the European Union [EU] proposed in Geneva. Asked what response he received from Milosevic today, Churkin said: "Mr. Milosevic and Belgrade strongly support the decision to bring an end to hostilities. As regards the concept of the Bosnia-Herzegovina union and the territorial division -- this is left to the Bosnian Serbs to pass their judgement. I hope, for two reasons, that their position will be positive -- because the percentage of the territorial division (51:49 per cent) is not negotiable, and this is valid for all sides in the conflict, not only the Serbs, and because this agreement is in the interest of both the Serbs and the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia." As expected, the sanctions were discussed at the talks today. Churkin said that he "explained to President Milosevic the paragraph referring to the sanctions from the final document of the ministerial meeting." "This paragraph opens very good possibilities for the Serbian side. The key members of the international community -- Russia, the United States, and the EU -- said jointly for the first time that the realization of the Geneva agreement would bring about a gradual lifting of the sanctions. I believe this is a strong incentive." Slobodan Milosevic and Vitaliy Churkin also discussed the problem of Brcko. "I received assurances from the Serb side that they are not carrying out offensive operations there," Churkin said. He added: "I also received support for the idea to end hostilities. I concluded after the talks today that the Bosnian Serbs would not oppose the deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] along the demarcation lines in the Brcko region." Asked to comment on the recommendation by the Duma to the Russian Government to lift sanctions against the FRY, Churkin said that he has not had the chance to see the full text of the decision. "Let me remind you that the recommendation was passed following the decision by the U.S. Senate [on lifting the arms embargo]. I hope that our two legislative bodies will not oppose each other, as our governments are not opposing each other. On the contrary, I hope they will work on a joint position." At the end Churkin was asked if he was going to Pale from Belgrade. He gave a brief answer: "No, I am returning to Moscow today."
