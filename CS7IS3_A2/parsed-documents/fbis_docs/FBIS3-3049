The 20-million U.S. dollar contract was signed today in Zhuhai City, one of the country's special economic zones, in Guangdong Province, south China. In 1992, the airlines set up a simulation training center in Zhuhai for Boeing pilots. With one Boeing-737 simulator and one Boeing-757 simulator, the center trained 716 pilots last year. Pilots for Boeing previously had to go abroad for training. The airline has ordered six Boeing-777s, the first of which is due for delivery in December this year.
