This is the only response by Ukraine for the time being to an issue which is of interest to many other capitals, apart from Kiev. However, nobody doubts Ukraine's interest in such a meeting. Describing numerous possible versions, local analysts prefer three most probable: the first suggests that a meeting may take place at the Kiev Airport on January 12 if Clinton makes a stopover en route from Prague to Moscow. According to the second version, the Ukrainian president will visit Moscow on January 14. The third presupposes the two presidents' meeting in Minsk on Sunday, January 16. Kiev very painfully reacts to another inaccuracy circulated by various mass media, including Russian, concerning the number of missiles in Ukraine. Some periodicals wrote about 1,000 nuclear missiles. In actual fact, this is an error made as a result of confusing nuclear warheads with missiles. Ukraine has 176 strategic nuclear missiles. Kiev believes that it is to destroy 130 of them in compliance with the START-1 treaty.
