FBIS3-29292 "dreas033_c_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 North Korea Envoy to Russia Decries Japan's Nuclear Armament SK1702140894 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0805 GMT 17 Feb 94 SK1702140894 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 0805 GMT 17 Feb 94 Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] Son Song-pil, ambassador of our country to Russia, held interviews with reporters of ITAR-TASS, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, and (KOMMERSANTO), on 8 and 10 February in connection with Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers and with commotions on our missile threat loudly talked about by Western countries, including the United States. The ambassador responded to questions about the commotions on our missile threat noisily talked about by the United States and Western countries. He said: The United States and Western countries raved that by developing missiles, we are threatening Japan and South Korea and are exporting missiles to Middle East countries. Their claim is a barefaced lie. This is intended as justification for the United States to continuously keep military bases and troops in Japan and South Korea and to militarily crush our Republic by reinforcing its Armed Forces. This is also designed for the United States to militarily tie down [kunsajoguro olgo maenochanunde] South Korea. As is known to the entire world, our defense forces are, for all intents and purposes, defensive forces of the nation. Public opinion that we will attack Japan and South Korea first is a trick fabricated by the United States. Our country is a peace-loving state. The hardline conservative forces in the United States should not miscalculate our military power. It is a firm resolution of our people and People's Army to defend the nation's independence and dignity. We are fully prepared for any contingency. We will respond to dialogue with dialogue and to war with war. If the United States advances along the road of confrontation with us through strength by reinforcing armed forces in Northeast Asia, we will take corresponding countermeasures [sangunghan taeungchaegul chwihada]. Responding to questions on Japan's nuclear armament, the ambassador said that Japan recently announced that it will ignite a new fast-breeder reactor, which is capable of producing a large quantity of plutonium. He continued: Japan has the potential to produce nuclear weapons at any time. In addition, it has a 800-ton annual nuclear reprocessing capacity. Japan is stockpiling 1.6 tons of plutonium at home and 2.9 tons overseas. Japan plans to possess 50 tons of plutonium by 2010. When this is realized, Japan will be capable of producing more than 6,200 nuclear bombs. Japan has already developed intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Japan's undisguised nuclear armament poses a great threat to peace and security in Northeast Asia, including the Korean peninsula, and to the world. Therefore, the people of the world, not to mention the Asian people, should deal with Japan's nuclear armament with a sense of vigilance, and should thoroughly check such armament. If one fails to check Japan's nuclear armament, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would be meaningless. Therefore, Japan's nuclear armament must be checked, first of all, to achieve the denuclearization of Northeast Asia.
