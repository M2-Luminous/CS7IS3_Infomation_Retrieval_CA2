FR941222-1-00020 FR941222-1-00007 For most fisheries, the 1992&hyph;93 averages, on which the 1995 recommendations are based, are somewhat higher than the actual rate used in 1994. This occurs because the rates used in 1994 were a rollover of the 1993 rates, which had been derived from data for 1990 and 1991. After the December 1994 Council meeting, NMFS will consider all available data and will publish preseason assumed halibut mortality rates in the Federal Register publication announcing the final 1995 initial specifications of groundfish TACs. Interim Groundfish Harvest Specifications Current regulations at ยง672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A) require that one-fourth of the preliminary TAC (not including the reserves and the first quarterly allowance of pollock), one-fourth of the inshore and offshore allocations of Pacific cod in each regulatory area, and one-fourth of the halibut PSC amounts, take effect on January 1 on an interim basis and remain in effect until superseded by the final 1995 initial specifications published in the Federal Register or until harvested. Seasonal apportionments of TACs or PSC limits under provisions of other regulations may supersede these interim specifications. Table 1 shows amounts of proposed specifications of target species and the ``other species'' categories. NMFS is publishing interim initial specifications as a separate document in the final rule section of today's Federal Register . Opening Date of the Directed Fishery for Sablefish for Hook-and-Line Gear Under new regulations implementing the IFQ program (50 CFR part 676) in 1995, the opening date of the sablefish fishery is March 1. Closures to Directed Fishing After consideration of public comments and additional scientific information presented at its December 1994 meeting, the Council may recommend closures to directed fishing. Additionally, NMFS may implement other closures at the time the final 1995 initial specifications of groundfish TACs are implemented, or during the 1995 fishing year as necessary for effective management. Under ยง672.20(b)(1), when NMFS determines, after consultation with the Council, that the TAC for any species or species group will be fully harvested in the DAP fishery, NMFS may specify, for each calendar year, the PSC limit applicable to any JVP or TALFF fisheries for that species or species group. Any PSC limit specified shall be for bycatch only and cannot be retained. Under ยง672.20(c)(6), if the Regional Director determines that a PSC limit applicable to a directed JVP or TALFF fishery has been or will be reached, NMFS will publish a closure in the Federal Register prohibiting all further JVP or TALFF fishing in all or part of the regulatory area concerned. The Council did not propose any PSC limits for fully utilized groundfish species at its September meeting, and it is not expected to make such recommendations at its December meeting. Groundfish PSC limits would only have been relevant if the Council had recommended groundfish apportionments to JVP or TALFF. The Council is not expected to recommend JVP or TALFF apportionments for the 1995 fishing year. Classification This action is authorized under 50 CFR 611.92 and 672.20; and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. A draft environmental assessment (EA) on the allowable harvest levels set forth in the final 1994 SAFE Report will be available for public review at the December 1994 Council meeting. After the December meeting, a final EA will be prepared on the final 1995 TAC amounts recommended by the Council. Consultation pursuant to section 7 of the Endangered Species Act has been initiated for the 1995 GOA initial specifications. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: December 15, 1994.
