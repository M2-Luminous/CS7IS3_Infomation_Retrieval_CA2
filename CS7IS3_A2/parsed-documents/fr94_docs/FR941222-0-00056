FR941222-0-00056 FR941222-0-00006 Whatever steps a utility takes to comply with the CAAA will affect the cost of electric service, e.g., if a utility installs new equipment, its capital costs will change; if a utility purchases low sulfur fuel, its energy costs will change; and if a utility buys emission allowances, its operating expenses will change. In Docket No. RM92&hyph;1&hyph;000, Revisions to Uniform Systems of Accounts to Account for Allowances under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and Regulatory-Created Assets and Liabilities and to Form Nos. 1, 1&hyph;F and 2&hyph;A , Order No. 552, III FERC Statutes and Regulations, Regulations Preambles ¶30,967, 58 FR 17982 (April 7, 1993), the Commission amended its Uniform Systems of Accounts for public utilities, licensees and natural gas companies to establish uniform accounting requirements for allowances for the emission of sulfur dioxide under the CAAA, and to establish generic accounts to record assets and liabilities created through the ratemaking actions of regulatory agencies. While acknowledging the need for the eventual development of a ratemaking framework for allowances, the Commission declined to expand the scope of the accounting rule to address rate issues. 12 12 The Commission stated that the accounting rules were intended to be ``rate neutral,'' i.e., they were not intended to prescribe ratemaking treatment for allowances and would not bar regulatory commissions (including this Commission) from adopting any particular ratemaking treatment. The Commission observed that the bulk of the cost of allowances and compliance will be within the ratemaking jurisdiction of the various States and not this Commission, and found that there was not likely to be a single ratemaking framework appropriate in each and every ratemaking jurisdiction for utilities subject to this Commission's accounting jurisdiction. III FERC Statutes and Regulations, Regulations Preambles ¶30,967 at 30,794&hyph;96. The EEI Petition EEI requests that the Commission now provide guidance on the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances in coordination transactions so that the CAAA emissions allowance program will work as Congress intended. EEI states that such guidance is urgently needed in view of the imminent onset of Phase I. EEI states that the allowance market is rapidly evolving, 13 and EEI expects this market to become even more active when utilities operating the Phase I generating units begin to use emissions allowances. 13 EEI Petition, Appendix A. EEI requests the Commission to: (1) Provide for costing emissions allowances at their incremental cost in coordination rates, determined on the basis of a leading index or combination of indices of the current price of emissions allowances, such index or combination of indices to be selected by the seller of the power; (2) compensate coordination sellers by permitting power purchasers at their option either: (a) To transfer or return emission allowances in kind 14 or (b) compensate the seller for its incremental cost of emission allowances, and (c) declare that purchasers who provide emissions allowances do not need to make filings with the Commission; (3) find that the cost of emissions allowances may be recovered under provisions in coordination rate schedules as ``out-of-pocket'' costs; (4) give utilities up to 45 days after the Commission issues a policy statement to file amendments to rate schedules to allow recovery of emissions allowance costs beginning January 1, 1995, provided that each utility gives its customers notice of the emission allowance recovery methodology it will be using when energy is scheduled (the Commission would reserve the ability, as a condition of making the policy effective January 1, 1995, to order refunds); (5) clarify that the transfer of emission allowances is not subject to a Section 205 filing and determine that sales of emissions allowances are not jurisdictional under Section 203 or 205 of the FPA; 15 and (6) declare that the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances endorsed in this Policy Statement does not preclude other approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. 14 EEI argues that such option will: (a) Allow a power purchaser to optimize its economic position if it can purchase allowances at a price below the seller's declared price; (b) prevent a seller from dictating the allowance price; (c) reward a power purchaser who seeks the lowest cost emissions allowances; and (d) promote an active allowance market that enhances the savings in compliance costs envisioned by the CAAA and also promotes the FPA's purpose to provide for reasonable rates. None of the intervenors and commenters oppose this proposal. 15 In particular, EEI asks the Commission to find that emissions allowances are not ``facilities'' under Section 203, and, therefore, the sale or transfer of such allowances does not require the Commission's authorization. We address EEI's request for a jurisdictional determination in a separate order. EEI notes that use of incremental costs as a basis for emission allowance costing is consistent with the cost basis used for other variable expenses ( e.g., fuel) related to coordination transactions and dispatch decisions. According to EEI, many utilities operate under existing rate schedules that include specific provisions allowing the tracking of incremental costs. 16 EEI requests that utilities with these types of rate schedules not be required to amend their agreements, but only be required to supplement their rate schedules with specific details regarding the recovery of the incremental cost of emissions allowances in their rates. 17 16 For example, Indiana Michigan Power Company has an interconnection agreement with Public Service Company of Indiana, Inc. (Rate Schedule FERC No. 24), which provides for the sale of limited term power with an energy charge of 110% of the out-of-pocket costs of supplying energy, with out-of-pocket cost defined as all operating, maintenance, tax, transmission losses and other expenses incurred that would not have been incurred if the energy had not been supplied. 17 EEI does not explain what procedure would be followed by utilities that have coordination rates on file that do not expressly provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, e.g., a coordination rate schedule that provides for recovery of incremental fuel, but is silent with respect to other types of variable costs; coordination rate schedules that include stated rates; or coordination rate schedules that do not adopt incremental cost pricing. Since there may be different ways of determining the incremental cost of emissions allowances, EEI proposes that utilities be required to submit the following company-specific details. First, EEI suggests that utilities should be required to choose a leading national index or combination of indices to determine the incremental cost of emission allowances at the time of the allowance's consumption and be required to use that index until they identify some other acceptable index in a filing with the Commission. Second, EEI suggests that each utility be required to explain the method of calculating its emission allowance dispatch value. EEI indicates that the use of incremental costing for emissions allowances should be consistent with the use of incremental costing for economic dispatch decisions. EEI proposes that any differences between the incremental costing for coordination sales of emissions allowances and dispatch decisions regarding emissions allowances be explained and reconciled. Third, EEI suggests that utilities be required to explain how they will quantify the amount of emission allowances attributable to each transaction. Fourth, EEI suggests that, with respect to longer-term transactions, utilities be required to specify the timing of opportunities for buyers to stipulate whether they will purchase or provide the emissions allowances. 18 Fifth, EEI suggests that utilities be required to identify any other factors that could impact pricing, such as rates tied to units other than the incremental unit used for the sale. 18 While EEI's argument on this point is unclear, we believe EEI's position is that, for longer-term transactions, buyers of emissions allowances should have the same timing opportunities as allowance sellers. Because sellers do not have to have the required emissions allowances until January 30 of the year subsequent to the calendar year, or the first business day subsequent to January 30 if January 30 is not a business day (hereinafter EPA reporting date), 40 CFR 72.2 and 73.35(a)(2) (1994), they are able to delay purchasing allowances in order to possibly obtain a less expensive allowance price. By providing flexibility as to the time within which buyers can transfer allowances, buyers might be able to save money as well.
