The program carries brief recorded interviews with some opposition figures at unspecified locations. The presenter begins by noting that there will be opposition rallies in Moscow's Theater Square on 17 March. He says that the exact number of militia and internal troops who will be assigned for crowd control is a military secret, "but there will be enough." Dorenko adds, however, that the militia are demoralized by the recent amnesty decision: "They risked their lives during such operations; the criminals then walked free." There follow telephone interviews with former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy and Communist Party chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov, who criticize the rallies as pointless and state that they have no involvement with them. Zyuganov says that the situation could get out of control and play into the hands of provocateurs. Dorenko notes that opposition leaders fear the rally more than the government; he says they are already applying enough pressure on Yeltsin and do not need street fights to put them in power. He goes on: "From contact with all the opposition leaders we gained the impression today that they are all terribly afraid of something." Sergey Baburin, leader of the Russian Popular Alliance, then appears. He says: "I am, of course, put on my guard both by the fact that the defense minister postponed his trip to St. Petersburg and by the fact that the president hastily went off to Sochi. This all indicates that there may be surprises in store, but not from those who are conducting the rally." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), is shown. He says: "Troop movements are thought to be taking place nevertheless and a scenario, as it were, is being worked out: under the pretext of eliminating the consequences of inspired and provoked mass disorder -- for example, a group of armed bandits attacks a group of traders, over 200 fatalities, blood -- under the pretext of putting an end to massive disorder, a state of emergency is declared in the city and, accordingly, there may be restrictions on political freedoms." Mikhail Astafyev, leader of the Cadet Party, says that only the country's present leadership need a crisis on the streets. Members of the opposition want power to come to them by the due process of politics, but the authorities are whipping up tension by practising military manoeuvres. Dorenko resumes: "Today deputies of all the colours in the rainbow, from Russia's Choice to the LDPR, came up to us and talked about a failed attempt yesterday at a coup in Russia with the ousting of the president and his dismissal from power. Deputies link this with the immediate hospitalization of counterintelligence chief Stepashin right after his conversation with the president. Among the heroes of the defense of the president, they name Yakovlev, head of the Ostankino TV company, and General Korzhakov. Whether or not these rumors are true or not, they characterize the atmosphere in some power structures." Dorenko goes on to say: "A considerable section of the opposition feels very strong. It is sure that power is just about to fall into its hands. Yet they fear that power will be seized from them by the power structures and by the economic elite, which will take over the country together with Yeltsin or without him. The opposition is aware that it is weaker than its competitors and is even doing its utmost to defend the president." Zhirinovskiy next says: "It's a purely Russian scenario. The president is supposed to be ill or on vacation. It's Foros-2. A good scenario: he's on vacation, he doesn't know anything. If disorders occur, democracy is curtailed. If everything is okay, he is protected and gets fuller powers. If things are bad, he is protected and punishes those who were unable to do anything. That's it -- maybe that's all it takes. We've had October 91 and October 93. Why not March 94?" Dorenko concluded the program by saying: "All schemes and schedules for the future carving of power are based on the assumption that the president is seriously ill. Incidentally, we know from our sources that, on 6 March this year, President Yeltsin had a thorough medical check-up, including an investigation of his kidneys and cerebral blood circulation. Our sources say that the president feels, at least, no worse than two years ago. We trust our sources. But you, of course, are not obliged to trust them at all until you are given the details by the president's physician."
