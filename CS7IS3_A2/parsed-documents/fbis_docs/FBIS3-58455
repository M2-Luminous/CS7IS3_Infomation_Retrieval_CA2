In a written statement on Greek Cypriot armament efforts, Atun said that some 5 trillion Turkish lira has been allocated to arms purchases in the Greek Cypriot defense budget for 1994. He added that the arms purchases, which have been intensified within the framework of the military doctrine signed with Greece, once again show that Kliridhis' disarmament proposal is not serious. Atun said that it is beneficial to know that trust cannot be built between the two peoples while policies of armament and enmity continue, adding that the countries that are selling arms to the Greek Cypriot community cannot contribute to the peace process. He noted that Greece and other European Union member countries, by arming the Greek Cypriot administration, clearly demonstrate why the role the EU wants to play in the Cyprus problem is unacceptable. Drawing the attention of the UN secretary general and the Security Council members to the armament activities that have intensified following the signing of the Greek-Greek Cypriot military doctrine, Atun called on the United Nations to put an end to adventurist moves that will disrupt the atmosphere of peace reigning on the island and that will create new tensions.
