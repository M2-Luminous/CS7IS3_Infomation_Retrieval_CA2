Braid] [Text] Cape Town April 23 SAPA -- The new Government of National Unity would have five years in which to lay the foundation for a new South Africa, State President F W de Klerk said on Saturday [23 April]. If this foundation was not laid well, the country would pay an expensive price later. Mr de Klerk was addressing a luncheon of the President 100 Club attended by 450 people. "We have a one-off chance to get it right. This is not the time for people to vote for their little prejudices, but to vote on a basis of principles and policies with regard to the major issues which have to be addressed in the next five years." He said a vote for the small parties with a narrow focus would be wasted. "These parties focusing on specific issues cannot be trusted because they over-emphasise only one aspect and ignore the total picture. "These are serious times and many of the smaller parties are making a joke out of an election which will determine the course and direction of the country." Turning to the National Party's two main opponents, Mr de Klerk said if the African National Congress had too much power, it would play into the hands of the "wild ones" in the party. If the ANC was cut down to size by a strong NP [National Party], it would provide a balance of power which South Africa needed. He said he was deeply disappointed that the Democratic Party had found it necessary to demonise the NP as if it was the main threat to the future. "I would have expected the DP to stand up and fight the ANC and say that we should not waste time trying to cut each others' throats, but instead gather support for that which we believe in." Although the NP could not claim all the honour for change, it had been the initiator and had had the guts and courage to change itself from within. "I ask for a mandate to enter the Government of National Unity to represent the moderates with assertiveness because we will have a strong, wide, deep power base," he said.
