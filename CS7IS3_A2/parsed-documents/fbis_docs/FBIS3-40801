Grave problems are attributed to it, such as mounting terrorism and unemployment stemming from the scarcity of financial resources. The growth in population means the shrinking of cultivable land, in addition to mass emigration from the countryside to urban areas, and the accompanying negative factors with many-sided effects. While the problem is not confined to Egypt alone, being an Arab and global problem, it is more serious in Egypt because of the rise in the unemployment rate, the lack of resources, and the drop in individual income. The latest statistics released by the Central Statistics Agency show that the population of Egypt will be 73 million by the year 2000. The January census of last year counted 58,987,000 Egyptians, which was a 676,000 increase over 1992, registering a 1.2 percent increase in six months. The statistics indicate that the rate of increase in recent years has risen to 1,229,000 persons per year, with a new birth every 25 seconds. The rate of population increase has thus reached 2.3 percent. Although this is still high, it is lower than it was twenty years ago, when it stood at more than three percent. Population experts believe that the rate of increase has significant and serious implications for the future of mankind in Egypt. This population explosion translates into a further decline in individual income, thereby having an impact on standards of living, education, health, and many other vital issues. Since taking power, President Mubarak has continued to warn of the dangers of the population explosion, and has urged Egyptians to use birth control. He has said that in 10 years Egypt's population has added the equivalent of the entire Arab Gulf region. He added that in the year 2000 the population will have increased by 12.5 percent. Where were the resources for handling this increase? If the population does increase by that much, investment flight will occur. The Egyptian workforce is 21 percent of the population, or 12 out of 59 million people. It is worth noting that Egypt's population in 1801 was 2.4 million, increasing to 9.8 million by 1897. By 1992, it had reached 59 million, and is expected to jump to 94 million by 2025, making Egypt 17th in the ranking of the 25 most populous countries in the world. Dr. Mahir Mahran, minister of state for population and family affairs, has rather different estimates, as he believes it is necessary to differentiate in the statistics between the population residing in Egypt--56 million--and those residing abroad, now nearly three million. He indicates that the number of births, despite the large increase, is considered to be in constant decline. The number of births last year was down 100,000 from 1988, so that it is expected that by 2000 the population figure will stand at 66 million. The statistics touched on the increase in Cairo's population density rate, which the census showed to be 15 million people, at 23,688 people per square kilometer. Cairo thus occupies third place in growth of density, after Calcutta and Manila. It is not expected that the population of Egypt will stabilize until it reaches a hypothetical volume estimated at nearly 120 million. This number is more than double the present population, which is an indicator of the growth problems, the spread of poverty, and environmental and social deterioration. Drop in Deaths A study prepared by the Egyptian Consultative Council says that the death rate in Egypt began to decrease at the end of the 1940s. The total death rate was about 30 per thousand residents after the end of World War II, then dropped to 15 per thousand in the 1970s and 11 per thousand in the 1980s, and should reach six per thousand by 2025. At the same time, the marriage rate has dropped. Reports indicate a drop in the marriage rate from 11 marriages per thousand residents in 1960 to about nine per thousand in 1987, with an increase in the rate of unmarried women who are at least 16 years old to above 20 percent, versus 12 percent in 1960. Egypt ranks twenty-first among countries of the world in population growth, according to United Nations estimates, with a rate of population growth of nearly 2.4 percent between 1985 and 1990; it was 2.8 percent between 1976 and 1986. The average number of children born to one woman was 4.4 in 1992; it was six children in 1965. Despite the fact that these numbers are viewed as remarkably positive when compared with what came before, they are still high rates that warn of danger. Perhaps the comparison here is significant. In the United States, the average number of childen born to one woman is two; in 1980 it was 1.8. Possible Dangers Egypt has had significant experience in birth control, one which has drawn many and varied criticisms since it began in the 1960s. It has encountered warfare, as well, from various quarters, and clashed with the customs and traditions of the majority of Egyptians, who view the process of birth control as forbidden. The agencies entrusted with birth control campaigns have endured much in their efforts to change this idea. Despite all the criticisms and obstacles, it may be said that positive results have begun to appear, as seen in a drop in the recent rates of population growth. The question of population growth, however, remains a grave one for Egypt and its development plans. The government relies primarily on awareness campaigns in all available agencies and media: television, radio, and posters which portray the benefits that may be reaped by families that use birth control, especially palpable economic benefits in the family's life, and positive health and beauty results for women who use birth control. Many methods for handling the problem have been suggested, and are still being proposed. The recommendations of a group of housing experts in Egypt will not be the last. Most notable among these was a recent study by the Consultative Council. One of the most important of these recommendations was was emphasis on improving conditions for women and supporting their participation in a variety of activities. Society strove for an increased rate of women's participation, from about 11 percent in 1987, to about 20 percent by the beginning of the next century, by preparing the proper environmental conditions so that women may play their role. Legislation that could limit women's positive initiatives should be amended; men should be prepared mentally and psychologically to accept women's role in society, with an end, in particular, to the exploitation of children and women; provisions of the labor code that limit the working age to be no less than 12 should be enforced; and a strict minimum should be imposed on the current marriage age. In the health field, the study proposed action to decrease the death rate among nursing children by 50 percent from its current level, in line with the official estimates, which were about 45 per thousand births in 1987, along with the need for society to construct an ambitious family planning program, in the context of comprehensive development. This program will aim at reaching the figure of two children per family within 20 years. The study dealt in particular detail with population distribution. It called for the establishment of new developed societies capable of absorbing about 15 percent of the population to about 10.5 million people by 2001. The study emphasized the need to review the "New Urban Communities" policy, with the aim of investing 100 percent in them instead of 10 percent, especially in Egypt's present conditions, and providing the suitable elements of attraction to draw people to the new societies, while also studying the failure of established regions to absorb the population projected for them. It emphasized a link between population policy and economic and social policy as a means of promoting population policy in the development plan, and the need for the government to allocate budget funds for the population planning program. There are many dangers facing Egypt should growth rates continue to rise this steeply. They are a growing strain on its resources, and, hence, a negative factor in the qualities and capabilities of its people. It also diminishes the standard of nutrition and health, education, and housing services in the necessities of life. Perhaps the problem in Egypt is even more threatening, for although there are nearly 37 projects to halt the population explosion, it is still a problem without a solution! There may have been a sign of hope, though, when Egypt was chosen as the site for the next World Population Conference this year.
