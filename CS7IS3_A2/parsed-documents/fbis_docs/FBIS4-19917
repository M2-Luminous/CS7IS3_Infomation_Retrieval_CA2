[Woerner] There is certainly a certain risk considering what we have seen from the Serbs so far. On the other hand, we will apply much more massive means, and we have left no doubt that we would not tolerate retaliatory acts without taking appropriate steps ourselves, for example close air support, to which we could resort at any time in such a situation. [Correspondent] Why does the threat only include bombings within a range of 20 km? [Woerner] There are a number of reasons, primarily military ones. But there are also monitoring reasons. We have to be sure that we can check on what is going on there. [Correspondent] Is the alliance now not facing the danger of an uncontrollable escalation of the conflict? [Woerner] I would not absolutely rule out such danger, even though I do not regard it as probable. In Sarajevo we had a different experience. Then, you must not forget one thing: Look at the pictures that can be seen on your television or any other television; the bombing of hospitals, even refugee camps have been shelled, and civilians are killed in the most cruel way. Should we stand idly by? [Correspondent] NATO has now shown its determination in the case of Gorazde. What about the remaining safe areas? [Woerner] We will discuss this later. [Correspondent] Where are the problems? [Woerner] There are many problems because each case is different. Each of these so-called safe areas has different problems, a different environment, different countryside, different weather conditions, different terrain, different troop strengths of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] forces, etc. There is no patent solution, which is why we have to discuss each case individually before adopting a decision. Yet, I think that a decision will come. [Correspondent] Still today? [Woerner] It is certainly going to be a long session, and we might not arrive at a decision before tomorrow morning.
