However, the reporters who attended the presentation were much more interested in asking the two ministers about the French intervention in the civil war in Rwanda and a possible German commitment there. Did the two minister provide comprehensive answers to these questions? [Heuer] Well, Francois Leotard did not answer at all. Volker Ruehe was apparently very reluctant to reply to questions about Rwanda. He was very reserved, referring to the fact that one must await the ruling by the Constitutional Court on the participation of German soldiers abroad and saying that he had merely asked his French counterpart, Francois Leotard, to brief him on the situation in Rwanda. [Begin Ruehe recording] The Constitutional Court ruling, due on 12 July, is to be given absolute priority. By the way, we have made it very clear -- also by providing material support -- that we are ready to provide humanitarian aid if certain preconditions exist. [end recording] [Heuer] Ruehe's statement confirmed the well-known position of the Federal Government. Bonn is only prepared to permit German soldiers to participate in humanitarian missions in Rwanda under UN sponsorship if the security situation is checked by the United Nations in Kigali and found to be such that the involvement of German Bundeswehr soldiers in hostilities can be ruled out. The second topic was the participation of German soldiers in the parade on the Champs Elysee in Paris on 12 July. Both ministers commented on this issue. Volker Ruehe explicitly conveyed thanks for the French invitation to the Germans. Francois Leotard stressed that the German soldiers are to take part within the framework of the Eurocorps. Asked about criticism of the German participation in the parade, expressed by members of the French Resistance, the French defense minister said it should not be overvalued. [Begin Leotard recording, in French with superimposed German translation] It is true that protests were expressed initially. However, they mainly came from political parties -- from the Communist Party. Some of the protests also result from internal French quarrels. The attitude of the majority of the French population is absolutely positive. Personally I believe that, generally, the French are glad that this Eurocorp, which includes German soldiers, has an opportunity to present itself on the Champs Elysee. [end recording] [Heuer] Thus, against this backdrop, Leotard naturally ruled out active protest by the French side on 14 July.
