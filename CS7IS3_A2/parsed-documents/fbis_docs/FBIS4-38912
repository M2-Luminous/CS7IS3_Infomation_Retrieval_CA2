Einseln asked President Lennart Meri on May 31 to accept the resignation he had put in May 4. The army chief found Laar's information about Estonian-Israeli cooperation "unethical, if not a downright lie." Laar met on Feb. 8 with an Israeli working group led by General Dan Shomron to discuss questions of Estonia's security and defense concept and opportunities for Estonian-Israeli cooperation in defense. "The leader of defense forces, who under the Constitution is competent with regard to national defense issues, was not informed about the meeting, its results and agreements concluded. Under the circumstances when the defense forces' chief lacks information about the premier's agreements with the Israeli TAAS company concerning national defense, the commander finds it difficult to answer for the country's defense capability and security," the information department of the Defense Forces general staff told BNS. Einseln drew the conclusion that the prime minister doesn't trust him and "has on purpose been acting without consulting with him." Under the circumstances, Einseln considered his resignation "inevitable." Former Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, too, has claimed that Laar's information about the Estonian-Israeli defense cooperation project is somewhat distorted. Kannik claimed Laar maintained in a May 17 letter to Einseln that the "government has neither in my nor anyone else's person signed a cooperation project with General Shomron." Kannik told BNS the record of Laar's Feb. 8 meeting with Shomron states that the "visitors and Mr. Laar agreed that the cooperation between Estonia and Israel may be divided into three main categories." The former defense minister maintained one of the agreed categories concerns the establishment of a joint working group at the Estonian Interior Ministry to analyze both the military and security aspects of the Estonian defense concept. The government press service told BNS that neither the Estonian Government nor ministries have signed any pacts or agreements without informing the Defense Forces general staff about it. "During the visit of General Shomron to Estonia on Feb. 8-9 the Israeli party proposed to form a joint working group to promote the mapping out of Estonia's defense concept. The Estonian side found that Estonia must have priority in this issue, but expert opinions are welcome. Consultations with private companies in security issues are widespread the world over, especially in the United States," the government press release reads. The meeting between the Estonian premier and the Israeli general found that Estonia needs more assistance with questions falling within the competence of the Interior Ministry, primarily those concerning improvement of the work of the police and the border guard, therefore "further solution of this issue" was referred to the Interior Ministry, the press service said. "Neither the premier nor the government have addressed this question. The Israeli side informed about its views on possible cooperation the Interior and the Defense Ministries. The prime minister's office has not received information about this," the government press service told BNS. The press service confirms that the protocol of Laar's meeting with Shomron provides for the formation of an Estonian-Israeli working group at the Interior Ministry to analyze the Estonian defense concept. Both Interior and Defense Ministry officials are expected to belong to the group. "The parties agreed that the group will start work as soon as possible and prepare a preliminary report by end June 1994," the press service informs.
