FR940617-0-00149 FR940617-0-00026 The cost effectiveness of controlling NO X emissions from on-highway mobile sources has also been estimated. The 1998 heavy-duty highway engine NO X standard is estimated to cost between $210 and $260 per ton of NO X reduced, and the recently promulgated on-board diagnostics regulation is estimated to cost $1974 per ton of NO X reduced from malfunctioning in-use light-duty vehicles. In summary, the revised cost effectiveness of the NO X standard included in this rule remains favorable relative to the cost effectiveness of several other NO X control measures required under the Clean Air Act. To the extent that cost effective nationwide controls are applied to large nonroad CI engines, the need to apply in the future more expensive additional controls to mobile and stationary sources that also contribute to acid deposition, as well as ozone nonattainment, nutrient loading, visibility, and PM nonattainment may be reduced. X. Administrative Requirements A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it may adversely affect in a material way that sector of the economy involved with the production of nonroad large CI engines and nonroad vehicles and equipment using those engines, previously unregulated by EPA. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements pertaining to certification and ABT in this rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act , 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1684.01) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA/OPPE/ORME, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 (Mail Code 2136) or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the Federal Register . This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 5,800 hours annually for a typical engine manufacturer. However, the hours spent annually on information collection activities by a given manufacturer depends upon manufacturer-specific variables, such as the number of engine families, production changes, emissions defects, and so forth. This estimate includes time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA/OPPE/ORME; 401 M Street SW., (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: EPA Desk Officer.'' All other information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . and have been assigned the following control numbers: ‚ê£ 1EPA ICR No. 1Type of information 1OMB control No. ICR No. 11 Selective Enforcement Auditing 2060&hyph;0064 ICR No. 282 Emission Defect Reporting 2060&hyph;0048 ICR No. 10 Importation of Nonconforming Vehicles 2060&hyph;0095 ICR No. 12 Exclusions 2060&hyph;0124 ICR No. 95 Exemptions 2060&hyph;0007 C. Impact on Small Entities The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA). EPA has determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation will affect manufacturers of large nonroad CI engines, a group that does not contain a substantial number of small entities. Manufacturers will be able to take advantage of the flexibility afforded by the averaging, banking, and trading program. Therefore, as required under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. , I certify that this regulation does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
