They said heads of state and government had endorsed the idea of a 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc, a largely West African currency pegged to the French franc. But in return they called for stronger compensatory measures than were being proposed by either the International Monetary Fund or France, as one western source said many of the countries were unprepared for such a devaluation. After meeting for six hours behind closed doors, sources said the discussions broke off at 10:30 P.M. (2230 GMT) and would resume early Tuesday. The devaluation rate will be the same for all of the 14 countries in the Franc Zone, with specific financial measures applied to each country to offset the consequences, the sources said. Among the main measures called for are loans to help cushion the effect on imports, especially basic goods, which are expected to flood the market after devaluation. In addition delegates here urged the suppression or reduction in each of the 14 countries' debts, in particular with France, their main donor country. In addition, they are reported to have called for an unspecified amount of financial aid for businesses to offset higher salaries that will become necessary by a fall in individual buying power. As the meeting broke up late Monday, there were no details of any specific figures, but aid to businesses would also help reduce debts and refill each country's coffers. But one donor told AFP many of the 14 nations were unprepared for the effects of such a devaluation. "The spectre of devaluation, which has lain dormant since last August, has arrived without African leaders really believing it would happen and before they were able to take the necessary measures to accompany it," he said. And other Western sources said only the Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire], which had already declared itself in favour of a devaluation, had come to the meeting well-prepared, armed with facts and figures. The other countries were forced to outbid their neighbors in a scramble for increased financial compensation. The current parity between the French franc and the CFA unit has not been changed since 1948. One French franc is worth 50 CFA francs, or currently about 294 CFA francs to the US dollar. Monday's agreement in principle has come after pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has insisted on a devaluation in return for help with structural adjustment programmes. The move would increase the price of imports, on which CFA franc countries are largely dependent, and open the way for more exports. Of 14 Franc Zone members, the only one likely to reap immediate benefit from devaluation is major coffee and cocoa exporter Ivory Coast, experts said. While devaluation would favour exports, regional leaders have argued that African goods face weak demand on international markets, thereby nullifying any likely gain from the initiative. Attending the summit are heads of state or government from Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Togo and the Comoros. They were joined Monday after three hours of talks, by IMF Director General Michel Camdessus and French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, as well as the finance ministers from the 14 participating countries.
