We failed to achieve success there. We were firmly shown where our place lies and what we can expect from our contacts with the powers. And the most we can expect is sympathy. Strategic decisions about the demarcation of influence are going to be made without our direct participation. That is how things used to be, and that is how they remain. This initial cold shower will be useful for the Pawlak government. It will enable the government to dispense with the "messianic" delusions of previous governments and might even help it establish a realistic program of cooperation with the West for the next four years, a program based on the strength of our exports and on military economic diplomacy, and capable of defending our industry and our commercial rights. Such a program has been called for by the coalition. Prime Minister Pawlak seems to understand this. Instead of being seized with a fit of despair about the Prague summit and shedding tears over the flimsy condition of the Visegrad Group, he is seeking new paths of cooperation. On the other hand, President Walesa clearly cannot come to terms with reality and is not hiding his profound disappointment with the West. But let us hope he recovers quickly and draws practical conclusions from this successive harsh lesson.
