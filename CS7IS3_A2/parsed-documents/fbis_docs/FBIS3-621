The Abana primary school, officially inaugurated last June, was built by the Akpabuyo local government in Nigeria's south-eastern Cross River state. It has now been abandoned by teachers and pupils due to the incessant harassment of the inhabitants of the village by the Cameroonian gendarmes, a NAN correspondent currently in the territory reported. Teachers posted to the five-classroom school fled the establishment after experiencing a series of attacks by the Cameroonian paramilitary police late last year, villagers told the agency. The teachers refused to come back after they were "brutally beaten" by the gendarmes during one of the raids last year, it concluded. Trouble flared anew in the Bakassi peninsula, a territory rich in oil and fish which is administered by Cameroon and peopled largely by Nigerian fishing communities, in December, when villagers accused Cameroonian security forces of assaulting them.
