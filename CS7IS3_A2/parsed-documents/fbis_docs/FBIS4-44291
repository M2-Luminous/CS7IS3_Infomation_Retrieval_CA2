The six deputies fled Turkey June 15, one day before the Constitutional Court banned the party on the grounds that it supposedly spread separatist propaganda and sided with the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization. Attending a pro-PKK rally in Frankfurt over the weekend, Zubeyir Aydar, one of the deputies, said about the recent PKK bombings in tourist places which wounded about 20 people and killed a British tourist that, "we regret the bombings but we (PKK supporters) had to do it." The deputies will reportedly meet the leaders of commissions and political groups here and are trying to schedule a press conference at the Council of Europe on Wednesday [29 June].
