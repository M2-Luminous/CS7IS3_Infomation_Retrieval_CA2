According to official statistics, 250,000 people have moved into Turkey over this period. The exodus has been particularly severe in Southern Bulgaria and in the town of Kircali 50 percent of the population have left for Turkey. The immigrants mostly enter Turkey on tourist visas although some cross the border illegally. The Bulgaria Rights and Freedoms movement representative in Kircali, Talat Coban, said that if the present trend continues the Turkish presence in Bulgaria would soon disappear. Mustafa Omer, mayor of the town of Kosukavak, stated on Tuesday that 50 Turkish villages in the region were now almost empty and added, "There are only a few old people remaining and even they are only waiting for a signal from their relatives in Turkey to leave the villages."
