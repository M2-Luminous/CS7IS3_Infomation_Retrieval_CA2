On commenting his earlier visit to Israel, Meri recalled as most remarkable language-teaching to immigrants. It was interesting to see how in only six months a person virtually melts into the society, Meri said. Meri also said that after meetings with the president, prime minister, foreign minister and representatives of the Israeli parliament, he knows that Israel understands the tasks that lie ahead of Estonia. On commenting on Ukraine, Meri said he thought the west often made a mistake in talking of the Baltic countries and former regions of the defunct Soviet Union. Ukraine is one of the biggest European countries, Meri said. We could see ourselves that gigantic economic reforms lie ahead of Ukraine and that the country intends to build a strong independent state which would be open to all countries of the world, he added.
