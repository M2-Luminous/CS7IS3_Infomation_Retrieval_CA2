Kurds Will Not Guarantee Safety of Pipeline Construction Workers"] [Excerpts] Dzhamal Kadyr [name as transliterated], the Kurdistan National Liberation Front's [ERNK] representative in the CIS, has issued a statement to the Kurdistan Committee in connection with the plans to build a new oil pipeline from Baku to a Turkish port. [passage omitted] The Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) has repeatedly stated that it will not allow any pipeline to cross the territory of Kurdistan without the consent of its people. Nor can the PKK guarantee the safety of persons employed in building the pipeline. These people will be arrested by the guerrillas of the Kurdistan Peoples' Liberation Army, D. Kadyr stated. The committee recalled that during the last month alone Kurdistan Peoples' Liberation Army guerrillas have on seven occasions blown up the oil pipeline that crosses the territory of Kurdistan from Kirkuk in Iraq to the Turkish port of Iskenderun. "We will not allow pipelines to be laid across our territory without our being asked and without the Kurds being taken into account at all," D. Kadyr later stated at a Moscow news conference. "And we do not want our natural resources to be exported from Kurdistan without the consent of the Kurds."
