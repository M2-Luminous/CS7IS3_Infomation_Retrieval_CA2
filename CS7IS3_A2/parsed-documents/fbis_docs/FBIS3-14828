"One should only welcome special attention of the president given to the issue in his message to the Federal Assembly. But I would not hurry to rejoice as there may be forces to urge the president on unjustified decisions," he said. In the words of Poltoranin, he "repulsed the attacks of forces wishing to divide the material-technical basis of mass media and break the single information space for the past two years." His parliamentary committee receives inquiries of deputies who are alarmed with the attempts to divide the influence spheres in mass media bodies. "The president said that TV and radio channels are not liable for privatization and shall be state, but one cannot say for sure whether they will remain state in future," added Poltoranin. In his words, the parliamentary committee aims to create conditions for economic independence of mass media, which "is the only guarantee of observation of constitutional rights in Russia at a time of anarchy." "If mass media fails to get the economic basis for its independence it will be suppressed and this process has begun. The president shall say the word in order not to allow this to happen," said the committee chairman.
