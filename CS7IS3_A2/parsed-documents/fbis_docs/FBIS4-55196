I am waiting for an answer." After yesterday's meeting of the government, we asked the prime minister in this context: [SME] When did you ask for the screening of government members and why had they not been screened during the formation of the coalition cabinet? [Moravcik] It takes some time. You know how much time we had to form the government. The screening certificates could not be obtained prior to the government's formation because, under the law, the certificate must be delivered to the screened person first and only when the screened person deems it suitable can it submit the certificate to whoever requested the screening. In other words, it was not technically possible to do this earlier. I expect that we will have all the screening certificates at hand in a few weeks. [SME] Are the rumors that one member of your cabinet has problems with the screening certificate true? [Moravcik] I do not know whether they are true. That is just what the screening should show. [SME] Should any member of your cabinet receive a positive screening certificate, how will you deal with the situation? [Moravcik] We will proceed in accordance with the law. [SME] When exactly did you ask for the ministers' screening certificates? [Moravcik] Some two or three weeks after the government's appointment. [SME] How are we supposed to understand your words that the results of screenings will be available in only a few weeks? When Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, asked the Slovak Information Service [SIS] for a screening certificate, he received it on the second or third day after submitting the application, as he told SME in an interview. Why should it take a few weeks? [Moravcik] I do not know how the process is progressing technically in the SIS. But I know that they have problems with the files. [SME] How quickly do you intend to amend the screening law? [Moravcik] It has not yet been decided whether the government will propose an amendment to the screening law. [SME] Do you not think that the questioning of this law undermines your declared endeavor to respect and comply with the screening law? [Moravcik] We are proceeding in accordance with the law.
