In Pernambuco, they caused a traffic jam and occupied the INCRA [National Land Reform and Settlement Institute] headquarters in Recife. The invaders want the government to accelerate the expropriation of farms in the interior of the state. The INCRA regional superintendent blamed the delay on bureaucracy. In Fortaleza, Ceara State, 400 invaders have been occupying the Legislative Assembly since last night. Police are preventing other demonstrators from entering the building. The demonstrators demand the payment of emergency front salaries which are due. They have not received their salaries for 45 days. The payment must be made by the federal government. After meeting Governor Ciro Gomes, the invaders decided to leave the Legislative Assembly late in the afternoon. The governor promised to do his best to ensure payment of the overdue salaries and to convince the government to increase the emergency front salaries. In Maceio, Alagoas State, the invaders have been in the Finance Ministry offices since 9 May. It was decided in a meeting that on 16 May they will receive seeds and basic foodstuff baskets, but the invaders decided to remain in the offices until the seeds and food are delivered. On the third day of demonstrations in Porto Alegre, the landless farmers marched along downtown streets and caused huge traffic jams. They walked up to the government palace and tried to meet with Governor Alceu Collares. They want land for settlements, credits for small farmers, and a meeting with the finance minister. The striking invaders even barred the finance minister's entrance to the Finance Ministry. Here is Alexandre Garcia's report: [Begin Garcia recording] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero has been the victim of two incidents that could have had serious consequences if it had not been for his common sense. The first incident occurred during a class he was teaching at Brasilia University, where he has been teaching for the last 24 years. Strikers invaded the classroom carrying a coffin and CUT [Sole Workers Center] flags. The professor suspended the class and walked toward his car in the parking lot. He was followed by the strikers, who were threatening the professor and minister. The second incident occurred after lunch yesterday, when he was returning to the Finance Ministry and found the entrance door blocked by members of the Landless Farmers Movement who were carrying CUT flags. He turned around and went to his Planalto Palace office. The finance minister reported on these incidents a few minutes ago. He said the incidents seemed to have been coordinated so as to be conducted throughout the country as a political strike against the economic plan. He pointed out that even the CUT national treasurer had admitted that. As an example, he mentioned that the offices of the Finance Ministry in four capitals have been simultaneously invaded. He added that these methods are not democratic. [end recording] We will now report on reactions to the strikes and the invasion of public buildings nationwide: [Begin recording] [Deputy Miro Teixeira; Democratic Labor Party, Rio de Janeiro] I do not believe, for example, that to maintain a minister inside his ministry's facilities, as if he were in a private prison, can benefit strikers. These incidents, however, may have been carried out by an agitator infiltrated into the movement. [Deputy Artur da Tavola; Brazilian Social Democracy Party leader] The PT [Workers Party] radical sector wants to unite the people around the excuse of the salary demand. The most reasonable PT sectors are hurriedly trying to extinguish this fire, but it has already given birth to the dragon that is now giving orders. [Deputy Chico Vigilante; PT deputy leader] These strikes have no political objective whatsoever. These strikes have economic reasons: The workers are demanding regaining their salaries' purchasing power. [Senator Marco Maciel; Liberal Front Party leader] As the strikes seek to destabilize the economic plan, they will result not only in political and electoral harm, but will also harm the country itself. [Jair Meneghelli; CUT president] These strikes logically help, as they enable workers to obtain compensation for losses resulting from the Fernando Henrique Cardoso plan. [Enilson Simoes de Moura; Union Force secretary] The recent strikes have clearly caused large electoral losses. There is a clear movement aimed at giving social consistency to Lula and PT criticism of the economic plan currently in force in the country. [end recording]
