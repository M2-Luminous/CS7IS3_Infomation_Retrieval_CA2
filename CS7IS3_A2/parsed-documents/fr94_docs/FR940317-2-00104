FR940317-2-00104 FR940317-2-00068 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 94&hyph;3; Notice 2] Ford Motor Company; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance Ford Motor Company (Ford) of Dearborn, MI, determined that some of its replacement windshields failed to comply with the labeling requirements of 49 CFR 571.205, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 205, ``Glazing Materials,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Ford also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. Notice of receipt of the petition was published on January 13, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 1989). Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z&hyph;26.1&hyph;1977, January 26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that, with certain exceptions, glazing materials for use in motor vehicles shall conform with Paragraphs S5, ``Requirements,'' S6, ``Certification and Marking,'' and ANS Z26.1.6, ``Marking of Safety Glazing Materials.'' Specifically, section 6 of ANSI Z26.1 states ``[G]lazing materials, which in a single sheet of material are intentionally made with an area having a luminous transmittance of not less than 70 percent (Test No. 2), adjoining an area that has less than 70 percent luminous transmittance, shall be permanently marked at the edge of the sheet to show the limits of the area that is intended to comply with Test No. 2. The markings shall be A e S1 or A a S2 etc. *␣*␣*'' Approximately 98,000 W1099V windshields manufactured from June 1992 through October 1993 and 14,800 W911V windshields manufactured from August 1992 to June 1993 are missing the A e S1 marking at the bottom edge of the shade band. The subject windshields are manufactured as replacements for windshields in 1980 through 1994 model year Ford F-Series and Bronco vehicles. Ford supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following: The affected windshields were produced by a Ford supplier without A e S1 markings at the bottom edge of the shade band, but meet all other marking and performance requirements of Standard No. 205 and ANSI Z26.1 including the appropriate AS1 marking in the area of the trademark identifying the type of construction of the glazing material. [Ford believes that t]he omission of the marking presents no risk of accident or injury. Consequently in Ford's judgment, the omission is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The stated purposes of [Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard] FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through the vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted, the affected windshields fully comply with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205 and although missing the A e S1 marking at the bottom of the shade band, they do have the correct AS1 marking to indicate the type of construction of the glazing material. Because all performance requirements are met, the omission of the marking at the shade band has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended by the standard. Ford is not aware of any complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition. No comments were received on the petition. The noncompliance reported does not affect the performance characteristics of the glazing, and, hence, the noncompliance has no direct effect upon motor vehicle safety. Although the markings have been omitted in one area of the windshield, the correct designation, AS1, appears in the area of the trademark identifying the type of construction of the glazing material. Thus, the omission at the shade band will not prevent correct identification of the glazing by personnel conducting periodic motor vehicle inspections, or when it is necessary to replace the windshield. There is no need in either instance for knowledge of where the area of 70 percent or greater light transmittance begins. In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby found that petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted.
