"We are neighbors and must live together in peace instead of threatening each other with our fists all the time," Major-General Aleksander Einseln said to Interfax before his departure for Moscow on Wednesday. At the same time, Russian military bases and any other form of Russian military presence in Estonia are "out of the question," he said. Einseln said one of the main purposes of his trip to Moscow, where he had been invited by the Russian Defense Ministry, was to ensure concrete cooperation at the final stage of Russian troop withdrawal from Estonia. Russia earlier offered to pull out all its troops by August 31 but linked this to the provision of residence permits and social security measures for retired Russian military officers living in Estonia. Einseln plans to propose setting up a bilateral military commission to quickly and efficiently deal with any troop withdrawal problems. He said he was on "civil" terms with the command of the Russian forces remaining in Estonia.
