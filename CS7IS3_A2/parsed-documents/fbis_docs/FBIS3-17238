"It can be understood from the proposal of Ilyumzhinov that the talk is about a change in the status of the Republic of Kalmykia", the spokesman said in a statement on Monday, explaining that such a change was possible under the constitution only upon mutual consent of the subject of the federation and the federation itself. "If (Ilyumzhinov) proposes to preserve the republican status, then, according to the Russian Constitution, Kalmykia should have its own constitution", the spokesman said. "The Kalmyk president's aspiration to preserve Russia's territorial integrity may be only applauded. However, any political action, however noble its motivation could be, should be brought in line with the principles and norms of the Russian Constitution. Any other approach is fraught with substitution of the idea of expediency for the idea of law. Such an approach will have nothing in common with the challenge of building a law-governed state", the spokesman emphasised.
