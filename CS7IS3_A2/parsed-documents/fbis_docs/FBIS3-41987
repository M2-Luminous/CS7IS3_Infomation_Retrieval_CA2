It seems the Foreign Ministry is concerned about a breakup of the cooperative system with the United States, which may take place during the final stage of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations. The Government's Position The government opposes the U.S. proposal to turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into an international treaty. That is, the government contends that because the joint declaration of denuclearization signed in 1992 is not a treaty between countries but an agreement signed within the nation, the government does not need to turn it into an international treaty. The government believes the issue of North Korea constantly keeping nuclear reprocessing facilities, even after adopting the joint declaration of denuclearization, should be resolved through North-South dialogue. In other words, the government believes that the government should persuade North Korea to destroy the nuclear reprocessing facilities through the Joint Nuclear Control Committee and, then, abide by the joint declaration of denuclearization. A government official explained that ``the U.S. proposal to turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into an international treaty is a result of considering North Korea's demand for a guarantee that a nuclear preemptive strike on the DPRK will not take place.'' That is, there is a possibility that because North Korea indeed regards as serious a nuclear threat from the United States and others, it may stick to nuclear development. Thus, in order to ease North Korea's threat, it is necessary for the nuclear-possessing countries to promise not to conduct a nuclear attack on North Korea. Government officials have analyzed that the United States is intending to supplement the weak points of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) by turning the joint declaration of denuclearization into an international treaty. The current NPT regulations stipulate that NPT member countries can have nuclear reprocessing facilities and inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are only required of the plutonium produced from the nuclear reprocessing process. Accordingly, if the joint declaration of denuclearization is turned into an international treaty, North and South Korea cannot have nuclear reprocessing facilities so suspicions of nuclear development on the Korean peninsula will be fully abolished. There was a (Tulatert) protocol signed by South American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, in 1967 in which the nuclear-possessing countries acknowledged the contents that had been agreed upon by the relevant countries. At that time, when the South American countries resolved not to develop and possess nuclear weapons, they called on the nuclear- possessing countries, including the United States, to acknowledge the guarantee of refraining from a nuclear attack on them. Thus, the nuclear-possessing countries turned the agreement into an international treaty through a protocol. It can be said that the United States has tried to apply this precedent to the Korean peninsula. [passage omitted]
