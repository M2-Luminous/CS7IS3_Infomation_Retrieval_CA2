On May 9, the U.S. State Department had issued an annual report on terrorism in which it called the DPRK a "terrorist nation," according to reports. The DPRK spokesman said that by accusing his country of being a terrorist nation, the United States was hoping to conceal its own terrorist activities. He said that the United States is taking advantage of the terrorist issue and current disagreement over the nuclear issue, to malign the DPRK. The spokesman said that his country opposes any terrorist activity, and does not engage in support to any terrorist activity. He demanded that the United States improve its own behavior and try to get rid of its own dub-name of "head of terror."
