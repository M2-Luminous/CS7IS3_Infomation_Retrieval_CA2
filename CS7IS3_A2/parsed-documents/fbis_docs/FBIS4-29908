FBIS4-29908 "dreas120_c_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 20 Jun 1994 North Korea Buddhist Federation Condemns Chongnyon Suppression Buddhist Federation Condemns Chongnyon Suppression SK2006050594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0456 GMT 20 Jun 94 SK2006050594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Korean Buddhist Federation issued a statement Sunday denouncing the Japanese authorities' suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan. Noting that the Japanese police on June 6 raided the office of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and searched 27 spots including houses of officials of the headquarters under the pretext of "violation of the national land utilization law," the statement bitterly denounced it in the name of the entire Buddhists of the DPRK as a vicious political suppression of Chongnyon and an open hostile act against the DPRK. The statement said: The Koreans in Japan are those who were drafted to Japan by the Japanese imperialists and forced to backbreaking toils in the past and their descendants. So they must enjoy special protection by the Japanese authorities. Far from apologizing to and compensating the Korean people for their past crimes, the Japanese authorities are suppressing them. This is a rash act that can be done only by villains bereft of reason. We strongly demand the Japanese authorities immediately stop the suppression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for that and sternly punish the criminals. We hope all the Buddhists of Japan will denounce the Japanese authorities' suppression of Chongnyon and express firm solidarity with Chongnyon in its righteous activities.
