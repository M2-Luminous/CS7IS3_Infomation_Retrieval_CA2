It is a question of Taiwan's nuclear waste being stored on Russian territory for cash. Chan Chunchen [name as transliterated], director of the Taiwan Power state corporation, on his return to Taipei after a 12-day tour of Russia, Sweden, and Norway, told reporters that fruitful talks had begun regarding the handling of Taiwan's nuclear waste in Russia. According to Chan, his partners in the talks were representatives of a certain research center who have 10 nuclear dumps on Russian territory under their jurisdiction. It is at these "capacities" that it is intended to process and store Taiwan's highly toxic waste products, provided of course that the financial side of the project is agreed to their mutual satisfaction. The problem of nuclear waste from its nuclear power stations is an extremely pressing one for Taiwan. It is not only a question of vigorous protests from the population (during a recent antinuclear demonstration in Taipei, for instance, over 10,000 people came out onto the streets) but of the fact that the dumps are almost full to bursting. The largest "waste facility" on the island of orchids, for instance, will have to be closed next year, but Taiwan's three nuclear stations punctually produce 130 tonnes of radioactive waste every year and that has to be put somewhere. Taipei has examined several options for resolving this problem or, to be more precise, several locations to which toxic waste could be sent -- in particular there was a plan to organize storage in "greater" China and in Sweden. However Beijing did not respond to Formosa's alluring proposition. The Swedes resolutely refused. Then along came Russia -- Taipei calculated that Russia's boundless expanses and its need for money should incline it to enter into constructive dialogue on this tricky topic. As you can see, their assumptions paid off -- that is the conclusion at least that can be drawn from the brief report made by the head of the Taiwan power corporation on his work in Russia. IZVESTIYA was told by the Ministry for Atomic Energy that there have been no talks regarding the possibility of burying Taiwan's nuclear waste in Russia. According to a senior ministry official, the Taiwanese tried to sound out the Russian side on this score during a recent scientific and practical conference on nuclear technologies in St. Petersburg. They were told that in accordance with current law and the president's edict Russia does not accept foreign states' nuclear waste for storage. Storage of spent fuel from nuclear power stations built abroad with Russian assistance is carried out on the basis of special agreements. However the ministry official voiced the opinion that a deal with Taiwan could bring colossal profits and would enable Russia to resolve many of its economic problems.
