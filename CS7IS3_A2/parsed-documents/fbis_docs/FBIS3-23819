The city's streets are half empty. The rarely encountered passers-by are not talkative. The shelves of the state stores are pristinely bare. Bread was delivered and a waiting line formed for it. But in the private commercial stores, on the contrary, everything is available and there are no waiting lines. For a Snickers chocolate bar for your child you shell out 30,000-35,000 coupons and there goes a third of your wages. One chicken costs 120,000 coupons. The salesmen break out into a smile at the sight of Russian rubles. The dolphinarium, once famous throughout the Union, is empty. The inhabitants of the dolphinarium were transferred to less expensive premises "until times get better"--there is no money to pay the workers and there is no one to marvel at the dolphins--few people travel to Batumi, and the local residents prefer bread to spectacles. There are few Russians left in Batumi. People's faces are stamped with gloom and doom. The government is praised for the fact that there is no war, but otherwise living is hard. They sell everything in order to eat. They staunchly tolerate accusations from citizens of the indigenous nationality that Russia is to blame for everything. The strong and healthy have left. The weak and sick have remained. The Ajarian militia frequently go around out of uniform; they are replaced by automatic weapons as a way of showing that a person works for the power structures. Militiamen are paid a great deal, with private merchants footing the bill. The minister of internal affairs told them straightforwardly: If you do not want the youth to get involved in rackets and robbery but rather to preserve your peace, hand over the money. With these funds they purchase rations, weapons, and uniforms. The border with Turkey is guarded. Russian border guards rule out the possibility of the illegal passage of armed formations across it. It is possible to bring a great deal from the other side of the cordons, but almost nothing is taken out. Only two of Batumi's industrial enterprises are operating--the heating and electric power plant and the tea packaging factory. The equipment in the shops is ancient. The chief of the 400,000 Ajarians, Aslan Abashidze, wants to reconcile Armenia with Azerbaijan and Abkhazia with the authorities in Georgia. The peacemaker is forced to sleep with his rations and stay alert--repeated attempts have been made on his life. In a KGB solitary confinement cell sits a person who was promised an immense sum for Abashidze's head in Tbilisi. But he himself had to make a confession since he considered "Mr. Aslan" to be a national hero. Members of the Ajarian government travel throughout the world and they have a great deal about which the rank-and-file resident can only dream. But at the same time they work 15 hours a day. They say about themselves that their death sentence has been signed in the event that Abashidze leaves--both opponents in Batumi and ill-wishers in Tbilisi are thirsting for their blood--and too many of them want to live a free and easy life and have power in their hands. Simple people do not have time for that. City dwellers are being fed by their soft-hearted relatives from the villages. Ajarians dream about receiving their wages in Russian rubles and they were glad when Georgia entered the CIS. But certain of them still consider Russia to be to blame for all their problems. For peace and tranquility, even if it is under the roar of automatic weapons, they thank Abashidze and Turkey, with which they have good relations. Customs officials of the Ajarians and their neighbors are living "in harmony." There is almost no theft in Ajaria. Of the six motor vehicles driven away during the past year, four have been found. Is everything tranquil in Batumi?
