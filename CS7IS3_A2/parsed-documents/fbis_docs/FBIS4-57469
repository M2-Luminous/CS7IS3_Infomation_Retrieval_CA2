How do you feel about it? Are you tired of exercising power? [Fujimori] No. Do you think I look tired? [laughs] I am enthusiastic. I like what I do. I am feeling increasingly energetic and want to resolve problems. One of the things I like to do best is to face problems. I do not know if this is explicitly stated in the book written by [name indistinct]. We have overcome some of the macroeconomic and terrorist problems and are now concentrating on social issues, like fighting poverty. [Lombardi] Will this be your priority issue in the last year of your term? [Fujimori] A few months ago we adopted specific measures in this regard. Perhaps some critics ignore this and I am sure they are unaware of it because they never go where these actions take place. There is still a lot to be done, not just next year but also in the years to come. [Lombardi] Are you announcing that you will seek reelection? [Fujimori] That is not what I meant. Presidents must seek the well-being of people and this entails a process. Some say I am campaigning but this is what presidents should do. I would say that all future presidents should constantly work toward achieving this goal, not just at cocktail parties and at the social level. [Lombardi] Well then, I will pose my question more directly: Engineer Fujimori will you seek reelection? [Fujimori] I believe this is the fourth time you have asked me the same question. [laughs] [Lombardi] But we are 12 months away from the presidential elections... [Fujimori, interrupting] I believe it would be good for the country if these electoral issues were set aside for the time being. We should address electoral issues only as election time gets near because the country needs people to work hard. If we distract our attention with electoral issues, we will be unable to do a good job. I will continue to exercise my duties as president. I have not yet announced my candidacy and I am still not a fully-fledged candidate. [Lombardi] Were you referring to anyone in particular when you said that future presidents and eventual presidential candidates should be working in the field and not at the cocktail party level? Whom were you referring to... [Fujimori, interrupting] I was not thinking about anyone in particular... [Lombardi, interrupting] There is no one... [Fujimori, interrupting] No, but that was the traditional way the issue was handled. Was it not? [Lombardi] No official candidacies have yet been announced. You have not announced your candidacy and no one has announced it either. But there are some obvious candidacies. What are your views on this? Whom would you like to run against next year? On 15 May [1995], Peru will have elected a new president... [Fujimori, interrupting] Yes, if I decide to run, that is... [Lombardi, interrupting] If you decide to do so... [Fujimori, interrupting] If I run. [laughs] It makes no difference to me at all. I believe... [Lombardi, interrupting] Do you think Perez de Cuellar would be a good candidate? [Fujimori] Well, I would like to see him here in Peru. Only then we will be able to assess the situation and his possibilities of leading Peru. I believe protagonists must be at the site of events not abroad. [Lombardi] The fact that he is not here does not mean we cannot make an assessment... [Fujimori, interrupting] That is perfectly fine. I also believe it is not good for the country to be abroad for a long period of time, particularly when handling national issues -- more specifically regarding the war on poverty. One must be on site to know the situation first hand. It is one thing to see the issues from Government House and another completely different issue to see the situation in (?Piquichaca) or (?Ancaray), which I visited today. The problems are viewed in a completely different light. To see how terrorism had destroyed these towns and the simple solutions that can be found. This can only be done at the site of events. [Lombardi] Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont is a potential presidential candidate who is here in Peru and who is trying to resolve problems affecting Lima. Apparently you dislike him and even at the government level you have blocked any possible solutions that Belmont has come up with to resolve problems affecting Lima. [Fujimori] The government has adopted technical measures seeking to decentralize power and this is being increasingly understood by people. [Lombardi] What are your views on (?Fidel Montes) as a presidential candidate? [Fujimori] Well, they have announced their candidacies and I hope many others will do the same. It is not just a question of these two personalities, but of other mayors as well ... [Lombardi, interrupting] Former mayors... [Fujimori, interrupting] Another candidacy was announced today. All this will be very lively. But we should leave all this activity for next year. [Lombardi] Not that long because the candidacies must be registered by October and the campaigns must be launched ... [Fujimori, interrupting] Yes, but the elections will be held in April. Let me remind you that I started to move only by March. [Lombardi] Let us talk about [pauses] ... but you will not be an unknown candidate like in 1990. [Fujimori] No, of course not. [laughs] But you are implying that I am going to be a candidate. [Lombardi] Let us discuss an issue which you have said will be your main concern this year -- social problems, an area that has greatly benefited from the resources obtained from privatizations. These huge resources were unthought of a few months ago. How will you spend these resources and how will people, the media, and Congress follow how these sources will be used? [Fujimori] Never before this century have resources been so well invested. The savings that have been made by using these sources are tangible. I would like to give a couple of examples: We saved over $100 million in an irrigation project. Imagine the significance of $100 million. I can build 300 schools with it. [Lombardi] What project are you referring to? [Fujimori] Chabimochic. [Lombardi] But that means that the project was totally overvalued. [Fujimori] Ah, there are works that were overvalued, others [word indistinct], and still others were incomplete. The Chimbote dock, for example, was overvalued. Fancy spending $19 million to build a dock that is useless. Look how we spent our resources. There was a long discussion and a campaign was launched criticizing the purchase of patrol cars. I read in one newspaper that this project was a crooked deal, that certain brands were to be preferred over others. That is not true. The bid was awarded to a given brand and we are purchasing Japanese pickup trucks to be used as patrol cars, with power steering, at $10,600... [Lombardi, interrupting] And the example set by some municipal districts such as [words indistinct]? [Fujimori] No. Sorry, we are only talking about one example. I take the example of the patrol cars because I think the people will understand it better. We purchased ambulances for social projects. For this we purchased new Toyota (?Hiway) vans delivered to Callao Port at $10,500. We are paying $7,600 for that type of vehicle that will be used as patrol cars. Tell me what other government has paid that kind of prices. This is why I maintain that our resources are not ill-spent. I am concerned about campaigns forecasting the misuse of resources. Usually behind these demoralizing campaigns someone is trying to get the government to acquire this or that brand. But we do not put up with this sort of thing. I think it is quite clear how the government uses funds for social programs. For example, we have CONADE [National Development Corporation]. Just look at all the electrification, potable water, and sewage projects it has carried out in the shantytowns. As one example I want to mention that soon I will visit a settlement in Manzanares, in Huachos, which has existed for 40 years without potable water or sewage systems. In Cerro San Cristobal, there are still some people who still do not have potable water, sewage systems, or electricity. Therefore, there is still a lot for CONADE to do and I am certain that the social projects are being administered efficiently. [Lombardi] Mr. President, to talk about the good or bad use of resources does not necessarily entail corruption or paying more for what can be purchased for less. Sometimes it refers to where the resources are used. You said the $100 million that was saved in the Chabimochic project could be invested in building a whole lot of schools. But is building schools all that is necessary to improve the quality of the education program in Peru or should we invest significant quantities in training teachers, increasing teachers' salaries, etc.? [Fujimori] Now we are talking about education? [Lombardi] Just as an example. Just an example of what is regarded as a good or bad use of resources. [Fujimori] Before referring to this subject, in which I am very interested, I want to mention that in the social field, for example, this government has the cooperation of the Armed Forces, the Army to build neighborhood roads. Recently we purchased machinery worth $40 million, with a credit granted by Eximbank of Japan, which will be used to build neighborhood roads and second and third level highways. This is a special program. We are also building health centers as part of the social program. In the education field, it has been said that I only think about education in terms of laying one brick on top of another. First, I want to tell those who criticize me that they are not acquainted with the Peruvian education system, that they are not aware of the real situation in Peru. Probably because, out of fear of the Shining Path or acts of violence, they have not visited shantytowns like Jose Carlos Mariategui, or [names indistinct], to mention some. To talk about education and maintain that this or the other aspect must be improved is fine, but in the meantime where do the children and teachers go? To thatch roof huts and sit on a pile of bricks? This is one aspect we are correcting. We must improve teacher training and salaries, we must supply books, shoes, and even buses to the poorest sectors. The government is doing this. Do you know that for the first time in 20 years we have held a massive training program from which 45,000 teachers benefited. All this is being tackled in a comprehensive manner and this is why I believe people are wrong to criticize the building of schools. Wherever I go I meet crowds of children demanding a school, and they have every right to do so. We may have to build 5,000 schools in the next few years. As you may have seen, every Sunday there is a whole page of the newspapers calling for bids for the construction of 20 schools. Just take a look at yesterday's EXPRESO issue and you will find a call for bids for the construction of 20 schools, next Sunday another 20 schools. This is one of the aspects of the social program which is, undoubtedly, very important. [Lombardi] Regarding the social program expenditures, the Ministry of the Presidency is one of the sectors in charge of administrating the expenditures of the social program. Do you think someone like Minister Raul Vittor, who is accused of being involved with someone who is sought by Peruvian justice, should handle this? [Fujimori] The charges have not been proven. [Lombardi] No. [Fujimori] If this were the case, then I should be removed also because there are hundreds of charges against me. Do you remember, during the campaign? Well... [Lombardi, interrupting] The relationship could be legitimate. [Fujimori] Of course. The Ministry of the Presidency was created precisely so the important resources be administered by the Presidency of the Republic. I must say that in this regard I am very distrustful. I could not bear all those resources scattered everywhere without an effective supervision of the expenditures by the executive branch. Experience has shown us that the resources are being used in a very rational manner and with the best social and economic results. [Lombardi] Does this mean you are satisfied with Vittor's performance. [Fujimori] So far, I am not only satisfied with Minister Vittor's performance but also with all heads of the various sectors, that is, of the National Prisons Institute, National Compensation and Social Development Fund, National Housing Fund, the infrastructure minister, and all my ministers, whom, let me tell you, I call my managers because they are the managers of the government's policies. [Lombardi] Somewhere we read that you call yourself general manager. Sandro Fuentes, for example, is an excellent manager, he did an excellent job... [Fujimori, interrupting] But he tendered his resignation for personal reasons. By the way, some believe a businessman should be elected for this post but I disagree because what the country needs is a greater collection of revenues. Therefore, we need someone neutral so that the amount of revenues collected may grow. Moreover, revenues come from the business sector. [Lombardi] Would not you like Sandro Fuentes, whom you know is an efficient person, in another cabinet post? [Fujimori] I have not even thought about this possibility. Probably [words indistinct]. [Lombardi] President Fujimori, one extremely important issue -- you have always granted it particular importance -- is the national pacification process. During the past few days in Lima, obviously not with the same magnitude of the past, there seems to be a new terrorist outbreak. There have been a few detonated petards and bombs that have only damaged windows. Nevertheless, it is worrisome. How does the government view these incidents; what intelligence information on the issue do you have? [Fujimori] This is only normal because the Shining Path, which is at death's door, is trying to make itself noticed with this type of violent actions. The situation is under control. We have the military front, particularly in the rural jungle zone and also in the urban zones keeping close track of terrorists. The citizenry must clearly understand that the war has not ended. We must not be over optimistic. The war will continue until 1995. There will be certain actions around 18 May, which marks the date on which they began their attacks. But the important thing is the progress we have made. You have not asked me about the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] because, subconsciously, you have forgotten about them. That is what will happen. Gradually we will progress in this struggle against terrorism and the people may rest assured that we are acting with determination, effectively against the Shining Path. There is no turning back. [Lombardi] We must not forget we are still at war, that the war has not ended. Maybe you are partially responsible for this lack of concern, convincing us that we will defeat the MRTA and the Shining Path. [Fujimori] I said I was going to defeat them in 1993. We are already behind schedule. We are still missing two Shining Path leaders. A couple of weeks ago the police arrested important members, right? They are members of the Shining Path national executive council. [Lombardi] By the way, some Chileans have been sentenced for treason to the fatherland. There is concern among congressmen. The other day, we talked with Chilean Congressman Pizarro, the president of Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chilean Chamber of Deputies, who asked us how Chileans can be sentenced for treason to the fatherland in Peru. He asked: Was it a mistake? [Fujimori] No, that was simply the name of the charge. It could have been called, let us say, treason to regional security. It is currently being described in a bill. Those Chilean terrorists committed a crime which is described as treason to the fatherland. Now, let us not forget that Castillo Petruzzi and his group kidnapped and held several people hostage in filthy cells, and they even murdered several of them. That is why I -- I think this television channel is seen in Chile -- am here addressing all Chileans, who should thank us. Those outlaws are now in Peru. They are very safe, sentenced to life without any possibility of escape. Imagine if they were released in 15 or 20 years. It would be terrible. They would be a threat. [Lombardi] You referred to the military fronts that operate in rural zones. Let us talk about the Huallaga region. What were the objectives of Operation Scorpion Three. [Fujimori] Two objectives. One was to eliminate, eradicate, any final Shining Path strongholds that may exist in the Huallaga region. At the same time, the Army is working in the (hills) in the Ene Valley where the Shining Path has been entrenched since 1984 and where they captured Ashaninka Indians. The intention is to first eradicate them and then to send the settlers and the natives back home. [Lombardi] Have these objectives been met? How long will it take? [Fujimori] Near the Bolson Cuchara Valley -- by the way it is the place where the [words indistinct] (escaped) -- but we will find him for sure. I hope that within a month we will have a [word indistinct]. Many deserters are surrendering [word indistinct] from the war. Within a month, the area will be clean. But this does not mean totally clean. This is where the Shining Path members who killed more than 50 people in Matucana came from. [Lombardi] It was like a Shining Path shelter... [Fujimori, interrupting] It was a fortress. [Lombardi] You said war is war. Evidently excesses are committed during a war, and innocent people may die. Charges of human rights violations in the Huallaga region have been raised. Do you think excesses could have taken place? Are you willing to investigate? Are the Armed Forces willing to punish those who committed excesses? [Fujimori] I do not rule out that some mistakes could have happened. I do not rule that out. That should be thoroughly investigated. Responsibilities must be determined, but ... [Lombardi, interrupting] Mistakes like these affect local victims and national security. They affect us at the international level. An investigation should be carried out and solved by someone trustworthy and credible. [Fujimori] There are several organizations with jurisdiction in this subject. They should be international organizations. For example, I can mention the congressional human rights organization, the attorney general's office, and any other organization that wants to investigate the subject. But let us not repeat mistakes of the past. The Shining Path committed some crimes which were blamed on the Army and the police. We have had several of those cases. We are very strict in this. We cannot fold our arms and ... [Lombardi, interrupting] [question indistinct] [Fujimori] We agree that the civilian population must be respected. There has been a radical change in the strategy of the antiterrorist struggle because the instructions given to the police and the Armed Forces is to first provide support for the population so that ... [Lombardi, interrupting] Are those instructions still in force? [Fujimori] Yes, those instructions are still valid. [Lombardi] I have unconfirmed information that the military troops in the Huallaga region are 17 or 18 year-old recruits? There are not many, I heard there is a 300-strong battalion. Why was this task assigned to such young men who lack experience and may get jittery, and not to troops with experience in the antisubversive struggle? [Fujimori] We do not have professional troops. Our troops are young men who, according to the law, start their mandatory military service at the age of 18. There are also some volunteers who are not minors. They are trained and commanded by capable officers. I must clarify something: It is very easy to be sitting on the sofa at home, watching television while our military men and soldiers are in the jungle at the risk of being the target of a bazooka or of stepping on a mine. We must clearly recognize the effort being carried out by our national police and Armed Forces. To whom do we owe the success of the economic program, peace, and a social program? We owe it to them, to the peasant self defense patrols, and to the people who fought terrorism, sacrificing their lives. How many of our Armed Forces are now handicapped? When people talk to me about human rights I tell them I defend the human rights -- you can see for yourself in our prisons, which are the best in Latin America -- of those who defend the human rights of 22 million Peruvians. Do you recall any article published by international human rights organization on atrocities committed by the Shining Path and the MRTA? I have not read any. That is why I began an international campaign in 1992 to make the human rights of our people be known. [Lombardi] Apparently your campaign has been successful because Amnesty International has begun to ... [Fujimori, interrupting] Ah yes, it began to report on it as of May or June 1992. [Lombardi] (Pierre Same), the secretary general of Amnesty International has come to Peru. The justice minister has said you will not receive him. Why not? Given that Amnesty International has reported on human rights violations committed by insurrectional groups? [Fujimori] Groups are free to carry out the investigation they want. We have total freedom in this country. Even International Red Cross inspectors can go into our prisons. [Lombardi] But the Red Cross has not been allowed to enter in the Huallaga Region. [Fujimori] I believe that impasse has been overcome. There is total freedom to carry out investigations. I wonder if, for example in other countries, the president receives representatives of human rights organizations? Does President Clinton receive them?. I do not think so. We are a sovereign country in this aspect. But the country is open to any investigation. Our government is defending the people's human rights. [Lombardi] President Fujimori, to ensure that the Armed Forces effort in defeating subversion is totally and unanimously recognized, other facts should take place. For example, the arrest of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as Vaticano. It was said that some Armed Forces officers stationed in trafficking zones are linked with traffickers. Names were given. What investigations are being carried out? How many officers have been arrested? Do you think that given the great power of drug trafficking, some personnel, not the whole institution -- no one is accusing the Armed Forces or the Peruvian Army -- but some officers could have been tempted by the traffickers? [Fujimori] Of course, that is human. Some have been tempted. That is why the Military Supreme Court has sentenced several officers for the crime of drug trafficking. These cases have taken place. A few were tried in civilian courts. Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera was charged for two crimes: Terrorism and trafficking. If a civilian court tried him for drug trafficking, where would he be right now? We would be saying that he is in such and such place, or that he escaped from prison, or that he is still being tried and that there is a risk that he may escape. Now he can be tried and asked which military officers are involved. Why can we ask him that? Because he is in a safe prison, serving a 25 or 30 year sentence. [words indistinct] had he been tried by a civilian court, I doubt he would still be in our hands. [Lombardi] Just like the case of Manrique. Before discussing the letter of intent with the IMF, and because people say we journalists are very sensitive about our rights, I would like to ask you to comment on reports that you allegedly forced a member of the international press, who accompanied you on a trip to Puno, to erase a video tape containing a recording of your visit to the (?Llamamallo) jail. What happened in Puno? [Fujimori] That report is correct because the recording contained a diatribe by a female Shining Path member. We will not allow the Shining Path to make rallying speeches. That was feasible before when the media were compelled to broadcast video and audio tapes containing calls of the so-called armed struggle. The government will not lose such an important front as is the psychological war. I believe Peru has the right to adopt all the strategies it sees fit in this war. Aside from all these issues, I believe that the achievement of peace is above everything less... [Lomabardi, interrupting] Mr. President... [Fujimori, interrupting] As for freedom of the press, I respect it and uphold complete freedom of speech. [Lombardi] Well, here you are to exercise that same right. [Fujimori] [words indistinct] [Lombardi] This past week, the government published a letter of intent with the IMF and a few days later the annexes. [Fujimori] Correct. [Lombardi] Some say this is merely protocol because the content of the letter includes details of an extensive negotiating process that lasted several months which cannot be altered no matter what criticisms and opinions may be expressed in the next few days. This is one interpretation of the issue, the other interpretation is even more bold. Some allege you do not want to sign the letter of intent, that you want to gain time, and that you will use these opinions to justify your not signing it. They allege you do not want to sign it because it restricts the use of funds in social projects to 650 million [currency not specified] and that you want to spend more than that in the election year. What is the truth behind the publication of this letter? Why was the letter of intent published? [Fujimori] The publication of the letter of intent before its signing is in keeping with what was ordered by the Central Reserve Bank and the economy minister. I want to note the importance of such a publication. These letters of intent are normally drafted secretly and kept under cover because of certain fears. First, the guidelines of the economic program and its objectives are clearly specified. Let us suppose we are unable to amend it, but if we are a truly sovereign state we can do so by specifying which clauses we want to amend [word indistinct]. I have to admit that although neither Central Reserve Bank Chairman German Suarez or Economy Minister Jorge Camet are members of the military, I have quote, ordered, unquote, [chuckles] them not to sign the letter of intent until a consensus is achieved. We were about to sign it sometime ago, but I was dissatisfied with some terms particularly regarding the use in social programs of resources realized from privatizations. But we have to sign this letter of intent sometime in the future. It will not be beneficial for Peru to refuse to sign. Peru has to sign it... [Lombardi, interrupting] But IPAE [expansion unknown] Chairman [name indistinct] has said Peru should not sign. [Fujimori] I am surprised that a businessman should adopt such a stance. Perhaps he has ties with the previous administration... [Lombardi interrupting] No, he is a young man and [words indistinct]. [Fujimori] Anyway, if Peru signs the letter of intent, we will have a technical endorsement from the highest international financial institution. With the letter of intent approved by the IMF we will have the IMF's support. This would allow us to request concessions and pardons from the Paris Club or request say $100 million from the World Bank for social stability programs. It is a fundamental endorsement. Now, even [pauses] after 5 April, everyone unanimously supported the reinsertion of Peru. Do you remember? [Lombardi] Absolutely. [Fujimori] We will achieve our reinsertion by signing the letter of intent... [Lombardi, interrupting] But two years after Peru's reinsertion, Peruvians have started to wonder. It is true the agreements achieved with the IMF have allowed us to pay and to receive funds. President Fujimori, when you assumed power in 1990 you inherited a foreign debt totalling $19 billion. Today, after paying part of it through the great effort of all Peruvians, this debt has risen to $24 billion -- and this is without having contracted any new debts because we basically paid interest rates. In view of this, does it make sense to continue paying? [Fujimori] There will come a point beyond which we will not make such large disbursements. A good part of this hike in the foreign debt was caused by interest rates contracted by previous administrations. This is why we are paying so much interest. Suppose the debt totals $20 billion. If we add only 10 percent, we will be throwing away $2 billion. We must strive to reduce debt servicing. This is why we need a letter of intent. This must be followed by a reduction in the servicing of the foreign debt, and a condoning of our debt with international banks. All this entails a process. Let us discuss the Brady Plan. Friends, the Brady Plan consists of the following: Peru owes $6 billion to international banks, this in addition to interest. Through the Brady Plan, Peru can refinance... [Lombardi, interrupting] But at lower interest rates... [Fujimori, continues] ... but condoning an important chunk of the debt. Suppose that after negotiations we are able to condone 50 percent of our debt, that is, instead of a $6 billion-debt we will have a $3 billion-debt. We pay a part of the remaining $3 billion and the rest is paid over 30 years. This is a way of reducing the servicing of the debt. [Lombardi] Mr. President, experts are concerned about some aspects of the letter of intent while the majority are concerned about other issues. For example, people say that tax revenues should be 12.1 percent and that if this is not achieved corrective measures will be adopted. I get goose pimples because this is tantamount to more taxes. [Fujimori] Well, it is those who pay taxes who should worry. [Lombardi] Do you pay taxes? [Fujimori] Yes I do and I believe the majority of Peruvians, at least those with an income, pay taxes. A 12.1 percent tax revenue is low. It is low because we should not think only from the point of view of those who pay taxes but in terms of those who benefit from these revenues. If we increase tax revenues -- and this is not necessarily achieved by creating more taxes or by increasing tax rates -- it means the government will have more resources to build schools, roads, running water systems, sewage systems, and energy systems. This is why the government seeks to achieve a tax revenue totalling 12.1 percent of the GDP. Neither you nor businessmen, however, should worry, Mr. Lombardi, because you will not pay more taxes. Right now tax revenues total 12.7 percent of the GDP... [Lombardi, interrupting] But that is... [Fujimori continues]... which means the current tax revenue is higher... [Lombardi, interrupting] So, we have already achieved the objective... [Fujimori, interrupting] Of course. [Lombardi] This is confusing. For example, there is talk of an increase in the GDP of 4.5 percent. But all economic indicators -- and even the economy minister has confirmed this -- show that the economic growth in 1994 is estimated at about 7 percent, if not more. What is the reasoning behind these low figures? [Fujimori] The letter of intent was drafted a few months back and only one of its articles, the one pertaining to the use of resources obtained from privatizations, was negotiated. Let me remind you that in the beginning we were talking about $250 million plus $200 million, and now we are talking about $250 million and up to $876 million. There is, therefore, a little imbalance but we are achieving the macroeconomic goals. In other words, we will not create more taxes because of this clause. In view of the tax reform we now have only four taxes: income tax, tariffs, General Sales Tax and consumer tax. We have rationalized taxes. [Lombardi] Just one final thing on the letter of intent. It is very surprising that a president from an agricultural background -- a farmer, a former Agrarian University rector -- has left aside the agricultural issue. For example, there have been reports that the agriculture surtax will be repealed in the next few years and the agriculture reactivation program was left aside. What do you have to say to all this? [Fujimori] We have defended the agriculture surtax in arduous negotiations with the Inter-American Development Bank and we have publicly stated that we rejected this precondition. There will be a surtax until 1976 ... [Lombardi, interrupting] You mean 1996. [Fujimori] I mean 1996 [chuckles]. In 1997, the new government will have to renegotiate this but it will depend on international agriculture prices. Agriculture has been protected as never before. There are no subsidies... [Lombardi, interrupting]...direct subsidies... [Fujimori, continues] ...but the agriculture policy seeks to maintain certain prices within a given bracket, with a flexible surtax, so that if there is a sharp drop in international prices of, let us say, rice prices, we will increase the surtax. In view of this, rice farmers -- except for seasonal reasons -- are guaranteed a minimum profit. [Lombardi] Will you fulfill the privatizations timetable in the year that is left of your administration? There have been successes, some failures, and it has faded out at times, but do you believe you will complete the privatization process by July 1995? [Fujimori] I refuse to assess it in terms of success or failure. There have been more successes than anything else. If we make a final balance we can say that the privatization process has been successful... [Lombardi, interrupting] Absolutely, on balance it has been successful. I did not mean failures, I meant temporary frustrations. (?I was not generalizing.) What happened with Centromin Peru [Central Peru Mining Enterprise] was not a failure, more a frustration. [Fujimori] No. Centromin Peru was not undervalued as people alleged, it was just that, of the 40 or 50 bidders, no one dared to bid the $280 million plus the $60 million needed to cover the debt. It was not that undervalued. But on balance, the privatization process has been successful. Four years after its implementation, I believe I am entitled to say that we had a good [word indistinct], a good privatization timetable within the framework of the integral development program because we intensified the privatization process after achieving domestic stability, otherwise we could have auctioned them... [Lombardi, interrupting] Of course... [Fujimori continues]... therefore, we will continue at the same pace but always looking for the best prices. Look at the $68 million we got for (?CementoYura); look at National Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru. By the way I cannot imagine what it must be like to receive $2 billion. [chuckles] [Lombardi] There are those who will not believe it until they see the check. [Fujimori] Ah well, I am one of them because I stand by St. Thomas saying: Seeing is believing. [Lombardi] We will have to wait until 17 May to verify this. [Fujimori] But I trust the Spanish Telephone Company, it is a very serious company. [Lombardi] Former President Alan Garcia's father has just passed away. Had it been up to you, would you have authorized former President Garcia to attend his father's funeral and offered him guarantees that he would not be arrested? [Fujimori] Yes. Instructions were given that if the former president arrived, no measures were to be adopted against him. This I believe went a little against the trial proceedings. [Lombardi] President Fujimori, thank you very much for your willingness to hold such a long interview on the Panorama program tonight. We are all impatiently waiting for 17 May at noon, when the Spanish Telephone Company will deposit a $2-billion check. Thank you very much. [Fujimori] Thank you very much and I know this will be a new milestone in the history of Peru's development. Thank you and good night.
