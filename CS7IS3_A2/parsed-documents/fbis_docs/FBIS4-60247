Sarid, who has been closely involved in the autonomy negotiations, says that 'Arafat's statements in the Johannesburg mosque earlier this month on signing agreements has created a crisis of confidence. The PLO leader, Sarid said, must declare his statements there null and void and reaffirm his total commitment to the peace process, in particular his support for a determined and open fight against terror. The environment minister was interviewed by Qol Yisra'el reporter Shulamit Schmerling during a visit to Haifa.
