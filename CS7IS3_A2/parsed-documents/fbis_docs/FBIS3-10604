Bishop Samuel Ruiz has received death threats. There is a lot of activity in Chiapas State. Let us hear from Mary Carmen Camacho, who is in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the Chiapas State capital. Good evening, Mary Carmen. [Camacho] Good evening, Pepe. Here is my report. Today, eight masked men killed Mariano Perez Diaz, regional leader of the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization. Francisco Meneses Gazon, municipal president of Simojovel, reported that the peasant leader was killed this morning on the doorstep of his home in El Carmito, 15 km from Simojovel. The son of the [word indistinct] leader in northern Chiapas was wounded in the attack. Meanwhile, approximately 70,000 workers, members of the Confederation of Mexican Workers [CTM], have threatened to break with the national CTM leadership if Fidel Velasquez does not accept the Chiapas workers' proposal that a CTM congress be held in Chiapas and that the state's CTM executive committee be elected here. At a meeting in Tuxtla Gutierrez in which representatives from almost 400 Chiapas labor union organizations participated, the participants ratified Carlos de Jesus Nataran Cordoba as CTM leader in Chiapas and expelled Javier Proter Maldonado, who yesterday was assigned to the post by CTM national leader Fidel Velasquez without the knowledge of the Chiapas workers. Nataran Cordoba, the acknowledged leader, said the Chiapas workers had thought about breaking with the CTM and forming their own labor federation. CTM workers said they will use force to keep the people appointed by Fidel Velasquez to the CTM state executive committee from taking office. This is what has happened in Chiapas.
