A state deputy alternate in Sao Paulo who is himself now holding the seat, Falcao is the man responsible for the PT leadership's swing to the left. A former militant in the PCB [Brazilian Communist Party] and in the VAR-Palmares [Revolutionary Armed Vanguard], the current vice president of the PT was a political prisoner for three years during the military regime. Falcao defends the legitimacy of the current PT leadership and says the lack of electoral representativeness at the top does not disqualify the leadership in comparison with the previous party officers. Following are the highlights of Falcao's interview with FOLHA. [Alves] The PT calls itself a socialist party. Would a Lula administration pave the way for socialism, and if so, what would be the content of that socialism? [Falcao] We define a Lula government as being democratic and people-based. A government of profound social, economic, and political reforms that plans to tackle longstanding privileges and create conditions for the people to participate in drafting the budget, in government decisions, in giving a new direction to the role of the State, and strengthening the organization of Brazilian society. The PT is a socialist party and sees the opportunity to govern the country as the time to change values, raise the consciousness of the public, and democratize land ownership. [Alves] So it would be a government of transition to socialism? [Falcao] We want to create democratic conditions so that in the future we can live in a society of fraternity, justice, and equality. In our view, such a society is socialist and democratic. [Alves] Is the current configuration of the PT leadership the result of the exhaustion of the social movement? [Falcao] The present leadership is as pluralist and legitimate as its predecessors were. The majority was constituted by capturing a sentiment pervading the party that there was too much distance between sectors of the leadership and the party's rank and file, that there had been indecisiveness in the former leadership's attitude toward the Itamar Franco administration when it was formed, and a certain natural loss of influence of leaders who had spent a lot of time in command of parties. [Alves] Among the classical schools of thought that founded the PT (the Church, the labor movement, and people from leftist movements), this last group has become superimposed on the others. Why did this happen? [Falcao] That sounds like a sociological explanation of the life of a party. There is no domination by formative legacies in the composition of the present leadership. Lula, who was mainly responsible for creating the PT, continues to be the expression of party unity, and a democratic fellowship among the different tendencies is what rules the PT today. [Alves] The groups that now control the PT lack social and electoral representativeness. Why is that? [Falcao] I would not say they lack social representativeness, inasmuch as several of my fellow leaders are associated with various movements. Electoral representativeness is conferred by the party as a whole. The legislators who serve in the current leadership and all the legislators of the PT were elected by the weight of the party--not to mention their individual qualities. Those who are now in the leadership did not go through the same voting process as their predecessors. But I do not believe this disqualifies, or qualifies, the colleagues who served previously in comparison with the present group, or vice versa. [Alves] Isn't this a sign that the PT is becoming a party of cadres and not of the masses? [Falcao] We never defended the idea that the PT should be a party of cadres. Since its foundation, the PT has broken with that tradition of the Brazilian Left. We believe that just because a party organizes millions of workers and common people, it does not mean that political cadres, organic intellectuals, are not developing. [Alves] Lula's electoral base is greater than what the PT has historically achieved. If he is elected, will the mandate be his, or the PT's? [Falcao] The president's mandate comes from the people, but it reflects a commitment to a program. It is that relationship that we establish so that there will be no doubt. It is a mandate from the people, but one that is also legitimized by the fulfillment of a program. [Alves] In case of doubt, will Lula, or the PT, make the decision? [Falcao] The one who governs this country is the president of the Republic, and his ministers, in conjunction with the Congress. We want to expand that concept of democracy by having the population not just vote, but be able to participate in the control over the government and in government decisions. [Alves] What are the PT's boundaries in terms of alliances during the campaign? [Falcao] Our policy as regards alliances must be coordinated with our program. We put priority on alliances in society and also with parties. The PCB [Brazilian Communist Party], the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party], the PPS [Socialist People's Party], the PV [Vanguard Party], the PMN [National Mobilization Party], and the PSTU [United Social Workers Party] are possibilities. The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is disputed territory. We recognize that the PSDB has a people's camp within its electorate and among its troops, and we are competing for the support of part of the PSDB for Lula's candidacy, even though we know the PSDB will run its own candidate for president, riding piggyback on a stabilization plan, something that is in the worst tradition of Brazilian politics. [Alves] What do you think of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso as a candidate, and what about the economic plan? [Falcao] The economic plan does not deal with the issue of the monopolies and the financial system. It does not associate stabilization with the need for development of this country; therefore, we might actually move into a situation of declining inflation rates but still have unemployment and misery. In the third place, it ties the country's economic decisions to the United States and to the IMF via a shamefaced dollarization of the Brazilian economy. In the fourth place, it is an electioneering program because it is betting on the possibility of a partial and temporary decline in the inflation rate to pay dividends at the ballot box. It is a Cruzado Plan without a wage bonus. [Alves] Now that the constitutional revision is a fact, is there any regret that the PT is absent from it? [Falcao] I do not consider the revision to be a consolidated process. What we are seeing now is an auction. There is dissent even among the elites as to the course the revision should take. We have maintained a tactic of obstruction, of attempting to reduce the boundaries of the revision and to shorten its duration. If the revision process does get going, we hope to achieve the longest possible agenda and a change in the rules so that our deputies can get involved in the process. [Alves] How do you view the manifesto by the intellectuals who criticized the party leadership by pointing to a distance between it and the PT grass roots? [Falcao] Any group of PT members may legitimately band together and express themselves either against or in favor of the leaders. I cannot, however, agree with their view of the current PT leadership. This leadership is legitimate, and there are other intellectuals who support it.
