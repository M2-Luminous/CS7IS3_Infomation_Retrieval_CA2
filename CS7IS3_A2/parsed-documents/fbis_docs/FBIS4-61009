At the same time, the minimum wage was still 50,000 coupons -- slightly more than 83 rubles. These figures relate to early April, when the Georgian unit was much higher. Since then it has fallen by another 250. There is probably nowhere that the Russian ruble is valued so much -- in Tbilisi, for instance, it sells for more than 600 coupons. Today we can already say that the Georgian monetary unit is dying. Having existed for just over a year, it has almost ceased to have any meaning. Bread, flour, municipal services, and transportation costs are fully subsidized by the state, an 800-gram loaf costs just over 1 ruble in Russian money, while a trip on the subway costs just 1 kopek. Budget expenditure is 270 percent higher than revenue, and no end to hyperinflation is yet in sight. In recent days the country's top financial and economic leaders have been talking more and more often about the need to immediately introduce a new national currency -- the "lari." According to some reports, one tonne of this currency is already stored in the republic's warehouses.
