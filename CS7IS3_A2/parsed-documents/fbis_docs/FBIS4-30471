The Hata cabinet is no longer in a position to make any major policy decisions since Prime Minister Hata announced his cabinet would resign en masse. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara told a news conference, however, that "the Hata cabinet is responsible for making preparations for the Naples Summit and it is a matter of course for the cabinet to make those preparations." Aides to the prime minister have stressed: "Prime Minister Hata is not making preparations for the Naples Summit on the premise of his attendance at it." But speculation is spreading in Nagata-cho that "the prime minister is showing extraordinary eagerness for reelection and attendance at the Naples Summit" as he is working hard on the preparations for the summit. At the end of the study meeting which lasted about one hour, the prime minister told a group of reporters: "If Japan skips the Naples Summit, it will be left behind by the international community and give the impression that its politics is in a shambles. Japan should attend the summit no matter what position it is in." In this way, the prime minister's statement can be interpreted as his eagerness to attend the Naples Summit or as his lingering attachment to it. The prime minister is taking a wait-and see position on his reelection. During a meeting with a group of reporters, one reporter told the prime minister: "Many people appear to be hoping for your reelection as prime minister." In response, the prime minister said: "I have left the question of my reelection as prime minister to the Diet." On the evening of 27 June, the prime minister returned in a happy mood to the prime minister's official residence after attending a meeting at a Tokyo restaurant. A reporter told the prime minister: "The political situation appears to be in turmoil." In response, the prime minister said: "I do not know; I know nothing. I think that I had better fall from power once. Many are moving to become prime minister out of conscious for their reputation."
