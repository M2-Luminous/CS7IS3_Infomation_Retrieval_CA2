Several political issues of great importance were deeply debated. Manuel Menendez Castellanos, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in the province, presented an in-depth briefing on the firm support being given to the Revolution by the masses in the province whom are exercising admirable selfnessness and using creative initiatives to confront the harsh conditions of the special period. Menendez spoke of the sustained progress made in the food program, although he described the progress as inadequate. He stressed the efforts being made to increase production and the recent work to ensure that cadres of the PCC, People's Government, and organizations can deftly conduct economic analyses and act with energy to reduce costs and increase productivity and production. Menendez pointed out that this strategy is essential to attain the economic efficiency that will make possible to step by step reduce state subsidies and repair domestic finances. Raul praised the efforts and work of the people of Cienfuegos, and insisted on several key points to attain goals in the farming sector, goals such as discipline, planning, and organization of the workers. This is to ensure effective work shifts of never less than eight hours a day. He also insisted on using 90 percent of the work force and fuel on the furrow irrigation, and the minimum amount of tractors to work the land, as well as to amply use ox teams in every possible phase of the agrarian process. In relation to the positive experiences of the Youth Labor Army [EJT], Raul stated that these principles are valid for state farms as well as for the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] being created [words indistinct]. In every case, the worker's income should reflect the end result of his work. The fight against crime and social indiscipline was another issue discussed. Colonel Luis Barrera, provincial representative of the Interior Ministry [Minint], briefed Raul on this issue. He described the efforts as generally favorable. However, there is need to maintain and increase vigilance and control measures, improve the Unified Vigilance and Protection System and broaden even more the people's participation in this struggle. Menendez referred to the mobilization of PCC and Union of Young Communists members and base-level bodies in the fight against crime and the effective intervention of the task action brigades in necessary cases. Raul insisted that this is a struggle of the entire people, not only the police's and the Minint's. He also stressed that every leader, from the minister to the manager of a small warehouse, must be fully responsible to preserve the people's resources under his responsibility and act accordingly. Raul added that quicker action by judicial bodies is needed to respond to the changing mode of operations by the criminals. In the company of Division Generals Leopoldo Cintra Frias and Joaquin Quintas Solas, chief of the Western and Central Armies, respectively, Raul visited a tourist facility and the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes electric plant. In the Punta Las Cuevas Hotel, manager Santiago Manzano explained to Raul that this a recently inaugurated center primarily for vanguard workers and couples on their honeymoons. Raul stressed the importance of preserving these types of services and urged its workers to maintain the quality which, despite its short time in operation, already distinguishes this hotel. At the electric plant, Raul was interested in the efforts of workers and technicians who guarantee the high degree of efficiency which characterizes this plant -- a national vanguard for 15 consecutive years. He was told that between what is produced in the enterprise and what is done in cooperation with other local entities, more than 30 percent of essential parts and components are being procured and there is the possibility of attaining up to 80 percent. Raul asked about the conditions of the workers' dining room and housing. He urged keeping in mind essential needs and warmly praised this work center. The workers asked Raul to rely a message to Castro regarding their willingness to maintain with the available resources the operation of this center due to its importance for the country in terms of energy and efficiency.
