Taiwan was the second largest foreign investor in Malaysia behind Japan, an official of the ministry's Industrial Development and Investment Center (IDIC) said. In 1993 alone, Taiwan businesses invested US$346.50 million in 86 projects in Malaysia, most involving electronics and electrical appliance manufacturing, wood processing, textiles and rubber processing. Although Taiwan investments in Singapore totaled US$562 million, most of that came from Republic of China [ROC] nationals meeting an investment prerequisite for Singapore immigration purposes, the IDIC official said. Vietnam, an up-and-coming favorite of Taiwan investors, absorbed 47 investments worth US$436.54 million from Taiwan last year. Through 1993, Taiwan was the No. 1 foreign investor in Vietnam with investments totaling more than US$1.531 billion. The investments focused on footwear manufacturing and foodstuff, building material, textiles, and wood processing industries, the official added.
