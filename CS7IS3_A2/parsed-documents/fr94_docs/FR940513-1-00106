FR940513-1-00106 FR940513-1-00022 Summer school sessions are considered to be ``outside school hours,'' i.e., nonschool weeks. Also, 14- and 15-year-olds enrolled in a State-approved, school-supervised Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may be employed for up to 23 hours in school weeks, 3 hours on school days, and during school hours. 1 1 Twelve States had Departmental approval to operate WECEP programs in the 1992&hyph;94 school-years. Child Labor Reg. 3 permits work by 14- and 15-year-olds in certain occupations in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments, and prohibits their employment in certain other work, including work prohibited by hazardous occupational orders. Pursuant to the FLSA child labor provisions, the Secretary has issued standards governing employment of minors under 18 years of age in nonagriculture occupations. The 17 nonagricultural hazardous occupations orders (HOs) now in effect are contained in 29 CFR part 570, subpart E. Prohibitions established by these HOs apply either on an industry basis, specifying the occupations in the industry that are not covered, or on an occupational basis irrespective of the industry in which performed. The current nonagricultural HOs deal with manufacturing and storing explosives (HO 1); motor-vehicle driving and outside helper (HO 2); coal mining (HO 3); logging and sawmilling (HO 4); power-driven woodworking machines (HO 5); exposure to radioactive substances (HO 6); power-driven hoisting apparatus (HO 7); power-driven metal-forming, punching, and shearing machines (HO 8); mining, other than coal mining (HO 9); slaughtering, or meat-packing, processing, or rendering (HO 10); power-driven bakery machines (HO 11); power-driven paper-products machines (HO 12); manufacturing brick, tile, and kindred products (HO 13); power-driven circular saws (HO 14); wrecking, demolition, and ship-breaking operations (HO 15); roofing operations (HO 16); and excavation operations (HO 17). Occupations in agriculture found particularly hazardous and, consequently, prohibited by the Secretary for children below the age of 16 are contained in subpart E&hyph;1 of 29 CFR part 570. Because of changes in the workplace and the introduction of new processes and technologies since the adoption of current regulatory standards, as well as changes in places where young workers find employment opportunities, the existence of differing Federal and State standards, and the divergent views on how best to correlate school and work experiences, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive review of the criteria for child labor employment, and is considering proposing revisions to Regulations, 29 CFR part 570. Accordingly, this advance notice of proposed rulemaking is being published to obtain the views of the public with respect to the matters set out below as well as to any other issues of interest under this regulation. I. Permissible Hours, Time-of-day, and Occupational Standards Under Child Labor Reg. 3 Since the regulations relating to hours, time and occupations were last amended, the Department has engaged in periodic reviews of the appropriateness of these regulations. Thus, for example, in 1982, the Department published a proposal in the Federal Register to, among other things, modify the permissible periods of work for 14- and 15-year-olds. 2 This proposal would have increased the maximum daily hours from 3 to 4 hours on a school day, and increased the maximum weekly hours of employment when school is in session from 18 to 24 hours. The proposal would have further permitted 14- and 15-year-olds to work up to 36 hours in any week when school was in session for only a portion of the week due to holidays or vacation periods. Finally, this proposal would have generally expanded the end-of-day time restriction from 7 to 9 p.m. on school days, and would have established a 10 p.m. end-of-day limit on any day during the summer months or preceding a nonschool day. The 1982 proposal generated considerable public interest and controversy. The Department subsequently suspended the proposal from further consideration, and it was not implemented as a final rule. 3 2 47 FR 31254, July 16, 1982; 47 FR 34166, August 6, 1982 (extending the comment period to January 13, 1983). 3 50 FR 17434, April 29, 1985 (DOL's Semiannual Regulatory Agenda). In August 1987, the Department established a Child Labor Advisory Committee (CLAC) 4 to provide advice and guidance in the development of possible proposals to change existing standards. In its review of hours and time of work issues, the Committee recommended that existing hours and time of work standards be retained without modification. 4 The CLAC was composed of 21 members representing employers, education, labor, child guidance professionals, civic groups, child advocacy groups, State officials, and safety groups. In the U.S. Congress, bills have been introduced in the House and Senate that include, among other things, hours and time restrictions for 14- and 15-year-old employees. Bills to reform the FLSA's child labor provisions, H.R. 1106, introduced February 24, 1993, and S. 86, introduced January 21, 1993, would allow 14- and 15-year-olds to work only for 3 hours a day and 15 hours a week, or between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. when school is in session. Under H.R. 1106, 16- and 17-year-old minors could not, for the first time, work more than 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, or before 6 a.m. or after 10 p.m. when school is in session. These hours and time restrictions for 14- and 15-year-olds are similar to the existing regulations, except that the bills set a 15 hours-per-week limit (rather than the current, regulatory 18).
