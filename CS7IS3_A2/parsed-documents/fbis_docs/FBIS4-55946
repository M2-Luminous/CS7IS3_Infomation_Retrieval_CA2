This call for coalition talks, which will be held on Saturday [28 May], actually means a refusal of the KDH offer which opened its list of candidates to politicians from small right-wing parties. Electoral polls have shown that only the KDH of the fragmented Slovak right could cross the five-per-cent barrier in the elections scheduled for September 30-October 1. The KDH has been refusing the right-wing coalition. "We shall try to form a united coalition of the right-of-the- centre parties," DS chairman Pavol Hagyari stated. He said he could not rule out that the DS-SPZ bloc would enter the elections independently, probably as one legal entity for which 5 per cent are sufficient, not seven as in case of a coalition. However, SPZ chairman Vladimir Randa called the cooperation a "pre- and post-electoral bloc of two independent parties." The Slovak right must make up its mind by the end of July when the list of candidates must be submitted.
