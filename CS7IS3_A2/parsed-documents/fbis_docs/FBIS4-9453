FBIS4-9453 "dreeu080__a94022" FBIS-EEU-94-080-A Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Temelin Builder Fined for `Breaching Regulation' Temelin Builder Fined for `Breaching Regulation' AU2504191994 Prague CTK in English 1645 GMT 25 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2504191994 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic's Nuclear Safety Office imposed a fine of 500,000 crowns (over $17.200) on the Czech Power Company (CEZ) for breaching an Office regulation concerning the nuclear power plant now under construction in Temelin, south Bohemia. Under the regulation, the assembly of the equipment at the first bloc of the Temelin project was to be halted until certain shortcomings were removed, Miroslav Kejval from the Green Party (SZ) said at a press conference today. CEZ spokesman Miroslav Novak said the fine was imposed on CEZ as early as last September in punishment [for] not removing waste from a "clean" assemblage, despite a warning from the Nuclear Safety Office. The fine was lowered to 300,000 crowns after all circumstances were clarified, he explained. The shortcomings unveiled by the Office were promptly put right and construction continued, Novak said. If the district authority in Ceske Budejovice believes a change in the automatic command system at the Temelin station to be essential, the project's construction would have to undergo new approval procedure, according to Kejval. The procedure could be initiated by the Environment Ministry, district authority or mayors of towns standing to be affected by a Temelin accident, Kejval said. The SZ, along with their colleagues from Austria and Germany, were to initiate the procedure because they viewed the above change as fundamental, he added. It is impossible to speak about any new license for the construction of the whole Temelin station, Novak stressed, saying any new approval procedure would concern only the essential changes themselves.
