A perusal of the agreement's hundreds of pages leaves no doubt as to who stands to lose and who stands to gain from the deal. Through the hundreds of lumbering, ambiguous, and petty nit-picking clauses, subclauses, addenda, and protocols, the total Israeli victory and complete Palestinian defeat are clearly visible. Minister Shulamit Aloni found the courage to mar the doves' rejoicing on the very first morning after the signing of the agreement: "Had the British written in so many restrictions, the State of Israel would not have been established," she said. It was an understatement, because (to use the same metaphor) the "British" have not left and the nation that is under occupation has, with its signature, legitimized the conqueror's continued presence. The peace camp is celebrating and the right wing is screaming, but it can safely be assumed that were Menahem Begin among us today, he would have signed the Gaza-Jericho agreement with only minor adjustments, because this agreement represents the successful implementation of the formulas Israel had proposed during the autonomy negotiations -- formulas that were rejected at that time. It is safe to assume that several veterans of the frustrating negotiations held 14 years ago attended the recent signing ceremony, and their contempt for Yasir 'Arafat stemmed not only from his televised contortions but also from the fact that the Palestinians acquiesced on some very substantive issues which the Egyptians had refused to cede. It is hard to tell what the Palestinians would have achieved had they not rejected the Camp David accords, and it is easy to understand the disappointment and rage of the territories leaders, who have realized the magnitude of their disgrace. Had the Israeli leaders not considered the phased implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] so important, they should have rushed to implement it throughout the West Bank: They will never get a better agreement in terms of safeguarding their political and economic interests. To gauge the Israeli success in implementing the 1981 autonomy plan, one should read the article Yo'el Singer published in HA'ARETZ almost two years ago (31 July 1992), over a year before the DOP was signed. Singer described at length the Israeli proposals drafted by him at the instruction of Defense Minister Ari'el Sharon and outlined what Israel wanted to achieve in terms of "withdrawal," "redeployment," "source of authority," Israeli-Palestinian distribution of powers, the definition of "settlement areas," and the evacuation of Israelis from the "self-rule authority's" jurisdiction. All these proposals were rejected by Egypt: "They maintained that the autonomy authorities should rule throughout the geographic outlines of the territories and over all the people living in them, including the Israeli settlers and settlements. The Egyptians added that an Israeli presence in the territories is illegal." Fourteen years after their introduction, the proposals have been fully implemented. According to the agreement, the "security annex," which permits free IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troop movement and the continued existence of a "military installation" and areas of "security importance," expresses the "full implementation" of the "withdrawal" and "redeployment." This wording complies with the Israeli interpretation of Security Council Resolution 242. The military government's "withdrawal" will not prevent it from exercising powers detailed in the Cairo agreement. These powers -- unbelievable as it is -- include "legislative, judicial, and executive powers and responsibilities, in accordance with international law." Thus, Gaza and Jericho continue to be under military occupation, and the Palestinians agree that the IDF's withdrawal does not nullify its status as sovereign and does not even restrict this status to the settlement areas. The Palestinians even agree that the entire complex system of military government orders, extralegal [last word published in English] arrangements, and extraterritorial legislation by the Israeli Knesset, which annexed the settlements and converted them and their inhabitants into an integral part of the Israeli system, will remain intact. The existing legal framework, therefore, will remain in force, except for powers "to promulgate legislation, including basic laws, laws, regulations, and other legislative acts," which have been transferred to the Palestinian authority, as long as those actions are acceptable to Israel, because if they are not, it has the right to annul them via a venerable body of judges, which will be authorized to approve the legislative acts only if they do "not seriously threaten other significant Israeli interests protected under this (Gaza-Jericho) agreement." Only in one area is there no restriction on the Palestinians' authority: their responsibility for all the commitments and all the actions and slipups that took place prior to the transfer of powers. Israel will cease to bear financial responsibility for its acts and omissions during the years of occupation, and any claims against it will be sent to the Palestinian authority. Add to that the economic appendix, which leaves Israel in a dominant position, and Israel's ability to execute physical changes and unilaterally determine arrangements within the territory it holds, which will have a decisive impact on the two small enclaves, and the conclusion becomes absolutely clear: The Cairo agreement does not contain anything to prevent its adoption by all the political camps -- coalition and opposition alike. All the glittering props -- uniforms, flags, passports, and stamps -- which irritated the right wing so much, cannot hide the fact that "Gaza and Jericho First" serves to legitimize the continuation of the status quo in its basic outlines. It is difficult to say why Yasir 'Arafat gave in to all the Israeli demands. Was it due to his weakness, a lack of staff work, the purge of the "local" leaders who understand the situation, or does 'Arafat view the entire agreement with disdain and believe that reality will ground this entire legal set up? After all, all colonial occupation forces withdrew from the territories under their rule only after signing detailed agreements with the national liberation movements. But the agreements between the Americans and the Vietnamese, between the French and the Algerians, turned into nothing more than a dead letter because, from the start, they were merely meant to save face. That might turn out to be the situation here as well, but that optimistic forecast cannot deny the irony: The late Menahem Begin's autonomy plan will be implemented by a dovish peace government.
