While I am filing this report, the two delegations and their hosts are holding talks. A document has also been drafted on the founding of high-level committees which, between 4 and 15 March, most probably in Vienna, will analyze, prepare, and formulate a draft constitution for Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as a preliminary agreement between Croatia and the federation, an agreement on military arrangements within the federation, and on interim measures and government bodies. The committee will coordinate the implementation of the outline agreement on the federation. A document on protection of human rights has also been drafted, containing reference to a series of conventions and declarations on protection of human rights, minorities etc. Foreign Minister Granic was received in Washington this morning by U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The talks were also attended by Ambassadors Redman, Sarcevic, and Galbraith. The Muslim-Croat agreement and possible solutions for the crisis in the Balkans were discussed. Both sides want, in principle, to reach an agreement. The solution is to be found at a diplomatic level in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gore said. An outline has already been provided by NATO and the United Nations, whose decisions we have to implement, the U.S. vice president told reporters. He added that NATO and UN decisions have improved chances of success in the diplomatic field. It has been demonstrated that this yields success, Al Gore said. We will try today to sign the preliminary agreement on a federation between the Croats and Muslims and on a confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and Croatia, Granic told reporters at the White House. We are now in the final stage of the negotiations and let us wait and see what happens, Granic said. Al Gore spoke about U.S. aid to Croatia in the following spheres: Help will be provided in the peaceful reintegration of UN protected areas; some commentators have been talking about credits to the tune of $500 million. The Partnership for Peace has also been mentioned. International financial institutions will approach Croatia once the agreement is signed, which is expected to be done on 15 March at top level, and then endorsed by the Croatian Assembly.
