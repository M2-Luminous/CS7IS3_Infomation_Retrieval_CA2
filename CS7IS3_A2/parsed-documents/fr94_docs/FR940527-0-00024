FR940527-0-00024 FR940527-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;14] Amendment of Class D Airspace; Walla Walla, WA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the Walla Walla, Washington, Class D airspace from full-time to part-time. It will correct that part of the airspace description which was inadvertently omitted during the airspace reclassification process. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zones'' with operating control towers, replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' This amendment brings publications up-to-date giving continuous information to the aviation public. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 U.T.C., August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Riley, ANM&hyph;537, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;14, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; telephone number: (206) 227&hyph;2537. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 21, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending the Walla Walla, Washington, airspace designation (59 FR 13262). Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. During the airspace reclassification process (57 FR 38962; August 27, 1992) the language designating the Class D airspace as part time was inadvertently omitted. This action corrects that omission. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone'' with operating control towers, and replaced them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule The amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Walla Walla, Washington. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
