The propaganda section of the Guangdong party committee told organisers of a Guangzhou trade show which had invited foreign reporters to take part in its opening ceremony on June 4 that reporters would not be allowed to come until June 6. "They say this is too sensitive a time," Chen Guanghui of the Guangdong environmental protection bureau, the organiser of Environment China '94, said. Confirming the ban on foreign journalists, an official at the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency (Xinhua) said the organisers should have checked with the Guangdong party committee before issuing invitations for the ceremony. "They should have been more aware of the situation," the official said. The Guangdong environmentalists appear to have been caught unaware by the sensitive anniversary. The opening ceremony -- scheduled for the morning of June 4 -- has suffered from withdrawals from at least two foreign government officials so far, Chen confirmed. The Environment Minister of the Canadian province of Alberta, Brian Evans, and the Australian consul-general in Guangzhou, Maurine Chong, have both bailed out of the opening ceremony after previously agreeing to attend. Spokesmen for the two officials said they had other matters to handle which came up unexpectedly. Chen said that numerous senior officials from Beijing, including the director of the National Environmental Protection Bureau, Xie Zhenhua, have also cancelled plans to attend the exhibition's opening ceremony. Beijing is known to have placed a ban on travel by senior officials during the period so they will be at their posts to deal with any outbreaks of protests. Travellers worldwide have reported difficulties recently in getting individual travel visas, apparently part of China's attempts to avoid an influx of journalists and overseas-based dissidents into the country during the sensitive period.
