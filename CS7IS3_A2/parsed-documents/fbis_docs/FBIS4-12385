He stressed the need to strengthen ties between Lebanon and Spain. He emphasized his country's commitment to the peace process in the Middle East. He hoped that the process that was launched from Madrid will continue. He said that discussion of the peace process is one of the goals of his visit to Lebanon. He noted Spanish-Lebanese understanding about reaching a fair solution to the Middle East problem. He pointed out that Minister Buwayz broached several points and Spain supports Lebanon's position on the peace negotiations, particularly implementation of Security Council Resolution 425. On the conditions required to make the peace process successful, Solana said: There is a working framework for negotiations on all tracks. In my view, the Palestinian track has achieved success and this result will appear in the next few days, which is mine and everyone's wish. I support what Minister Buwayz said, that the time factor is important for the progress of the negotiations. He said that any slowdown in the talks would not be in the interest of moderation or the parties concerned, but would open the way for extremists to obstruct the peace process in the Middle East. He said: Spain and Lebanon support the establishment of peace in the near future and we will defend this position.
