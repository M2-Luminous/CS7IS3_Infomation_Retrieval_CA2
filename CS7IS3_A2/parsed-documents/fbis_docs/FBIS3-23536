Special attention was devoted to the "small-arms" section presented by Russia. Besides similar models, you mentioned the "Gyurza" 9-mm pistol set. Could you discuss this weapon in more detail? Aleksandr Vlasov Krasnodar Despite the modest dimensions and limited combat significance of this type of weapon, the history of the pistol is the history of the dramatic struggle of a designer's idea and the capabilities of the technology. Frankly speaking, until recently there hasn't been an ideal pistol in the world. There were simply successful and popular models: the Browning, the Mauser, the Colt, the TT [Tokarev Tula pistol]... But, based upon the big picture, they remained a weak weapon of destruction. Small weapons are acquiring force only right now. The pistol that we are discussing today is actually a powerful weapon that meets very high combat requirements. They named it "Gyurza" [Persian -- gurza -- a type of poisonous snake], probably because there is little chance of pulling through after a "bite". As Mauser the younger once said, Inventor and State Prize Laureate Petr Serdyukov, in cooperation with Aleksey Yuryev (the cartridge designer), managed to accommodate so much death and force in the space called "Gyurza" that the pistol can legitimately be considered to be one of the best, if not the best, in its class. But let's let the technical specifications speak for themselves. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tactical-Technical Specifications of the "Gyurza" Pistol Set | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Length, mm |195 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Height, mm |145 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Thickness, mm |30 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight without cartridges, grams |995 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Capacity of the magazines |2 X 18 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Caliber, mm |9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bullet muzzle velocity, m/s |420 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Combat rate of fire, cartridges per m-|up to 40 | |inute | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- One of the main specifications is effective firing range. For "Gyurza", it is 100 meters (as we know, the PM [9 mm pistol designed by Makarov] has a range of 25 meters). It is from this distance that the pistol permits us to destroy an enemy who is protected by a helmet. At a range of up to 70 meters, "Gyurza's" bullet pierces a flak jacket (two titanium plates 1.2 mm thick each and 30 layers of Kevlar). No other pistol is capable of doing that today. "Gyurza" is equipped with two automatic safeties which is an innovation. One is located on the trigger (a pin that depresses when squeezed) and the other is on the handle. The safeties are turned off when the pistol is grasped properly by a hand, thereby excluding the possibility of delays when opening fire that are characteristic for a standard pistol and which are associated with a forward safety in the fighting position, or the possibility of the pistol becoming stuck in the holster, caught on clothing, etc. The new pistol permits you to conduct fire when the hammer is placed in the fully cocked platoon. There is a horn, a bend in the trigger guard, or, as they call it here, a support for the other hand. That is also an innovation that facilitates firing the powerful pistol. However, experience has shown that firing the "Gyurza" one-handed is also adequately effective. A pistol shooter with a medium level of training hits a full-length target no less than 16 of 18 possible times at a range of 100 meters. It remains to be added that the pistol was developed at the Central NII of Precision Machinebuilding and is entering the inventory of MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] special subunits.
