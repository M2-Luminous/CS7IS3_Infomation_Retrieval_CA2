[passage omitted] Currently, we have a valid Constitution adopted in a national referendum, and its Article 55 states that the Seimas [parliament] term in office is four years. True, the Constitution specifies several cases when early Seimas elections can be held. This could happen if three-fifths of the legislature could no longer work together, or if three principal governing institutions -- the Seimas, the government, and the president -- could not agree among themselves. We have neither case today. Cooperation among all of these institutions is quite good. Their conflicts, if any, could be resolved by the Constitutional Court. Thus, there are no reasons for holding early elections today. There is nothing except a great and almost sickly desire of the losers to take their revenge and return to power. [passage omitted] What is the purpose of this goal? Is there a desire to assist the country at this difficult moment with ideas and constructive proposals on how to continue reform? Do the nationalists and other political parties seeking early elections have any great ideas that could lead the state out of a crisis? Might these parties have many candidates for ministers, prime ministers, and government officials? However, Lithuanians already saw their "skills" and assessed them in the 1992 Seimas elections. Have these political forces evaluated their mistakes and changed their principles and values within a year? It seems that they have not! They are continuing to incite people, increase tension, look for their own people, and so on. It is obvious that these parties are not rich in intellect. Why is it necessary to destabilize the situation in the country again? Maybe, they want our potential economic and political foreign partners to begin to assess our situation as unstable. These reasons might force them to hesitate and refrain from large investments. Do not the goals of certain political forces coincide with the aims of those "foreign political forces" which are against Lithuania's independence? The fact that it is these forces who often take care of our country's independence by means of words does not mean that these words conform with their deeds. If the Lithuanian people approved a four-year term in office for the Seimas by voting for the Constitution in a referendum, this is a law that must be observed by all political forces. New elections will be held in four years (by the way, only three years are left), while now oppositional parties have enough time to prepare themselves for the next elections and to work constructively for Lithuania's benefit, if they seek this not just by means of words. I can comfort those who are so fond of elections. After the adoption of the law on self-governments, Lithuania will hold elections almost every year: One year we will elect the president, another year -- the Seimas, and every two years -- self-governments. Thus, we will be able to exercise in politics each year, and all parties will have work up to their eyes. It is very important both to constituents and to political parties to preserve such regularity. Voters will be able to assess more seriously different parties, their people, and "teams" that would form the government, and so on. Therefore, the voters' choice will be less influenced by various coincidences. Parties will be forced to prepare themselves with greater care, particularly when selecting their people. In general, politics will become professional. [passage omitted] "Thinking objectively," claims political scientist A. Krupavicius, "there are no arguments for early Seimas elections today." Then why has this statement been exploited practically... since the first round of the 1992 Seimas elections? A. Krupavicius believes that the opposition must "accustom constituents to the thought of early elections," and not only to this. Oppositional parties must sustain the "militant" spirit among their members and supporters, and encourage themselves continuously that the new elections will be held soon.... Such tactics allow opposition leaders to keep silent before their party members concerning the reasons for defeat in the former elections. In normal democratic countries, leaders of defeated parties usually resign with honor. We have the opposite situation -- they have not only refused to resign but have also raised themselves above others again or promoted themselves. Only V. Radzvilas, former leader of the liberals, is a pleasant exception here. The third reason is that constant talk about early Seimas elections is a peculiar form of pressure. For example, some worker who sees the negative developments in his collective may get frightened, or some higher or lower local official, incapable of solving human problems or unwilling to do so, may explain that "elections are not far off, our people will come, and so on...."
