Popov under the rubric "For High Combat Readiness": "Joint Strike"] [Text] The economic crisis in our society cannot help but be reflected in the everyday activities of the army. We will be honest--the state of affairs in the ranks frequently reaches catastrophic in virtually all regions. The unsatisfactory logistical support is having a marked effect on the course of combat training for the air units in the Far East Military District as well, and naturally not in a positive sense. Many of the aviation commanders in the local areas thus have to rack their brains searching for ways out of the situation. They do find them, you know. By way of example, flight shifts have begun to be planned with the finely tuned orientation of each flight toward the comprehensive resolution of basic tasks of combat training, so as not to permit any further reductions in the professional qualifications of the pilots. The efficient use of simulators in particular is contributing to the cause of conserving material resources. People, that is to say, are not sitting with their arms folded waiting for suggestions from above, but are rather seeking out reserves themselves. But they understand that the maintenance of skills in the techniques of piloting alone is clearly insufficient to improve tactical flight proficiency--the principal aim of the martial labors of the aerial warriors. This circumstance has obviously also prompted the officers of the detached air-assault air regiment to try and find non-standard solutions for these problems. There have been lots of proposals, but the most realizable--and ingeniously simple--one came from Deputy Commander Military Pilot 1st Class Lieutenant-Colonel V. Yeshmyakov. Its essence consists of the following: to perform the tasks of tactical flight exercises [LTU] in conjunction with our neighbors, helicopter pilots, taking into account experience in the interaction of Su-25 aircraft and rotary-winged craft during the combat operations in Afghanistan. Valeriy's idea was then supported by everyone. The first results of the flights organized in the new fashion have confirmed its vitality. The LTU I wish to talk about became the logical continuation. No, we were not able to accomplish everything planned right away. The fact is that, as with everything new, Yeshmyakov's idea required a considered approach and precise calculations in order to see that the undertaking itself was not discredited, and to prove its right to life. The first difficulties arose as early as in the stage of preparing for the LTU. That is understandable--there was nowhere to turn for experience or official documents for performing such exercises. The flight-control officers of the helicopter and attack-aircraft air regiments had to be trailblazers here. And they managed to do so, efficiently putting forth methodological recommendations, elaborations of variations for joint actions and calculations for the efficient application of forces. This was facilitated by the fact that many of them had completed the harsh schooling of Afghanistan. What did they use as the basis of the calculations? First and foremost, the conclusions of military scholars, both domestic and foreign, seeking to prove the effectiveness of close interaction among diverse aviation forces. The capabilities of the Mi-24 crews to detect, identify and destroy armored targets on the battlefield, by way of comparison, are several times greater than the analogous ones for the Su-25 crews. The latter, however, are able to overcome the resistance of enemy PVO [air defenses] more successfully. It is thus not surprising that the results of modeling their joints operations showed that they are 1.6--2.1 times more effective than autonomous operations, while the losses of the one and the other were reduced by 30--50 percent. The required helicopter and attack-aircraft forces were 20--30 percent lower in that case accordingly. These data were also used to develop the plans for the impending exercises, namely the distribution of forces for the accomplishment of combat-training tasks. Comprehensive group exercises on LTU topics were devoted to clarifying them. All of the training had to be conducted on the ground, using simulator systems to the fullest extent, for understandable reasons. The pilots of both regiments realized very well how difficult the tasks facing them would be to accomplish, and were thus thoroughly prepared. The IAS [aviation engineering service] specialists had their own concerns. Each technician experienced for himself that the less his aircraft flies, the greater the attention that must be devoted to it in servicing. The personnel, for all that, prepared the aircraft for the exercises very well. The standouts included aviation technical detachment commander Major G. Makukh, armaments engineer Captain V. Golub and servicing group chief Captain A. Nefedov. Proper credit must also be given here to the specialists of the support services--Senior Sergeant A. Gusarov and Sergeants Ye. Stetsyuk and I. Khalilov, among others. The military collective of the air garrison, that is, was working at a uniform rhythm, united for a common aim--to achieve success. The first to go up were helicopter pilots of the group commanded by Major N. Vasilyev. Understanding very well that the operations of the rest depended on the results of their work, each of the reconnaissance crews was in a combat frame of mind. Reaching the assigned area in concealed fashion, they carried out the search, transmitted the coordinates of targets detected, and identified and even designated the targets in the next pass. The attack aircraft appeared behind them on the practice range. Leader Major A. Sirotin did not miss the opportunity to confirm his reputation as a leader; making use of all of the might of his on-board weaponry, he suppressed the fire of the "enemy" air defenses on the move. The wingmen supported the initiatives of the squadron commanders. A group of Mi-24 helicopters rushed into the "overflight corridor" that had been formed. Could the helicopter pilots really let down their commander, Major A. Sobolev, with the LTU were being held on the eve of his birthday?! They deluged the tank targets with a sea of fire and smoke from the rockets on the first pass. Then the attack aircraft were back in the sky. While excellent work on the practice range was the rule for Major S. Salnikov, Captains Yu. Zabudko and S. Esse--who had recently obtained their 1st class ratings--were pretty anxious before the sortie. But for no reason at all, judging by the results. Participation in the ground attack was for them yet another opportunity to verify for themselves their mastery under conditions that were as close to combat conditions as possible. It is in just such a climate that you understand that common victory in a military action takes shape from the individual achievements of each soldier. That is how the successes of Captain I. Abdullayev's flight can be explained--there were two destroyed "enemy" artillery emplacements on the scorecard of his pilots in one pass. Such is the style of the new masters of weapons delivery. They were entrusted with putting the period to the end of the LTU. And they did not disappoint. The tactical flight exercises are behind us now. I would say right off, first of all, that the work of the fliers on the practice range was assessed as excellent by the evaluators, and their smooth interaction in the air was noted in particular. The joint strike justified itself in every way--virtually all of the targets were destroyed, the evaluation of the system of command and control of the crews in the air was conducted successfully, and a high level of organization of aerial reconnaissance and search-and-rescue support was achieved. The hypothetical losses of the crews proved to be minimal as well. Second, a considerable economy of fuel and ammunition was also achieved in the LTU through the joint performance of analogous tasks using a reduced complement (on both sides). But the aviators have not forgotten the results, and they have drawn conclusions and lessons for tomorrow. It also makes sense for others to think some about what can be undertaken--even on the scale of a single regiment--if one does not wait for something to turn up, and works creatively instead. And all that is because--and this is third--the people, yearning for the true business, finally found faith in themselves and felt the taste of victory. That is the moral achievement of a cohesive collective--the gaining of hope. When this material had already been prepared for publication, I called Khabarovsk. It became clear from my conversation with a senior air officer that the policy of developing command independence, creativity in the accomplishment of combat-training tasks and the rejection of stereotypes among the attack-aircraft and helicopter pilots at garrison X was unchanged.
