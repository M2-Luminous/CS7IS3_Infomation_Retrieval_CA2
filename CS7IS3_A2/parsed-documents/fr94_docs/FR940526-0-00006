ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The purpose of this final rule is to codify the national marketing quotas and price support levels for the 1994 crops for several kinds of tobacco announced by press release on March 1, 1994. In accordance with the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (the 1938 Act), as amended, the Secretary determined the 1994 marketing quotas to be as follows: Fire-cured (type 21), 2.150 million pounds; fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23), 40.4 million pounds; dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36), 10.6 million pounds; Virginia sun-cured (type 37), 131,000 pounds; cigar-filler and binder (types 42&hyph;44 and 53&hyph;55), 9.3 million pounds; and cigar-filler (type 46), zero pounds. This rule is necessary to adjust the production levels of these kinds of tobacco to more fully reflect supply and demand conditions. In accordance with the Agricultural Act of 1949 (the 1949 Act), as amended, the Secretary determined the 1994 levels of support to be as follows (in cents per pound): Fire-cured (type 21), 140.7; fire-cured (types 22&hyph;23), 148.3; dark air-cured (types 35&hyph;36), 127.3; Virginia sun-cured (type 37), 124.5; cigar-filler and binder (types 42&hyph;44 and 53&hyph;55), 108.4; and cigar-filler (type 46), 84.4.
