FR940913-0-00032 FR940913-0-00009 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;22&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9023; AD 94&hyph;19&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives; Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters. This action requires initial and repetitive inspections of the swashplate for cracks in the swashplate support assembly fillet radius area and replacement, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracks found in the swashplate support assembly fillet radius area near the base. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the swashplate support assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Effective on September 28, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 28, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before October 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;22&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., P.O. Box 482, Fort Worth, Texas 76101. This information may be examined at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Richard Monschke, Aviation Safety Engineer, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate, ASW&hyph;170, Fort Worth, Texas 76193&hyph;0170, telephone (817) 222&hyph;5177, fax (817) 222&hyph;5959. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. (BHTI) Model 206A, 206A&hyph;1, 206B, 206B&hyph;1, 206L, 206L&hyph;1, and 206L&hyph;3 series helicopters, equipped with swashplate support assembly, part number (P/N) 206&hyph;010&hyph;452&hyph;001, &hyph;005, or &hyph;109. BHTI has received three reports of swashplate support assemblies with cracks in the fillet radius area near the base. The cracks originated on the aft section of the swashplate support assembly. The total time-in-service (TIS) on each of the reported swashplate support assemblies exceeded 1,500 hours. The swashplate support assembly is a critical, non-rotating, rotor system component that supports the rotating swashplate. Through the swashplate support assembly and subsequently the swashplate, the pilot control movements that are necessary to maintain rotorcraft control are transferred to the main rotor system. Therefore, a crack in a swashplate support assembly creates an unsafe condition. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the swashplate support assembly, loss of control of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. The FAA has reviewed and approved Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Alert Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74, Revision B, and 206L&hyph;93&hyph;89, Revision B, both dated April 4, 1994, which describe procedures for an initial visual inspection for cracks within the next 25 hours TIS using a 10-power magnifying glass, and thereafter, repetitive visual inspections for cracks at intervals not to exceed 50 hours TIS from the last inspection. The inspections are for swashplate support assemblies that have more than 1,500 hours TIS. If a crack is suspected, the Alert Service Bulletins provide for a dye penetrant inspection. If a crack is found, the applicable Alert Service Bulletin specifies replacement of the swashplate support assembly with an airworthy swashplate support assembly prior to the next flight. Neither BHTI Alert Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74, Revision B, nor 206L&hyph;93&hyph;89, Revision B, both dated April 4, 1994, shows the Model 206A&hyph;1 as being an affected model helicopter. However, this model helicopter uses the same swashplate support assembly as the Model 206A helicopter. Therefore, for purposes of this AD, Alert Service Bulletin No. 206&hyph;93&hyph;74, Revision B, dated April 4, 1994, will also apply to the Model 206A&hyph;1 helicopter.
