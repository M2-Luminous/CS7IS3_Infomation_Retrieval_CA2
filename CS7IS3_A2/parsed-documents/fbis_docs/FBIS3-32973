The Senate unanimously approved the decision made in the morning by the members of the Appointments Committee, chaired by Justicialist Party Senator Deolindo Bittel. The Appointments Committee passed judgment on the proposals submitted by the executive branch. The committee rejected an objection to the Lopez record that was formally raised by trustees of a faction of the National Railway Union. The objection alleged that when Lopez served as a judge of the labor court, he passed a biased judgment, favoring [National Railway Union leader] Jose Pedraza in an electoral conflict in his labor union. The new justices will replace Rodolfo Barra and Mariano Cavagna Martinez, who resigned their posts in the Supreme Court in order to meet the terms established in a pact between President Carlos Menem and [Radical Civic Union president] Raul Alfonsin on constitutional reform. During the session, the Senate also approved the promotion of Army Colonel Enrique Alberto Grazzini. [passage omitted]
