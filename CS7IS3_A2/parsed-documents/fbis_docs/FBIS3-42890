Besides Baburin's ROS [Russian National Union] and Zyuganov's Communist Party, even Nikolay Lysenko's National-Republican Party is getting ready for 12 December. Although if I were personally asked just a month ago to name the principal fascists of Russia, without stopping to think, I would have named: Lysenko. And only then: Barkashov. But the leader of one of the most radical groups of Russian nationalists is able to sniff the wind in order not to break his neck in the example of his less pragmatic double--the leader Barkashov of the defeated Russian National Unity. Both of them came from Vasilyev's Pamyat. Both of them aspire to the role of savior of the Russian nation. The first thing each of them did was to muster troops for themselves--according to their own calculations, 500 militants each. Thus, why does the leader of the NRPR [National-Republican Party of Russia] call the leader of the RNYe [Russian National Unity] his exact opposite? "Indeed, Lysenko is a Russian nationalist, a person with ultranationalistic views. But this ultra does not shout `Sieg Heil,' rather the opposite, and he categorically rejects those who shout `Sieg Heil'--this is the way Nikolay Lysenko sees himself. [no close quotes as published] Barkashov, in Lysenko's words, "obviously lived in some kind of unreal world, a world of illusions." After all, it is impossible in the final analysis to wear a swastika on one's sleeve and throw up one's hand in a Nazi greeting while living in a country that still remembers the 30 million who died in the war with German Nazism and simultaneously count on popular success among the public. The sensitive leader of the NRPR is another matter. A year earlier Lysenko had already made a clever move. The president had scarcely attempted timidly to stop the formation of militarized structures under political organizations with an edict when Lysenko formally detached from the party the Russian National Legion that had gained fame in the Ossetia battles and in Pridnestrovye. (However, the president's salvo then, in contrast to October of this year, proved to be a dud.) The evacuation this summer of the NRPR from the FNS [National Salvation Front] "with the absolutely wild positions of the communist organizations," as it later became clear, also became a prudent step for Lysenko. (In revenge, the red Sovraska [SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA] insulted the nationalist, accusing him in his appeals of "Russian-Jewish unity.") The NRPR leader also "realistically assessed the situation" in the first days of October of this year. He not only did not rush to defend the White House, as was done by the romantic Barkashov, but even refrained from any kind of commentary on those events. Yeltsin, of course, "crudely violated" the Constitution, Lysenko would say later, but it was a "sovok"-type, and deserved it: "I foresaw that Rutskoy and Khasbulatov would lose." It is simply that the leader of the national-republicans needed the elections in order finally to get out to the people, albeit over the corpses of former allies who had perished. Who could expect that the competing Communists would be given free rein. "If I were in Yeltsin's shoes, I would not allow the participation of the Communist organizations in the upcoming elections," Lysenko admitted to a MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent. The national-republicans were also compelled to be a little concerned about Mikhail Astafyev's Constitutional Democratic Party, whose voting list was rather inopportunely headed by the well-known fighter against Russophobia, Igor Shafarevich, and "iron Shurik" Nevzorov. It is they who will accurately gather up the entire patriotically concerned electorate. But the most devastating blow to the Lysenko followers was delivered by Yuriy Luzhkov, our respected mayor, who declared war in the capital on the uninvited guests from the south. But, after all, the promise to "severely punish" the "southern occupiers" is the keystone of the NRPR election program, whose implementation (with general approval, which is sad) Luzhkov has already practically started. "I understand very well that this is a demagogic move just before the elections," says Lysenko, "but I do not doubt that Luzhkov is the pioneer in this matter." So, who will continue these beginnings? The elections will determine this. The Lysenko group has little possibility of surmounting even the 5 percent barrier. And probably all that will remain will be to take off the tattered sheepskin and say in one's natural tongue: "Sieg Heil!"
