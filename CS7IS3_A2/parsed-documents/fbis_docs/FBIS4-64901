FDP General Secretary Werner Hoyer told the press in Bonn on Monday [9 May] that not even the "intervention" of the president of the Constitutional Court during the weekend had altered the demands of the liberals concerning the possibility of dual citizenship. In press interviews, Herzog had said that foreigners who do not wish to take German citizenship should go back to their countries of origin. The FDP acknowledged Herzog's stance, said Hoyer. However, he continued, the FDP wonders whether it is a good thing for the Union's presidential candidate to give so many press and television interviews. Hoyer said that the FDP leadership fails to understand why Herzog should once again remind it that the Union has left the liberals in the lurch on the subject of dual citizenship. It would have been better if Herzog, who needs the FDP's votes for his election, had kept quiet. However, the FDP leadership considers it in its interests to back Herzog instead of Johannes Rau for the office of president. Hoyer was speaking during a presentation of the FDP election program, due to be adopted at the FDP congress in Rostock at the beginning of June. The FDP Presidium's draft resolution presents the FDP as a "party of better wage-earners." "We are the party of the producers and higher wage-earners of today and tomorrow, and we want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to become better wage-earners," says the resolution. However, the FDP does not wish to repeat the Social Democratic Party of Germany's "ghastly mistake" of attempting to define a borderline between "better" and "worse" wage-earners, said Hoyer. The FDP is also interested in people who have decided to become better wage-earners through greater productivity. Performance must once again be profitable, said Hoyer, a principle that the FDP wants to implement with its "civic benefit" concept, which is geared to the poverty line. Whoever earns wages above the poverty line should pay tax; whoever earns wages below the poverty line should receive this "civic benefit," which includes such social payments as child benefit, educational grants, family income supplement, and unemployment benefit. But only a part of one's income should be taken into account in this system, so that "it is profitable to work." After two years of work, the FDP draft election program lays down the FDP's stance on all spheres of politics. It mentions the creation of new jobs, the internal unification of Germany, and the assumption of political coresponsibility as some of the most important objectives during the next parliamentary term of office. The FDP wants to create new jobs by easing the tax burden, among other things. The new laender should receive tax concessions whereby products by east German manufacturers might carry a lower rate of value-added tax. The FDP election program should again provide the basis for coalition talks with the Union, if the voters permit the coalition to continue, said Hoyer. The FDP's demands include a review of the solidarity tax surcharge after three years, the liberalization of store opening hours, a five-year time limit on subsidies, the abolition of car tax by raising gasoline tax, and the gradual abolition of commercial tax. A so-called major offensive to combat organized crime has been rejected in keeping with FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel's position.
