Uruguay, which is at present considered free from foot-and-mouth disease, with vaccination, enters this new stage amid pressures and criticism from several sectors involved, but with the firm decision of producers, who together with ministerial authorities agreed that 15 June will be the last day for vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease in our territory. There is no going back now. Agriculture and Fishing Minister Pedro Saravia will communicate this significant decision at the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) annual assembly, which is to be held in Paris on 16 May. [passage omitted] Trade benefits undoubtedly played a central role in making such an important decision. It should be remembered that the government has announced that once the country enters the disease-free circuit, it will sell 20,000 tonnes of beef to the United States as part of a quota upon which no tariffs are levied. [passage omitted] Uruguay has been free of foot-and-mouth disease for 46 months. No focal points have been reported since January 1991, and authorities have reported that no viral activity has been spotted within 300 km of our border. [passage omitted]
