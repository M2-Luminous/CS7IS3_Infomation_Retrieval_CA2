The new group named "Shin-Ryokufu-Kai," or "New" Ryokufu-Kai, is the third largest parliamentary group in the upper house after the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest party in the ruling coalition. A 27-member upper house alliance of the Japan New Party (JNP), Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the Democratic Reform Party (DRP) got together with an 11-member group comprising the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and the Sports Peace Party. Eiji Suzuki, a member of the 11-member group, did not join the new team and became independent, the members said. The new alliance will hold all-member discussions every week, they said. However, the group will not bind members by its decisions, said Kanpei Matsuo of Shinseito who heads the alliance. He said the team was named after "Ryokufu-Kai," a defunct powerful upper house group of independent legislators which existed shortly after the end of World War II. The new group will ask upper house SDP and Komeito members to join in, with a view to supporting the coalition government, the members said. In the 252-seat upper house, the LDP now has 95 seats, the SDP 71, Shin-Ryokufu-Kai 37, Komeito 24, the Japanese Communist Party 11, the Niin Club five and independents nine.
