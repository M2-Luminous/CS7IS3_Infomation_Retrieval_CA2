Role of Animal Models Determining the risk posed to human health from chemicals requires information about the potential toxicological hazards and the expected levels of exposure. Some toxicological data can be derived directly from humans. Sources of such information include accidental exposures to industrial chemicals, cases of food-related poisoning, epidemiological studies, as well as clinical investigations. While human data are available from clinical trials for therapeutics and they provide the most direct means of determining effects of potentially toxic substances, for other categories of substances, it is generally difficult, expensive, and, in some cases, unethical to develop this type of information. Quite often, the nature and extent of available human toxicological data are too incomplete to serve as the basis for an adequate assessment of potential health hazards. Furthermore, for a majority of chemical substances human toxicological data are simply not available. Consequently, for most toxicological assessments it is necessary to rely on information derived from animal models, usually rats or mice. One of the primary functions of animal studies is to predict human toxicity prior to human exposure. In some cases, species phylogenetically more similar to human, such as monkeys or baboons, are used in neurotoxicological studies. Biologically, animals resemble humans in many ways and can serve as adequate models for toxicity studies (Russell, 1991). This is particularly true with regard to the assessment of adverse effects to the nervous system, whereby animal models provide a variety of useful information that helps minimize exposure of humans to the risk of neurotoxicity. There are many approaches to testing for neurotoxicity, including whole animal (in vivo) testing and tissue/cell culture (in vitro) testing. At present, in vivo animal studies currently serve as the principal approach to detect and characterize neurotoxic hazard and to help identify factors affecting susceptibility to neurotoxicity. Data from animal studies are used to supplement or clarify limited information obtained from clinical or epidemiological studies in humans, as well as provide specific types of information not readily obtainable from humans due to ethical considerations. Frequently, results from animal studies are used to guide the design of toxicological studies in humans. In vitro tests have been proposed as a means of complementing whole animal tests, which could ultimately reduce the number of animals used in routine toxicity testing. It also has been proposed that in vitro testing, when properly developed, may be less time-consuming and more cost-effective than in vivo assessments (Goldberg and Frazier, 1989; Atterwill and Walum, 1989). By understanding the biological structures or functions affected by toxic substances in vitro, it also may be possible to predict neurotoxicological effects in the whole animal. An added advantage of in vitro testing is the growing availability of human cell lines that could be used for directly assessing potential neurotoxic effects on human tissue. The currently available strategies for in vitro testing have certain limitations, including the inability to model neurobehavioral effects such as loss of memory or sensory dysfunction or to evaluate effectively the influence of organ system interactions (e.g., neuronal, endocrinological, and immunological) on the development and expression of neurotoxicity.
