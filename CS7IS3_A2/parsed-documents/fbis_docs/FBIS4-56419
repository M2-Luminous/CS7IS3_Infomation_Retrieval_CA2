This is where Desire (Desi) Delano Bouterse (48), who until 31 January of 1993 was the Army commander, spends a lot of time. The greeting is a bit stiff. This is a different Bouterse from the one at a meeting four years ago at the Het Park club in Fort Zeelandia, which at that time was the military headquarters which had a strong hand in Suriname's affairs of state. Back then he was a colonel, starched in his faultless uniform; now he is a country dweller in boots, shorts, and T-shirt. He has put on some weight. Bouterse, the current leader of the National Democratic Party (NDP), sits down on a crude wooden bench underneath a tree. [passage omitted] [ELSEVIER] Are things not going well with the Army? [Bouterse] An army is a part of the community. At this time, the Surinamese community is showing all the signs of chaos. As the Army is a part of the unity, it too is showing the signs. In addition, it is being systematically cut back and stripped. Gorre is not in a good enough position to offer any resistance to this. For this reason, there is grumbling among military men. [ELSEVIER] Would you happen to know any people who would be better in the post of Army leader? [Bouterse] Ceder would be good. I am also thinking of Boerenveen, Christopher, and Slijngaard (Bouterse gives some names of high-ranking officers, all of whom have advisory staff functions in the entourage of President Venetiaan or Defense Minister Gilds). I hope that my naming these people will not have any consequences for them. [ELSEVIER] Is the Army still in a position to carry out a coup? [Bouterse] (Laughing) I do not think so. And I do not hope so, either. We have had a certain amount of developments in Suriname: two Army coups. I think that this was quite enough for the safe transformation of the young Republic. It has had its historic meaning. In the end, the political work must be left up to the politicians. We had already implemented this evolution. Now, the Army is being rapidly detached from politics, although here in Suriname each political party is still trying to have an influence on the Army. [passage omitted] [ELSEVIER] How are things going with the NDP? Is it right to say that you would be prepared to cooperate with others in order to come up with a national approach? [Bouterse] We definitely need that. There is a difference between podium talk and your responsibility. Our country is in a very serious situation and is going through a bad time. Economically, there is a wide open, chaotic situation. With every passing day, the people are finding it harder to make ends meet. President Venetiaan and the Front are governing on an ad hoc basis, letting things take their own course. People no longer believe in him. He offers no prospects. The solution lies in early elections. I think our followers are growing. We are prepared for full or partial power. [ELSEVIER] What do you mean full? [Bouterse] If we get the majority, if not, then we will work together with those people who accept a national approach, along the lines of a consensus model. [ELSEVIER] What is the core of this contribution? [Bouterse] People must be put back to work in this country. Authority and discipline must return. There must be a slightly military approach, with a slightly adjusted model of democracy. There should be a parliament, but not endless waffling. Let the representatives of the people meet every three months to discuss legislation, but do not let them mess around with plans that are never implemented. That makes me resentful. If they leave me in peace, then within five years, I will lay a foundation for a new Singapore here on this land, with these people, and with all the resources. We have wood and gold, but not yet the know-how and the money to use it for development. Other countries do. The thing to do now is to have the inventiveness to combine national interests with international interests, in an open manner, without engaging in backhanded methods, through a consensus. [ELSEVIER] What stands in the way of this consensus? [Bouterse] One condition is to have a national reconciliation. There are still a lot of hard feelings. The coups, the counter-coups: We must draw a line under all of this. One man says: "You killed my family." And the other man says: "You locked me up." We have black pages in our history, but if we keep looking back, then we will keep attacking each other. [passage omitted] [ELSEVIER] People are saying that you want to become president? [Bouterse] What shall I say? Everyone has been expecting for a little while that, given half a chance, Bouterse would become the new president. For me, however, this is not an end in itself. If I had wanted that, I could have done that for a long time. If the voters want it and the community requests it, then I will not shirk that responsibility. If I obtain political power, however, then people will know that it will call for a lot of hard work. That costs votes. I am not going to tolerate the fact that you have to wait two hours for passport control at the airport, that the streets are in shambles, that people do not show up for work, and things like that. [ELSEVIER] Will you cooperate with the Netherlands as a friendly nation? [Bouterse] Politics is a tough business, one in which there is no room for hard feelings. The history is there. We were a colony of the Netherlands; hundreds of thousands of Surinamers live in the Netherlands; and we have an international treaty. Of course, it is up to the Netherlands to decide whether it wants to cooperate with a Bouterse government. If not, then I am not going to go whining to The Hague. But we are looking for other countries to cooperate with.
