However, the Western Alliance has come to the conclusion that NATO should open up a perspective of eventual extension of its membership but not try to determine criteria, timetables or candidates. The NATO summit next Monday [19 January] and Tuesday in Brussels is expected to approve the partnership for peace plan, which offers East European states closer military links with NATO but no security guarantee or the full membership they want. All Central and East European countries including Russia will be invited to join the program which will enable them to develop military cooperation individually with NATO. The partnership for peace will take place as part of an evolutionary process enabling some of the former Soviet Bloc states to become full members of NATO in the future, a British Foreign Office official said. It will allow these countries to consult with NATO whenever they face a threat. "Such a right of consultation and opportunity for consultation is not of course a security guarantee... it is not, of course, an automatic obligation on existing NATO members to go to war on their behalf but it is an indication of a degree of security concern on the part of NATO about these countries," said the official. The NATO, faced with complaints from some East European countries such as Poland for refusing them early membership and opposition to its eastward expansion from Russia, will send a signal that it is committed to enhancing security to all those countries, including Russia, the official said.
