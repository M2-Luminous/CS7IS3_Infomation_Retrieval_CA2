It stands a reasonable chance of passing the council as an alternative to Governor Chris Patten's 1992 measures. There is no other viable choice. Hong Kong people want to see compromise and stability. Amid signs of a possible thaw in Sino-British relations, we do not want to see the arguments of the past two years rekindled again on Wednesday. Our measures propose two things which are essential if we are to have a legislature which converges with the system after 1997. First, we must create nine new functional constituencies to add to the existing 21 as per the Basic Law. Secondly, an election committee must be set up to elect 10 Legislative Council members, also similar to the system enshrined in the Basic Law. Before the promulgation of the Basic Law in 1990, the British and Chinese governments, through the subsequently revealed exchange of diplomatic letters, saw great merit in making the pre- and post-1997 Legislative Council dovetail with each other. Certain understandings of good faith were in those letters. Our package is trying to stick to the essence of those understandings. Our draft follows the same principles adopted when functional constituencies were introduced by the Hong Kong Government. This is fundamentally different from Mr Patten's '92 offering which gives new meaning to functional constituencies by extending the electorate to everyone who works in one of nine broad categories of industries. This type of franchise extension is a form of direct election. Calling it functional is not calling a spade a spade. We see no reason for the nine new functional constituencies to be different in concept from the existing 21. The present system is well known and understood. It provides stability and balance without jeopardising the ultimate goal of achieving full direct elections in the long run, which incidentally is also written into the Basic Law. The nine new functional constituencies we propose are: agriculture and fisheries; textiles and garments; sport, culture and entertainment; transport; retail, import and export; insurance; electronics and information technology; and two more seats for labour. The first five were proposed by both sides before the Sino- British talks collapsed. We are just picking up where they left off. The expected electorate of these nine is about 122,000, compared with only 107,000 spread over the existing 21. The average size of new constituencies in our package is 2 1/2 times the existing ones. And if the total electorate is raised by giving each corporation six directors' votes, which we would not object to, if my colleague James Tien Pei-chun's amendment to maintain "one company one vote" is not accepted, the electorate for these nine is 223,000 -- more than twice the total of the current 21. The election committee is something new for Hong Kong, but it is spelt out clearly in the Basic Law how it is to be composed from 1997. Mr Patten's package proposes an election committee comprising 346 district board members. Our amendment calls for a committee with four equal parts, like the Basic Law, totalling 396 members, all elected separately by more than 30 different sectors of voters. This is not just larger, but also more representative than the '92 proposals. What's more, our scheme is close to the Basic Law, while Mr Patten's is miles away.We notice another non-Liberal Party member Frederick Fung Kin-kee has also put forward an amendment to bring the election committee more in line with the Basic Law. Our motives are the same: convergence and a smooth transition. Mr Patten has, since proposing his '92 draft, said it is up to the Legislative Council to decide. Our party chairman Allen Lee Peng-fei will meet the Governor tomorrow to re-emphasise our call for the three government officials to abstain in Wednesday's voting. There will be no constitutional place for government officials in the council from 1995 onwards. Since we are deciding the composition of our own Legislative Council for 1995 and the views are divided with so many amendments, it will look bad for the British Government if those three votes turn out to be the swinging votes in Wednesday's toss-up, because of instructions from the last Governor from London. So we're saying: leave us alone to make our own choice.
