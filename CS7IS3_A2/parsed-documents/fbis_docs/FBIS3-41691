True, everything luckily turned out without the tragic finale. From on board the aircraft flying to Krasnodar from Turkey came the message: One of our passengers needs emergency medical assistance. Physicians met the aircraft on the airfield. The patient had already lost consciousness, and his pressure was nearly at zero... The 53-year-old patient was sent to the infectious disease hospital; however, that left another 27 members of the tourist group and, in addition, 6 passengers from Krasnodar and 6 Turkish citizens who had arrived on the same flight. The Turks refused examinations and left the airport on their own business. The six Krasnodar residents simply hid after passing through customs. By nightfall, they were collected from their homes by ``ambulance.'' And the entire tourist group from Naberezhnyye Chelny were, despite their protests, detained and placed in the hospital. ``The next day nearly all of them were sent home to Naberezhnyye Chelny via a special flight,'' said M. Mkrtchan, deputy chief physician of the sanitary-epidemiological oversight's kray center. ``But here everything did not end without incident: For some reason, the group ``slipped in'' two persons with symptoms similar to those of cholera, leaving two healthy persons here. Laboratory studies confirmed the diagnosis in the two tourists who still remain in our hospital. Later, studies of specimens collected by us showed that another five of the group members who had flown off also carried cholera's causative agent. Of course, we informed our colleagues in Naberezhnyye Chelny of this fact.'' ``As it turned out, the group going from Naberezhnyye Chelny to Turkey was in Syria. Barely landing in Krasnodar alive, one man had already felt bad for several days. He hid his condition, however, and tried to treat himself. At the sanitary-epidemiological station's kray center, they told me that his illness was noticed in the group, but they decided not to see a physician. The illness was evidently some sort of complication. Indeed, it was a commercial flight, and the group had carried many things in from abroad.'' The patients' condition is now improving. No other cases of cholera in Kuban have been noted.
