Akayev told Japanese Ambassador Kiji Watanabe during the ceremony of the presentation of credentials, that since the first days of independence, Bishkek and Tokyo had been maintaining relations of trust and friendship. "No other country helps us more than Japan in promoting economic restructuring and the reorganization of the banking and communication systems," he said. On the same day, Kyrgyz Prime Minister Apas Zhumagulov met with Japanese businessmen to discuss the role of Japan in the economic restructuring program. He proposed that Japan invest in the Kyrgyz defense, machine-building and agriculture-related industries. Zhumagulov said that only about 8 percent of Kyrgyzstan's hydro-energy resources were used, and that Japan's participation in the construction of small, medium and big hydro-power plants might benefit both countries. As an example of bilateral cooperation he referred to the plant for the production of semiconductors which is being built in the south of Kyrgyzstan. This plant is expected to manufacture 1000 tonnes of poly-and mono-crystal silicon a year. Zhumagulov told Interfax that relations between Kyrgyzstan and Japan were broadening and that he expected much of the Kyrgyz-Japanese committee for economic cooperation, which is to meet in Tokyo next November.
