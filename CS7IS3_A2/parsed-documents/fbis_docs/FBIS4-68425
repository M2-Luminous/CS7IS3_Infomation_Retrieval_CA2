Georgia Has Its Own National Customs Service": place and date not given] [Text] Georgia has had its own customs service for two years now, but we cannot say yet that everything is perfect and without flaw in it. Most of the public gives it very poor marks, and not only that, people think it is a money-grubbing organization, and not without reason, I think. This is also attested these days by free-wheeling "black business." Of course, what kind of performance can you expect when this vital national service has been reorganized almost four times in its two years of existence, and its officials and customs personnel have been replaced similarly. How could all of this not leave its mark on the service's formation? Judge for yourself: the Georgian Customs Administration of the USSR Customs Committee was abolished in February 1992 and the Georgian Customs Department was formed, after which the Department became part of the Finance Ministry, only to be removed from it soon after and become a separate Customs Committee. Last year, again, this Committee was abolished and the Customs Department was formed. "It was all new to Georgia, and it had to be learned empirically, gropingly, following hunches, and sometimes local officials put their own pockets' interests first," said the current chairman of the Customs Department, Viktor Lordkipanidze, a member of Parliament from Ajaria. He was appointed to the post, quite unexpectedly to everyone, late last year. Not much time has gone by since then, but it has been long enough for this man to become adjusted to his new job and to think out and shape his own future operations program. So I talked to him and asked, "Can we say, at long last, that Georgia has its own national customs service?" [Lordkipanidze] Georgia's state customs service, the Georgian Customs Department, with its own customs agencies, laws, rules, material-technical base, and cadres, does exist legally and in actuality. It has been recognized and accepted as a member by the World Association of Customs Organizations; it is a subject in our republic's bilateral agreements with other countries; and its chairman is a full member of the Council of Chiefs of Customs Services of the CIS and an equal member of the heads of customs services of other countries. At a press conference not long ago, Batoni Giorgi Chanturia (who seems to have maintained his interest in Georgia's customs service) said that Georgia's entry into the "ruble zone" is "already underway, inasmuch as Georgia's customs service has already joined Russia's customs service structure." If such a political somersault is valid, then we can just as well turn it around with a back flip and say, "Russia's entry into the coupon zone is already underway, inasmuch as Russia's customs service has already joined Georgia's customs service structure." And so, if we stop juggling words and look into the thing, Georgia's customs service is a two-year-old child, just getting on its feet, still learning and developing, but nevertheless independent and on its own. Most of these two years have been taken up by wars to preserve Georgia's territorial integrity, and customs officials also put on the uniform. And they fought and died, too. Even between wars, unarmed customs officials have been repeatedly pelted by legal and illegal armed formations. Through its own fault, the customs service--and sometimes with good reason--acquired the image of a money-grubbing organization. The control agencies didn't waste time: they quickly created customs control structures and set up detection headquarters in the customs office. [Correspondent] Nobody likes constant control, but it is a fact that the customs service has not been all that spotless.... [Lordkipanidze] People in every era and in every country have had no sympathy for tax gatherers and customs officials. It cannot be disputed, of course, that the people's wrath is well founded these days. You have to agree, however, that it's annoying when you have to suffer not only your own lash but someone else's whip. We customs officials have enough sins of our own; don't hang other people's on us. What we need to know is that the customs inspector is empowered and obliged to follow customs control procedures (and he does) only with respect to persons crossing the border at customs checkpoints, in specially designated customs zones. Customs checkpoints on land are being created only by agreement with neighboring countries, and on both sides of the border. [Correspondent] How many border customs checkpoints are there in Georgia right now? [Lordkipanidze] There are railroad checkpoints at Gardabani and Sadakhlo; highway checkpoints at Kazbegi, Lagodekhi, Samtatskaro, Tsiteli Khidi [Red Bridge], Ninotsminda, Guguti, Sadakhlo, Akhkerpi, and Sarpi; maritime checkpoints at Batumi and Poti harbors; airport checkpoints in Tbilisi and Batumi Airports. Hence, anybody else who comes up to you somewhere else, on the highway or at a crossroads, on a train, wearing a uniform or not, armed or not, with credentials or not, who passes himself off as a "customs officer" is nothing but a highway robber and a criminal. [Correspondent] I don't suppose that means that Customs Department personnel are all free of sin.... [Lordkipanidze] Of course not. When we carried out the Head of State's order "On Planned Measures To Stabilize the Situation In Lower Kartli," we abolished the Bolnisi Customs Office and fired all its 60 staffers and officials; in Marneuli we set up a new customs office. In the Poti Customs Office we fired the chief, and in Sadakhlo we fired the entire 36-man crew of the customs post, which both local and foreign citizens had been lodging complaints against. An investigation is underway, and so far 26 men have been fired. [Correspondent] Naturally, you will hire new ones to replace them. Isn't it possible, though, that one robber will be replaced by another? [Lordkipanidze] Most of those who have been fired are not robbers. It's just that, owing to their own subjective and objective traits they are not able to meet the required standards. Let me tell you the requirements which an airport customs post inspector must meet: a college education, completion of a special customs school or special courses, a customs service rank, fluency in Georgian and Russian as well as a working knowledge of another foreign language, age 35 or under, a "clean" record, good physical condition, good build and appearance, a high level of culture, and a certificate from a narcology clinic (some preference is given to women). After all this, a half-year contract is signed with the inspector, which will be renewed after the trial period and certification. In the past two years, no instruction has been provided; now this is given priority. Since 10 January, training has been provided in specialized courses for persons recruited for customs service. These courses will be permanent and will be expanded by drawing upon qualifications-upgrading groups. An agreement has been signed stipulating that this year about 60 young people will be enrolled in one-month courses training customs service recruits in Moscow and Rostov. About 35 customs specialists will upgrade their qualifications in Moscow. More than 20 will take short-term study and training courses under Euro-Association auspices in customs schools and structures of Europe. By summer, plans call for opening a customs academy in Moscow, and a number of our young people will be sent there. I think that Georgia's Customs Service must be depoliticized not only on paper but in deed, so that the political ups and downs taking place in the country cannot influence it. Its work has to be based on high professionalism and obedience to the law almost to the point of nitpicking. [Correspondent] Still, what is your impression of the customs service from the inside? [Lordkipanidze] Like others on the outside, I used to see two opposed forces--the smugglers trying to carry prohibited or unauthorized goods out of the country, currency, and historical and national treasures, and bring in narcotics, other psychotropic substances, weapons, ammunition, and so on. On the other side there were the dedicated customs officials who, sometimes at the cost of their life, tried to prevent smugglers and narcotics peddlers from breaking our laws and carrying material goods away. I respected honest customs officials and hated those who engaged in extortion and made dirty deals with smugglers and narcotics importers. If you can believe it, that's the way it really is. That's why the battle must be without compromise. [Correspondent] I believe you have a computerized export-import reporting network. How has it helped you? [Lordkipanidze] We found that in 11 months of last year three times more goods left Georgia than came in. In another time and another country this would be taken as a positive; and we would have taken it that way also if we could be certain that all the earnings from the exports were coming into Georgia and not ending up in the safes of other countries. Only 18 percent of the value of goods shipped out of Georgia on a barter basis came back in the form of commodities. We have got used to seeing gas, utility services, and other bills being paid late or not paid at all. Unfortunately, many state and private structures owe billions to the state treasury. We have the ability to work with the National Bank, the Economics and Finance ministries, the Tax Inspection, and other departments to draft laws, regulations, and directives and, through the customs service, stop the commodities and currency drain and recover at least some of the old debts. The introduction of an effective record-keeping system has made it possible to assign the Customs Department the task of assessing and collecting excise and value-added taxes, but nothing has been done about the fact that the Customs Department needs a new assessment and collection system of the kind it is not used to, and highly qualified specialists to run it. Therefore, it proved impossible to start this effort on 1 February as the law stipulated. The other day, however, at our request we went to the Head of State, and many essential decisions were made. [Correspondent] What can you tell us about arming customs officials? [Lordkipanidze] At first we asked for a 1,500-man customs security force with a general in charge in order to accommodate our official functions. But after several rounds of battle against the criminal world, my "appetite" got smaller. If border units are strengthened sufficiently, if they can seal off the smuggling routes and at the same time secure the safety of the customs posts, we will be content with smaller, mobile, fast-reaction detachments, well trained and armed with the best Alpha and Delta traditions, provided with the necessary transportation facilities--armored vehicles on land, patrol boats at sea, and helicopters in the sky. The equipment will be painted white and have its own insignia. [Correspondent] What do you wish for most? [Lordkipanidze] To set up posts on the Psou and the other side of the Roki Tunnel. [Correspondent] Is that realistic? [Lordkipanidze] Absolutely. It's just a matter of time!
