The theory of reflection in dialectical materialism falls into the category of the Marxist theory of cognition, of which Marx, Engels and Lenin all offered explicit and full discussions; however, it was Mao Zedong who was most thorough in applying it to the arenas of literature, art, and aesthetic theory. He was certain that life "provides literature and art with an inexhaustible source, their only source. Life is the only source, for there can be no other." That was the view of a firm and thorough materialist. In the history of Marxist thinking on literature and art, no one before Mao Zedong had applied the Marxist, materialist theory of cognition and made such profound, scientific assertions and explicit explanation on the relationship between literature, art, and life as he did. However, Mao Zedong was simultaneously a great dialectician, while ascertaining that life was of a primary nature, and literature and art of a secondary nature, he fully expounded that literature and art could and ought to be "on a higher plane, more intense, more concentrated, more typical, nearer the ideal, and therefore more universal than actual everyday life." That was also the offspring of Mao Zedong combining Marxist theory with social practice in China as well as practice in literature and art. Some people groundlessly regarded the Marxist theory of reflection and its application to literature and art as the "theory of reflection through direct perception of the senses." We have only to read relevant works by Mao Zedong himself to find out that he was very certain about the truth that life was the only source of literature and art, a materialist concept that could never be shaken; furthermore, he fully affirmed the dynamic role of literature and art in life, and the subjective aspect of the writer in literary creation. Those people who regard the theory of reflection, and its application to matters of literature and art, as the theory of reflection through direct perception of the senses which is a negation of the subjective aspect deliberately distort the Marxist theory of reflection, or at least lack genuine understanding of the Marxist concept on this issue. In the past, writers and artists who did not entirely neglect life could see consciously, or at least through practice, that literary and artistic creation could not be independent of life. For example, Chinese painters who specialized in the genre of portraying nature did not directly express social life, but the majority of them saw the importance of "learning from nature"; otherwise, they could not really have any true artistic accomplishments in portraying nature. There were cases of following in the footsteps of ancient artists; however, those painters who failed to pay attention to observing nature but simply followed in the footsteps of ancient artists, and did not see nature as the inspiration for their own creation would inevitably create only impoverished works, and their works could not have genuine artistic life. We naturally cannot rest satisfied with the simple materialist understanding of ancient writers and artists in the relationship between art and life. Every person who believes in historical materialism acknowledges that history was a creation of the people, and history was mainly the producers' history. When Mao Zedong set forth the proposition that our literature and art reflect the life of the people, his view was by no means without foundation; it was just the true face of history. If our literature is truthful, and falls in line with the true face of history, we can only place the truthful reflection of the people's life above all else. It cannot be otherwise, especially when history has developed to an era of the people's revolution under proletarian leadership. In past Chinese literature, there were many works that portrayed the life and suffering of the working people in poetry; but in novels, such works were few aside from "Outlaws of the Marsh." Lu Xun shared that view. Aside from the "Book of Odes" and much folklore in its wake, the poet Bai Juyi wrote many works reflecting the people's sufferings; however, he could not avoid looking down at the impoverished with sympathy and pity typical of the literati and officialdom in feudal China; literary works in this category can be said to have an "affinity to the people." Furthermore, not only works that give a direct portrayal of life at the lowest depth have an "affinity to the people." This issue should not be grasped in a simple and narrow view. But in the history of Chinese literature, it was none other than Lu Xun who was the first to genuinely portray images of peasants, such as sister-in-law Xianglin and Runtu, who were genuine Chinese peasants, not those in the eyes of past literati and officialdom in feudal China. But even Lu Xun mainly succeeded in portraying the sufferings of the oppressed peasants; in that aspect, he was extraordinarily profound and truthful. The peasants of Lu Xun's pen were mainly of the suffering class, they had not yet awakened, and were not a revolutionary class. Mao Zedong explicitly set out the need for literature and art to depict the new mass era, and the new life of workers, peasants, and soldiers; that should be viewed as an important revolution in literary and artistic thinking. In the era of the people's revolution, especially in an era when the masses have already grasped political power and become masters of the country, literature and art must appear in new features if they are not to be divorced from life, peasants, workers, and the army. It was precisely because of this that Mao Zedong's call that "China's revolutionary writers and artists, writers and artists of promise, must go among the masses; they must for a long period of time unreservedly and wholeheartedly go among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, go into the heat of struggle, to the only source, the broadest and richest source...." was not just a periodic need, not just a "war-time policy for literature and art," as some people put it, or only applicable to past rural environment, but the party basic line for literature and art, which is grounded on Marxist basic tenets. In the 50 years since the publication of "Talks at the Yanan Forum on Literature and Art," the great accomplishments in Chinese revolutionary literature and art are the victory of the party basic line for literature and art as well as Marxism. Of course, we should always bear in mind that the reflection we refer to in the arena of literature and art is aesthetic reflection, and a particular way of grasping the world. Every step taken in this arena contains expressions of the unique imagination, feelings, and sentiments pertaining of the writer himself. In this arena , it is utterly impossible to implement compulsion and to achieve mechanical balance with other ideological arenas; freedom of creation to the maximum must be insured on the basis of a common revolutionary orientation and thinking. That was a point Lenin did not forget even when he stressed that literature must adhere to the principle of party spirit, with clear and explicit affirmation. On the issue of literary and artistic creation, Mao Zedong set out the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloom, which precisely contained the same thinking as Lenin's. While adhering to the ideological universality of literature and art in the past, the neglect of the particularity of literature and art was an important ideological root cause of "leftist" dogmatic errors. Such "leftist" dogmatic thinking had negative effects on normal development in creation. Under the prerequisite of opposing bourgeois liberalization and adhering to the correct ideological and political orientation, it is necessary to continue to weed out such "leftist" dogmatic thinking. Proceeding from this understanding, what enables us to correctly resolve the issue of reflecting people's life is primarily to reflect the life of workers, peasants, revolutionary armymen, and revolutionary intellectuals. On this issue of the relationship between the requirements history has bestowed on literature and art and "self-expression" of writers and artists, the belief that literature and art should be and mainly is "self expression" was comparatively popular a few years back, with comparatively strong voices. In fact, all spiritual products are stamped with the producers themselves, namely, the "self" expression of the producers. It is the more so with artistic production. Artistic products always bear sharper particular personal experiences, feelings and sentiments than other spiritual products. The reason art cannot be repeated probably lies here in the main. Even with the same subject matter, in works portraying the same hero, even by the same author, it can hardly be a complete repetition. It is so with the writer's literary creations, the composer's musical pieces, the painter's artistic works, and the playwright's scripts; it is so with the performing artist, too. An actor worthy of the name of an artist, or a fine, outstanding conductor of an orchestra, even when he was playing the same role or the same piece of music over and over, will offer new variations and new creations every time; that was a fact that the majority of the audiences already knew. We cannot generally oppose "self expression," the question is what sort of "self." Any writer of whatever class has his own "self," and will inevitably express his own "self"; the "self expression" of a writer taking the people's position naturally shares the people's feelings and sentiments; have we not come into contact with many good lyric poems and songs? A poet or a composer who takes the people's position, and shares the thinking and emotions with the people, when he gives expression to his personal feeling is giving expression to the popular feeling at the same time. In fact, many of Mao Zedong' poems are "self-expressive," or expressing the "self" at the same time; has this not most satisfactorily explained this issue? We do not approve of and oppose only the "self expression" that is divorced from the people and even stands in opposition to the people. There were actually quite a few of works of "self expression" in this category sometimes in the past. Such "self expression" can in no way express the essential things of life.
