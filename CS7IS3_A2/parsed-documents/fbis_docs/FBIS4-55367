The documents are only in draft form and will probably be reworked on consultation with NATO, he said. The documents represent an intensification of the preparations for Czech membership in the security structures. They include consultation in the event of a threat to the security of the Czech Republic on the basis of 16+1, i.e. the sixteen NATO members plus in such a case the Czech Republic, he said. In addition they embrace further political consultation, the support of United Nations (U.N.) forces and work on the compatibility of the Czech Army with the armies of the alliance. The Czech Republic is to offer its training bases for U.N. troop exercises, participate in the organization of study visits and continue to cooperate in the military actions of U.N. peace-keeping forces.
