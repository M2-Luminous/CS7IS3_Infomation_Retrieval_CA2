FR941220-0-00011 FR941220-0-00004 e. Allocation After the Phaseout In the October 14, 1994 proposal, EPA reserved the right to allocate potential production allowances after the phaseout date for methyl bromide, starting January 1, 2001, and beyond. One comment was received suggesting EPA state an intention to allocate potential production allowance, at some level, after the U.S. phaseout date. EPA intends to analyze the role of methyl bromide in the depletion of stratospheric ozone as more scientific information is gathered over the next few years. EPA also intends to monitor global and U.S. production of methyl bromide and its use. At this time, EPA cannot predict the future actions relative to the post-phaseout period for methyl bromide. Based on the monitoring and analysis activities, EPA will continue to consider proposing an allocation of potential production allowances after the U.S. phaseout date for methyl bromide. IV. Summary of Supporting Analysis A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined by OMB and EPA that this amendment to the final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). EPA believes that any impact that this amendment will have on the regulated community will serve only to provide relief from otherwise applicable regulations, and will therefore limit the negative economic impact associated with the regulations previously promulgated under Section 604 and 606. An examination of the impacts on small entities was discussed in the final rule (58 FR 65018 and 58 FR 69235). That final rule assessed the impact the rule may have on small entities. A separate regulatory impact analysis accompanied the final rule and is contained in Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;01. I certify that this amendment to the accelerated phaseout rule will not have any additional negative economic impacts on any small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act Any information collection requirements in a rule must be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Because no additional informational collection requirements are required by this amendment, EPA has determined that the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to this rulemaking and no new Information Collection Request document has been prepared.
