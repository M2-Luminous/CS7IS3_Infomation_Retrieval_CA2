The area for the exercises is in Orenburg Oblast to the east of the Volga, the "heartland" of Russia. It is reported that technical preparations for the exercises are almost complete. Even the insignias have also been made. When the exercises start, the national flags of both countries will be hoisted side by side, and the purpose of the exercises: peace-keeping '94, will also be clearly written on them. However, two months before the exercises, many members of the Russian State Duma have questioned whether or not it is "appropriate" to hold them, and there is also endless debate in the press. A major Moscow newspaper wrote on the eve of the anniversary of the victory in the Second World War: "In those years, the German fascists only managed to come close to the Volga, but today we have invited U.S. troops to cross it." On the other hand, IZVESTIA gave tit for tat and put forward the view: "If the Russian-U.S. joint military exercises are canceled, the president will have made a big mistake." The two opposed views are not giving in and are pitted against each other like the imaginary "red troops" and "blue troops" in the exercises. Under such circumstances, President Yeltsin has expressed his "understanding" of the doubts of the Duma members and ordered the Ministry of Defense to "discuss the issue of military exercises with the United States again." It is said that the scale of the exercises is very small. Only a total of 250 officers and men on the U.S. side will take part in it. Also, they will only be equipped with automatic rifles and other light weapons. The cost is $2.5 million. The purpose is not to practice coordination in peace-keeping activities. [sentence as published] At first glance, the exercises do not involve major interests. Why, then, have the planned exercises evoked such strong reactions in the Russian political arena? Ever since ancient times, the Russian nation has esteemed the Volga as the "mother of rivers" and a spiritual source. To allow U.S. troops, their former opponents, to cross the Volga is evidently something more than some people can bear psychologically. This is all the more the case today when feelings of nationalism are on the rise. People cannot help associating this with other discord in Russian-U.S. relations at present. The two sides have not yet ended their dispute over what kind of "partnership for peace" should be established; and to date, Russia still wants to revise the "Treaty on the Reduction of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. The reason for such revision is that the "treaty" was reached between the two major military blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization several years ago and that if matters are still handled according to the original treaty, it will be to Russia's disadvantage. Also, since the second half of last year, Russia has been seeking "special interests" in the former USSR area. However, Western countries have regarded this as a signal that Russia is attempting to restore its "former empire." The dispute in the Russian political arena over the military exercises seems to be merely a minor episode in the current not very harmonious relations between Russia and the United States. In the past few days, the "weather" for the military exercises seems to have "turned fine." Russian Defense Minister Grachev said that the exercises will be held as scheduled. However, no matter whether or not U.S. troops succeed in "crossing the Volga," it is evidently not easy for Russia and the United States to change from being opponents to being "partners," because this requires arduous readjustments of the interests of each side.
