Introduction Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Public Law 94&hyph;163, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA), Public Law 95&hyph;619, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;12, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), Public Law 102&hyph;486, created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products other than Automobiles (Program). 1 The consumer and commercial products currently subject to this Program (often referred to hereafter as ``covered products'') include general service fluorescent lamps and general service incandescent lamps, the subject of today's notice. The Department is publishing elsewhere in this issue an Interim Final Rule amending part 430 to establish test procedures for flourescent and incandescent lamps, incorporating by reference test procedures adopted by the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES), American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). 1 Part B of Title III of EPCA, as amended, is referred to in this proposed rule as the ``Act.'' Part B of Title III is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291&hyph;6309. II. Discussion By this notice, the Department is proposing definitions for colored fluorescent and incandescent lamps. The Department is also proposing to clarify the exemption for rough or vibration service incandescent reflector lamps by requiring a C&hyph;17 or C&hyph;22 filament or by requiring a vibration test. The proposed definitions will apply to those products covered by sections 322(a)(14) and 325(i)(1) of the Act. A. Definitions
