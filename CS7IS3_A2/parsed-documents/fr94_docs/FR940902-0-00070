FR940902-0-00070 FR940902-0-00010 Several commenters raised concerns regarding the definition of State education agency. The commenters requested that the final regulations specify that the Governor may allocate the 8 percent funds only to the State Education Agency, as defined by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Department believes that clarification is needed. The commenters argued that the definition of ``state educational agency'' in section 4(23) of the Act specifically refers to the agency defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as the state education agency for JTPA purposes. The Department interprets the Act differently. The term ``state educational agency'' is a different term from the term ``state education agency,'' which is used in section 123(a) of the Act. The term defined in section 4 of the Act is used in section 122(a)(3)(B)(1) of the Act to describe membership on the SJTCC. Support for the view that the terms used in sections 4 and 123 of the Act are intended to be different is found in the use of the phrase ``any State education agency'' in section 123(a). If the Department were to read this phrase to mean a single agency, the reading would render the word ``any'' redundant. The Department reads section 123(a) to mean that, at a minimum, the Governor may consider as the State education agency that agency responsible for primary and secondary education, or responsible for vocational education programs under the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act and the Adult Education Act. In addition, the Department finds that a number of States have consolidated a number of education functions and agencies into various cabinet arrangements. For this reason, the Department has determined that the regulations should retain the statutory language ``any education agency,'' but some changes are made in ยง628.315(a) of the final rule. The phrase ``or agencies'' is removed from the final rule because the Department does not intend to cause confusion or appear to encourage the designation of multiple agencies; however, the rule should not be read to absolutely prohibit this practice under justifiable circumstances when significant parts of the education function are not within one agency. As previously reflected in the interim final rule, the Governor is not permitted to designate any agency for which ``education'' is not the primary and operational function, which means that the entity must actually be responsible for the operation of educational programs. A commenter questioned the conditions under which the State JTPA entity can be found eligible to be a subrecipient of the 8-percent monies. The Act envisions the state education agency as receiving and using the section 123 funds. The State JTPA entity is only eligible to be a subrecipient if the agreement with the Governor and State education agency stipulates this as a part of the agreement. In response to the question of whether a portion of the funds may be used for certain administrative functions ( i.e. , audit, oversight) the Department has stated in previous guidance that limited funds may be set aside for this purpose. This would be described in the joint agreement.
