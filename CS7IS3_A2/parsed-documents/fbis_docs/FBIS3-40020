It is replacing the basic program adopted in Ludwigshafen in 1978. The Hamburg program is the first all-German basic program of a German party after reunification. With the new program, the CDU is drawing conclusions from the intellectual and political changes in Germany, Europe, and the whole world. The basic program is characterized by the general motto "Freedom in responsibility." The idea of responsible freedom belongs to the Christian concept of man of the CDU. According to the chairman of the CDU committee responsible for drafting the party principles, Reinhard Goehner, the program follows the ideal of a free and responsible society, a citizens' society as opposed to an individualistic-privatistic affluent society. The "distribution society" is to be replaced by a "responsible society." The program does not include a proposal leading to higher state expenditure, Goehner stressed. In areas where a higher expenditure is required, funds should be shifted in a way that no additional costs arise. This means that the CDU will have to reduce the new indebtedness, which rose as a result of German unification, and the state quota and taxes and charges. The development of the social market economy into an ecological and social market economy was the subject of a controversial discussion at the party congress. As reported yesterday, the delegates voted in favor of this change by 359 to 279 votes. The expansion of the social market economy to an ecological and social market economy was primarily rejected by representatives of the Economic Council and the social committees. They were against watering down the trademark social market economy. According to Goehner, the development of the economic and social system into an ecological and social market economy and the preservation of God's Creation are the major messages of the new basic program. In order to use the strength and the innovative power of the economy to a greater extent to protect the environment, the CDU want to integrate ecological elements in the tax law more than in the past, and it wants to introduce environmental surcharges, possibilities for compensation, and regulations concerning certificates and liability. Largely in conformity with the action program for growth and employment, which was also adopted by the CDU Congress, the basic program contains a catalogue of measures and demands designed to strengthen Germany's attractiveness as a business location and to create new jobs. With the basic program, the CDU acquires a stronger profile as the "party of the family." After a heated debate, the congress voted in favor of family splitting. In order to safeguard the multi-generation agreement [to finance pensions] in view of the demographic changes, the CDU advocates family-friendly measures in the tax and social insurance law. It wants to acknowledge the additional burdens resulting for parents from child education to a greater extent as contributions within the pension system. The pension insurance is to remain contribution-oriented and thus performance-oriented. The CDU advocates linking the pensions with the development of the wages of the employees and their prosperity. Labor Minister Bluem again rejected uniform pensions. A basic pension would be a service for drop-outs, financed by others. The social committees expressed satisfaction with the results of the discussions of the program. Social gaps of the draft have been eliminated. The prospect of a "negative tax," proposed by the Christian Democratic Employees and the Economic Federation, was adopted. This is a milestone in the sphere of tax policies. In the discussion about the part of the CDU's new basic program devoted to domestic policies, several speakers attacked the opposition in Bonn, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. The legacy of the so-called 1968-generation continues to largely dominate the policy and program of the SPD, Bundestag member Rupert Scholz from the CDU criticized. For the CDU in Germany, this is nit acceptable -- neither politically, legally, nor ethically. It is true that the state has to ensure the freedom of its citizens, but freedom must also serve the community and take into consideration moral and ethical values. "Unconditional and irresponsible libertinage" is unacceptable. Late on Tuesday [22 February], a debate about the significance of plebiscites in the CDU's new basic program took place. The CDU of Saxony demanded that the sentence should be deleted from the draft program according to which the CDU rejects referendums at the federal level. This option must at least be kept open for the new laender, a speaker demanded. Scholz and CDU Bundestag member Friedbert Pflueger, however, were against that. Only in a parliamentary democracy can the consensus be achieved that is required in a pluralist society, Scholz stated. He accused the SPD of discrediting parliamentary democracy with its support for plebiscites. Pflueger warned against devaluating parliamentary decisions through referendums. Finally the few delegates who were left late in the evening spoke in favor of not eliminating the sentence that the CDU rejects referendums at the federal level. Interior Minister Manfred Kanther defended the law on the fight against crime, which will be discussed at the Bundestag today, Thursday. It includes two dozens of important measures that cannot be renounced only because it was not possible to achieve a consensus on other major issues. Referring to the Free Democratic Party of Germany, which largely rejects the "great bugging campaign," Kanther stressed that the alarming crime rate among foreigners who stay in Germany for a short period should not be concealed. On the other hand, the crime rate among Germans and foreigners who stay in Germany for longer periods is the same. Johannes Gerster, deputy chairman of the Bundestag group of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU], also spoke in favor of stressing the issue of internal security during the election campaign. The debate about European policies was unexpectedly peaceful. The old basic program still included the goal of a democratic European federal state, to be organized on the principle of subsidiarity. However, in the discussion about the new CDU basic program, the element of a federal state was accorded less significance. After a short debate, the CDU Congress agreed on the formulation, adopted earlier by the Executive Committee, that the European Union should be shaped in a "free, democratic, federal, and subsidiary manner." In his speech, Finance Minister Theo Waigel tried to play down the differences between the CDU and parts of the CSU over Europe's future. Waigel stated that the treaty on the European Union does not provide for federal states. In their speeches, the CDU officials were generally critical of the press. As a result, restrictive regulations for the media were included in the basic program. Thus, the right to counter-declarations should be widened for the affected persons, and every citizen should be granted a legal claim for damages against the press and the radio. The SPD criticized the CDU's new basic program. The CDU has abandoned the social market economy and embarked on the path of a "slightly modified Thatcherism." The tradition-conscious Christian Democratic Employees are apparently losing influence. The new program will not stop "the draining process concerning contents and personnel, for which Kohl is personally responsible," SPD spokeswoman Dagmar Wiebusch stated.
