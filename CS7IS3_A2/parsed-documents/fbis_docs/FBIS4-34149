Mr. Evans Francois, who is in charge of a diplomatic mission in Santo Domingo, made some statements regarding the current juncture and condemned the handling of power since 30 September 1991. Mr. Francois, who demanded the resignation of Gen. Raoul Cedras, considered that the threats of intervention in the country are very serious. Here is a report on his statements: [Reporter Renois] It was from Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, that Mr. Evans Francois wanted to reveal the content of his letter addressed to Gen. Raoul Cedras. The brother of the Port-au-Prince police chief seems to have taken very seriously the threats of intervention weighing on Haiti. Considering that the threats were very imminent, Mr. Evans Francois invited Gen. Cedras to make the gesture that the whole country and the Army are expecting from him, in order to prevent, he says, the national soil from once more being stained. He gave the guarantee that Colonel Michel Francois was ready to make some concessions in the nation's interest. Calling the entourage of Gen. Cedras a jungle gathering of professional crooked dealers, Evans Francois accused Cedras of hamstringing all the governments since 30 September 1991. Regarding the government of Judge Emile Jonassaint, Evans Francois revealed that most of the members of this government were chosen by Gen. Cedras himself. Furthermore, he reproached the Army commander in chief for not having agreed to resign in exchange for the lifting of the embargo as was officially promised by the American Government. While recognizing that he was one of the authors of 30 September 1991, Evans Francois recognized that the coup d'etat has not been managed to the benefit of the nation and asked how many Aristides have we created since 30 September? Finally, Mr. Evans Francois showed great concern for the life of his brother, the police chief. Because of his naivete, his loyalty, and his respect for the hierarchy, he risks being eliminated following the example of Col. Jean-Claude Paul, says Evans Francois, specifying that the maneuvers had already started. Here is an excerpt of this letter from Mr. Evans Francois, addressed to Gen. Cedras: [Begin Francois recording in progress] ... Make the gesture that the Haitian Armed Forces, all the Haitian social strata and the whole world, expect from you to safeguard the nation and the only institution that we have left. Only God knows how many concessions Col. Francois is ready to make in the framework of safeguarding the superior interests of this small nation. I would ask you, Mr. General, to behave honestly toward this young officer who, because of his naivete, his loyalty, and his respect for the hierarchy risks being eliminated, following the example of Col. Jean-Claude Paul. The maneuvers have already begun. Mr. General, I, Evans Francois, who have always held up the country's prestige in the Dominican Republic as well as in Washington and the Bahamas, as a diplomat in charge of defending the interests of my compatriots in strict regard for the norms ruling international relations, have decided to address you this open letter, at this watershed where my country's sovereignty is threatened by the most powerful nation in the world, when the precarious life of the officers, noncommissioned officers, soldiers and their families, after being seriously affected by this embargo wrongly managed, are now in danger with the application of new sanctions due to your stubbornness, your ties to power, your greed, and your irresponsible and ambiguous behavior. On 30 September 1991, you made a democratic correction. In June 1993, you supported the parliamentary act recognizing Aristide as president. On 3 July of the same year, you signed, on Governors Island, the agreement affixing 30 October for the return of the president in exile and [word indistinct] your anticipated retirement. You always fought with your reserved tactics, the constitutional government of Robert Malval until you replaced it with the Jonassaint government which was installed under the conditions known by everyone.
