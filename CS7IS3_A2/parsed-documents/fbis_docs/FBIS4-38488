TRUD writes that "the visit can be viewed as a practical step to flesh out the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan on the delimitation of the spheres of competence and mutual delegation of powers". The newspaper emphasises the president's words that "this is the first such treaty. So, the Russian president shows special interest in how it is being carried into life." ROSSIISKIYE VESTI notes that "Yeltsin began his familiarisation with the reform process in Tatarstan with a visit to the kamaz in order to decide on how the automotive workers can be helped". One of major sections of the kamaz -- a motor engine manufacturing plant -- is known to have been gutted out by fire on April 14, last year. "Measures to help overcome this problem are expected to be the basis of one of future economic agreements," the newspaper reports. PRAVDA points out that "the Russia-Tatarstan treaty, undoubtedly, has opened the door for the establishment of constructive relations of trust between the central authority and regions". The newspaper quotes the Russian president as saying that "the treaty between Moscow and Kazan has become a precedent on the basis of which relations between Russia and Chechnya as well as between the Crimea and Ukraine could be settled". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA evaluates the results of the the president's two-day visit as follows: "Yeltsin is satisfied with his stay in Tatarstan. It remains to implement the bilateral treaty between Moscow and Kazan". SEGODNYA (TODAY) newspaper carries an article headlined "Zhirinovskiy Repays Debts to the GMM" about a relationship between the Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and the GMM trust company. The newspaper reproduces Zhirinovskiy's letter, addressed to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. In the letter, Zhirinovskiy requests assistance in settling "relations between the GMM and financial agencies as well as a resumption of televised advertising on state-run broadcasting channels". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA runs an article in which writer Eduard Limonov criticises LDPR leader Zhirinovskiy. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that the MMM joint-stock company has again incurred financial losses. This time owing to an attack of the company's money collectors who were robbed of money amounting to 1,500 million roubles. "None of three robberies has been exposed so far. But then the MMM remains one of few firms which avoid businesslike contacts with the 38 Petrovka criminal investigation department." PRAVDA runs an article by retired Colonel Robert Bykov about Pavel Grachev in his capacity as Russia's defence minister. The writer of the article critically evaluates the minister's activities, pointing out his inconsistency. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) reports that an expedition to the area of the sunken nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets is planned in the coming months. The submarine with two torpedoes is known to have met with an accident in Norwegian Sea. The newspaper points out that the environment can be contaminated as a result of the corrosion of the torpedoes, each of which contains 3,200 grammes of plutonium. "According to the most pessimistic expert forecasts, this may happen at the end of 1995 or early in 1996".
