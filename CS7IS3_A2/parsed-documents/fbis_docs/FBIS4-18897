"We agreed," said the League's Lower House whip Roberto Maroni, "that this would be a government of complete change, which will initiate very strong and incisive reform, rewriting the constitution to reconcile federalism and a presidential republic." This was the second day of contacts between the League and National Alliance, which, with Forza Italia and several smaller parties, were part of the right-wing Freedom Front which scored a victory in last month's general elections. The Freedom Front parties are now seeking consensus on programmes to allow them to form a government. National Alliance and the League said they would be working on a scheme including direct elections of the prime minister, and reorganisation of the state along federal lines, leading to constitutional reforms which would then be put to the public in a referendum. Domenico Fisichella, of National Alliance which sticks firmly to its line of the indivisibility of the state, said after today's meeting that "federalism has tended, throughout history, to unite peoples, and not to break them apart. The counter-balance of a presidential republic is necessary, however." "There are two possibilities as far as a presidential republic goes," Fisichella added. "There is the direct election of the president of the republic, and the direct election of the premier. This second option is the most practical," and will provide the basis for further League-National Alliance talks, he said. Gianfranco Miglio, the League's ideologue, briefed journalists on his long-term view of Italian institutions, stressing that these ideas were not discussed in today's talks: "With the direct election of the prime minister," he said, "the president would lose many of his current functions... He would be reduced to president of the constitutional court." Miglio foresaw an end to the cabinet, which would be replaced by a `directorate' of representatives from the cantons into which the country would be divided. Miglio's League colleagues foresaw a six-month timetable for basic constitutional changes, which would be drawn up by the executive, then presented to parliament for its opinion before being put before the country in a referendum. "The era of parties running things together has come to an end, and the governing majority will therefore make its proposal which will then be debated in its natural place, in parliament," said the League's Senate whip Francesco Speroni. "If the initiative comes from the government," said Roberto Maroni, "then there will be none of the long-windedness which accompanied the bi-cameral reform committee (which overhauled electoral laws) and it will not take long to draw up a proposal to put before the Houses." With Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi having withdrawn from the government-formation fray after his most recent verbal battle with League chief Umberto Bossi, haggling over government posts was apparently absent from today's talks. Some mention of who will fill the premier's office was made, it would seem: "It is up to the president of the republic to decide on who will get a prime ministerial mandate," said Giuseppe Tatarella of National Alliance, who was present for the gathering, "but all signs are pointing towards Berlusconi, in his capacity as leader of the force which came first in Italy." And Forza Italia's chief financial expert, Antonio Martino, looked confident about his party's future role in forging economic policy. Commenting on 1994 forecasts presented by the cabinet today, the economics professor said "there can be no doubt that if our proposals are adopted, the growth in employment and in investments, and the development rate would be far above that predicted by the government." Forza Italia will be back in the picture next Monday when Freedom Front allies get together. "This will be the first meeting in which all the parties which consider themselves government allies will discuss programmes," said Giuseppe Tatarella. "And from Monday on, we will all be looking forward to decisions from President (Oscar Luigi) Scalfaro."
