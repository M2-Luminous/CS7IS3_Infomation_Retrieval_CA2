Fifty Haitians, who were getting ready to embark by boat to the Florida coast, were arrested by police. Those people, mostly peasants, were brought before the court over the weekend. Members of the civilian mission went to the spot to investigate this matter. It should be noted that this was the first significant arrest of potential boat people since provisional President Justice Emile Jonassaint's announcemnt of his government's intention to suppress the departures of boat people. Orders were given to representatives of the Haitian justice system to apply the 17 November 1980 decree, punishing authors and accomplices of efforts to organize clandestine trips to foreign countries. A clear upsurge in departures of Haitian boat people to the Florida coast was observed during the past few weeks, following the announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton of a change in the procedure of direct repatriation of Haitian refugees. They must be authorized to seek political asylum in the United States, on some U.S. ships, or in some other countries. These new measures have not gone into effect yet, however.
