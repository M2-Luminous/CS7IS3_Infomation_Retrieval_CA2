The RPR [Rally for the Republic] president, who used to be rather reserved during the Tuesday [22 February] majority luncheons at the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], unreservedly criticized Edouard Balladur's policy yesterday while enjoying the cassoulet which was served. According to a participant, the RPR president was "very aggressive." He first criticized the prime minister, and more especially [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard for not resuming the nuclear tests. He explained to his interlocutors that in their position he would have done so and that, technically speaking, it was possible. He then wondered how Francois Leotard could still have the courage to face public opinion after lacking courage before the president of the republic. Jacques Chirac, in brilliant form, did not stop there. Taking the tone of "when will there be a decision on....," he then demanded a reform of the electoral system for regional elections. And he demanded a postponement of the municipal elections until after the presidential election. On this last point, Edouard Balladur gave him satisfaction. And Valery Giscard d'Estaing acquiesced. After these three fierce attacks, the mayor of Paris attacked Charles Pasqua. The interior minister is not in favor of the RPR president's wishes with regard to the regional elections. He thinks that there is no panic and he is extremely reticent about regional constituencies. According to him, it would amount to placing the other local communities under supervision and would be a first step toward a Europe of regions. Valery Giscard d'Estaing simply spoke of nothing but Bosnia. The atmosphere at the luncheon, one leading member of the majority said, "was strangely reminiscent of the `Gunslingers.' The atmosphere was very heavy. They are now all firing on Balladur. He is their target." The prime minister looked very pale, seemed "completely cornered," and said virtually nothing.
