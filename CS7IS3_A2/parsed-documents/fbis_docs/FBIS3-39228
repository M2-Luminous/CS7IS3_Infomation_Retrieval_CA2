Mr. Delcroix, who was responding to a question asked by Jacques Devolder of the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats], underlined that British General Michael Rose, commander in chief of the UN troops, was the man primarily responsible for the safety of Belgian troops. "We are not intervening directly to specify what the troops belonging to the Belgian contingent should do there. However, this does not mean that we are not concerned for their safety. Moreover, we are making recommendations on this subject to our commanders on the ground," he said. Nonetheless, the minister did not want to provide any further details on the content of these measures. Meanwhile, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes reiterated that air strikes would be ordered if the Bosnian Serbs failed to comply with the ultimatum imposed on them by NATO on Wednesday evening, and which expires in 10 days. The foreign minister, replying to a question asked by Dirk Van Der Maelen of the SP [Flemish Socialist Party], duly confirmed that NATO would remain intransigent if the Serbs neglected to meet all the conditions laid down in the ultimatum. The ultimatum calls for the Serbs to withdraw their artillery to a distance of 20 km from Sarajevo.
