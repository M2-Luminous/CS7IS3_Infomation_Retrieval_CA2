The afternoon was relatively calm and most of the people abandoned their hideouts to look for something to eat. If this situation continues until tomorrow, it is very probable that a World Food Program [WFP] aircraft will land in the city of Cuito with food for the people who are once again experiencing a serious food crisis. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports. If the calm experienced since early this afternoon continues until tomorrow, WFP aircraft could land in the city bringing food. If the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] does not again shell the city in the coming few hours, the thousands and thousands of residents hope to receive assistance from international humanitarian organizations to save them from famine which is killing people, particularly in Cunje commune. This afternoon we learned that four orphans, under the control of the provincial branch of the Social Reintegration Ministry, were killed and six others wounded in the latest UNITA shellings.
