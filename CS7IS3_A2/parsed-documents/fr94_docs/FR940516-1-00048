FR940516-1-00048 FR940516-1-00003 The use of seafloor SDV's would preclude the use of J-tube methods of riser installation since the valve could not be passed through the J-tube. Sea-bottom conditions may dictate the location of SDV's. Protective coverage would be necessary to prevent trawl damage. Heavy valves, should they become suspended, will cause additional stress on the pipeline. The SDV's located near the waterline would be vulnerable to collisions and wave damage. Question _What actuation and control system options are available for placement of the SDV on the seafloor (e.g., pneumatic, hydraulic, electrical)? Would actuation backup capability be necessary or desirable? Response _Actuators can be powered by line pressure, stored gas pressure, or hydraulics. Fail-safe operation would be desirable. Pneumatic and hydraulic systems are the most reliable for subsea service. Manual operation is also necessary. Electrical systems could be used, but a backup system would be desirable. It is also necessary to provide manual diver valve actuation for emergency situations. Question _What emergency support systems (e.g., fire loop system, ESD system, subsurface safety system) would activate the subsea SDV? Should the conditions of actuation be different than for an SDV located on the platform? Response _All ESD and fire loop systems could operate the SDV. There would need to be a control line between the valve actuator and the platform. This could pose a maintenance problem. Pressure sensors could also be installed for the case of a ruptured or blocked line. This would require a relief valve, which brings up the following question. Where would the relief valve relieve to, the seafloor? The foregoing provides yet another reason to have the SDV above water. Question _For seafloor placement of the SDV, what would be the optimum location in distance from the platform? Response _Distance is not very important. The closer to the platform, the better. This would keep the control lines the shortest. Placing the valve 40 feet below the water surface on the riser would make it accessible to divers while providing its structural protection. The location of an SDV relative to the platform should ideally be decided by a quantified risk analysis. The optimum distance for placement of an SDV should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering water depth, anchorage areas, fishing areas, and minimizing the inventory between the platform and the SDV. Question _What effect would burial (either intentional or unintentional) of the valve and actuator have on maintenance and operational reliability? Response _Burial would not hurt the SDV, but it would make it harder for divers to find it. Burial would increase the diving costs associated with maintenance. Burial would preclude using a remotely operated vehicle for inspection and maintenance and should be avoided. Question _What measures would be necessary to protect a subsea valve and control system from the following effects? (a) Temperature. Response _The SDV and control system need to be designed to operate in internal and external environments by selection of suitable materials. (b) Hydrates. Response _Hydrate formation could prevent subsea SDV operation. Glycol injection lines would be required in addition to control lines supplemented with glycol tanks, pumps, and attendant equipment. (c) Permafrost. Response _Not feasible. (d) Hydrogen sulfide. Response _The effects of hydrogen sulfide could be controlled with special alloys or inhibitors. (e) Carbon dioxide. Response _The effects of carbon dioxide could be controlled with special alloys or inhibitors. (f) Stress cracking. Response. _The effects of stress cracking could be controlled with special alloys. (g) Other effects identified by commenters. Response. _Control lines and connections could be damaged by boat or fishing activity. Protection will be necessary to protect small lines from being hooked by trawl boats and anchors. Sand production could jeopardize the operation of a subsea valve.
