It is a dirty piece of writing, full of lies and absurd accusations against democracy and President Sali Berisha. On the basis of the penal code and the law on the press, this newspaper is being sequestered while the author of the article, Haxhi Lleshi, profiting from the indifference of the executor of the law, leaves the country for Debar. [passage omitted] After throwing mud, in such a base manner, at the Number-One figure in the Albanian democratic state, why did Haxhi Lleshi go to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], specifically, to the city of Debar? From the reports of well-informed and reliable eyewitnesses, we learn that Haxhi Lleshi was accompanied on his trip to Debar by an active member of the extreme left, a member of the leadership of the Socialist Party, Sabit Brokaj. During his stay in Debar, Sabit Brokaj kept out of sight, far away from the meetings and out of the view of the residents of Debar. At the wedding of a cousin of H. Lleshi's, where people were having a good time and Haxhi Lleshi tried to get them to sing partisan songs and songs in honor of Enver [Hoxha], Mr. Brokaj was off in a room by himself, far away from the wedding guests. Also, during Haxhi Lleshi and Sabit Brokaj's visit to that city, there was movement of individuals supporting H. Lleshi, in the direction of Gostivar, Tetovo, Skopje, and Belgrade. Nevzat Halili, the Macedonian card in the anti-Albanian policy in Macedonia, was fired. During this time, the Albanian Socialist Party did not say a thing about the problems and activity of the PPD [Party for Democratic Prosperity], because, it appears, things were going just as they had planned in their strategy in support of the Macedonian social-communists. The silence was broken and the strategy failed with the exposure of the Nevzat Halilis, the elements who were sabotaging the Albanian cause in Macedonia. In this crisis, specific circles in Macedonia are working with intensity in two directions. This cannot be done without the help of others, especially traditional friends. First, with subversive elements, to extend the crisis of the splitting up of groupings, to obstruct the rapprochement as long as possible so as to make it difficult to hold the Congress prior to the general census which will be held in Macedonia. Therefore, divide and conquer. Second, to put in the elected forums of the PPD branches, upto the PPD leadership, Macedonophiles, supporters of the former UDB [Yugoslav State Security Administration] in the guise of Albanian nationalism (who, until now, have remained in the shadows) and who, tomorrow, will continue the anti-Albanian policy of the Nevzat Halilis. The PSSh [Albanian Socialist Pary] leadership has a clear and concrete political strategy in regard to the ethnic issue in the Albanian regions in Macedonia, Kosovo, and elsewhere. based on the political strategy of Enver Hoxha, which it has never abandoned but which it claims is a taboo in its practice. Haxhi Lleshi, the son of Halil Lleshi, a sworn Serbophile and anti-Albanian, is facilitating the progress of the Macedonian anti-Albanian policy. There is no shortage of collaborationists to work with the lynchers of the Albanians. They have been and still are people without personality, people with narrow interests who, for various nefarious reasons, have fallen into the swamp of treason. The people recognized them even though they were camouflaged and they gave them hatred and contempt as recompense. The attitude of the citizens of Debar, etc., toward Haxhi Lleshi, that compromised figure of Enver Hoxha's regime, is proof of this.
