The signing of the acts of accession within the framework of this meeting of heads of state and chiefs of government has become possible owing to the overwhelming vote of consent by the European Parliament on 4 May 1994. At that time, I assessed the favorable vote in our parliament as a decision of historic consequence, and I cordially welcomed the future members in the European Union. I would like to corroborate this today. You are cordially welcome. Your membership will strengthen parliamentary democracy in Europe. The social and democratic model in your countries, your political culture, your commitment to unambiguous and openness in policy -- these are the virtues for which the European Parliament showed its respect by voting for the accession of the four candidates on 4 May. Is it not a unique event in the history of the European Union and its previous enlargements that the countries that now join us will be granted transition periods, while the European Union binds itself to raise the standards of environmental directives to the standards of the new members within four years? For the European Parliament, the debate on the enlargement shortly before the end of the legislative period was probably the most difficult decision of the past five years. All deputies were aware of the great political consequence involved. The delays in the negotiation schedule and the resultant pressure of time were not caused by the European Parliament. All the more, we must thank the Greek Presidency, which is hosting the meeting today, for having made a huge effort to bring about and ensure the completion of the necessary documents. It has thereby allowed the European Parliament to discuss the issue in a matter-of-fact debate. Through this debate, the broad public has become aware that this parliament of the European Union has decisive rights and powers and is able to deal with them in a responsible way. Our parliament has often demonstrated this by its right of co-decision on legislative and budgetary problems, even though it may have done so in a less spectacular and publicity-effective way. The European Parliament did not find it easy to make a decision on the enlargement. The reasons are known and are not attributable to the new members. The European Parliament was and is of the opinion that the inner institutional reform of the European Union should not have been considered of lesser importance than the enlargement. We have always insisted that the review of EU institutions, which is necessary for the functioning of the Community, should take place simultaneously and in parallel with the membership negotiations. This criticism applies to our own governments and the EU Council of Ministers. Yet, we did give our approval, because we rely on the pledge made by the chiefs of government, saying that the European Parliament would be involved, on the basis of absolute equality, in the work of the preparatory group for the government conference in 1996, and because we believe that the contribution of the new member states will be in the sense of strengthening the democratic structures within the European Union. With the enlargement of the Union by Norway, Austria, Finland, and Sweden, the geography of the European Union will change. The EU area will grow by 50 percent and will extend beyond the polar circle. For the first time, the European Union will also have a common border with Russia. This fact alone symbolizes new tasks for the enlarged Union. In this connection, I consider it a particularly good sign that the European Union has also signed the partnership agreement with Russia today in parallel with the membership acts. However, the European Union is also facing huge internal tasks. We can only cope with the crisis of growth and employment by common effort. A prerequisite for this is a large and strong European Union whose members are oriented on the common basic values and convictions of the founding fathers, and which as a whole is able to win its citizens' confidence anew time and again. The fourth direct elections of the European Parliament have shown how necessary this will also be in the future. The favorable vote for membership in Austria shows how people can be won over for this project through comprehensive information. The newly elected European Parliament will be a reliable partner on this road -- as of 1995, also with the deputies from the new member states. The European Parliament will continue to be the democratic conscience of the European Union and, soon, the advocate of 370 million citizens who expect this European Union to ensure peace and freedom, prosperity and health, employment and social justice.
