Prathin also said he was "not confident at all" that Thai police would be able arrest the culprit behind the foiled attempt to carry out what could have been the worst sabotage on Thai soil. He added it was most likely the criminals had fled overseas. "I have sent the sketches of two suspects to four countries, which I can't name at the moment, in the hope they may know their identities," Prathin said. Those countries have official organizations which keep records of international terrorists, he added. Asked if Thai police would be able to arrest the culprits, Prathin said: "I'm not confident at all." He added that he was not afraid of the "political consequences" of his remark. Pratin said the large amount of fertilizer found in a truck abandoned by an Arab-looking man near the Israeli Embassy in March 11 after a minor accident was uria nitrate, not ammonium nitrate as previously reported. "I've checked with foreign experts and it turns out the bomb does not have as much destructive power as we first thought," he said. Meanwhile, a police source said one of the terrorists behind the conspiracy is believed to be among three men still at large after bombing the World Trade Centre in New York in February last year. The source said Mir Aimal Kansi 30, is one of the three suspects. The combined rewards for information leading to his arrest in connection with the worst terrorist act on US soil amounts to $2 million. Police suspect this man was behind Bangkok's truck-bomb attack but that he fled the country through a border point in Songkhla province last week. The source said officials at Sadao district, on the border with Malaysia, remembered a man "who looked like an Arab" crossing the frontier on March 15. They had photocopied his fake Pakistani passport. The source said the picture in the passport looked like Kansi except that his haircut had been changed. About 300 senior metropolitan police officers attended a special meeting yesterday on how to cope with saboteurs using explosives. The meeting at the metropolitan police headquarters was held because "metropolitan police have no knowledge about how to cope with suspicious objects or explosive materials," according to Pol Maj Gen Somchai Praphatpakdi, deputy Bangkok police chief.
