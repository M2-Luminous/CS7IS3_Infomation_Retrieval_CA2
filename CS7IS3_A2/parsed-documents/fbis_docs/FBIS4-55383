The amendment will enable Slovak citizens who do not permanently reside in Slovakia to participate in the elections providing they vote in Slovakia. Ex-Justice Minister Katarina Tothova said that the amendment did not stipulate any registration of these citizens, so theoretically they could vote in as many constituencies as the transport system allowed them to get to. Ex-Finance Minister Julius Toth said that citizens were allowed to vote several times in various constituencies providing they had valid federal passports and claimed they had permanent residence in the Czech Republic. "We are likely to have more voters in Slovakia than citizens," Toth said. Tothova said that the electoral law also had holes in that it enabled politicians to run on another party's ticket without their describing themselves as independent candidates or creating a coalition with the party for which they would run. Theoretically, this would mean that parliament could be entered by parties which would otherwise not stand a chance. The government Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) of Jan Carnogursky has recently offered to individual politicians from other right-wing parties to run on a KDH ticket.
