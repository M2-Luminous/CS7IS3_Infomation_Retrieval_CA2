FR940323-1-00030 FR940323-1-00005 III. Response to Public Comments Because of the large volume of public comments that we usually receive on notices of proposed rulemaking, we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will address all public comments received on this document in the preamble to the document in which these proposed regulations are issued in final form. IV. Paperwork Burden Sections 435.612(f), 435.615(e), 435.907, 435.911, 435.918, 435.932, 435.935, 436.612(e), 436.615(e), 447.51, and 447.60 contain information collection and reporting requirements that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). We have submitted these proposed regulations to OMB for review. The reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 6 hours per response. A notice will be published in the Federal Register when approval is obtained. Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of information collection must be addressed to the specified office indicated under the `` ADDRESSES '' section of this preamble. V. Regulatory Analysis We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of RFA, we consider all providers and suppliers of health care as small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of a small entity. We are not preparing a RFA because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of providers and suppliers. Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital which is located outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. We are not preparing a rural hospital impact statement because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Although this proposed rule is not an ``economically significant'' rule under Executive Order 12866, the statutory changes which are the basis of this proposed rule, are substantial. We present below a voluntary anaylsis of these effects. This proposed rule would incorporate in regulations, and in some cases interpret, statutory changes that are already in effect. In cases where it was necessary to provide interpretation, we have relied on the legislative history of the statutory provisions, when available, for the best reading of the provision. The statutory provisions are effective on the statutorily established date, regardless of whether or not we have issued final regulations. The statutory changes that expand eligibility groups and coverage of services will increase Medicaid program expenditures independently of the promulgation of this rule. Costs associated with these proposed regulations are the result of legislation or due to the interpretation of statutory changes already in effect. Therefore, these costs have been included in the Medicaid budget estimates. It is difficult to predict what the fiscal impact will be since several provisions provide Medicaid coverage to certain groups at the option of States. Another unknown factor is the additional number of pregnant women, infants, and children and disabled, elderly, and homeless individuals who will be offered services that previously were not covered by the States and the type and cost of these specific services. We know costs for States will rise as they begin to furnish the additional services that will be required if medically necessary. The following data reflects our estimate of medical costs attributable to expansion of services under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;203; the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;360; the Family Support Act of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;485; the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public Law 101&hyph;239; and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;508. The following estimates are based on data from the census, current population survey, and average cost using Medicaid data: Estimated Federal Costs [Dollars in millions] 1Law 1Provisions 1FY93 1FY94 1FY95 1FY96 OBRA&hyph;86 MCH* $250 $285 $325 $370 ‚ê£ eld/disab** 245 295 355 425 OBRA&hyph;87 MCH 380 440 510 590 OBRA&hyph;88 MCH 165 180 195 210 OBRA&hyph;89 MCH 335 355 380 405 OBRA&hyph;90 MCH 280 415 565 730 n,n,s Totals 1655 1970 2330 2730
