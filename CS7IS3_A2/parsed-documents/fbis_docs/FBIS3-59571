Titanium nitride is the hard material most widely used to coat tools such as drills and milling cutters to enhance their mechanical resistance. It will also perform a significant role in future memory chip generations, where it will form the barrier preventing the semiconductor material, silicon, from diffusing into the metallic strip conductors. The Fraunhofer researchers had a number of tricks up their sleeves: They used tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium as a volatile metal compound, which they fed into an ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) plasma together with nitrogen or ammonia. An ECR plasma is a particular form of excited gas state in which a magnetic field and an alternating electrical field are used to project and accelerate electrons onto spiral paths, a highly efficient method of activating gas molecules by inducing collision with electrons. Golden Coatings at Boiling Temperature The researchers in Hamburg manipulate the gases in this plasma in such a way that pure crystalline titanium nitride layers with ideal material properties can be precipitated at a temperature as low as 100 degrees Celsius; this cannot be accomplished below 500 degrees Celsius in conventional processes. The test parameters are set in such a way that the breakdown of the organic metal compound can be piloted to keep the layers free of the carbon impurities that would otherwise usually contaminate them. The project was financed by the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology and managed by the VDI-TZ [Association of German Engineers Technology Center] in Duesseldorf. The low precipitation temperature makes the process attractive primarily for microelectronics applications and for coating temperature-sensitive substrates such as plastic. About 50 research teams worldwide have been working for around 10 years on precipitating this valuable substance from volatile organic metal compounds.
