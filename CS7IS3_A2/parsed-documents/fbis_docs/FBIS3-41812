Provisional figures issued by the Department of Health show a record 1,017,763 patients awaiting admission at the end of June, compared with 994,974 at the end of March. The figures also show an increase between March and June of 15.6 percent in patients waiting more than a year -- a slightly bigger rise than that in Labour's unofficial count published on Monday. Labour estimated that the total waiting list had passed a million, based on an unofficial tally for the end of April. But until last night neither the department nor ministers had admitted that the psychologically important barrier had been breached for the first time. The official figures for June show the same totals for the 14 English health regions, as Labour had collected, but show 11,930 people, compared with Labour's 10,429, waiting for treatment at the specialist hospitals run as special health authorities. This includes 275 patients waiting more than two years, despite Patient's Charter commitment that nobody should face this delay.
