At the time of the survey, the victory by the Hungarian Socialist Party in the first round of elections was known, and it seemed very likely that, as a governmental party, the Socialists would have a determining role in the country's life. Therefore, the conclusions drawn from the replies show what performance people are expecting of the new government. The outgoing government "was found wanting" because everyday living conditions and the circumstances determining the narrower and wider scope of life were unfavorable. The country will judge the performance of the government that is being formed and the parties that are setting it up in four years' time. As for the present, all in all, it can be said that the new government is facing serious burdens regarding the population's expectations. Whether it is the macroeconomic conditions, personal living conditions, or issues affecting the political sphere, the majority or people expect as a minimum that the situation will not deteriorate. However, as is shown by a detailed analysis of the data, it is a -- realistic or unrealistic -- desire of many people for conditions better than the current conditions to emerge. On the subject of the country's economic situation in the next four years, the population's living standards, the unemployment rate, the level of inflation, the number of poor and rich people, and the financial situation of their own family, some one-tenth of people (7-10 percent) cannot choose between the positive and negative alternatives offered. Almost twice as many or even more people (17-27 percent) cannot or will not express their views on the expected changes of the country's foreign political relations, the political structure, and the freedom of the press in this brief period. If we only look at people who have an opinion and are willing to express it, we can establish that half (49 percent) of them believe that the country's economic situation "will improve" in the coming four years. More than one-tenth (14 percent) have an opposite view -- "it will deteriorate" -- and more than one-third (37 percent) believe that the country's economic situation "will remain similar to the current situation." It has to be mentioned here that the surveyed people did not select the two extreme points of the five- point scale of values -- "it will improve significantly," and "it will deteriorate significantly." This also applies to the further questions that, at the same time, indicate that the expectations, whether positive or negative, are moderate. Therefore, the public attitude is characterized neither by overt optimism nor by dark pessimism. The overall picture is less favorable when people talk about the expected living standards of the population. The proportion of those who expect the living standards "to remain similar to the current one" (41 percent) is almost the same as of those who expect improvement (39 percent). One-fifth (20 percent) expect a deterioration of living conditions. Therefore, 10 percent fewer people expect the improvement of living standards than the development of the economy, and 6 percent more people mention their deterioration than economic decline. As for the financial situation of the families, the proportion of those expecting improvement is even smaller (34 percent) than the proportion of those who expect a positive change in the population's living standards. Half (50 percent) of those who replied do not believe in either a positive or a negative change, and 16 percent believe that the coming four years will bring a negative change in the family's financial situation. Therefore, the further away we get from the macro-sphere and the closer to people's everyday living conditions, the more reserved the expectations become. This is also supported by people's views on the expected level of inflation. According to a relative majority (42 percent), inflation will be higher than the current level in the coming four years, and similar proportions (28 percent) hope that the level of inflation will "decrease" or that it will "remain similar to the current level." Expectations as regards the economy and unemployment are closely related to each other in people's way of thinking. A relative majority (45 percent) of people believe that the number of unemployed people will decrease in the next four years; according to 23 percent, the situation will be the opposite of this; and according to 32 percent, the number of unemployed will not change. Three times as many (64 percent) of those who believe in economic improvement also believe in the reduction of unemployment, than those (20 percent) who believe in further deterioration of the economy. Conversely, more than half (55 percent) of the latter, and 10 percent of the former believe that the number of the unemployed will exceed the current level in the next four years. Although these are cutting issues that directly or indirectly affect the everyday conditions, people's views are less determined by their social situation than by their party affiliations. The calculations clearly show this. As an example, let us take the expectations regarding the financial situation of families and inflation. In both cases, positive expectations are more influenced by the fact whether someone had voted for the MSZP or the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] than by the fact that the person is at the top or bottom -- as unemployed -- of the social hierarchy. This "logic" is valid in all cases. The voters of the Socialists and -- although more moderately -- of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] expect a better performance in the next four years than the supporters of the Smallholders, Christian Democrats, or the Hungarian Democrats. The Gallup survey also touched upon the future size of the two opposite ends of society, namely the poor and the rich. The same proportions of people (46 and 47 percent) believe that, in the next four years, there will be more poor and more rich people in the country than currently. However, while one-quarter (26 percent) trust that the number of the poor will decrease and 28 percent believe it likely that the current proportions will remain, 12 percent expect the number of rich people to decrease and 41 percent believe that their number will not change. Based on the replies given to the two questions, the Gallup prepared an indicator that shows how people see the "movement" of these two social groups in the future. Accordingly, the replies can be placed in three groups. The majority (51 percent) expect the same kind of movement in the two groups, namely either both groups will increase, both will decrease, or neither will change. According to the second group (30 percent), the number of rich people will increase more than that of the poor, and according to the third group (19 percent), the number of the poor will increase more than that of the rich. Regarding the proportions of the latter two groups among the voters of parliamentary parties, it can be established that three times as many MSZP voters and twice as many SZDSZ voters expect the population to become richer than to become poorer (MSZP: rich 44, poor 13 percent; SZDSZ: 28 and 13 percent respectively). As for the voters of the other parties, the proportions of those who expect one or the other group to increase are nearly the same. The voters of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] are an exception to this: More (22 percent) of them expect the number of poor people to increase than that of the rich (16 percent). The public opinion survey only touched on the sphere of politics. With the help of a question -- that has been asked many times in the past years -- it examined where people place Hungary in the dimension of dictatorship and democracy, where they think it stood at the end of the 1980's, and where it will be in four years' time. A nine-point scale was used where a 1 meant that the country's political setup is "dictatorial" and a 9 meant "democratic." Comparing the results of the survey six months ago -- October 1993 -- with the end of May results, no change can be seen as regards the future. In October 1993, the average for "now" was 5.65, and in May 1994 it was 5.61. Both values indicate that the country's "current" political system is considered to be more democratic than dictatorial. As for the near future, people expected further expansion of democracy at both surveys (October 6.95, May 6.73). The voters of two parties -- the MSZP and the MDF -- are worth mentioning whether we are looking at views on the present or the future. As opposed to the stability of views typical of the other parties, the voters of these two parties have a more positive view of the "present" situation than they did six months ago. However, as regards the future, the views of these two groups change in the opposite direction. The expectations of the MDF supporters have become less favorable -- 7.45 in October and 6.36 in May -- and that of the MSZP supporters have become more favorable -- it increased from 6.66 to 7.36. Let us also note that the Socialist supporters are the only group whose expectations for the future changed in a positive direction. People have a less favorable view of the past -- the political system of the 1980's -- now (4.23) than six months ago (4.78). This applies to all voters, including the Socialists, regardless of the party affiliation. However, it also has to be seen that the views of the Socialist supporters on the 1980's was better both in October (5.45) and in May (4.80), than among the voters of other parties. The general tendency that the Socialist voters expect more and better in the next four years is also manifest in their views on the freedom of the press. According to 41 percent of the replies, the freedom of the press will increase in the next four years, half (52 percent) do not expect any change, and 7 percent expect it to be reduced. Six out of 10 MSZP voters (59 percent) and four out of 10 SZDSZ or Fidesz voters (44 and 43 percent) expect a positive change in this area. In the other camp, two to three people out of 10 hold this view: 17 percent of MDF voters, 20 percent of Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] voters, and 29 percent of Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] voters. During the election campaign, the question of how Hungary's foreign relations with the Western and neighboring countries will change was raised many times. The results of the survey show that an absolute or relative majority of people also expect improvement in this area. According to 45 percent of them, the country's Western relations will improve in the next four years, 12 percent believe that they will deteriorate, and four out of 10 people (43 percent) believe that they will not change. As for relations with the neighboring countries, even more people expect positive changes. The view of the absolute majority (54 percent) is that Hungary's relations with the neighboring countries will improve, and 7 percent have an opposite view. According to the rest of the people (39 percent), no change will take place. Whichever aspect we look at, significantly more Socialist supporters expect positive changes and a better governmental performance than the voters of any other party. This is particularly true for our relations with the neighboring countries. Almost three-quarters (72 percent) of the MSZP voters expect our relations with our neighbors to improve in the next four years compared to now. Some 38 percent of the MDF voters expect the same.
