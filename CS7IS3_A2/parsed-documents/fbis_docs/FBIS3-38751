The participants, including about 400 members of "autonomous groups," marched to the former party headquarters of the Nationalist Front (NF), which has been banned. The largely peaceful demonstration was accompanied by a heavy police presence. According to a police release on Sunday, 80 persons were arrested before and during the rally. Thirty of them will be reported for, among other things, violating the Arms Law and for the ban on hiding one's face. The police officials seized baseball bats, knives, tear gas, one ax, and a rubber hammer. Before the rally, 49 members of the "rightist scene" were arrested, because the police had received information about planned acts of violence to be committed against the demonstration. The men had stayed in the former NF party headquarters.
