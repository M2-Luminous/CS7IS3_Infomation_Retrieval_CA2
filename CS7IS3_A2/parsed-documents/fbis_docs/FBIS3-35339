FBIS3-35339 "drnes036_c_94001" FBIS-NES-94-036 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Feb 1994 Egypt Minister Denies Government Under `Threat,' Comments TA2202152694 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 22 Feb 94 pp A1, A10 TA2202152694 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Report by Gay Bekhor and Aluf Ben] [Excerpt] In an interview with HA'ARETZ on 21 February, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa reacted to the various publications which have been saying that Mubarak's regime is under a threat: "This is idle talk, an interpretation based on wrong assumptions, a serious exaggeration, a misunderstanding of the reality in Egypt, and a significant deviation from the truth." This is the first reaction by an Egyptian official to reports published in the British weekly SUNDAY TIMES according to which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that there is a real chance that President Mubarak will not be able to hold on to his position due to the pressure of Islamic terror. Foreign Minister Musa rejected these reports outright. "This is not Islamic extremism, but instead extremism in the name of Islam. These extremists have nothing to do with Islam." Lashing out at religious terror elements in Egypt several days ago, Husni Mubarak made similar remarks. Asked for the best way to handle Islamic terror in his country, Musa said: "The only way is to have terrorism curbed by the government and the security forces, which they are doing. At the same time, the reasons for this extremism are known. The long-term economic reform plan will take care of the extremism." During the interview Minister Musa asked if we would use the term "terror activity," and not "Islamic terror activity." He explained that "the government is now taking very powerful steps on the ground in terms of security and maintaining public order. I believe, therefore, that terror activity will diminish." Musa did not specify the number of supporters of the Egyptian terror and the extent of their influence, but said: "I believe the figures are on the decline because the reforms and the determined activities against those gangs will clearly diminish their abilities." Answering a question on who is behind terror activity in Egypt and who should be blamed for it, he said: "Many domestic and external elements are behind the terror. I would rather not elaborate." When asked whether it is Iran, he said he would not mention names. He repeated that "the claim that the activities of the terror gangs in Egypt might destabilize the very existence of the current regime is definitely an exaggerated interpretation." U.S. evaluation elements have estimated that Mubarak's regime is in danger, but amended their assessment and now believe that the Egyptian administration is stable enough and has managed to develop the appropriate tools for dealing with fundamentalist terror. A report received in Jerusalem several days ago says that the updated assessments of the U.S. evaluation elements indicates that the Egyptian regime is basically stable and able to deal with crises. The evaluation also says that Egypt has a long tradition of and broad support for the government which has managed to absorb shocks in the past, such as after the death of President 'Abd-al-Nasir in 1970 and the murder of President Anwar al-Sadat in 1981. According to the U.S. evaluation, the Egyptian regime will endure even if Mubarak personally loses power. The evaluation elements disagree on whether fundamentalism is a different phenomenon in each Middle East country or whether there exists a "domino effect" and mutual influence of fundamentalist Islam acts in Algiers, Egypt, Jordan, and the Gaza Strip. The annual intelligence report, presented to the government some four weeks ago by Major General Uri Sagi, head of the Israel Defense Forces Intelligence Branch, says that fundamentalism would be a source of concern in the long run if it succeeds in toppling the regime of one of the neighboring countries such as Egypt or Jordan. At the same time it does not pose an immediate threat. The report states that there is no danger that the Egyptian Government would fall this year. Israeli analysts are following the situation in Egypt and have recently presented the political echelons with reports on the Muslim movements there, but did not find that the Egyptian Government is in danger.
