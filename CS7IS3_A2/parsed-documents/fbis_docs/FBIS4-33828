"Our greatest goal is to carry out a genuine reform of the social, political, economic, and moral systems," Duran-Ballen stated in a national radio and television broadcast. He revealed a seven-point questionnaire for the referendum, including the prospect of convening a constituent assembly on 2 January 1995. The proposed structural reform process seeks "to end the current institutional plan, which only promotes useless confrontations, absurd skirmishes, obstacles among the functions of the state, discredit, the degradation of justice, and, even worse, a total disregard of the fundamental mission of the state: to look after the welfare of its citizens," he added. The other questions refer to the possibility -- now banned -- of electing citizens who are not members of political parties. Other questions focused on retaining or removing the prevailing capacity of the deputies to manage public funds and approving the state budget and the reelection -- also banned -- for any popularly elected position, including those of president, vice president, and deputies. The sixth question focuses on the issue of whether deputies must be elected during the first or the second presidential elections every four years. Currently, deputies are elected in the first round, which makes Congress very heterogeneous. The last question asks for a referendum regarding the current prohibition on acquiring a second nationality without losing Ecuadoran citizenship. Last April, Duran-Ballen convened the referendum with a similar questionnaire for 1 May 1994. However, his request was "illegally" denied by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], he underscored today. TSE members then argued that holding a referendum on constitutional reforms was possible only if the deputies previously had directly denied the topics being voted on.
