FBIS4-52277 "dreas089_d_94034" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 South Korea Anniversary of Kwangju Uprising Commemorated Anniversary of Kwangju Uprising Commemorated SK0905032194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0303 GMT 9 May 94 SK0905032194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- On May 18, 1980, the people of Kwangju rose up against a group of Army officers who seized power for what was to become the Fifth Republic, leading to hundreds of citizens being killed or injured in clashes with the Army. "The May 18 Kwangju Democratization Movement" marks its 14th anniversary this year with a civil movement in place to shed a new historical light on the tragic incident. As part of the movement to paint a true picture of the incident, dissident groups and some opposition lawmakers are moving to file a criminal suit against former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u and others who allegedly led the Army's suppression of the Kwangju uprising, apparently encouraged by the Kim Yong-sam government's efforts to "re-evalutate historical incidents." These groups formed in March "the national committee looking into truths of the May 18 uprising and upholding the uprising's spirit" to prepare programs marking the incident's 14th anniversary. The committee is comprised of over 300 members representing religious, political, academic and journalism circles as well as victims of the incident, and the co-chairmen include Christian pastors Kang Sin-sok and Kim Sang-kun and Rep. Kim Won-ki of the opposition Democratic Party. The committee will hold memorial services on May 12 for those killed in the uprising at Kwangju's Mangwol-tong cemetery, where they now lie in peace, to avoid crowds of visitors on the anniversary day. On May 13, the committee will hold a press conference in Seoul to demand judicial action against former Presidents Chon and No and others accused of killing and injuring Kwangju residents during the uprising. It will also call on the government to delve into the truth behind the incident, saying President Kim Yong-sam's civilian government has not yet shed a full light on the tragedy. After the press conference, representatives of the committee will visit the public prosecutor's office to file a criminal suit against 34 persons accused of being responsible for the deaths and injuries, including former Presidents Chon and No, together with a petition signed by Chong Tong-nyon and 319 other victims for judicial action against the 34. Rep. Chong Sang-yong of the opposition Democratic Party, who sits on the committee, says shedding a new historical light on the May 18 Kwangju democratization movement should entail punishment of those responsible for the tragedy. The committee will then hold an academic conference in the National Assembly on May 14 to re-evaluate the historical significance of the Kwangju democratization movement and divulge the "fictitiousness" of the Kim Yong-sam government's probe of the Army's suppression of the movement. The conference will also deal with the issue of punishing those responsible for the armed suppression of the uprising, a committee official says. The national committee will focus its 14th anniversary programs on a historical re-evaluation of the Kwangju democratization movement, with a view to giving it a proper position in history, another committee official says.
