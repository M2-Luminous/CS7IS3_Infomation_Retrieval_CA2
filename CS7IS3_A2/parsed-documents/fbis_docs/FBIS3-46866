Previously, the Business Economics Department -- which handles trade negotiations, research and data compilation-- was the responsibility of Deputy Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai. Mr Chaloemphon, who was appointed when Phaithun Kaeothong moved to become deputy labour minister, made no secret of the fact that he was not interested in the Business Economics Department, prefering an agency that has practical activities inside Thailand. Mr Uthai has given him responsibility for the Insurance Department in a direct swap, dropping the Export Promotion Department and adding the Commercial Registration Department. Deputy Minister Churin Laksanawisit is taking responsibility for the Export Promotion Department, relinquishing the Commercial Registration Department, while also retaining responsibility for the Intellectual Property Department. Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap will take charge of the Internal Trade Department.
