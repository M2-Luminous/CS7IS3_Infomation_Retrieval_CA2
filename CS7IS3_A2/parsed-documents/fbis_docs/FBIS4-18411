These are comments by Otto Schlecht, chairman of the Ludwig Erhard Foundation and long-time undersecretary in the Ministry of Economics, on the SPD's latest tax plans in a conversation with DIE WELT. Schlecht appeals to the coalition and the opposition to improve the basic tax provisions in the interest of international competitiveness--thus to reduce the tax burden--and recommends as a "second best solution." tax preferences for risk-intensive tangible assets. "Growth and jobs must come before redistribution and increases in income. Businesses have to be confident that they will not be burdened excessively," Schlecht suggests. For 1994 and 1995 the per capita tax load is moving toward 50 percent. "That is statism. We have not only reached the end of the flag pole; we have to go back to the 45 percent of 1989." We have to make room for spending through energetic savings. In this connection, he accused the government of "political inaction." Both sides, the coalition and the SPD, have not yet detailed their future tax policy. "But this is urgently necessary. The economy is waiting for this." The government should stipulate a time limit for the solidarity surcharge and not pass any new tax increases. Schlecht makes a fundamental distinction between the coalition's solidarity surcharge and the SPD's special levy. From the government's viewpoint, the solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent of the tax liability is "a necessary evil, an emergency measure for a few years." The SPD, however, wants the 10-percent special levy to be "permanent" as a social instrument of redistribution. If 25 percent of the tax payers paid 70 percent of the wage and personal income tax, there could be no talk of a "fairness gap." To prevent any further transfer of jobs abroad, we have to level the tax differences with respect to European and other competitors by reducing the profits tax rates and eliminating taxes unrelated to profits (industrial capital tax and industrial property tax). If this "best solution" does not meet with success owing to a lack of votes in the Bundesrat, Schlecht recommends as the "second best solution" tax preferences for risk capital--not only for corporate profits. "We have a lack of risk capital for new investments." There should also be more and more examples of employee participation in investments (participation wages). Management and labor are chiefly to blame for the fact that this "has never worked" in the past, he says. "We need a moderate wage policy for years to come."
