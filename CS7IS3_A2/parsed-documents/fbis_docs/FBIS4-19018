Forza Italia MPs warned the Rome government "not to compromise the issue of EU membership to Slovenia and Croatia with any irreversible acts" at the Brussels meeting, referring to possible acceptance by this government of future membership for the two former Yugoslav republics on Italy's northeastern borders. The motion gives a clearer indication of what the foreign policies of a future government under the Freedom Pole (Forza Italia, Northern League and National Alliance) may be with respect to the two neighboring republics. Those borders and former Italian territory now belonging to Slovenia and Croatia, as well as the issue of rights for the Italian minorities there, are being cited by the neofascist National Alliance as reasons for vetoing EU membership. Forza Italia MPs, as their allies, evidently fear that Andreatta on April 20 may commit future Italian governments to grant Slovenia and Croatia EU membership. "This government that will be in charge for just a few more days, representing political balances that have been turned upside down by the popular elections, in recent weeks has taken decisions that may jeopardize irrevocably delicate issues that are often crucial for future developments," the Forza Italia motion claimed. National Alliance wants to renegotiate three postwar treaties signed with former Yugoslavia and wants to negotiate special rights for Italians living in the two republics.
