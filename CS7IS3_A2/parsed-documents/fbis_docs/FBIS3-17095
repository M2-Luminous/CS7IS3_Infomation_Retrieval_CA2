According to Karasin, Posuvaluk had transferred a personal message from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. The message calls for renewal of the talks and confirms the intention of the Russian co-sponsor to contribute to implementation of the UN Security Council's resolution 904. Russia believes that the adoption of this resolution, in particular providing for international participation in ensuring safety for Palestinians living on the occupied territories, creates the necessary atmosphere for a move forward in the Arab-Israeli dialogue, the Russian Foreign Ministry's representative Karasin said.
