The necessary material base for the resolution of these tasks exists within the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and it must be constantly maintained in a viable state. It is very hard to do that under contemporary conditions, however, since the decline in production in the state is having a negative effect on logistical supply for the troops as well. Resolution of questions of rear support is becoming more and more difficult owing to the limited financing of the Army. The funds allocated do not provide for even the vital needs of the troops. The indebtedness to enterprises and late payments for the receipt of materials are leading to cutbacks in the output of products that are needed by the Armed Forces. The Ministry of Defense is squandering the industrial capacity of enterprises that were created over many years, and it will be very difficult to restore it. A significant quantity of food products is being received from suppliers without payment, as a consequence of which the indebtedness of the Armed Forces is increasing. The suppliers are in turn imposing penalties that total more than four billion karbovantsi a day. And who is suffering the losses? The Armed Forces once again! Funds cannot be allocated in this case for the development of the material base of the troops or improving the social conditions of the servicemen. The suppliers of Kharkiv, Poltava, Luhansk and Chernihivsk oblasts are refusing to supply the troops with meat, eggs and other foodstuffs. The food reserves at central and district warehouses have decreased sharply, which is leading in turn to disruptions in the supply of foodstuffs to the personnel in accordance with established supply norms. We thus see the way out for the resolution of the tasks that face the rear services of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the arrangement of logistical support for the troops with food, matériel, fuels, medical equipment and medicines, and the resolution of a whole set of social problems that touch on the interests of all categories of servicemen. The leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, under these difficult conditions, is taking every step with regard to improving the supply of foodstuffs to the servicemen. Tobacco products have been issued to the conscript servicemen as of 1 January 1994. Those who do not smoke are permitted to receive monetary compensation in the amount of the value of the corresponding class of cigarettes. Concern for quality food for the servicemen is constantly at the center of attention of the rear-support command at all levels. The food is prepared in tasty and varied fashion in most of the mess halls of military units. A corresponding program is being developed with the aim of further improvements in the organization of food, which provides in particular for: --the establishment of a unified day for the food service in the Armed Forces of Ukraine (the second Wednesday of each month). The monitored demonstration preparation of food, exchange of experience in the preparation of various dishes, especially Ukrainian cuisine, and the exhibition of dishes and confectionery and flour items are all performed on that day; --the model upkeep of mess halls, a rise in the standards for eating and the straightening out of the schedule of mess hall operation; --expansion of the assortment in the preparation of dishes, so that dishes are not repeated more than twice in a week; cutlets, meat patties and schnitzels are prepared no less than two or three times; flour items are baked one or two times; --a competitive inspection is conducted every year for the best soldiers', sailors' and cadets' mess halls in garrisons, formations, large units and military districts of the branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; --radical improvement in the training and placement of cadres in the food service. Only officers who have special education are to be named to the positions of chief of the service, and chiefs of the food service and mess halls are to be released from all types of details; --the salary of the chiefs of mess halls are set at grade 9; the most responsible and conscientious warrant officers are to be named to that position; --the certification of the culinary personnel of military mess halls by commissions of the military units is performed twice a year after the training periods. Up to 50 percent of the standard quantity of cooks may be women who have a motherly attitude toward the soldiers and prepare dishes with higher quality; --increased everyday monitoring of the completeness of the issue of food and the reaching of stipulated consumption norms for the personnel. Every military mess hall shall equip a monitoring corner in a suitable manner for this purpose. The deputy commanders of units for rear support will conduct a session with the supervisory personnel and rear-support employees once every quarter with regard to monitoring the organization of food and the preparation of dishes; --the development and entry into force of the "Uniform Requirements for the Organization and Upkeep of Military Mess Halls" and the "Instructions for Monitoring Military Catering." I would like to direct your attention herein to the fact that notwithstanding all of the difficulties, our conscript servicemen are not eating all that badly. They receive 200 grams of meat, 100 grams of fish, 100 grams of milk, 30 grams of cream, 70 grams of sugar, 750 grams of bread, 900 grams of vegetables and potatoes a day, and four eggs a week and other foods as well. Proper eating plays a large role in improving health care. All of the medical treatment facilities are for that reason supplied with fish, milk and dairy products, fresh vegetables and fruits, pork, meat from livestock and poultry first and foremost. A vivid demonstration of the concern of the state for its protectors is the fulfillment of the Law of Ukraine "The Social and Legal Protection of Servicemen and the Members of Their Families." The institution of the issue of a food ration also testifies to this. The rear support for the Armed Forces is making no small effort to fulfill that task, launching broad-scale work on military sovkhozes and the subsidiary plots of units. The food obtained thereby goes for the consumption of the troops. Real improvements in food supply for the servicemen, however, requires continuous and regular financing first of all. We are thankful to the many representatives of the President and the heads of the local industrial enterprises who are assisting us with the provision of dishes and mess hall equipment and its repair. The enterprises of military trade play a large role in improving the food situation. Fresh vegetables and fruits and confectionery items are being found in the solders' pots first and foremost. The summer trade of cold drinks and frozen and baked items will be organized at all military compounds as of May 1. The medical service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is working on improving medical support for servicemen. A new standard organizational structure is being instituted in the hospitals, which provides for the offering of specialized medical assistance. The possibility is being considered of offering it to the members of the families of servicemen and employees of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The existing method of research for flight medical evaluations is being reviewed, and fundamentally new approaches to the individual assessment of the state of health, psycho-physiological condition of pilots and specialists of the flight operations control groups for each flight shift are being developed. A database for all personnel is being created under the program of medical support. The physical plant of the service is also being developed. The construction of treatment wings at military hospitals located in Kovel, Kharkiv and Odessa is underway, along with diagnostic wings at Vinnytsya and Rivne. A great deal of attention is being paid to improving health-resort treatment. The construction of a diagnostics and treatment center at the Shklo military sanatorium is continuing for that purpose, along with overnight wings at the Truskavetskyy and Yevpatoriya children's sanatoria and a mess hall for 1,000 at the Frunzenske sanatorium. The medical personnel are also putting a great deal of effort into providing the military infirmaries, hospitals and sanatoria with medicines and medical matériel, and acquiring new diagnostics and treatment apparatus. The insufficient funding, however, is impeding the resolution of those tasks. As vexing as it may be to talk about, the bath and laundry support for the troops has worsened considerably of late. The units and institutions have nothing with which to pay off the bath and laundry enterprises. And they have too few funds to obtain detergents and equipment, or for the prompt payment of wages to their employees or to pay for municipal services. But what is more, the Armed Forces are indebted for more than 50 billion karbovantsi to the enterprises of light industry for matériel received. The conscript servicemen are already wearing out their uniforms, but the mills have not even been paid for them yet. The lack of funds makes it impossible to reach agreements with enterprises for the manufacture of matériel for 1994, although four months have already passed. The availability of some types of matériel at warehouses makes it possible to supply only the spring draft of young replacements and to shift to the wearing of summer dress. The military uniform has always been one of the most important attributes of armed formations. It can be reported today with all certainty that the new uniforms for the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been created and are being introduced. They will be manufactured in the first half of this year for graduates of military institutes and schools, and for generals and officers of the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense. The capabilities of the textile mills and combines to sew the uniforms for military trade provide for the sewing of new uniforms for other categories of servicemen as well. The lack of funds for the procurement of measured material, however, is unfortunately restraining this process. The papakhas for the colonels have been left thanks to a host of requests. It is, after all, a long historical tradition of the Ukrainian Cossacks, and its replacement would have a negative effect not only on the servicemen, but on other segments of the population as well, as was indicated unequivocably in the mass media. Many complaints were received from some superior officers and servicemen with regard to the introduction of leather overcoats for generals. I assure you that the sewing of leather overcoat for generals is done only by request and only for a fee. A series of measures is being instituted to improve the military uniform of cadets, which is, by the way, as close as possible to an officer's. They will be issued everyday uniforms in camouflage coloring as of 1 September 1994. Changes have also been made in the insignia. A new brass buckle is being developed in place of the "claw" buckle. Shoes with high shins are being issued to conscript servicemen instead of the canvas high-tops. The overcoats are being replaced by a jacket from cape fabric, and the parade and open jackets with a dress jacket. The discharge of conscript servicemen into the reserves at their request is permitted in parade dress, everyday field uniform that they are wearing or, in special cases, in civilian dress. Servicemen who are entering service under contract in the positions of soldier or sergeant are provided only with the items of the field uniform according to the season during the trial period. The rear support of the Armed Forces is taking a series of measures to improve the municipal-services support for servicemen in extended service. The use of military bathhouses and the services of the military unit support services combines is permitted for them and the members of their families, as well as hair cutting at non-regulation barber shops. A very difficult situation has taken shape surrounding the provision of the troops with fuels and lubricants. The lack of funds for the procurement of the necessary quantity of fuel is reducing the training of flight personnel and drivers, which is having a negative effect on the combat readiness of the troops. Air defense units stationed a distance of 10--15 km or more from populated areas do not even have enough fuel to take the children to school, or the servicemen to their service locations. Another problem must also be kept in mind--200 various types of fuels and lubricants are employed in the military hardware of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. More than 150 of those types are not manufactured at the enterprises of Ukraine. The State Committee of Ukraine for Oil and Gas has refused to supply us with them for the last two years. The supply of fuels and lubricants has improved somewhat thanks to repeated appeals by the Ministry of Defense to the Cabinet of Ministers. The Ukrnaftoprodukt Association is ready to assume the entire obligation of providing the Armed Forces with fuels and lubricants. The ultimate resolution of this issue, however, depends on the availability of funds that the Ministry of Defense does not have at this time... We are collecting funds in karbovantsi under these difficult conditions so as to at least somehow support the vital activity of the troops. We are leasing empty tank capacity, arranging the output of lubricants using our own manpower, and obtaining fuel through barter transactions. These measures, however, cover only a paltry portion of requirements, and are not solving the problem. Orders and directives have moreover been sent to the troops along with recommendations on restricting the consumption of fuels, economizing them, making widespread use of simulators, and various types of reductions in the number of trucks in the transport groups. There are already tight restrictions on the use of passenger cars. Limits have been introduced for the expenditure of fuels and the service lives of motors, and an efficient system of centralized shipment of cargo is being developed. The system of logistical support is being reviewed so as to reduce the distance of shipment of cargo and the consumption of fuel, and new storage areas are being created at the bases of troop that are subject to disbanding, along with other measures. Hasty and poorly thought-out decisions are having negative consequences in many cases. The commercialization of military trade is an example of this. The sale and leasing of those enterprises and stores has caused large losses, turning military trade from profitable into beggarly. Only thanks to the considerable efforts of the Minister of Defense of Ukraine and Edict No. 41/94 of the President of Ukraine of 10 February 1994 has this campaign been halted for the social protection of the servicemen, first and foremost the conscript servicemen, as well as to improve the trade and domestic support for the troops, especially those at remote or closed locations. The leaders of military trade, notwithstanding all of the difficulties, have resolved the task of seeking out the goods of prime necessity, starting with sewing needles and ending with complex technical groups of goods. It is worth noting that most of the collectives have met their targets for the trade and domestic support of military formations. The difficult situation has also had an effect on the provision of servicemen in the Air Forces and the Air Defense Forces with everything they need. The rear services have been occupied there only with supporting flights and combat readiness, while the question of material and domestic support has always been relegated to the background. Two groups of rear-support specialists of the Armed Forces have been created today that are studying the actual circumstances of those troops, and are taking steps to improve the living and domestic conditions of servicemen and provide them with the necessary matériel. The rear-services inspectorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine is working intensively. The theft of the people's property has been curtailed thanks to its resolute and principled work, and funds have been supplemented at the expense of those guilty of waste, shortages and abuses. A number of officials guilty of abuses of their official positions and excessive spending have been relieved of their duties, and the criminal cases have been turned over to the military procuracy. The central bodies of the rear support for the Armed Forces of Ukraine are staffed by highly qualified officers who are capable of organizing the rear support for the troops. I say to the parents of the servicemen not to worry about your sons. We can assure you that there will be no disruptions in food supply, medical care and the provision of matériel. If there are problems in some places with questions of logistical support or complaints regarding the poor quality of the food, we ask you to write to the address 252063, city of Kiev, Dehtyarivska St., Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine for Rear Services--Chief of Rear Services for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Or telephone at (044) 213-72-61. I promise that immediate steps to end those problems and improve the state of affairs will be undertaken. I appeal to the leaders of local authorities at all levels to find an opportunity to allocate plots of land to servicemen for their own gardening activity, so that they will be able to provide their families with potatoes and vegetables. The heads of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes of military units are ready to provide accommodations and assistance in equipping stores for the sale of their products at military compounds--milk, meat, eggs, vegetables--which will be mutually advantageous for both parties. We have agreed to take into the Agriculture Directorate of Rear Services for the Armed Forces the kolkhozes and sovkhozes that have lost faith in their existence. Assistance will be granted on our part. The leaders of the Ministry of Defense and Rear Services for the Armed Forces of Ukraine are working nonstop. A constant search is underway, as can be seen, for ways of solving complex problems, increasing the maneuverability and steadfastness of support and service units, and finding sources of extrabudgetary financing for the measures being pursued in the Armed Forces. I would like to emphasize, in summing up the aforementioned, that the complexity of the problems that have arisen cannot diminish our perseverance in the cause of building the Armed Forces of an independent Ukraine.
