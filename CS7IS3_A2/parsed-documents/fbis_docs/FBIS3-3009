"This conforms to China's interests as well as to the regional and world interests," Qian said at a press conference this morning. Asked about the International Atomic Energy Agency's difficulties in inspection of nuclear facilities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Qian said China supports DPRK to hold negotiations with the United States, the Republic of Korea, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the past the negotiations met some setbacks and achieved some progresses too, Qian said. Now some difficulties have cropped up again. "We believe that so long as all sides are patient in negotiations and do not adopt measures to make the situation complicated, the negotiations will achieve important progress," he said.
