He said he believed that the proposed amendment to the law on political parties was advantageous mainly for small and formerly non-existent parties. "Those who will support the amendment and thus demonstrate their accommodating approach will be richly rewarded," Grebenicek said. He added that at the same time these parties would make it clear that they place power and money above the obligations of the deputies of the legislative body which ensue from the law. If the bill is passed and makes it possible to freely dissolve political parties then it would be a definitive full stop on the time in which citizens could cherish illusions about the existence of parliamentary democracy in the Czech Republic, he said. On the occasion of the 49th anniversary of the liberation of Ostrava from Nazi occupiers KSCM representatives today laid wreaths and bouquets of red carnations on the graves of fallen Red Army soldiers in the Comenius Park and at a memorial tank.
