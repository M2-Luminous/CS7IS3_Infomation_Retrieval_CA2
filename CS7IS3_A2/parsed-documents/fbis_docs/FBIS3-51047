FBIS3-51047 "drlat008__a94008" FBIS-LAT-94-008-A Document Type:Daily Report 12 January 1994 ANNEX Brazil Justice Minister Correa Reveals Past Coup Possibility PY0701001694 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 6 Jan 94 p 4--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY0701001694 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Text] Brasilia -- During the Power Struggle [Jogo do Poder] television program transmitted by TV Manchete at 2315 [date not given], Justice Minister Mauricio Correa revealed that President Itamar Franco was sounded out between October and November to stage a coup "in the style of Peruvian President Fujimori" but "thanks to the firmness of the president and support of the three military ministers, nothing happened." Correa said: "The president was encouraged to adopt a Fujimori-style solution." The minister did not quote names but journalist Carlos Chagas, who hosts the program, recalled that in those days Senator Pedro Simon made some remarkable statements, like when he said that President Itamar Franco was even willing to resign in the name of democracy. Chagas now interprets this statement as the result of the spirit generated by the pressures on the president. The coup possibility revealed by Correa becomes more believable if we add to it the rumors of a possible break of the institutional order that circulated at the time. A well-informed source close to the military chiefs told JORNAL DO BRASIL at the time that the three military ministers told the president: "In face of the political crisis and the latent conflict among national government branches, they were willing to offer a support base to allow him to govern." Correa last night confirmed: "The coup did not take place only because President Itamar did not want it." Correa said the coupists believed the atmosphere for a Fujimori-style solution was created by the first charges of corruption against the budget committee, the high inflation rate, and the dissatisfaction of the military men with their low salaries. Correa said: "The public would not complain about a coup against corruption charges and high inflation." The minister said that this solution, however, "was never considered by Itamar."
