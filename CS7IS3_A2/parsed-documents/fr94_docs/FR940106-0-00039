ACTION: Correcting amendment. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to the regulations of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that govern the evaluation of diseases of the ear and systemic conditions. These corrections are required in order to amend editorial errors in those regulations. No substantive change to the content of 38 CFR part 4 is being made by this correcting amendment. EFFECTIVE DATE: This correcting amendment is effective January 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Bisset, Jr., Consultant, Regulations Staff, Compensation and Pension Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233&hyph;3005. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The regulations that appear at 38 CFR 4.87a, diagnostic code 6210, establish the criteria for evaluating disease of the auditory canal. Due to VA error, that criteria contains the word ``serious'' instead of the word ``serous.'' This document corrects that error. The regulations that appear at 38 CFR 4.88a, diagnostic code 6311, establish the criteria for evaluating military tuberculosis. Due to VA error, that type of tuberculosis is identified as ``military'' instead of ``miliary'' tuberculosis. This document corrects that error.
