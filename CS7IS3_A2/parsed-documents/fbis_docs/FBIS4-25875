Lu Ping made these remarks when meeting with the delegation of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions headed by Chairman Li Chak Tim. He said that the differences between China and Britain over financial arrangements for the new airport are narrowing gradually and that China hopes to solve the problem of financial arrangements first, and then discuss the draft regulations of the Airport Authority. He reiterated that the Chinese side is not demanding that the financial burden on the future special administrative region (SAR) after 1997 not exceed HK$5 billion, but according to the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding, the two sides must negotiate if it exceeds that amount. At present, the Hong Kong government has financial reserves of over HK$100 billion and the proceeds from the sale of the land along the airport railway will far exceed the originally estimated HK$40 billion. Therefore, it is not difficult to resolve the financial arrangements for the new airport, and I hope the British Hong Kong Government will inject more money and reduce as much debt as possible. Lu Ping stressed that after the question of financial arrangements is resolved, it will be necessary to establish a supervisory mechanism, and in keeping with the principle of "low costs and high efficiency" -- as expressed in the Memorandum of Understanding -- it is necessary to pay close attention to construction costs so that costs will not rise continuously. At the same time, it is necessary to supervise the progress of projects and to strive to complete most of them before 1997. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the role of the Airport Consultative Committee, and the Airport Consultative Committee is also one of the channels. I hope that everyone will have a cooperative attitude, and will earnestly and properly resolve the new airport issue. On the question of retirement insurance, Lu Ping said: The Economic Panel and the Social and Security Panel of the Preliminary Work Committee recently held meetings to discuss this question. They held that the question of retirement insurance for old people has a bearing on social stability and should be resolved at an early date so as to guarantee that people have something to depend on when they are old and so can work with their minds at ease. The committee members held that the retirement pension the British Hong Kong Government is pursuing is subsidized welfare and that a comprehensive staff retirement insurance system should be established first. Therefore, they hoped that the British Hong Kong Government would propose a comprehensive retirement insurance plan at an early date, extensively solicit views from all quarters again, and strive to settle the question before 1997. As for what form should be adopted, the two panels of the Preliminary Work Committee need to study the question further. However, most committee members tend to favor setting up a compulsory provident fund. As for the question raised by members of the delegation that workers find it difficult to find jobs during the transition of Hong Kong's economic pattern, Lu Ping said: The Chinese Government has always been rather concerned about this, and will strictly control some departments and regions in their labor services to Hong Kong so as to avoid an impact on the employment of the Hong Kong work force. The plan to export mainland professionals to Hong Kong is also under the HKMAO's direct control. Lu Ping said: The future development of Hong Kong's economic structure also should be based in industry because industry really can create value. The reason the securities markets of Tokyo, New York, and London are booming is that they are supported by strong industries. So far, the Chinese side has not considered discussing this issue with the British side. But out of the long-term consideration for a smooth transition, the Chinese side will put this question to the British side. Lu Ping reiterated that the Basic Law already has clear stipulations on the question of civil servants' pensions. The future SAR's HK$25 billion of financial reserves plus over HK$100 billion of land reserve already can meet the needs of retirement pensions for civil servants in 1997. The pension for civil servants after 1997 is guaranteed both by law and by the financial status, so they can rest completely assured. The Chinese side supports the setting up of a civil service long-term service fund and is preparing to propose to the British side, through the Joint Liaison Group, a considerable increase in funds on the basis of the HK$7 billion so as to put civil servants' minds more at ease. Moreover, the Basic Law also has stipulated clearly that except for the 20 or more top officials, all members of the civil service may continue in their posts as long as they are willing to serve the SAR. It is not necessarily true that the top officials cannot remain in their posts, but they must be nominated to the executive chief and be appointed by the central government. Some members of the delegation proposed that the SAR Preparatory Committee issue a notice in 1996 stating these views. Lu Ping expressed approval. Speaking on property prices, Lu Ping said: The British Hong Kong Government's current measures to curb property prices are mainly to increase land supply. It will increase 15 hectares this year and will increase another 55 hectares before 1997. Moreover, it also has asked the Land Commission to increase an additional 50 hectares of land as a reserve. Together, they make up 120 hectares. This does not include the annually approved land, the 58 hectares of land along the airport railway, and the military land to be converted to civilian use. In this way, land supply after 1997 will be more than 200 to 300 hectares. The Chinese side worries that this will lead to a slump in property prices. Therefore, this question must be negotiated through the Sino-British Land Committee and handled carefully. State Council HKMAO Deputy Director Wang Fengchao was present during the meeting. In addition, asked by reporters today whether he would meet with British Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad on his visit next month, State Council HKMAO Director Lu Ping said: Goodlad is a guest from the Foreign Office and will meet with people from the Foreign Ministry. His visit this time is not intended for the Hong Kong issue, but to discuss Sino-British relations and other international issues. Lu Ping said that he would unavoidably have contact with Goodlad.
