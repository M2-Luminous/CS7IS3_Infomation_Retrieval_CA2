This is a gratifying step toward realizing the goal of equipping the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant with homemade fuel. As China's only nuclear power plant fuel package production base, since its founding in 1991, the broad masses of workers, cadres, engineers, and technicians in the Yibin Nuclear Fuel Package Plant have labored under an excessive workload and, after two years and seven months of efforts, the plant has smoothly passed the following five rigorous tests one after another: The test by the State Bureau for Nuclear Safety; the simultaneous acceptance test of the three aspects of environmental protection by the State Environmental Protection Bureau; the project construction appraisal by French specialists; the industrial approval test; and the product approval test. The plant will begin to provide the No. 2 Generating Unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant with [words indistinct]. This will enable us to provide large nuclear power plants with as much homemade fuel packages as possible.
