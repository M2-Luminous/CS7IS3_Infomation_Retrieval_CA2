The PvdA [Labor Party], which as the largest party is entitled to fill this position, has renounced any claims to it. PvdA leader Kok made this clear in a letter to party leaders yesterday [10 May]. The appointment, in principle for four years, takes effect when the new Chamber first sits on Tuesday of next week. Deetman, chairman since September 1989, had already indicated that he was available. According to the PvdA, there is "broad appreciation" of the way Deetman has discharged his responsibilities. Another factor was also that First Chamber chairman is the PvdA's Tjeenk Willink. According to an unwritten rule in the Netherlands parliament, the presidents of the First and the Second Chamber must never be from the same party. In 1986, when the CDA had more seats than the PvdA, PvdA member Doman was also allowed to remain at his post. As the biggest party, the CDA did not demand the job for one of its own members until 1989.
