FBIS4-9567 "dreeu082_k_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-082 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 CROATIA UN: RSK-Croatia Cease-Fire Holding UN: RSK-Croatia Cease-Fire Holding LD2604151194 Belgrade TANJUG in English 1424 GMT 26 Apr 94 LD2604151194 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN ["Pool" item] [Text] Knin, April 26 (TANJUG) -- UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] chief of staff in the sector south, Joseph Ngare, said on Tuesday that the two sides in conflict, the republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia, are observing the ceasefire and showing a readiness to continue to implement the agreement on the cessation of hostilities and the separation of forces signed in Zagreb at the end of March. At a regular press conference, representatives of U.N. peace-keeping forces announced that UNPROFOR civilian police, 4,200 of them, together with the peace-keepers of the republic of Serb Krajina started on Tuesday to patrol and enforce peace and order in settlements along the line of separation. The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia settled by Serbs as their response to the forceable secession of the Zagreb regime from the former federation and is under U.N. Protection (UNPA) since March 1992. U.N. observers in sector south warned this time once again about the great danger of mines placed during the withdrawal of the forces in conflict or left behind earlier, but the representative of the sector for information, Alan Roberst, was not able to say which side had done that. The mines removing operations are progressing slowly since the Croatian side, unlike the Serb, has not yet made available the exact data, maps and plans about the mine fields. Two Krajina Serb army troops lost their lives, while four were wounded by mine explosions last weekend when they were visiting their village. Last week, two Canadian battalion members within UNPROFOR were also wounded. These are the main reasons why the return of local inhabitants to settlements where military opoerations have been going on until recently is still banned. The headquarters of the Serb Krajina army announced that the Croatian Army violated on Monday the ceasefire agreement and opened fire from small arms towards the zone of responsibility of the Lika corps in the wider Kapela area.
