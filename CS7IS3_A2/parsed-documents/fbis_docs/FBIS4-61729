From where do you derive your confidence? Is it from your disappointment with the current power system, or from its disability to organize things? Or, perhaps, as some people state, we are heading toward dictatorship, and the introduction of the Presidency is the first, legal step in that direction? Or, perhaps, there are no reasons to dramatize the situation -- this is simply an option for the most effective model of government? [Hryb] I do not know anything about those striving toward dictatorship; in my opinion, the Presidency will allow us to create a system of government from the top to the bottom. The new Constitution is only a foundation for this -- we need a law on local self-governments as well. By now, nobody is subordinated to anybody in Belarus. Local soviets are following their own paths, city soviets -- their own, and so on and so forth. Their powers must be determined, including their vertical responsibilities to the president. Without the controllability of the system, it is impossible to even establish order, not to mention any movement forward. At one time, I had a clash with Shushkevich over this very issue. My attitude toward Stanislaw Shushkevich is good, but I disagree with him on this issue. In a democratic society, resolutions are adopted by the majority -- I mean, the parliament. If you do not want to carry out a resolution by the majority, just make a statement about your disagreement and retire. What has become of the issue of collective security? Even though the parliament adopted a resolution, the speaker did not stop attacking it. You cannot do this. The system of government cannot work this way. However, the point is not only in specific people, but also in the ineffectiveness of the government system, in which every disputable question, more or less, must be submitted to a referendum -- on the republican, oblast, rayon, or village soviet level. This way, we will only be quarreling with each other, while issues are left unresolved. [Hruzdzilovich] Regarding the issue of neutrality. In general, this term is still being used, but it reminds me of that communism which was to come about... Has neutrality, as a matter of fact, ceased to be a goal and transformed itself into a card of the political game? [Hryb] We do not deny neutrality, but, for the time being, we do not have it; it is rather doubtful whether we will have it before the year 2000. Can we have neutrality with 30,000 Russian troops armed with nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory? We have agreed on the withdrawal of these troops, and they will be withdrawn; they are already being withdrawn. By now, however, I think that leaving our Army without the support of other CIS countries would just disrupt operations and break it into pieces. The Army will simply cease to exist. We will be incapable of feeding, dressing, and equipping the Army with good firearms. [Hruzdzilovich] Do we need the Army at all, if nobody is going to attack us? [Hryb] One must always think of tomorrow. Nobody is going to attack us today, but you never know what will happen tomorrow, do you? Yes, we have adopted a military doctrine which does not envision any specific country as a potential enemy. However, does that mean that the Army should be disbanded? No, it does not. Even neutral countries have armies. Moreover, the concept of neutrality is subject to change over the course of time. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia actually do not have their own Armed Forces; these forces will appear in about 20 years, not earlier... But if the world shakes, what will we do? How will we defend our sovereignty? Are we going to be entrapped again by this side or that? [passage omitted]
