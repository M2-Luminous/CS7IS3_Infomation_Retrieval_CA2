Is this contradictory? Given that we recognize price fluctuations, why should we still emphasize stability? This is because the price fluctuations that we recognize refer to moderate rather than drastic and disruptive ones; and stability refers to keeping the general level of price rises basically stable rather than freezing prices from any changes. We have to seize the opportunity to get through fluctuations in price reform so as to accelerate the pace of economic development, but we must also create a macroscopic environment of price stability so that our economy can continue to develop in a healthy manner. Fluctuations and stability are just like two sides of the same coin which cannot be separated. In price reform, relaxing restrictions is not equivalent to noninterference, while fluctuations are not tantamount to loss of control. The general price level is a comprehensive concept. This year's 10 percent is precisely the general level of price rises which the state wants to control and realize. Whether or not the economic situation is stable will, to a very large extent, depend on whether or not we can prevent price rises from going far beyond the 10 percent limit. According to economic experts' analyses, the growth rates of GDP and of price rises would be better kept in the ratio of 1:0.6. This year's 9 percent economic growth and 10 percent price rises are in the ratio of 1:1.1. Compared with the base of last year, this ratio can be described as a high speed of economic growth and a low inflation rate. However, since this year's low price rise level is pulled down from last year's high level, we still cannot underestimate the difficulties in controlling this year's general price level. Obviously, there are many factors affecting the general price level. To keep commodity prices under control, we have to proceed from many aspects. Acting Against Seeking Exorbitant Profits--An Urgent Task It is not the case that all kinds of price fluctuations are reasonable. In the market, we do not rule out the existence of some unique commodities. Maybe a thing is precious when it is scarce, and it is natural that the prices of those unique commodities are higher than those of ordinary ones, but they are only a minority. Quite a number of commodities are priced far beyond their own worth without taking the situation of market demand and supply into account. To keep the general price level under control, we must take strong measures against prices seeking exorbitant profit. Last year, a wristwatch was priced at 990,800 yuan in a certain shop, but this year, the price rose to 1.2249 million yuan. A dumpling was sold at four yuan in a certain restaurant, but, to everyone's surprise, the restaurant asked 80,000 to 100,000 yuan if one wanted to book a table. All these are not cases of fixing prices at one's discretion, but cases of asking exorbitant prices and of running fraudulent businesses by forcing up prices. Certain production and management enterprises, plagued by the "price starvation disease," cannot restrain themselves, but rather take advantage of the relaxation of price controls to drive up prices at will and to shift the burden onto consumers; while certain traders, plagued by the "blind pricing disease," do not fix reasonable prices in light of market demand, mistakenly believing that they can reap huge profits by marking prices at will. People can choose not to buy those commodities for which excessive prices are charged, but they cannot prevent those who are seeking exorbitant profits from driving up prices. Recently, how to act against the seeking of exorbitant profits and fraudulent practices has become a common concern. In drawing up regulations against practices seeking exorbitant profits, Shanghai first defined the concept of seeking exorbitant profits. Any charges exceeding prescribed average prices and reasonable profit margins are considered as moves seeking exorbitant profit which must be punished. This is a weapon given to consumers. But still, some people say that it is not enough to merely give a quantitative definition, and we should also evaluate traders' motives and purpose in raising prices. If fraudulent means are used to raise a certain price, even though it is not large in quantitative terms, it should be treated as a fraudulent move and one which seeks exorbitant profits, and must be punished. Directed Against the Crux Where does the crux of price rises lie? If the impact on prices of a small number of traders' illegal profit-seeking moves is a point to be reckoned with, the factor bringing about overall price rises within greater limits is the issuance of too much currency and the expansion of fixed-asset investment. This is the root cause of a constant, overall, and high level of commodity price rises, that is, inflation. The crux lies precisely in keeping price rises under control. Investment is necessary for the development of our economy. Be it a province, a city, or a prefecture, there are thousands of reasons and grounds for investment. However, when all these are added together, they precisely become the force driving up our country's general price level. After analyzing the relationship between the growth of fixed-asset investment and changes in commodity prices over the past 14 years, some people have discovered the following characteristics: 1. When the growth of investment is equal to or lower than the average growth rate, it will not trigger off large-scale commodity price fluctuations; 2. Generally speaking, price rises will emerge a year after an investment boom. When the scale of fixed-asset investment expands drastically and exceeds the average growth rate of investment in a certain year, then huge commodity price rises will emerge in the following year. In order to achieve a rapid and healthy development of our national economy, we do not rule out the possibility of making more investment in a certain year but less in others. However, overall, we must control the scale of fixed-asset investment within proper proportions. We must provide a material basis for development, but also keep severe inflation in check and maintain a relatively stable general level of commodity prices. Macroscopic regulation in 1993 promptly eased the inflationary pressure, but by the end of last year there were still unfinished projects worth 130 million yuan created by greater investment, registering an increase of 60 percent over that of the previous year; and 30 to 40 percent of investment was put into the market in the form of consumption funds, thus creating more demand, which drove up prices. The aftereffects of excessive growth in money supply will be felt more noticeably this year. There are indications that in the first two months of this year, the growth rate of state-owned units' fixed-asset investment dropped as compared with last year; and another good sign is that more and more investment is being made in projects at the central level, in coastal areas in the eastern part of the country, and in the communications and transportation sector. However, macroscopic regulation is still needed to oversee the strong trend of investment growth. Beware of the "Float Phenomenon" From a long-term point of view, subsidies have to be abolished. But for a fairly long period, subsidies cannot be abolished. In order to offset part of the pressure caused by price rises and to maintain the situation of stable development, the state, at a time of price rises, often provides large amounts of subsidies to lighten consumers' burden. In order to stop price rises for some commodities, the state also gives large amounts of capital subsidies to production enterprises, wholesalers, and retailers. This is what people call "hidden subsidies." However, we must have a good grasp of the degree of subsidies. Commodity price researchers analyzing this situation say that subsidies are another manifestation of rises in the commodity price index. That is to say, subsidies are an essential measure for keeping commodity prices stable. However, while price rises are held in check, the potential energy of price rises is also stored up by subsidies, and will be released when we run into financial difficulties and normal economic operation is affected. If the open index of price rises is considered as one level, subsidies are another level of price rises beneath the horizontal line. This is what they call the "float phenomenon." Just like a float on the sea, the open price index is the part of the "float" on the surface; whereas subsidies are the underwater part of the "float," which is called "hidden price rises." The sum of the two parts should be the concrete growth rate of after-subsidy prices. Can we reduce subsidies so as to seek moderate price rises? According to the analysis of the departments in charge of commodity prices, it is possible to do so, and will be determined by the macroscopic environment of a basic balance of demand and supply. When the macroscopic environment is relatively relaxed, we can duly accelerate the pace of price reform because there will not be excessive price rises and the growth rate of subsidies can be lowered correspondingly. That is to say, when we are in a condition to duly relax restrictions on commodity prices, even if we reduce some subsidies, there will not be a huge increase in commodity prices. It is thus clear that under certain conditions, the hidden price rises created by too many subsidies may exceed the rate of price rises brought about by relaxing restrictions on commodity prices. Hence, for some commodities with strong competitive power in the market, it is better to provide fewer or even no subsidies, and the way out is, after all, to gradually achieve basic stability of prices in light of market fluctuations. Of course, this is not to say that all subsidies can be abolished at a stroke. The application of subsidies should be determined by how relaxed or strained the macroscopic economic environment is. New Problems As far as the requirements of moving toward marketization are concerned, the price reform has not succeeded and it must be deepened. Keeping the general level basically stable is the prerequisite for deepening the reform. The formerly distorted price structure has been, to a certain extent, rectified, but so far has still to be thoroughly changed. Ever since the policy of reform and opening up was implemented, the prices of extraction industries and basic raw and processed materials industries have been rising by more or less the same margin, hence the prices of basic industries, which were originally on the low side, are still low at present. Relying on the market to distribute resources is precisely empty talk if prices are not straightened out. For example, some petroleum prices have been raised since the policy of reform and opening up was implemented, but it is getting more and more difficult to exploit petroleum and so the costs keep increasing. Since the price and the cost of crude oil are not in harmony with each other, it is difficult to increase output, which very much restricts our national economy. This is also one of the reasons accounting for the marked growth in imported petroleum in recent years. The coal industry, likewise, faces similar problems. Meanwhile, unjustifiable phenomena are also present in the prices of commodities and in the service sector. That is to say, reforming the unreasonable price structure cannot be achieved by a few adjustments. Moreover, inflation over the past few years has also offset the revised higher prices of some commodities. For example, grain prices have been raised and restrictions on purchase prices have been relaxed several times, and the purchase and selling prices of grain are basically the same, but peasants have to bear higher costs of grain production because of the huge increases in the prices of agricultural means of production, hence the advantages of price rises disappear. To deepen the price reform, there are still many things to do. Can Prices Be Checked? Faced with the complicated situation, can we hold the general price level in check? As shown by the determination of the party Central Committee and the State Council and various price-regulating measures recently introduced, it is possible to do so. The foundation is, first of all, not to regulate commodity prices for prices sake but to aim at creating a good macroscopic economic environment and to hold inflation in check by maintaining an appropriate economic pace so as to bring the general price level under control; and to bring excessive demand under control and to hold drastic price fluctuations in check by guaranteeing normal production. The "shopping basket" and the "rice bag" projects are commodity prices most directly felt by people, and their stability is the foundation of stable prices. Not long ago, the State Council delegated the authority to take charge of the "shopping basket" project to mayors of large and medium-sized cities, who are held accountable for accomplishing the project. Moreover, every year the mayors have to report their assessment results to the people's congresses and people of their cities. This is an absolute order issued to the mayors. As indicated by information, it is no good not to issue such an order. The impact on the "shopping basket" project of the construction and development of some cities has already affected daily supply and led to drastic commodity price rises. Vegetable markets in some localities have changed into pet markets and vegetable farmland into development zones; while financial subsidies given to key nonstaple foods in some localities have also been abolished. After experiencing excessive price rises in grain, cooking oil, meat, and vegetables by the end of last year, many cities were soberly aware that the "shopping basket" project is a "365-day project," which must be handled firmly every day. The most fundamental way as well as the strongest means to bring commodity prices under control is to guarantee production and supply, particularly proceeding from controlling commodity prices of key agricultural and sideline products. The municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have adopted various means not only to have a rich "shopping basket" but also to build up firm "vegetable farmland." How can price reform measures be introduced in such a way as not to cause drastic fluctuations? Comrades from departments in charge of commodity price regulation hold that as far as price reform is concerned, we must take into account the three aspects of our ability to bear, that is, the state, enterprises, and consumers, and no single one of them can be dispensed with. In introducing every reform measure, the principles which we must grasp are not to add to the state's financial burden; that the increased cost of raw and processed materials thus caused can be controlled within the limits to which normal production and management of enterprises can adapt; and that the living standard of most people will not drop because of price rises. Comrades studying the commodity price reform liken the existence of these three conditions to a "satellite launch window." We should choose such a "window" to introduce reform measures. If the necessary conditions are not present, we would rather put off reform and, at the same time, actively create an environment for such reform. This is a safe and prudent move. It is also precisely the most significant foundation and source of confidence for the state's macroscopic regulation. In the balance measuring the triangular relationship among the state, enterprises, and consumers, the weight of the consumers is the heaviest. Macroscopic regulation can control inflation within bearable limits, that is, the growth of urban residents' cost of living and income and peasants' earnings are higher than the extent of commodity price rises. Once inflation goes beyond bearable limits, the state can also intensify macroscopic regulation to impose strict controls on it. We should admit that owing to differing income levels, some people are weaker in bearing commodity price rises; for example, workers and staff who retired a long time ago and incumbent personnel of enterprises without good benefits. The state has already urged the various localities to take special care of them. Now, the compensation system linking basic old-age pensions with the cost-of-living index has been implemented in some localities; while funds for aiding the poor have been set up in some cities to subsidize low-income groups and households with special material difficulties. Moreover, some localities have laid down minimum income levels for incumbent workers and staff and a minimum livelihood protection level for unemployed workers and staff. All kinds of assistance are given to them to solve their problems. How Should Departments Responsible for Commodity Price Administration Control the Situation? A consumer went to the Administration of Commodity Prices to sue a store where she had bought several meters of woolen cloth, because she found that the same cloth was being sold $10 to $20 cheaper in another piece-goods store. Therefore, she urged the administration to punish the first store. Similar situations can be seen everywhere. Should the Administration of Commodity Prices punish the store? According to the defined jurisdiction of price reform, an overwhelming majority of traders selling ordinary consumer goods are authorized to fix prices directly, and the Administration of Commodity Prices should not frequently take punitive action against stores. Hence, the first way in which consumers must protect themselves is to learn how to select among various prices for the same commodity. So, at a time when restrictions on the prices of most commodities have been relaxed, how does the Administration of Commodity Prices regulate commodity prices in the market? How to safeguard consumers' rights and interests? All these are new problems posed for departments responsible for commodity price regulation. Obviously, we cannot, as was done in the past, take an account book and examine and approve, item by item, every commodity price, neither can we refuse to have anything more to do with the matter and let prices rise. We must blaze a new trail of indirect administration. The goal and task of our price reform in the next stage is precisely to establish a system of macroscopic regulation with indirect administration as the core, in which prices can be free of restrictions but can also be brought under control. This is also a historic transformation of the functions of commodity price administration. We have relaxed restrictions on the prices of grain, edible oil, meat, eggs, and vegetables since the policy of reform and opening up was started, but following the panic purchase occurring at the end of last year, the state swiftly took such measures as setting up reserves and setting price limits to bring commodity prices under control as quickly as possible. This indicates the possibility of accomplishing indirect commodity price administration and controlling market commodity prices by means of macroscopic regulation. Gao Tiesheng and Liu Wen, officials from the State Planning Commission's Department of Market and Commodity Price Regulation, say that a system of macroscopic regulation of prices should include five points: Setting up a system of price regulation at both the central and provincial levels; administering prices through comprehensive application of economic, legal, and administrative means; setting up price regulation funds and a reserve system for important commodities at the two levels; establishing a system to monitor commodity prices and to take precautions against drastic fluctuations; and installing a sound system of laws and regulations. At present, price regulation funds and reserves of important commodities are becoming the two firm systems in various localities which help to control sudden price rises in the market due to seasonal changes and the arrival of holidays or to cope with disastrous events. The systems at the central level are being vigorously established. Monitoring commodity prices and taking precautions against drastic fluctuations are the key tasks of departments responsible for commodity price administration which have had their functions transformed. Beijing Municipality has introduced or is drawing up eight laws and regulations. As far as the work of price forecasting is concerned, it includes analyzing the situations of production, supply, marketing, and consumption, the trend of changes in prices, mass expectations, and changes in demand and supply in neighboring areas. A system of placing price rises on file is implemented for most commodities, whereas for a small number of commodities a system of reporting price rises to the higher authorities and of controlling the rate of price differentials is implemented, and price ceilings are set to guard in advance against drastic price fluctuations. The state administration of a small number of directly priced necessities and service charges is very strict. Not long ago, the state unequivocally announced that 20 commodities and services which were already priced by the market would be subject to rigorous inspection. As long as prices are fixed within the prescribed limits, arbitrary price rises can be checked. Price reform is also a systematic project of the overall economic operation, which can never stride forward while divorced from reforms of the planning, taxation, monetary, and foreign exchange systems and from the development of enterprise restructuring. Price reform must proceed in cooperation with other reforms. As long as we seize opportunities to promote price reform while taking into account all sides' ability to bear price fluctuations, prices will not run wild but will be controllable.
