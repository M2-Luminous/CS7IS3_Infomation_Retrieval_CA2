The siege was lifted when pilgrims left for 'Arafat and Manni deserts for special Hajj rituals. This year, the headquarters was surrounded after a large gathering of Muslims in solidarity with Bosnian people ended. Iran declared May 15 the Day of Support for Bosnian People. Hojatt ol-Eslam Mohammad Mohammadi-Reyshahri, the leader's representative for Hajj-related affairs, said that the Disavowal of Unbelievers ceremony would be held in front of the headquarters on Tuesday if no restrictions are set by the Saudi Government. He called on pilgrims to remain calm and orderly during the ceremony.
