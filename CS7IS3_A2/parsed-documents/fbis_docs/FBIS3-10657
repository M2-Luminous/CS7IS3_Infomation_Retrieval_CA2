The report notes that with only 4,200 members, a little more than half what it had in the 80's, the PF is plagued by unbridled corruption, the improper discharge of duties, disagreements, lack of leadership, and disrespect for the chain of command, etc. The article says the PF is losing the main characteristic of any police force -- its desire to investigate, and mentions cases that reveal the PF agents' apathy about investigations. Quadros then mentions cases that reveal how PF agents discharge their duties inefficiently, engage in corruption, do not respect the chain of command, and are involved in crimes, including rape.
