According to the prime minister, Moldova has always favoured an economic union of the Commonwealth countries, since neither Russia, nor Ukraine, nor still Moldova can compete with the European Economic Community single-handed. The European Union countries want the former Soviet republics to form their own economic space, their market and their production, Sangeli said, stressing that the eastern market is responsible for the lion's share of the Moldovan export. The prime minister called the industrial slump the main difficulty in carrying out economic reforms in Moldova. "If our economy had accomplished the 1990 results, it would be easier to carry out reforms," he said. "When we carry out good reforms, but living standards drop, people will not understand such a government."
