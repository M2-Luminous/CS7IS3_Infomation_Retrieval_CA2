However, even though the republic does not exist, the conflicts among its political leaders are real enough. Although Shkelzen Maliqi, one of the pioneers of party pluralism in Kosovo, says in ZERI that the rift among the Albanian leaders should not be written about, the Albanian press keeps exploiting this topic to the full. According to ZERI, the surprise came when Jusuf Buxhovi, one of the founders of the Democratic League of Kosovo [LDK], was removed from that party. That triggered off a series of political clashes in the most populous and influential Albanian party in the Balkans. The LDK members are wondering what Anton Kolaj, member of that party's presidency, is doing in the United States while they, as they say, are here fighting the Serbian authorities. The explanation that Anton Kolaj is in the United States to form a branch of the party does not sound convincing enough, particularly as the party and Kolaj are only interested in the money of Albanian guest workers in the United States. According to ZERI, the conflict started in the Parliamentary Party of Kosovo, when "the entire leadership was removed" from the party. This was, by the way, a party of young people. There has also been a rift in the Christian Democratic Party. Lazer Krasniqi, its leader, is now in Zagreb, according to ZERI, and academician Mark Krasniqi is now the leader of the party. Those with a good knowledge of the political trends in Kosovo and Metohija have from the start doubted that this party had a future, since most of its members are Albanians of the Muslim faith, so this must be the only Christian Democratic Party in the world whose members are predominantly Muslim. There have also been rifts in UNICOMB (the Party of National Unity) since its chairman Halit Alildemaj left. He is now in Tirana. Skelzen Maliqi and Kacusa Jashari have left the leadership of the Social Democratic Party. According to BUJKU, there have also been rifts between "the president of the republic and the government of Kosovo." BUJKU's commentator wonders whether it is true that there has also been a rift among the ranks of the LDK and Bukoshi's government. Academician Rexhep Qosja told the press about the cause of the rift: "The problem is double-edged -- because of the prestige and the money that Bukoshi is gathering diligently while Rugova wants to spend it without any controls." Adem Demaci, chairman of the Commission for Human Rights and the director of the weekly FORUM, was more open in presenting the real picture. He sent out an appeal to his fellow-citizens "not to pay 30 percent of their income in tax to a republic that is not recognized by anyone. The chances are that they, Edita Tahiri and Anton Kolaj, are spending that money in the United States." Demaci also said that many leaders use the money from that fund to educate their children abroad, while the Albanians in Kosovo can barely make ends meet. Following these individual clashes, the supporters of Rugova's option are now faced by an official opposition. At the recent gathering of Albanian parties in Tetovo -- which was not attended by the representatives of Rugova's LDK -- the so-called democratic bloc was formed. Mahmut Bakalli, who hitherto used to communicate exclusively in the Ankara-Pristina-Bonn-United States direction -- made his first public appearance in Tetovo.
