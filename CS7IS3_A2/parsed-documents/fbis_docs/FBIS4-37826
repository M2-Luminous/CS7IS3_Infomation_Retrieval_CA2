"For two weeks now we have not moved a metre," said Colonel 'Ali Salim Muhammad of the 17th Brigade stationed here, 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of Aden. "We could easily enter Aden, but we are waiting for the order from political leaders in Sanaa," the colonel added. "For the time being, we make do with bombarding military targets in Aden, especially the military camp at Khor Maksar." Aden hospital sources earlier reported that 30 people had been killed Thursday and nearly 150 wounded as north Yemeni gunners shelled the southern stronghold, prompting the south to appeal for foreign intervention to break the stranglehold. The bombardment began at dawn, continued through the day and was still in progress as night fell. Fierce fighting on the north and northwestern fronts meanwhile left eight soldiers dead and 48 wounded after northern troops launched two offensives, according to the city's other hospitals. The north's second lieutenant, Mujahid 'Ali Husayn, meanwhile said northern troops had moved some two kilometres (one mile) forward on Saturday [25 June], after repulsing a "desperate counter-attack by (southern) secessionists." Colonel 'Ali Shaykh 'Umar, commanding officer in Abyan 25 kilometres (16 miles) east of Aden, admitted that "northern fire has hit civilians by mistake," but said that was "very rare." Since northern troops launched their unrelenting assualt on the port a week ago 108 civilians have been killed and 387 wounded, according to hospital officials. Northern troops listened to patriotic songs played over a loud-speaker mounted on a military vehicle as they fired shells on Aden. But the songs did not drown out the explosions of shells fired by the south's heavy artillery from the besieged city. Southern shells fell sporadically into the desert near the brigade's positions, and southern warplanes buzzed Abyan regularly, flying high to avoid northern anti-aircraft fire. Burned-out remains of northern troop-carriers, destroyed in southern air raids, were strewn around the dusty Al-Aslam region some 15 kilometres (nine miles) from Aden. But northern soldiers were visibly relaxed in the scorching sun, as they washed themselves with scalding water from an enormous tank mounted on a rickety lorry. War broke out between northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5. So far, all attempts to mediate a ceasefire have failed.
