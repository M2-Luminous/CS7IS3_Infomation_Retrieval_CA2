According to the latest statistics released by the State Statistical Bureau, in the first four months of this year, fixed asset investments by state-owned units grew 38.4 percent over the same period last year, showing a decrease of 30.5 percentage points in the growth rate. Of this, the growth rates for capital construction and technical transformation investments dropped 32.5 and 28.4 percentage points, respectively. What is most eye-catching is that the growth rate of real estate development investments fell 72.8 percentage points, thus further cooling the "heat of real estate markets." While the investment scale was brought under control, the growth momentum of newly-started projects nationwide was also effectively restrained. In the first four months, a total of 6,316 state projects involving capital construction and technical transformation with an investment of 50,000 yuan or more each were launched throughout the country, 1,715 less than those of the same period last year; and investments totaled 47.5 billion yuan, down 32.3 percentage points. A total of 5,106 local projects were launched, 1,680 less than those of the same period last year; and total investments decreased 1.2 percentage points. The overall investment structure was improved as compared with the same period last year. In the first four months, excluding real estate development investments, state-owned units invested a total of 1.8 billion yuan in primary industries, up 13.6 percent. In secondary industries, state-owned units invested 60.8 billion yuan, up 27 percent; the ratio of such investment to total investment decreased from 56.2 percent to 52.7 percent. In tertiary industries, state-owned units invested 52.8 billion yuan, up 47.5 percent; the ratio of such investment to total investment increased from 42 percent to 45.8 percent. In analyzing Chinese investments in fixed assets, authoritative economists said: Despite initial successes in macroeconomic regulation and control, the demand for investment remains strong in various sectors. It is still rather difficult to reduce fixed asset investments to an appropriate scale. Localities should not relax their efforts, but should continue to resolutely implement the State Council's "circular on continuing to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over fixed asset investments." Meanwhile, the relevant departments should pay keen attention to and adopt effective measures to promptly solve problems related to the western region's slow investment growth and lack of funds for a number of key construction projects.
