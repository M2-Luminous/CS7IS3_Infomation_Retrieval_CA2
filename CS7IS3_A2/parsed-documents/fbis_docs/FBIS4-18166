Sweden will have the most in common with Germany, Denmark, and Britain. It is expected to cooperate with Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands on environmental issues, and with Germany and Denmark on labor market policy. On social policy, its likely partners will be Denmark and Belgium. In addition, it is expected to find common cause with Germany on industrial policy and budgetary matters, and with Britain on free trade, competition policy, and state subsidies. It will probably only be able to form alliances with the southern European countries on single issues: for instance, with Spain on regional policy and Greece on veterinary matters. Sweden will be closest to the French position on foreign and security policy issues. Portugal will be an ally on matters concerning the influence of smaller countries, as will Belgium. In an interview with Hedlund, Christer Asp, the deputy permanent representative in Brussels, promised that Sweden would be diligent in instituting the rules of the single market. "We will very much uphold the common rules and laws. The strength of cooperation is achieved by having set rules." He predicts that Sweden will soon surpass Britain, currently on top, in the number of regulations implemented. Asp also notes that Sweden's foremost aim as a member of the EU will be to defend the interests of small countries and "not get squeezed between the large trading countries."
