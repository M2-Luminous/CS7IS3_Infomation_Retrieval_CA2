Over 50 commanding officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Joint Chiefs of Staff attended a meeting at the ministry held to analyze the latest developments in the North Korean nuclear impasse and Pyongyang's military movements. The meeting, presided over by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, concluded that North Korea has not showed any signs of forward movement but that the North's conventional troops still pose a threat of attack. The commanders also decided that North Korea is unlikely to abandon its nuclear program despite South Korean-U.S. efforts at dialogue, leaving the issue clouded by uncertainty. North Korean aggression cannot be ruled out if the matter is referred to the UN Security Council for sanctions, they said. Yi instructed the military to support the government's policy on resolving the nuclear crisis through dialogue, while remaining on full alert to deter any attack and maintaining an early warning system in cooperation with the United States. Yi asked the armed forces to prepare for the South Korean-U.S. joint military exercise "Team Spirit," scheduled to open in November unless the nuclear problem is sufficiently defused.
