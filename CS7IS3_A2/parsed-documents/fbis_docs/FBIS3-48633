"Our efforts to attain reform are not aimed at causing a power struggle or horse-trading among political parties or factions," Hosokawa told a meeting of the Committee for the Promotion of Political Reforms, a private panel of business executives, academics and journalists. His remarks came in response to opposition attacks on his plan to replace the current 511-member House of Representatives with a 500-seat mixture of single-seat constituencies and proportional representation as favoring the coalition partners, especially Shinseito [Japan Reneewal Party] and Komeito. Hosokawa told the meeting, "I will not remain prime minister for a minute if political reform is not achieved." The remark was immediately taken as implying his readiness to disband the cabinet and resign if he fails to secure the opposition Liberal Democratic Party's consent to hammer out a compromise version of his reform package. Minutes after the meeting, however, Hosokawa recanted his statement, telling reporters in the premier's official residence, "I only uttered something as a matter of course as a general statement." "I am not thinking of dissolving the House of Representatives for a general election or of disbanding my cabinet," Hosokawa said. The meeting was called two days before the current Diet session is to close on Saturday -- Hosokawa's self-imposed deadline for pushing his package through the Diet.
