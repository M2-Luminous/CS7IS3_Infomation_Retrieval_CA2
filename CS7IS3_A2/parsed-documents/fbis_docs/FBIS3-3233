He said: Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong have expanded rapidly in the past nine years since it entered the transitional period in 1985. Thanks to the opportunities provided by the hinterland's reform and opening up, old Chinese enterprises -- such as the China Resources Group, Merchants Steam Navigation Group, International Travel Service, Bank of China, and People's Insurance Company -- have advanced by leaps and bounds, each with a total asset reaching from 1 to as much as several hundred billion Hong Kong dollars [HK$]. The groups' business activities have become internationalized and diversified. For example, the Bank of China Group, with over HK$400 billion in deposits and HK$700 billion in assets, has become the second largest financial group in Hong Kong. New Chinese- enterprises -- such as the International Trust and Investment Corporation, Everbright, Construction International, Guangdong Enterprises Group, and many others -- have developed vigorously and attracted broad attention. He said: Chinese enterprises are playing an increasingly important role in Hong Kong's economic activities. The China Resourses Group and other enterprises, which transport and manage all kinds of basic means of subsistence, especially those supplied by the hinterland, have played an active role in stabilizing the livelihood of the compatriots and curbing inflation in Hong Kong. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Guangdong Enterprises Group have also occupied a very important position in Hong Kong's maritime and inland navigation, especially navigation linking to the hintherland's ports. The Bank of China Group has channeled its more than HK$200 billion loans to support Hong Kong's industry, commerce, and infrastructure, and to meet the demand for capital by various sectors of society. Last year, the group issued loans amounting to HK$16 billion to support local industry and HK$100 billion to help local residents buy housing units in installment payments. The Bank of China Group has also actively helped the local authorities stabilize Hong Kong's financial markets many times and maintain the sound operation of Hong Kong banking and stock businesses, thereby winning praise from Hong Kong society. Huang Diyan concluded: In the future, Chinese enterprises in Hong Kong should step up efforts to build up their strength and strengthen the economic foundation for Hong Kong's smooth transition. He added: Chinese enterprises should not only play an important role in economic activities but also strive to be their own spokesman politically and have their own representatives in the Legislative Council's function groups.
