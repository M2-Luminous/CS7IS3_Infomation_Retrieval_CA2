Greetings on the coming new year 1994! Today is the Day of Solidarity of Azeris throughout the world. I greet the Azeris throughout the world on this momentous day and wish for them to cooperate even more closely in the future! The year 1993, which is drawing to an end, has been a difficult one for the Azeri people, for our republic. Complex sociopolitical processes have evolved in the life of the Republic of Azerbaijan this year; certain changes have occurred. The war that has resulted from aggression by the Armenian Armed Forces has continued; some of our lands have been occupied; many citizens of Azerbaijan have been forced to leave the locations of their permanent residence and become refugees. This year, the Republic of Azerbaijan has been going through a profound economic and social crisis. We may say with complete confidence and a feeling of tremendous pride that our people and our republic have come out of these difficulties and trials worthily, and are looking to the year 1994 with confidence. The year 1993 has been marked by complex collisions in the socioeconomic life of the republic. A confrontation between various groups and the striving of separatist forces to dismember Azerbaijan have disrupted sociopolitical stability in the republic, which by the middle of the year ended up on the very brink--at the threshold of a civil war. We might say that a civil war has already started, that the blood of brethren has been shed in some regions of Azerbaijan, which has worsened tensions within the republic. However, the people have once again displayed their wisdom, and prevented a civil war. The confrontation has been eliminated, and the separatist forces endeavoring to dismember Azerbaijan have been neutralized. By now, our republic is already solving its problems under stable and quiet conditions. This year, our republic has tried to stop the onslaught of the Armenian Armed Forces. Unfortunately, we have suffered defeats, and some territories have been lost. Our citizens who have become refugees as a result of the occupation of Azerbaijani lands by the Armenian Armed Forces have been resettled in other regions of the republic. At present, there are more than 1 million refugees in Azerbaijan. This has produced extreme tensions in the position of Azerbaijan as a whole, and in particular in the situation within the republic. However, it should be noted that the situation has now changed. In recent months, we have witnessed major changes, which have resulted from the efforts made to raise an army in the republic, strengthen discipline in it, and securely protect our lands. The units of the Army of Azerbaijan, our heroic warriors are now securely protecting our territories, displaying exemplary heroism, worthily responding to attacks by the Armenian Armed Forces, and striking blows at that. We can say with a feeling of satisfaction that in recent months, all attempts by Armenian Armed Forces have been defeated; their offensives have been turned back. The Armed Forces of our republic are securely defending the positions taken by them and are proving to the Armenian Armed Forces the degree to which the force and might of the Republic of Azerbaijan have increased. At present, heavy fighting is under way on all fronts, through the fault of the Armenian Armed Forces. We have said repeatedly, and I will repeat again, that our state comes out in favor of a peaceful withdrawal from this war, from the woes that have befallen Azerbaijan. We have taken several steps in this direction, and today we are proclaiming our position again. I think that these steps of ours should produce results. At the same time, the Republic of Azerbaijan has already been able to boost its military might, and our people may be completely confident that the Army of Azerbaijan will be able to take the necessary measures to ensure the secure defense of the republic and to regain the occupied lands in the future, too. War goes on, fighting goes on, and our people suffer losses. This is natural. Today, just as in the beginning of the year, the valiant sons of the Azeri people become martyrs and die as they defend our lands in front-line regions. Today, on the eve of this holiday, I express my condolences to the families, relatives, and loved ones of the fallen. I admire the courage of the heroic sons of Azerbaijan. May Allah bless all those who have sacrificed themselves, and may their graves be filled with light [the previous sentence is rendered in Azeri in the original]. May Allah grant patience to their families. I think that our people are capable of enduring these severe trials. At present, on this holiday, I send my holiday greetings to soldiers and officers and all our citizens who are steadfastly and heroically fighting at the front; I greet them on the occasion of New Year's day. I wish them health and success in doing their sacred duty. The war has borne bitter fruits, and it is still bearing them. The number of refugees has increased as a result of the aggression of the Armenian Armed Forces. As I address the refugees, the esteemed citizens of Azerbaijan, I send my greetings on the occasion of New Year's day. Indeed, it is the tradition of our people for each citizen to mark the New Year holiday in his own home, at the native hearth. Unfortunately, a majority of our citizens have lost warm shelter, houses, and hearths, and have been put up in various rayons. However, the refugees, wherever they might be, should know that our people care for them deeply, and the state looks after them. No matter how sad they are and what hardships they are experiencing, I wish them to be in a holiday mood today. Our republic is going through a difficult crisis. The socioeconomic crisis is associated, on one hand, with the war that has been going on for about six years, and on the other hand, it has been due to certain objective and subjective causes. All of these were the reasons for a decline in the welfare of our people, who are now in a difficult situation. However, we know that our people are patient, and that they will endure these difficulties, too. The distressing year 1993 will end, and in 1994 a turnaround will occur in the development of our economy; the welfare of the people will improve with every passing day. Today, on the Day of Solidarity of Azeris throughout the world, I wish all Azeris to have unity and solidarity. The solidarity of Azeris on the territory of the independent Republic of Azerbaijan is needed to this end first of all. The second year of independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan is now ending. This is not too long a period of time. These two years have been a difficult time for our republic. We are proceeding toward a third anniversary of our independence. We are facing great tasks, to accomplish which our people and the Republic of Azerbaijan will need unity and solidarity of all citizens. If all of our citizens, all Azeris residing in our republic, manage to create a genuine atmosphere of accord, we will be able to achieve unity among Azeris throughout the world. This is why I appeal to our people for solidarity, I appeal for patience. I would like to assure you that the coming year 1994 will be a year of great changes and great accomplishments for the Republic of Azerbaijan. I repeat: We are now securely protecting our Motherland, our lands. We strive to lead Azerbaijan out of the state of war, to put an end to this war, withdraw from it in a peaceful manner. We have taken a multitude of steps to this end, and we will take them in the future. On 20 December, in Paris, I signed the Paris Charter on behalf of the Azeri people. We have thus demonstrated yet again to the entire world the adherence of the Republic of Azerbaijan to peace, tranquility, and security. We are supporters of peace. However, along with this we reinforce our defense forces and strive, and will continue to strive, to ensure the recovery of the occupied lands of Azerbaijan. Our people can be sure that all measures will be taken to ensure the territorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the inviolability of our borders. You, dear citizens, dear brothers and sisters, may be certain that in 1994 our occupied lands will be recovered at any price. The refugees will return to their homes, to their dwellings. The territorial integrity and state sovereignty of the Republic of Azerbaijan will be fully upheld. Once again, I greet all of you on the occasion of New Year's day. I wish all citizens of Azerbaijan to have peace, tranquility, prosperity, happiness in personal life, and success in all of your endeavors. Good bye! Happy New Year!
