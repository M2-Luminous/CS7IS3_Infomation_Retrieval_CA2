(1) An applicant for a loan that has been denied may, as part of the request for a review, request an independent collateral evaluation by an independent evaluator, as defined in §614.4440 of this subpart, of any interests in property securing the loan (other than the stock or participation certificates of the lender held by the borrower). (2) Within 30 days after a request for a collateral evaluation, the credit review committee shall present the applicant or borrower with a list of three independent evaluators approved by the qualified lender. The borrower shall select and engage the services of an evaluator from the list to perform the collateral evaluation. The collateral evaluation must be completed within a reasonable period of time. The cost of the evaluation shall be borne by the applicant or borrower. (3) The credit review committee shall consider the results of any such collateral evaluation in any final determination with respect to the loan or restructuring, provided the applicant's or borrower's evaluator has provided a copy of the evaluation report to the lender not less than 15 business days prior to any scheduled meeting of the credit review committee. (4) Any such collateral evaluations that are not completed in conformance with the collateral evaluation requirements described in subpart F of this part, relative to collateral evaluation standards, independence requirements, and qualification requirements, need not be considered by the credit review committee. To facilitate the proper completion of such collateral evaluations, a copy of part 614, subpart F, shall be provided to the borrower for presentation to the borrower's evaluator, and a copy signed by the borrower's evaluator shall be a required exhibit in the subsequent evaluation report. * * * * * PART 618_GENERAL PROVISIONS 4.
