It is assessing several offers, the one from the RDP Group among them. Nevertheless, no agreement has been signed between the Defense Ministry and the arms manufacturing consortium. Moreover, Zdenek Borkovec says: "The Defense Ministry is considering several alternatives of the modernization of the T-72 tank. Because of the high financial requirements of the project, the key problems of the solution are being examined first. The RDP Group concept does not completely correspond to the specified tactical technical demands of the army. The aforementioned RDP concept is more export oriented." Currently, 542 tanks of the T-72 series serve the Army of the Czech Republic. According to Zdenek Borkovec, neither the number of tanks to be modernized, nor the time schedule for their modernization have been decided. The optimum alternatives -- with respect to the future orientation of the transforming Czech Army and, above all, the limited financial resources -- are to be selected by the end of the year 1994. Regarding the new technical concept of the army, the principal document apparently is the "Concept of the Building of the Army of the Czech Republic to 1996," which was discussed by the government last June. It was decided that in the realization of the intended goals, the same system of planning, programming and budgeting (SPPR) will be used, as is commonly used and accepted in the armies of the North Atlantic Alliance. This system, which, according to Zdenek Borkovec, makes the processes taking place in the army transparent, and facilitates easier monitoring of the army by the parliament, will be applied as early as this year. The financing of the armed forces is covered by the Defense Ministry chapter of the state budget, which assumes total expenditures of 26.792 billion korunas and total revenues of 2.3 billion korunas. Of the total expenditures, 8.88 billion korunas is intended for technical material, of which, 278 million is earmarked for the purchase of new arms, technology, and other material as per the "Concept." The new tank, which should be manufactured in coordination with the RDP Group consortium, will allegedly meet the requirements of the NATO organization concerning of its member states' arms. According to the director general of the consortium, Jan Vlcek, a number of the elements -- the communication system, for instance -- are compatible with the Alliance systems. According to Zdenek Borkovec, however, "the notion of compatibility with NATO armies cannot be identified with compatibility of arms. It is a logical sequence of certain activities in which the compatibility of the equipment has its place but it is not a primary one. First, the linguistic, planning, communication, and other problems must be overcome. Therefore, it is expected that approximately during the period until 1996, only a part of the armed forces will be equipped, above all, with the modern means of communication, command, and reconnaissance." Jan Vlcek claims in the RDP Group statement that one of the alternatives of the modernization of the existing tank is prepared for the Czech Army as the most important customer. The army, according to the aforementioned information, adopted a substantially more cautious stand. Exports will apparently be necessary for RDP.
