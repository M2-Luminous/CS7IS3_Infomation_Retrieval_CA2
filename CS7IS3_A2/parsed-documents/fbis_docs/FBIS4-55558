There is great interest in the upcoming session, as the most topical issues, from relieving Josipa Manolic of his duties and appointing a new president of the House of Counties, to the alleged demand for the resignation of Defense Minister Gojko Susak and Minister of Culture Vesna Jurkic Girardi, are on the agenda. President Manolic reminded him that the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] wanted to relieve him of his duties as president of the Chamber of Counties very quickly. He also reminded of the reasons for founding the HND [Croatian Independent Democrats], stating that was what changed the political balance of powers in the Assembly and the political scene in Croatia. Manolic claims that the opposition was thus strengthened as a whole, which was the main goal. The unsuccessful attempt at replacing him started the parliamentary crisis, said Manolic. A resolution can occur either through an agreement of all those involved in the crisis, or by holding preterm elections, which would not suit anybody. "We have managed to carry out a differentiation process both within and outside the assembly, we have strengthened the position of the entire opposition, and partly managed to break the monopoly of one party and one man. We want the party that has had the monopoly until now to continue the differentiation process. We accept the challenge. We want to form our own club and to be entitled to the same rights in conducting talks." Manolic also told the reporters that the HND had proposed to the HDZ that the item relating to replacing the presidents of the two parliament chambers be taken off the agenda so that any possibility of obstructing the activities of the parliament and the expensive marathon-like sessions are avoided. The HND further proposed to put the item on the agenda in 15 to 20 days, but only after the agreement of all the parties on the redistribution of all the important positions is reached. Manolic predicted that there would be "pulling and pushing" about this issue if the HDZ does not accept the proposal. Seks' Threats In the introductory part of the news conference, Manolic repeated his statement that certain representatives were pressured and seriously threatened. He quoted the words of Vladimir Seks, spoken in Vinkovci: "Croatia does not have capital punishment, but we will take Manolic and Mesic's heads off." " Why are there threats and on whose behalf? The times of a one-party state are behind us, and the time of real parliamentary decision making is ahead of us. We will defend the autonomy of the assembly," said Manolic. He mentioned the non-democratic behavior during the forming of the State Tribunal, explained why some opposition representatives have been asking that discussions of topical issues, such as the resignations of Gojko Susak and Vesna Girardi Jurkic, and the teachers' strike, be held at the Assembly. "The Assembly can not neglect these problems," remarked Manolic. He has asked that issues that were up until now untouchable, covered by the veil of "military secrets," be discussed at the assembly. The questions of the reporters then followed. [Zeljko Peratovic] Did you attend the party meeting at the Presidential Palace in the morning? [Mesic] I was invited, but I did not know who it was that invited me, so I did not go. I had a short meeting with leaders of some opposition parties at the Assembly, and agreed with them that we had to discuss the new balance of powers after we founded the Club of the HND. I did not go to the meeting -- I did not want to go before it was determined what Deputy President Seks said, why he openly threatened us. Such vocabulary becomes a traveling circus. "What Resignation?!" [VJESNIK] Why did you write a letter to U.S. congressmen, claiming that the Washington agreement is not being implemented, when the Vienna agreement had already been signed at that time? [Mesic] The time we sent the letter does not match the time of the signing of the Vienna agreement. We sent the letter to point out that the arms embargo must be lifted, so that the people can defend themselves. We also pointed out that there were forces that want to prevent the implementation of the Washington agreement. [VJESNIK] Which forces are preventing the implementation of the Washington agreement; did you discuss that with Mr. Galbraith? [Manolic] At the time we sent the letter, a discussion had started in the U.S. Congress regarding the lifting of the arms embargo, which was during the time of the fiercest attacks on Gorazde, when the international forces were not capable of protecting the Muslims. We also asked that the embargo on Croatia be lifted, because that is the only way we can defend ourselves from the Serb agressor. President Tudjman said at a certain point that he opposed the lifting of the embargo, and he has not taken it back, although circumstances have changed. [Dijana Rexhepi] When do you expect that a peaceful reintegration of the UNPA's [UN Protection Areas] will take place? [Mesic] We want rule-of-law in Croatia, in which authorities are divided into three parts, in which European standards are applied, and in which every citizen will have guarantees that they will be protected. [Sead Saracevic] You claim that the HND is the second most powerful party in Croatia. How would you account for that? [Manolic] We are the number two parliamentary opposition party; 10 representatives have gone over to us. They claim that we have a stud of Trojan horses. They are not a stud; they are representatives who have names. [Mesic] I would say they are thoroughbreads. [Dejan Jovic] What positions in the Assembly would you demand for the HND? Which parties attended the meeting? [Mesic] There is a new reality in the Assembly. Now we have to sit down and talk, but without previous conditions. We will not accept ultimatums. We want partnership, fair talks, and a gentlemen-like agreement. We talked to Savka Dabcevic-Kucar [president of the Croatian National Party, HNS], Drazen Budisa [president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party, HSLS], Djapic [leader of the Croatian Rights Party, HSP], Ivica Racan [president of the Party of Democratic Changes, SDP], and a HSS [Croatian Peasants Party] representative also attended, while some were not able to attend. We will meet for a discussion again, after the talks in the Presidential Palace are over. The World Is Breaking Over Bosnia-Herzegovina [REUTER] What does your criticism of the government relate to? [Mesic] We have not criticized the government; the government has worked within the provided framework, and we support it. Our criticism relates to state politics, the policies toward Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. The HDZ has responded to two historical challenges: getting out of the Communist-Bolshevist surroundings, and founding a state. Now the question arises what kind of Croatia we want. We want rule-of-law, in which everyone will be doing their job within the framework of the Constitution and the laws. We have encountered obstacles there. President Tudjman said that rule-of-law would function only when all the territories are liberated, and we think that rule-of-law can function in the liberated parts. When it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we believe it should remain within its borders, and that the world should not violate the principle of inviolability of borders, as if this is done, the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina could be annexed to Serbia and it could pull the occupied parts of Croatia along. At the time we were inferior in weapons, we opened the front with the Muslims too, although we had a common aggressor. The results of this policy are evident: tens of thousands killed and exiled, houses destroyed. [Ingrid Badurina] What is your interpretation of the disunion in relation to the percentages of the territory that is supposed to belong to the Muslim-Croat Federation? In Vienna there was talk about 58 percent, while in Geneva 51 percent was being mentioned. [Mesic] The international community must take efficient action that would make the third side realize what reality is, that is not allow that borders be changed through aggression. [Manolic] The world is breaking over Bosnia-Herzegovina, and this is why this illogicality. However, that still does not mean that the Serbs will not find a place for themselves in the Federation. [Olga Ramljak] You support legality, but you do not want the vote of no confidence to take place, although, in accordance with the procedure, the issue was put on the agenda. Why is that? Moreover, you have addressed the U.S. Congress, while you reproached others for doing so. [Mesic] We have the right to address the international public if the Croatian people are in danger, and the arms embargo is disadvantageous to the Croat people. We are against measures being taken against Manolic only because he expressed his opinion. President Tudjman announced there would be proceedings before the Court of Honor because Manolic did not take back what he said, but while we were in the meeting, there was a phone call saying signatures were being collected. Manolic should have been given the chance to defend himself before the Court of Honor. It is to these methods that we object. [Manolic] We have put the issue of the relieving the president of the Chamber of Counties on the agenda, but at the session we will propose that it be taken off the agenda if the proposer -- the Club of the HDZ -- accepts it. If it is not accepted, the session will be conducted according to the agenda. As far as the accusations, the "traitors addressing the world" are concerned, we have not accused Croatia, but the policy that has isolated Croatia from the rest of the world, led it into social unrest, and almost destroyed it. "Kuna -- a Concession to the Herzegovinian Lobby" [REUTER] How much influence does the Herzegovinian lobby have on Croatian politics, and who is against the Washington agreement? [Manolic] It is a large lobby. The Vienna agreement has provided answers to Gojko Susak's war aims. However, what is left of them? Tens of thousands of dead and exiled. None of these war aims have been achieved. We know in advance who will oppose the Vienna agreement: the same people who started the war against the Muslims. [Jasmina Kuzmanovic] Allegedly, the decision was made that the kuna be introduced in Herzeg-Bosna too. Is that correct? [Manolic] The kuna is a minor issue, although it is interesting that within one year the Law on the Croatian Bank Note has been changed twice. The decision on the kuna was made at the time of the greatest conflicts with the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus being a concession to the Herzegovinian lobby. [Mesic] There is no mention of Herzeg-Bosna in the Washington agreement, and therefore there is no mention of the kuna being introduced either. That would not have been support to the implementation of the Washington agreement. [Unidentified foreign correspondent] Will you disclose the names of the representatives who have become members of the HND? [Mesic] Yes.
