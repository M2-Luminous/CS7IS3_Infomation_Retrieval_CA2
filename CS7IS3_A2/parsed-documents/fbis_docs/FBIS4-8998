Participating in the conference is a group of more than 10 representatives of the North Atlantic Assembly, a political-advisory body of NATO, with Chairman Loice Bouverde, Secretary General Peter Corterier, Jose Pereira, head of the subcommittee on Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, and functionaries of the NATO apparatus. The numerous high-ranking officials include representatives of Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Russian Federation, and Romania. Poland is represented by several Sejm deputies and senators, representatives of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, teh Academy of National Defense, and others. Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy underscored the expectations of Poland and, as it seems, of all interested states in our region, to enhance the guarantees of international security through cooperation with NATO. He also recalled the thesis that there is the possibility of various advancement in the construction of links, with the use of the platforms on which there are no longer any differences between us. "We appreciate the significance of the Partnership for Peace program. We will implement it. However, it does exhaust our political aspirations." The roundtable discussion consists of three sessions. The first one presents "NATO's Perception of Future Relations With Central Europe," the second, "Perception of Central European States' Future Relations With NATO," and the third, "Prospects for Neutral and Nonaligned States." Hans Jochem Peters, head of the liaison section in the Political Affairs Department in NATO, pointed, among other things, to the importance that is being attached to the Partnership for Peace program. Vernon Penner, political adviser to the commander in chief of allied forces in Europe, posed the question of whether Poland and other states applying for membership in NATO are ready to share the burden of NATO's duties in resolving international problems. Later on, he added that "there are not many states such as Poland that thoroughly understand the entire issue." Commander Ian Clapham, staff officer in the office of special adviser to the commander in chief of the organization in Europe, responsible for cooperation, characterized the state of contacts that have already been made. In 1993, the Central and East European states took part in 220 joint military activities with NATO. In 1994, there will be approximately 350 such initiatives. Among other activities, this October there are scheduled joint Polish-Czech-British-Dutch exercises of battalions in the Netherlands, the task of which will be to test the feasibility of cooperation in peacekeeping operations. Cdr. Clapham reviewed the contacts to date on the so-called second level (the first level are talks and decisions among high-ranking politicians)--that is, experts, commanders in charge of maneuvers, participants in seminars and courses. He said that Slovakia had been given advice on how to organize rapid deployment forces; Moldova, Romania, and Bulgaria were shown computer support of military exercises; various problems of the fleets of Albania and Bulgaria were jointly analyzed. He said that "the most substantive example of joint action" were the early-warning flights over Hungary in connection with the Balkan conflict. The speakers characterized the main barriers to further cooperation. "In contacts with some partners, we have a trust gap," it was generally agreed. In the case of members of CIS, a certain problem would be the different plans to transform military structures--some of them are being changed quite significantly, others have preserved a typically Soviet structure. Another problem is the knowledge of Western languages; in Poland, only 200 officers speak such languages, whereas there should be at least several times as many. However, there are also states in the East in which this can be said of only a few dozen officers. Important problems are also distances--for example, between Kazakhstan and NATO Headquarters, as well as the poor communications network. However, generally speaking, "the possibilities for passive cooperation are petering out. We have reached the limits of efficiency in this form of cooperation. We must enhance the clarity, raise the level of trust, and grant greater assistance to your states in the establishment of Armed Forces that are an element of democracy," said I. Clapman.
