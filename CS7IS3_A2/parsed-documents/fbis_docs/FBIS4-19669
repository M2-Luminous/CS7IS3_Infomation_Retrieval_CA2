These letters can be described as memorandums calling for the immediate signing of the package of confidence-building measures. Ozgur's memorandums also upheld several views that are in parallel with those that have been expressed by Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis; Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative; and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative. Ozgur leaked his letters through mediators to the Greek Cypriot side in order to convey particular messages to the Greek Cypriots. The Greek Cypriot newspapers reported on Ozgur's memorandums shortly after they were conveyed to Denktas. We acquired three of the letters, which can be described as memorandums, some time ago. We urged those who promised to establish a clear administration before the election in 1993 to make them public. Denktas and Ozgur, however, preferred not to do so. So we decided to publish Ozker Ozgur's first memorandum, dated 11 March 1994, today. In it, Ozgur opposes Denktas' statement that he has lost confidence in Butrus Butrus-Ghali and says that what Denktas has said is an obstacle to the UN secretary general's effort. He opposes placing sovereignty on the agenda and the effort made to hold talks on the essence of the Cyprus problem before the package of confidence-building measures is put into effect. Ozgur describes that approach as a delaying tactic. Ozker Ozgur also opposes the inclination to seek recourse in the Republican Assembly on legal changes. His letter reads as follows: TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf Denktas, Nicosia. According to page one of the records of the 10 March 1994 meeting, we expressed the view that talks on the essence of the Cyprus problem should not be held before all the necessary procedures relating to the confidence-building measures package are complete. But the work to repair Maras [Varosha] will take five years. The international community will not agree to suspend the work on the essence of the problem for that long. We must realize that we must benefit from the situation created by the existing conditions in our favor. You have noted in the records that holding talks on issues concerning a comprehensive solution, the issue of "sovereignty" for example, will be useful when negotiations are held on the confidence-building measures package. But considering that we have agreed to hold talks on the confidence-building measures package, an initiative to hold talks on a comprehensive agreement may be seen as a delaying tactic. That could be used against us. The confidence-building measures package clearly states that the sides will maintain their positions. According to paragraph five, page two, we opposed the proposal for the transfer of authority to UNTA to enable it to enact or amend laws and suggested that the two sides be consulted on any legal change that will be effected. But reference to the parliaments of the two sides is unnecessary within that framework. The main point, the right one, is our insistence on holding consultations with the two sides. The same paragraph also says that the communal leaders will be consulted before any change is made. We deem it useful to oppose the footnote on page one in the draft. The UN secretary general has taken up a goodwill mission in connection with the package of confidence-building measures. Although we are convinced that you are justified in your sensitive approach that the bounds of the UN secretary general's goodwill mission must not be exceeded before the process is complete, we believe that expressing a lack of confidence in the UN secretary general in advance, that is, before it is confirmed that the bounds of his goodwill mission have been exceeded, will be wrong. It will harm our image as the side that cooperates with the UN secretary general. We draw your attention to the points we have mentioned in this letter and convey our respects. [Signed] Ozker Ozgur, leader of the Republic Turkish Party [Date] 11 March 1994
