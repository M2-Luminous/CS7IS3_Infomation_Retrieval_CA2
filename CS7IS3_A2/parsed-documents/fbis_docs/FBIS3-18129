After the debate, the drafts were sent on to the committees. Speakers of all parliamentary groups attributed great importance to internal security and announced that they are looking for agreement on the less controversial details of the article laws. The deputies concentrated on the differences between the drafts. Speakers of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] regretted that the coalition draft does not envisage the possibility to monitor conversations in apartments to combat organized crime, but they called the respective formulations in the SPD draft impracticable. The coalition said the SPD's demand that assets be temporarily impounded when there is just well-founded suspicion that they were acquired by criminal activities is unconstitutional. The SPD, for its part, accused the coalition of wanting to blur the borders between the intelligence services and the police in a constitutionally alarming way by giving the Federal Intelligence Office (BND) powers of investigation against organized crime. Interior Minister Kanther (CDU) said that with its draft law the coalition proves that it is able to act. Effective policy for internal security is the "best contribution" against extremist parties. The opening of the borders in Europe gives rise to crime in Germany. Kanther explained the coalition's article law, on which the CDU/CSU and the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] agreed in January after protracted negotiations. Criminal proceedings should be accelerated and the detention law should become "more effective." Penal provisions about instigating people and using Nazi-like symbols should be expanded. It should be possible to impose higher sentences for bodily injury. It should be an "imperative" provision of the law that adult foreign drug dealers be expelled from the country. The regulation on turning state's evidence should be transferred to organized crime. In the case of the extortion of protection money, higher fines should be imposed. The BND should be permitted to pass on findings on organized crime, which are gained through monitoring international telephone conversations, to the responsible authorities. Kanther said: "Unfortunately, the electronic monitoring of conversations in apartments is not included in the package of laws." He will continue to advocate it. On behalf of the SPD, Deputy Group Chairwoman Anke Fuchs said that the coalition has neglected to hit organized crime at its "never," namely at its profits and assets. Saying this, Mrs. Fuchs justified her group's proposal that not a court sentence but already justified suspicion should be sufficient for impounding assets, which have perhaps been gained by criminal activities. Then the suspect should be forced to prove that he gained the assets legally. Illegal profits must not be introduced in the legal economic cycle just because investigations are too slow. Therefore, the SPD proposes and amendment to Basic Law Article 14 (guarantee of property). However, her group knows that this would mean stepping on "juridical virgin soil." Mrs. Fuchs as well as SPD legal expert De With rejected the coalition's planned extension of the regulation on turning state's evidence as well as additional powers for the BND. Other projects of the coalition (perpetrator-victim compensation, stricter punishment for bodily injury, ban of neo-Nazi symbols) are supported by the SPD group. FDP legal expert Kleinert said that everything that the SPD did not take over from the coalition is "abstruse." With it proposals for impounding assets, the SPD is crossing the "limits of a rule-of-law state." Kleinert paid tribute to the coalition draft. The differences of opinion on monitoring conversations in apartments did not lead to blockades in other fields. FRG Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger demanded that the laender reinforce their police forces. The planned laws must not give the impression that the state has been defenseless so far. Party of Democratic Socialism Deputy Gysi accused the SPD of using its draft law so as not to expose itself to the coalition in the election campaign regarding internal security. The coalition and the SPD want to restrict basic rights. Just as the coalition, Gysi criticized the SPD's proposals for impounding assets. Shifting the burden of proof weakens the citizen. The social reasons of crime must be eliminated, Gysi said. Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein (CSU) paid tribute to the coalition draft as a piece of progress, but he noted that it does not live up to the threat posed by organized crime. It must be possible to monitor the apartments of heavy criminals. Covert investigators must be permitted to commit "milieu-related" crimes. Beckstein called for life terms for "gang-like organized drug dealing." The constitutional protection authorities should be involved in watching organized crime.
