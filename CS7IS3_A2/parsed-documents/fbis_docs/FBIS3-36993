Clinton Could Have Gotten Through to B. Yeltsin If He Had Wanted To"] [Text] On 11 February world agencies reported on a briefing at the White House on the adoption by the NATO Council, at the level of representatives of the member countries, of a decision which, as is known, presupposes the possibility of bombing raids on Serbian positions in Bosnia. During the briefing, White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers said, in particular, that President Clinton had "tried to get through to Yeltsin before the announcement of NATO's decision. Unfortunately, their conversation did not take place." This statement clearly qualifies as sensational on two counts. Even in the cold war years there was no occasion when the leaders of the two great powers were unable to hear one another in an emergency. Second, your IZVESTIYA correspondent has seen the mobile presidential communications switchboards which are set up wherever he might be at any time of the day or night: in a car, in an aircraft (from the big presidential TU-154 M to the small Yak-40, on which he occasionally makes short flights, and the helicopter, which is used for trips to his out-of-town residence, and so on). V. Ilyushin, the president's principal assistant [pervyy pomoshchnik], told INTERFAX that B. Yeltsin had been ready to talk for 90 minutes and had waited for the call "for as long as he decently could." Your IZVESTIYA correspondent also managed to establish that "non-hotline" communications between the two presidents are conducted via a switchboard at the Foreign Ministry. A. Lake, the U.S. president's national security assistant, got through to Moscow via this switchboard, and this fact might refute Mrs. Myers' words about technical difficulties. So what we are talking about probably is political "difficulties." Washington wanted to wait for the NATO Council decision on the Serbian question, and only then perhaps inform the Russian president.
