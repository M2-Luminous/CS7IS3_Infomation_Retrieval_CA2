After many years, the people, the press and most political parties are in a mood to have a settlement with Pakistan. They are generally on the defensive whenever Kashmir crops up because they are not happy over all that is happening in the valley. On the other hand, never before had the government considered Kashmir a disputed territory as it has done now even in a roundabout way. The Shimla Agreement, which is India's Bible on Indo-Pak relations, specifically mentions a final settlement on Jammu and Kashmir and New Delhi has adhered to the formulation. Even after declaring from the ramparts of Red Fort on the Independence Day that Kashmir is an integral part of lndia, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao wrote a letter to Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto proposing talks, including Kashmir as a subject. As promised in Islamabad during the abortive meeting between the foreign secretaries of the two countries, New Delhi has sent a package of six proposals to improve the relationship. They may not be ideal ones. But they concede some ground, which can be expanded. In contrast, Pakistan's response has been hysterical. It has declared a country-wide hartal [strike] for February 5. Benazir Bhutto has already gone to the UN Human Rights Commission accusing India of having committed excesses in Kashmir. And her foreign minister has threatened a nuclear war if Kashmir is not settled. All this is familiar. This time the rhetoric is more shrill than before. Otherwise, it is the same exercise which Islamabad has gone over many a time. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the late Pakistan prime minister, too had threatened a 1,000 year war. Yet the same Bhutto turned so peace-loving that he not only agreed to convert the cease-fire line into a line of control but also hailed it as `a line of peace'. He signed the Shimla Agreement to consecrate a bilateral approach. He said he was sick of going to the world chanceries for help. After the 1965 and 1971 wars, he realised that he would have to sit one day with India, across the same table, to settle all disputes, including Kashmir. Islamabad, under the leadership of his daughter, Benazir Bhutto, has taken a different course. It has unilaterally repudiated the Shimla Agreement. It has said that future bilateral talks will be aimed at finalising 'the modalities for holding plebiscite in Kash mir'. But clause Vl [Roman 6] of the agreement had mentioned `the modalities' in connection with `the establishment of durable peace and normalisation of relations, including a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir'. Nowhere does plebiscite figure. Assuming that Pakistan wants nothing but a plebiscite, it surely realises what it is in for. While proposing plebiscite, the UN had laid down certain conditions. One is that the entire State of Jammu and Kashmir will come under the control of India. This means that Pakistan will have to vacate not only `Azad Kashmir' but also areas like Gilgit and Baltistan, which are now its integral part. (China too will have to vacate the Kashmir territory, which General Mohammad Ayub Khan had given to it in 1962). Two, the armed forces of Pakistan will have to withdraw from `Azad Kashmir', Gilgit and Baltistan, leaving behind only a contingent of Indian forces to enforce law and order. Three, normalcy in the State must return before a plebiscite is held. It is difficult to imagine Islamabad complying with these conditions. The people in Pakistan will never agree to the handing over of `Azad Kashmir', Gilgit and Baltistan even temporarily. And Pakistan should note that there is no time-limit for normalcy to return. New Delhi too cannot go back to plebiscite because it will revive religious animosities. When a referendum in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) was held in 1947 to determine whether it should go to India or Pakistan, the choice got reduced to whether the Muslims wanted to vote for the Gita or the Koran. India cannot afford to rip open old wounds. Its battered secularism following the demolition of Babri Masjid cannot withstand any more knocks. Both countries face a difficult situation. I am reminded of what Jawaharlal Nehru told Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in London in November 1961: "Zulfi, I know that we must find a solution for Kashmir. But we have got caught in a situation which we cannot get out of without causing damage to the systems and structures of our respective societies." Another development which has taken place in the last few years is that the Kashmiris want independence. When India and Pakistan agreed to a plebiscite in 1948, the choice was confined to joining either India or Pakistan. Islamabad has repeatedly said that it wants the Kashmiris to decide about their future. Will it agree to the third option? And, is an independent Kashmir a tenable proposition? After all, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir wanted his state to be independent after the British left but failed in his endeavour. Pakistan never accepted the idea. The only solution possible is a settlement which may displease all the three, India, Pakistan and Kashmir, but may go some way in assuaging their sensitivities. One proposal is to soften the line of control so that the bona fide nationals of the state living in Kashmir and `Azad Kashmir' become one people. They should enjoy autonomy except in defence and foreign affairs. Both subjects should continue to vest in India and Pakistan in their respective parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The nationals of India and Pakistan should be able to visit the state by getting a visa -- the Indian citizens from Islamabad to go to `Azad Kashmir' and the Pakistanis from New Delhi to visit Kashmir. This arrangement is not an ideal one but it may enable the people on both sides to meet more often at least in Kashmir. It is quite possible that one day the high walls that fear and distrust have raised on the border will crumble and the people of the subcontinent, without giving up their separate identities, will work together for the common good. *
