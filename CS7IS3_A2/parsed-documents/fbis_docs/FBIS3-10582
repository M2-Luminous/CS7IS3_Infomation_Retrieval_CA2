Senator Julio Larosiliere has charged Sen. Osny Eugene and Sen. Bernard Sansaricq with the responsibility for the physical attacks on employees of the Senate administrative service. [passage omitted] Firmin Jean-Louis, the official senate president, says he has advised the senators not to go to the premises of the Senate in order to avoid any clashes. Jean-Louis has called the incidents barbarous acts. Sen. Jean-Louis says he asked the police chief to intervene to stop the acts of banditry, but that he remains unsatisfied. [Begin Jean-Louis recording, in Creole] [passage omitted] The first thing we did was to communicate directly with Port-au-Prince Police Chief [Lieutenant] Colonel [Joseph Michel] Francois. I had a long telephone conversation with him. I explained to him the situation the way it had been explained to me. As Senate president, I formally asked him to take the necessary measures to ensure not only the safety of the building [corrects himself] of the buildings, but also the safety of the senators. He told us that -- just as he agreed to send policemen on 7 March at the request of Sen. Sansaricq -- he agreed to send soldiers to the Senate. The soldiers may ensure safety both inside and outside of the building, but they will not intervene in what may happen between senators. This supposedly means that the soldiers can do nothing in the event that senators aim weapons at one another. [passage omitted] [end recording]
