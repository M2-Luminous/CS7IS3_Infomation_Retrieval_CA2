FBIS4-65964 "drweu102_o_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-102 Daily Report 25 May 1994 CYPRUS Feissel Denies Lamb Proposed Changes Feissel Denies Lamb Proposed Changes NC2505170994 Nicosia O FILELEVTHEROS in Greek 25 May 94 p 20 NC2505170994 Nicosia O FILELEVTHEROS Greek BFN [Report by Andreas Khatzikiriakos] [Text] A reliable source yesterday told O FILELEVTHEROS that the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council can only be blocked if Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas gives clear and positive answers on the issues of the map and Famagusta's fenced-off area. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, said: "There are no plans to delay submission of the report further." With the entire procedure having lost a significant part of its credibility, however, Nicosia appears to have reservations about the assurances it has been given. These reservations are intensifying because Britain and the United States expect Denktas to give a positive answer by tomorrow and because, in case of an agreement, it is unclear if the two sides will accept the same things. In a statement to O FILELEVTHEROS, Feissel categorically denied allegations that on Monday [23 May] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, made some proposals that concerned the Cypriot Government. Feissel reiterated that the substantive portion of the UN document cannot be changed. Feissel specifically denied that: a) The creation of two separate customs offices at Nicosia International Airport was proposed; b) Access by Greek Cypriots to Famagusta will be controlled by Turkish Cypriot policemen in civilian clothes; c) A number of countries will allow Turkish Cypriots to enter by using "Turkish Cypriot passports;" d) He had agreed to Turkish Cypriot control of access to Famagusta; e) The aircraft of the "Turkish Cypriot Airlines" will bear the pseudostate's emblem; f) Turkish Cypriot troops will use the Dherynia-Famagusta road. It is worth noting that an official government statement that was issued last Monday referred to two additional proposals, distinct from the six mentioned above, but Feissel refused to comment on them. Those were that both sides would make an equal number of flights from Nicosia International Airport and that troops would remain in the southern part of the fenced-off area. A reliable source told O FILELEVTHEROS that the procedure for the submission of the UN secretary general's report has been set in motion, clarifying that "if nothing happens, the report will be full, complete, and detailed." The same source said: "The only development that could prevent the report from being submitted would be an agreement on the confidence-building measures, something that both sides agree on." He added that the main issues on which the Turkish side must give clear answers are the map--a yes or no answer is required--and the issue of access. He said: "A specific settlement is proposed regarding access, and we want an answer on it." For his part, Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis did not rule out that Denktas might make some maneuver. Asked for a general evaluation of the situation, Kasoulidhis said: "It is difficult to make a general evaluation because the Turkish side's moves are unpredictable." O FILELEVTHEROS has learned the United States has sent a message to the Cypriot Government which mentions that Denktas will accept the confidence-building measures after a meeting of the so-called "ministerial council" and the pseudoparliament. U.S. Ambassador in Nicosia Richard Boucher yesterday said "the main point of the entire effort is to find an operational settlement that will enable both sides to use the basic changes stemming from the confidence-building measures." He also appeared to be impatient for the report to circulate, adding that this would prompt the Security Council to study alternative ways of action. Boucher also admitted that the obstacles have not been overcome.
