Kranich said that the Ministry of Finance had achieved "a lot of positive" and largely carried out the tax reform when Urike was the minister. Kranich said that no parallels could be drawn with the work of the Ministry of Economics, which, in spite of "great fuss" had managed to prepare only two bills that have reached the Riigikogu [parliament], both of them causing certain problems. Kranich said that the coming weeks would be needed to acquaint himself with the work of the Ministry, for he had no "clear idea of its condition."
