FR940812-1-00006 FR940812-1-00002 (3) *␣*␣* (iii) ``Expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to entertainment facilities or before January 1, 1994, with respect to clubs'', see paragraph (e) of this section, and * * * * * (e) Expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to entertainment facilities or before January 1, 1994, with respect to clubs _(1) In general. Any expenditure paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to a facility, or paid or incurred before January 1, 1994, with respect to a club, used in connection with entertainment shall not be allowed as a deduction except to the extent it meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. * * * * * (3) *␣*␣* (ii) Club dues _(a) Club dues paid or incurred before January 1, 1994. Dues or fees paid before January 1, 1994, to any social, athletic, or sporting club or organization are considered expenditures with respect to a facility used in connection with entertainment. The purposes and activities of a club or organization, and not its name, determine its character. Generally, the phrase social, athletic, or sporting club or organization has the same meaning for purposes of this section as that phrase had in section 4241 and the regulations thereunder, relating to the excise tax on club dues, prior to the repeal of section 4241 by section 301 of Pub. L. 89&hyph;44. However, for purposes of this section only, clubs operated solely to provide lunches under circumstances of a type generally considered to be conducive to business discussion, within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, will not be considered social clubs. ( b ) Club dues paid or incurred after December 31, 1993. See paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section with reference to the disallowance of deductions for club dues paid or incurred after December 31, 1993. * * * * * §1.274&hyph;5T [Amended] Par. 3. In §1.274&hyph;5T, the first two sentences of paragraph (c)(6)(iii) are amended by removing the language ``at any time'' and adding the language ``before January 1, 1994,'' in its place.
