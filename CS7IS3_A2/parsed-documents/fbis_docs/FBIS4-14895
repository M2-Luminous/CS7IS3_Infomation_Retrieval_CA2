In accordance with a decree signed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev today, the state Kazakhstan TV and Radio Broadcasting Company is to be closed down and a republican corporation of Kazakhstan's television and radio is to be set up instead. The head of state says his decision has been caused by objective necessity: It is obvious that the state broadcasting company has lost the struggle for the radio audience to the numerous commercial studios and stations in Kazakhstan, as well as to programs broadcast from Moscow. It is no coincidence that (Leyla Beketova), head of a commercial TV channel, has been appointed president of the new corporation. At the same time, one can clearly see that the Kazakhstan head of state is striving to increase his own influence on the Republic's television and radio broadcasting. For instance, the top official of the corporation will be directly subordinate to him. The president of the Republic has also appointed a senior official from his press service as his permanent representative in the new structure.
