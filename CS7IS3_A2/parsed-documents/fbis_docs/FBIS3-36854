As reported by Interfax, on February 8, FM Kozyrev accused the Baltic States of "ethnic cleansing" and other serious human rights violations, the statement says. In remarks to reporters, he stated, "About one third of the residents are treated differently based upon ethnicity. I have in mind the Russian-speakers -- Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews and even Finns -- who are not being given citizenship. They want citizenship, but it is being denied for one reason: ethnicity. If this is not `ethnic cleansing' what is it?" "Since numerous UN, CSCE, Council of Europe and other international delegations have all reaffirmed that the situation in Estonia fully measures up to international human rights standards, the question arises: Who is not telling the truth, the international organizations or the politician who has repeatedly declared Estonia to be part of Russia's sphere of interest, the so- called near abroad?" the Foreign Ministry's statement says. The Foreign Ministry affirms that the laws of the Republic of Estonia "allow everyone to acquire citizenship regardless of ethnicity". There is a positive aspect to the Russian Foreign Minister's comments on February 8, too, the statement continues. Namely, he presented an important historical position which has caused many bi-lateral disagreements due to differing interpretations. FM Kozyrev said, "I admit the crimes of the Stalin regime, but we cannot forget that these were carried out by political powers -- on the one side Stalin, on the other Hitler -- who signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact." "It is to be hoped that the Russian Foreign Minister will be able to take the next step and to admit that the Baltic States were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940," the Foreign Ministry's statement concludes.
