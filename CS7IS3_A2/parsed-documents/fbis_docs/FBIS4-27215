The program among the six carmakers -- Honda Motor Co., Mazda Motor Corp., Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Daihatsu Motor Co. -- is intended to trim their manufacturing costs for a minicar or vehicle with an engine displacement of 660 cc or less, MITI said. Unified parts will total 84 out of 20,000 items usually needed to assemble one automobile, MITI said. The proposed unification will cover most of the important auto component systems -- engines, electronics, lighting and measurement equipment, transmission, braking systems, body and attached equipment such as audio and air conditioners, MITI said. MITI hopes parts makers will be cooperative with the industry plan, a MITI official told a news conference. MITI proposed the latest program as a prescription for Japan's minicar makers to survive intensified price-cutting competition. The program will help secure a stable parts supply for consumers while promoting auto parts standardization and curbing unnecessary model changeovers, the official said. The auto and auto parts industries should formulate specific unification programs in a manner that would not cause problems under the Antitrust Law, the official said. Transparency should be also ensured in selecting components subject to unification, the official said.
