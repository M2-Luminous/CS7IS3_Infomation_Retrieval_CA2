FR941003-0-00043 FR941003-0-00013 C. Section 314.53_Submission of Patent Information Proposed §314.53 contained general requirements for the submission of patent information by NDA applicants and NDA holders. For example, proposed §314.53(b) would have required an NDA applicant to submit information on each patent that claims the drug or drug product for which the applicant is seeking approval or a method of using the drug that is the subject of the NDA or amendment or supplement and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product. Proposed §314.53(c) described general reporting requirements, such as information on the type of patent and the name of the patent owner, and also required applicants to submit ``certifications'' with respect to formulation or composition patents (proposed §314.53(c)(2)) and method of use patents (proposed §314.53(c)(3)). 21. One comment addressed patent information and amendments of patent information under proposed §§314.50(h) and 314.53. These provisions would require each application under section 505(b) of the act to contain specific information about each patent that claimed the drug product or a method of using the drug product. The provisions also would require applicants to amend patent information or patent certifications and would permit the agency to disclose patent information. The comment said FDA should only publish patent information filed by NDA applicants at the time FDA approves the NDA. A drug product does not necessarily have a patent by the time FDA approves the NDA. The statute expressly recognizes that a patent might issue after NDA approval, and, under such circumstances, instructs the NDA holder to file patent information within 30 days of the patent's issue date. Once FDA receives this information, the agency is obliged to publish it (see section 505(c)(2) of the act). Patent information might also change after NDA approval. For example, the patent term restoration provisions at 35 U.S.C. 156 give patent holders the opportunity to extend patent terms. The extended patent term may be as long as 5 years. However, patent owners cannot apply for patent term extension until FDA approves the product for marketing (see 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1)). Thus, patent term restoration (also known as ``patent term extension'') always occurs after NDA approval, and patent owners who obtain such extensions usually notify FDA of the new patent expiration date. The new expiration date will be important to ANDA applicants because section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii) of the act requires ANDA applicants to submit patent certifications. Consequently, FDA does not accept the comment's suggestion. 22. One comment would amend proposed §314.53 to establish a mechanism ``for review of submitted patent information to determine, at least on a very general basis, applicability to the particular NDA in question.'' FDA declines to adopt the comment. As stated elsewhere in this final rule, FDA does not have the expertise to review patent information. The agency believes that its scarce resources would be better utilized in reviewing applications rather than reviewing patent claims. 23. FDA, on its own initiative, has amended §314.53(b) by replacing the phrase, ``such patents consist of drug (ingredient) patents'' with ``such patents consist of drug substance (ingredient) patents.'' The final rule also replaces the phrase ``For patents that claim a drug or drug product'' with ``For patents that claim a drug substance or drug product.'' These changes are intended to clarify the type of patents involved. 24. One comment would amend proposed §314.53(b) by requiring an applicant to declare that it holds each patent or is the exclusive licensee of the patent owner or is authorized to submit patent information on behalf of the patent owner. The comment would also prohibit an applicant from submitting patent information and would prohibit the agency from listing any patent information if the applicant did not make any of these declarations. The agency declines to amend the provision. Under §314.53(c), the applicant must provide the name of the patent owner or, if the patent owner or applicant does not reside or have a place of business within the United States, the name of an agent or representative who resides or maintains a place of business within the United States and is authorized to receive notice of patent certification. Requiring an applicant to declare that it is the patent owner or exclusive licensee or is authorized to submit patent information would go beyond the statutory language at section 505(b)(1) of the act and would not serve any statutory purpose. FDA also declines to amend the rule to prohibit the applicant from submitting patent information or to prohibit the agency from listing patent information without a declaration of ownership or license. Such an amendment would be contrary to section 505(b)(1) of the act and may result in less published patent information, thereby causing applicants to question the accuracy and validity of any patent information listed by FDA. 25. FDA received two comments that objected to proposed §314.53(b) and (c) regarding the submission of patent information by NDA applicants. Both comments claimed that the 1984 amendments only require NDA applicants to provide patent numbers and patent expiration dates. FDA disagrees with the comments. Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires an applicant to file ``the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the application * * * and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug.'' The requirement in §314.53(b) and (c) that applicants provide information on the type of patent and the name of the patent owner or authorized representative is consistent with the purpose of section 505(b)(1) of the act.
