China has issued six types of such bonds since 1981. The amount expanded from 19.8 billion yuan-worth in 1981 to 100 billion yuan-worth this year. Until 1988 state bonds were not allowed to be put onto the market, a local bank official said. "Although the interest rate on the bonds was higher than on the bank's savings deposits, people still regarded their purchase as making a contribution to the state and not making an investment for themselves," he explained. A survey shows that the transactional volume of the Shanghai market for state bonds amounted to 11.321 billion yuan-worth in five trading days from May 30 to June 3, while that of stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange during this period reached only 2.54 billion yuan-worth. According to the official, state bond futures are more attractive to investors. At present, China is working out a package of regulations to ensure the healthy development of these markets.
