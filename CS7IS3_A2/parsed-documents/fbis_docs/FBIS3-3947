As one of the five largest livestock producing regions in China, Tibet has 22.8 million head of cattle including yaks and sheep. Last year its meat output reached 100 million kilograms and dairy products weighed in at 180 million kilograms. There are about 82 million hectares of grassland in Tibet with about 52 million hectares of grassland available for cattle. The autonomous region constructed marketplaces in cities, counties and towns for farmers' and herdsmen's livestock business. In Amdo County in northern Tibet, the local government set up a live cattle market and the annual transaction value reached 9 million yuan last year. Tibet is also emphasizing the development of the livestock product processing industry. Now the region has eight factories engaged in processing wool cushion materials. Last year exports of the materials reached 10,000 square meters. Baingoin County last year invested 780,000 yuan in Golmud City in Qinghai Province to set up a wool factory. A 2.3-square-kilometer livestock product processing zone has been planned in northern Tibet and is expected to be constructed soon. Commodity-oriented livestock production has helped farmers and herdsmen in Tibet to raise income levels. Last year the income per capita of farmers and herdsmen reached 515 yuan, an increase of 5.1 percent over the previous year.
