One of the most prominent features of this role has been Russia's cosponsorship, together with the United States, of the peace process from the Madrid Conference to this date. Much has been said about the dimensions of the Soviet role, and subsequently those of the Russian role. Questions have been raised over the last decades about the credibility of this role through the harsh experience to which Palestinian-Russian (and previously Palestinian-Soviet) relations in particular, and Arab relations with Moscow in general, had been subjected. Comparisons were made between those relations on one hand, and Israeli-U.S. relations on the other. The realities of the new international order, which have marginalized to a great extent the effectiveness of the Russian role in the world, forced Moscow to reduce its foreign preoccupations in the interest of difficult domestic and economic problems. Thus, Russia trimmed its responsibilities and commitments inherited from the Soviet era and often appeared as another Western power that attaches greater importance to its own private interests. Despite this, observers are noticing signs of Russia sliding from the narrow confines of the new role. Hence, the attempts to circumvent this role in Bosnia-Herzegovina and expand its basis in the Middle East. In particular, those attempts were apparent during the Security Council discussions on the issue of international protection for Palestinians following the Hebron massacre, and also through Russian initiatives and proposals in this sphere, which aroused the annoyance of Israel and the West. Will the slow Russian moves in the Middle East continue in such a way as to deviate from the Western lines drawn for Soviet policy? Such a development requires intense Palestinian and Arab efforts, which do not seem to exist right now. Consequently, Russian moves will remain subject to mere Russian realities on one hand, and the West's political monopolization on the other. This does not herald that a significant change will occur in Russian diplomacy, at least not in the foreseeable future.
