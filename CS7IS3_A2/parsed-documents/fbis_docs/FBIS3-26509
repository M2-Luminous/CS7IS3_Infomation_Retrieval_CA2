That the topic on exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology was not on the agenda of the discussions cannot but be considered a blemish on an otherwise very successful meeting. The "Wang-Gu" talks in April 1993 were clearly defined by both sides as "nongovernmental, economic, routine, and functional." Among the four, the significance of the "economic" character cannot be overlooked. "Nongovernmental" and "functional" refer only to the objective characters of ARATS and SEF; the word "routine" defines the nature of the talks, which are aimed at solving existing problems arising from cross-strait contact and exchanges. Only the "economic" character manifests, in a forward-looking manner, increased cross-strait economic exchange, greater economic cooperation, and mutually beneficial cooperation that will contribute to prosperity and welfare on both sides of the strait. That the ARATS's proposal for inclusion of discussions on economic affairs was adopted at the "Wang-Gu talks" and was written into the "General Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks" has broadened the immediate significance of the talks and made the agreement more popular across the strait; moreover, it meets the needs of cross-strait economic exchange and will serve as a guide for cross-strait economic exchange and trade. The success of the "Wang-Gu talks" has injected new energy into nongovernmental economic exchanges and trade across the strait. While the tide of Taiwan businessmen's investment in the Mainland has been growing unabated, a new trend of large businesses and financial groups vying with one another for business opportunities on the mainland has emerged. Immediately after the "Wang-Gu talks" concluded, a delegation of officials from 15 private-sector banks in Taiwan made a fact-finding tour of the Mainland. It has been learned that 38 percent of the 270 publicly listed companies in Taiwan have been authorized by their boards of directors to invest in the Mainland. Because of objections from the Taiwan authorities, most of these listed companies have not been able to implement their investment plans. Nonetheless, cross-strait trade and economic exchange grew rapidly in 1993. Statistics from the Taiwan side indicate that Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong in 1993 were $18.45 billion, up 19.7 percent over the previous year; imports stood at $1.72 billion. Taiwan ran a trade surplus of $16.72 billion. According to an analysis by Taiwan's "Ministry of Economics," if trade with Hong Kong was excluded, Taiwan would have run a trade deficit $8.85 billion. Cross-strait entrepot trade accounts for the bulk of Taiwan's trade with Hong Kong; it is therefore clear that the Mainland has become a principal market for Taiwan's economic development. A pattern of mutual reciprocity is emerging in cross-strait economic exchanges and trade. In terms of indirect trade, the Taiwan side is enjoying a huge surplus, which has to a considerable extent helped sustain Taiwan's economic prosperity; the Mainland side, on the other hand, has run a huge trade deficit. Out of political considerations, some officials in Taiwan have purposely made a political issue out of Taiwan's growing "dependence" on the Mainland. It should be pointed out, however, that the surplus-deficit situation in cross-strait trade was not created artificially. The deficits are, on one hand, due to the shift of production to Taiwan-funded enterprises on the Mainland; on the other hand, because of the Taiwan authorities' policy that places restrictions on the amount and grades of semifinished products exported from the Mainland to Taiwan, cross-strait economic exchanges and trade remain at rather low levels. Many people in the business circles of both sides have pointed out: If the ban on the import of Mainland high-tech semifinished products is lifted, it would not only help correct the trade imbalance but also improve Taiwan's competitiveness in the international market. In investment, investment by Taiwan businessmen has increased with each passing day, and protection for the rights and interests of Taiwan investors is being constantly improved. The Taiwan authorities, on the other hand, have set numerous restrictions on in Taiwan businessmen's investment in the Mainland. To this day people from the Mainland's economic and trade circles are barred from visiting Taiwan. Therefore, it is necessary for the ARATS and SEF to reach a consensus through economic discussions and work out measures for implementing higher-level exchange and cooperation under the principle of reciprocity. Topics on economic affairs account for a significant part of the "General Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks." They range from "covers the rights and interests of Taiwan investors in the Mainland and related issues," "the issue of mutual visits by industrialists and businessmen," "stepping up the development of energy and other resources and exchanges in this field," to "mutual visits by scientists, the exchange of scientific publications, discussions on the standardization of technological terms and the standardization of product specifications," and "scientific exchanges in the fields of computers and other industries." At the time of the "Wang-Gu talks," the two sides already had considerable differences over these issues which needed to be worked out through common efforts in later talks. Over the past half-year or so, the ARATS had made a great deal of preparations so that talks on the aforementioned topics could be placed on the agenda of ARATS-SEF working discussions at an early date. It sent several letters to the SEF in hopes of bringing about a fact-finding tour to Taiwan by Mainland economic and trade circles. It put forth -- at the first working discussion on implementing the general agreement of the "Wang-Gu talks" -- a "schedule of discussions" that called for an exchange of views or comprehensive negotiations on all topics -- including economic exchanges -- covered in the general agreement. Moreover, the Mainland has also taken positive steps to advance cross-strait exchanges in the fields of economics, trade, and science and technology. It has also responded positively to Taiwan's concern over legislative protection for the rights and interests of Taiwan investors in the Mainland. Thanks to the ARATS's active work with relevant authorities, a draft of the "Law on Protecting the Investments of Taiwan Compatriots" has been submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation. It is the wish not only of the ARATS but also the business circles on Taiwan that issues related to the economy and science and technology are placed on the agenda of ARATS-SEF working discussions. In early December last year, the first meeting of the second board of directors and supervisor of the SEF adopted a motion by Wang Youzeng [Wang Yu-tseng], a director of the SEF and executive chairman of the Taiwan Business Federation, recommending that the "Mainland Affairs Council" "lift the ban to make it possible for leading Mainland industrialists and businessmen to visit Taiwan." In January this year, SEF Chairman Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] said in answering a reporter's question that cross-strait economic exchanges and trade is extremely important; it cannot continue to be clouded with uncertainties. Authorities must formulate specific policies for Taiwan's business circles to follow. Exchange of high-level visits between economic and trade circles across the strait is also very important. This year should see, at the least, the start of such exchanges. Taiwan's KUNG SHANG SHIH PAO [COMMERCIAL TIMES] also published an article the other day urging authorities to lift restrictions on visits to Taiwan by Mainland industrialists and businessmen at an early date. The reality of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade over the last decade or so shows that both sides will benefit economically by complementing each other's strengths. Moreover, the earlier such cooperation starts, the greater the benefits for both sides. The Taiwan authorities realized early on that "only by having the Mainland as its hinterland will Taiwan be able to solve its current and future economic difficulties." Due, however, to political considerations and man-made factors, development of cross-strait economic exchanges and trade has been placed under considerable restrictions. The "Wang-Gu talks" have removed a psychological barrier enabling both sides to eschew divergent views on politics [bi kai zheng zhi shang di qi jian 6699 7030 2398 3112 0006 4104 2978 6015] and develop economic cooperation through negotiations on routine affairs. It is therefore rather urgent for the two sides to study ways to comprehensively implement the agreement and place -- as early as possible -- economic issues on the agenda of the follow-up talks. Increasing mutual understanding through talks will help facilitate formulation of specific measures and plans for advancing cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation and effectively pushing forward cross-strait economic, scientific, and technological exchanges, thereby ushering in a situation in which both sides will emerge as winners.
