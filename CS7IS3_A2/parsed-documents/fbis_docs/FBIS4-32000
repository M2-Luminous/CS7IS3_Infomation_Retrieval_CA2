Kolodko met with businessmen, bankers, and scholars during the Poznan international fair to discuss the future of the Polish economy. "The programme is credible for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), that is for the people who can count money much better than us. The programme is also credible for the ministers responsible for the economy and finance in countries of the European Union," Kolodko added. Deputy President of the Polish Business Council Jan Kulczyk stressed that its members were satisfied with the way the government solved the question of taxes in the programme. He called on the minister to ensure the same conditions for Polish capital as there are for foreign investors in Poland. Foreign companies should play a complementary role in Poland's economic development and new companies should be protected by the government. Polish businessmen also talked about the possibilities of cooperation with companies in the east, including China. It was emphasised that without the support of the government policy it would be difficult to regain the previous position on the markets of the former Soviet Union. The finance minister said the government had already adopted some regulations aimed to boost economic cooperation and not only export expansion to the east. The government assumes that exports and imports with the east will increase faster in the years 1994-1997. Kolodko also spoke about the government's efforts to solve the problem of mutual debt. Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Leslaw Podkanski, who also participated in the meeting, told Polish businessmen that his ministry keeps a data bank on eastern markets. He also said that his ministry is planning to set up eight trade centres east of Poland.
