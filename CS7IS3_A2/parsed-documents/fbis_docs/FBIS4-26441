Located on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, Qinghai has harsh natural conditions and is often hit by natural disasters. According to Ma Yuanbiao, vice-governor of the province, by the year 2000 Qinghai's animal husbandry production will occupy 30 percent of total agricultural production, the per capita income of farmers and herdsmen will be over 500 yuan, and some 50 percent of the total social production value in rural areas will be made by township enterprises. In the past eight years, the poverty-stricken areas in Qinghai have constructed over 2,300 kilometers of highways and improved farmland soil and grassland. The per capita income has increased by 81 percent in the rural areas. The provincial government has helped the poor areas to set up nearly 1,000 processing factories for farm and animal husbandry products, mining and metallurgical plants and trained more than 1 million people. In 1993, the total industrial output value in poor areas was 1.25 billion yuan (about 180 million U.S. dollars), 2.6 times the figure eight years ago. As a result of these efforts, nearly 70,000 people in the province have escaped poverty every year. But there are still 1.19 million people under the poverty line, one-third of the population in rural areas. According to a new help-the-poor plan of the province, there will be an average of 170,000 people escaping poverty each year, and 14 percent increase of per capita income, through 2000. The provincial government has issued policies to encourage enterprises in developed areas to invest in poor areas. Each year, the province issues 3 million yuan in aid-the-poor loans.
