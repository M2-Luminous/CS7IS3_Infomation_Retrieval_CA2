FBIS4-13793 "drnes079dd_94006" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Fatah, Hamas Reach Cease-Fire Agreement in Gaza Fatah, Hamas Reach Cease-Fire Agreement in Gaza Further on Abu-Zayidah's Remarks JN2504121394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Arabic 1016 GMT 25 Apr 94 JN2504121394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Arabic BFN [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, a prominent Fatah official in the Gaza Strip, by Hasan Abu-Zayid; place and date not given--recorded] [Text] [Abu-Zayid] What are the results of the latest Fatah- Hamas meetings? [Abu-Zayidah] First of all, there is confusion between the public seminars being held in several places and the organizational meetings held on other levels. In any case, these contacts are aimed at unifying all Palestinian ranks. The aim is to prevent the shedding of Palestinian blood, particularly at this transitional phase between the signing and implementation of the agreement. There is no doubt that it is in the interest of the Palestinian people and the interest of the agreement and the peace process to have an agreement between Hamas, in particular, and the forthcoming Palestinian authority, particularly Fatah, which is a basic part of this authority. However, Israel thinks this rapprochement is taking place at the expense of the peace process. This is completely wrong. [Abu-Zayid] What about this agreement? How can this agreement be interpreted? [Abu-Zayidah] If you mean the agreement signed between the Fatah hawks and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam [battalions], then I can say that this agreement is about internal affairs pertaining to the Gaza Strip. These affairs have nothing to do with the peace process, but with events on the ground. Please note that the agreement concerns strike days, the lands supervised by the government, internecine fighting, and the killing of agents. It is in the national interest of all to control these matters. The agreement does not cover support for or rejection of the peace process. [Abu-Zayid] Will Hamas members participate in the Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho? [Abu-Zayidah] As supporters of the peace process and as a forthcoming Palestinian authority, we open all doors and windows to Hamas and the Palestinian opposition in order to participate in building the Palestinian future. However, there seems to be no agreement or firm decision within Hamas itself. There are personal opinions on the extent of Palestinian opposition or Hamas participation in this authority. For example, they do not object to participating in municipal councils or taking part in municipal elections. However, some refuse to take part in the administrative or legislative council elections of the autonomy. In all cases, it is in the interest of the Palestinians as well as Hamas to be part of this Palestinian authority. Otherwise, let it be a democratic, objective opposition. This is the aim of the dialogues and meetings. [Abu-Zayid] Yesterday, you met for the first time with the Islamic University students, who are considered part of the opposition. What is the significance of this meeting? [Abu-Zayidah] In my opinion, the meeting was extremely important. It sent a message to the Israelis and the whole world that the Palestinian people enjoy a great awareness and sense of responsibility, that they can shoulder their own responsibility by themselves, and that there will be no bloodbath as soon as the Israeli Army leaves the Strip, as some try to depict it. There will be great love, appreciation, and respect among the sons of the one people even if they have different views. This is the important message of this meeting. [Abu-Zayid] Mr. Sufyan Abu-Zayidah from the Fatah leadership in Gaza, thank you very much. [Abu-Zayidah] Thank you.
