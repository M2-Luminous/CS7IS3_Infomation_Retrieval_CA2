"I understand [Russian Foreign Minister] Andrey Kozyrev's concern and at the same time am still surprised at the inconsistency of some of Russia's representatives and the minister himself," Anatoliy Zlenko, head of Ukraine's foreign policy department, told me in Paris. Minister Zlenko reminded me that Ukraine has ratified the START I Treaty. That is an important first step toward Ukraine's acquiring the status of a nuclear-free state, but it is not the last step. Since Ukraine and Russia are two friendly states it is not in Moscow's interests to exacerbate the situation. Zlenko stressed that the disquiet voiced in Kozyrev's statement over the fact that Ukraine is a nuclear state does not accord with the facts: "Ukraine is not a nuclear power. It is the owner of nuclear weapons with a limited opportunity of putting them to their designated use." The minister stressed that Ukraine primarily views the nuclear weapons as a "great material asset" and, on this premise, is willing to conduct talks and decide their future. The tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn from Ukraine to Russia last May are valued, according to Anatoliy Zlenko, at several billion dollars. We are being forced to surrender an asset that our people created without receiving compensation. The head of the Ukrainian foreign policy department indicated that two questions have to be decided. The first is associated with guaranteeing national security: "Otherwise our people will not understand us since we will be left alone to face the danger that exists around Ukraine. Especially since we are constantly facing territorial claims from both the east and the south." The second concerns the provision of financial and technical aid for Kiev -- and this is in the interests of the international community. The Ukrainian budget does not have the money to destroy the nuclear weapons. But there is a comprehensive government program for the destruction of these weapons. And this program costs over $2.5 billion including the social requirements. Kiev also has bones to pick with Moscow. Thus, assessing Russia's new military doctrine, Anatoliy Zlenko noted that some of its provisions, primarily the possibility of Russia being the first to use nuclear weapons, worry the international community, including Ukraine. Against whom does Moscow intend to use these weapons? Who is its number one enemy?
