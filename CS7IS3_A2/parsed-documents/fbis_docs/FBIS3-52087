The president said this in exclusive statements to ULTIMA HORA. The chief of state said that at first he did not agree with the privatization of the National Cement Industry (INC), but now he approves of the privatization of all public companies. "The problem is that we are living with a budget we did not prepare. We did not have a manual to help us through the transmission like, for example, Bolivia. When we speak of privatizing the public companies we are not speaking of five companies. We will privatize everything except the Lopez Palace," the president said. He added that the privatizations must not be carried out haphazardly, but that a special philosophy must be adopted for each case. "For example, in the case of the INC -- which is just one company -- some say that a small part of it should be privatized, some say only its administration should be privatized," he stated. The president favors privatizing the INC but not its quarries, maintaining government control on that part of the activity. Wasmosy said his government wants a social market economy and equal opportunities for all. He mentioned the possibility of sending to Congress a general privatization bill to include both the public companies with deficits and all the public institutions without exception, specifying the privatization philosophy to be adopted in each case.
