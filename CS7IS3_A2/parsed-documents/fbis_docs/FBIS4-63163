Opposition parties again demanded to disavow the agreement on cease-fire and the disengagement of troops, which was signed in Moscow on 14 May following the results of the Georgian-Abkhazian talks. The document envisages the withdrawal of the Georgian and Abkhazian units from the line of confrontation passing along the Inguri River, the deployment in the "buffer zone" of peacekeepers. The opposition believes that the materialization of the document will lead to the loss of Abkhazia. Deputy Irakly Tsereteli demanded that question be raised on confidence to the head of state Eduard Shevardnadze. If this is not done before 26 May, Day of Independence, he said, people will do this, instead of parliament. The argument caused by the signing by Georgia of an agreement on the settlement, nearly broke the session of parliament on Tuesday. Commenting in an interview with INTERFAX on the demands to hold early parliamentary elections, leader of the Republican Party, Ivlian Khandrava said that he did not see any legitimate mechanism for holding them. The only way, he said, is the consent of two-thirds of the current parliament which is impossible to obtain. All the rest steps, including referendums and decisions by the head of state would not be legitimate, he said.
