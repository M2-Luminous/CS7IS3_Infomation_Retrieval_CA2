FBIS4-23185 "drafr104_c_94036" FBIS-AFR-94-104 Daily Report 31 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 31 May South African Press Review for 31 May MB3105112594 MB3105112594 BFN [Editorial Report] CITIZEN Amnesty Issue Viewed -- "The question of amnesty has never been satisfactorily dealt with," begins the Johannesburg CITIZEN in English on 30 May in a page-6 editorial. Responding to recent talk of extending the cut-off date, the editorial writes that "since we never accepted amnesty for `political' crimes, we are not enamoured with the idea of any new cut-off date. It means there will be no end to the political violence if people or organisations think they can get away with the killing or maiming of innocent people for `political' reasons." Justice Minister Omar "says the government is considering a commission which will facilitate disclosure and acknowledgement within a framework that provides amnesty, justice and dignity. We hope that what Mr Omar has in mind is not the `truth commission' advocated by Mr Justice Richard Goldstone." "We would rather not have a truth commission but an end to the Goldstone Commission's probes, an end to trials that can only result in amnesty, and a final, firm cut-off date that will not be adjusted." ILANGA Action Against ANC's SDUs Urged -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 23-25 May in a page-8 editorial says that "the killing of 12 people in Thokoza Township in the past week is an abomination like all such incidents in the past. This killing happens at a time when many people in the country had hoped that the violence would abate following the first democratic election in the country." "The emerging truth shows that the Thokoza killings are the result of infighting among members of an ANC brigade known as the self-defense unit [SDU]. Reports say members of this unit have turned into thugs fighting for supremacy." "The ANC must disband this unit as it is now obvious that its members are mere thugs. If it supplied them with arms, these must now be taken from them promptly. They are nothing but criminals." "To those that were pointing fingers at other political groups over the killing of the 12 people, what have they got to say now that the truth is out? Let them comment!" Furor Over Land Issue Viewed -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 26-28 May in a page-4 editorial notes that "the matter of land given to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini should not be manipulated to create bad relations within the leadership of the new South Africa. It should not be used to create unnecessary noise. Those that do not love peace should not be allowed to use this matter to create division, more especially now that the violence that has gripped this country shows signs of abating." "It is encouraging to hear that President Nelson Mandela and Home Affairs Minister Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi discussed the matter amicably." "It must also be remembered that the land given to His Majesty has always belonged to the Zulu nation. The British usurped the land from the Zulus when they were conquered. Actually, there is nothing amiss in the land being given back to the rightful owners." "Therefore there is no need for any furor."
