After hours of shelling our positions this morning, the Serbian aggressor early this afternoon made yet another attempt to break through the defense lines with strong armored and mechanized forces. With heavy artillery support, the tank and infantry attack was carried out in two directions, toward Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca and Boderiste-Vranovaca. The fighters of the 108th Infantry Brigade and the 108th Motorized Brigade responded well to this attack. About a dozen chetniks were killed in infantry fighting and the fighters of the 108th Brigade fired a precise shot and destroyed a chetnik tank with the entire crew. The fighters of the legendary 108th Motorized Brigade have asked us to say that this was their way of expressing their support for the defenders and citizens of Gorazde. They say: We cannot rout the chetniks around Gorazde but, for Gorazde, we will rout the chetniks here. [passage omitted]
