The project is in commemoration of the 50th anniversary in 1996 of the reign of His Majesty the King. The premier made the call at a meeting at Government House to unveil the project attended by some 500 provincial governors, representatives of provincial chambers of commerce, businessmen and ministerial officials. Mr. Chuan said Their Majesties the King and Queen have been devotees of forest conservation and reafforestation. In 1996 His Majesty the King will have been on the throne for 50 years, the longest reign in the kingdom and currently in the world. The Government will seize this great opportunity. All Thais will celebrate the event through the reafforestation project in honour of His Majesty the King, he said. Apart from the five million rai of denuded forest land, trees will be planted at roadsides, temples, schools, government offices and residential communities. The project, the biggest of its kind launched by the Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry in 30 years of reafforestation work, has begun in certain areas and will be accelerated so that it is completed in time for the big celebrations in 1996. The Government has informed Their Majesties the King and Queen about the project. Their Majesties have expressed their royal wish that the reafforestation be carried out in uninhabited areas with mixed species of tree seedlings, especially indigenous species. The work should be done from the top of the denuded mountains to the plains and, in the case of serious erosion, vetiver grass should be introduced to help hold the topsoil and keep humidity. Their Majesties also said that fog catchers made from cheap local materials should be provided at the planted pits to catch fog or dew drops to feed the seedlings. The fog catchers would also protect the seedlings from the sun and provide water for the seedlings at the same time. The authorities concerned should follow Their Majesties' suggestions in carrying out the project, Mr. Chuan said. The Cabinet approved the project last Tuesday and regards it as a major task for all ministers. The project calls for the reafforestation of five million rai over 1,345 degraded forests across the country beginning on Coronation Day this year, 5 May, and ending on 5 May 1996. After reafforestation, the project areas will be conserved and closed to commercial exploitation, and villagers will not be allowed to encroach on the land. Those who joined the reafforestation will not be able to claim ownership of the forest. Deputy Agriculture Minister Suthep Thuaksuban, the minister responsible for the project, said deteriorating conservation forests in national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and watershed areas will come under the project. The Government's target is to reafforest 1.35 million rai of denuded forest land this year, 1.65 million rai next year and another two million rai in 1996. Mr. Suthep said the Forestry Department has prepared 500 million seedlings so far for the reafforestation this year. He said His Majesty the King pioneered the program with the reafforestation of the Chai Phatthana and Mae Fa Luang foundations, 500,000 rai of land, for the Thai people. Several private sector companies have joined the program by expressing their intention to grow trees on two million rai of land nationwide. Oil trading businesses have promised to grow trees on about one million rai. Reafforesting one rai will cost about 3,000 baht. The entire project will require about 20 billion baht. A new foundation will be set up specifically to handle the project on behalf of all interested parties.
