About 1,200 people gathered in silence in front of the building to protest against ethnic cleansing, while some also called for military intervention in the conflict. The crosses and tombstones were due to be removed during the night, despite protestors' hopes that they would be left in place for a few days as a reminder that all the green spaces in Sarajevo have been turned into cemeteries. The organisers from a Strasbourg-based group say they intend to mount similar protests "until peace returns to Bosnia".
