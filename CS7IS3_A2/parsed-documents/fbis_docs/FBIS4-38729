"In principle," he told a press conference here, "we favour foreign investments in the Russian economy, including the banking sphere. However, the national banking system is yet in the making. It is not strong enough to face tough competition from major foreign banks on the domestic market. Hence, there is no point in trying to `butt the oak'. We need time to gather strength." Yegorov noted that Russian banks ran up against great difficulties whenever they tried to open their offices, let alone subsidiaries, in Western countries. "Restrictions on the admission of foreign banks to the Russian market," he said, "will not last for centuries, but only for concrete time periods, necessary to give the Russian commercial banks a breather so that they could gather strength and build up a Russian national banking system." Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Chairman of the Russian Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko said that some restrictions on the work of foreign banks in Russia might be lifted in the foreseeable future.
