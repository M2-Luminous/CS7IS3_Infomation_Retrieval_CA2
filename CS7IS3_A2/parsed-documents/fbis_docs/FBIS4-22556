The country itself extracts 15-17 billion cubic meters. But it needs four times that. And the pressure in the gas lines from the near abroad is falling. Prices for blue fuel are already higher than world prices and continue to rise. But that is only half the problem. It will become really bad when the Orenburg, Turkmen, and even the Siberian deposits dry up. And not for Ukraine alone. Such a prospect is not so far off. International experts predict that with the present level of consumption, there may be only 10-12 years of natural gas reserves left at best. And what then? In our country, in such cases we begin feverishly looking for ways to solve the problem which has supposedly come about unexpectedly. This time, it is true, nontraditional sources of hydrocarbon raw materials and means of extracting them were recalled in good time. Beginning in 1988, three international scientific symposiums were held in St. Petersburg and Donetsk and were devoted to the topical problem which already disturbs not only scientists but most people who are a long ways from science. The most promising substitute for traditional natural gas is coal gas. The very same methane which from time immemorial has been the enemy and killer of miners when there are sudden blow-outs and explosions. But it could become their best friend and put unprofitable and dangerous mines on their feet. "Reserves of methane in coal mines are such that Ukraine could completely satisfy its gas needs for about 12 years," said the chief of the laboratory of mining geology and comprehensive development of the interior under the Ukrglavgeologiya [Ukrainian Geology Administration] Association at Donetsk Technical University, Anatoliy Brizhanev. "And as a backup, there is enough of it to last a very long time." So the Donbass is not only a coal deposit but the largest coal gas deposit. The most promising regions are the Donetsk-Makeyevka, Chistyakovo-Snezhnoye, Krasnodon, and Almaznaya-Maryevka regions. The mines with the most methane and the most densely populated territories and hundreds of large industrial enterprises which need enormous amounts of gas are located here. But it is extracted from mine degasification systems in very small quantities for heating administrative and residential areas. We are not even close to industrial or commercial extraction. But a start has been made, although it is a modest one. At the Torez Mine Administration, the building of one of the mines, two residential buildings, and a greenhouse have been heated with their own gas for many years. And not from the degasification systems, but from mine layers worked through vertical shafts. The Donetsk Mine imeni Zasyadko has experience in fueling motor vehicles with coal gas. Experiments on preliminary degasification of layers from the surface have been conducted for more than 25 years at other Donetsk and Makeyevka mines under the "patronage" of the Moscow Mining Institute. Alas, even now in the face of a gas crisis, the extraction of methane remains on the same symbolic level in our country. But "they," the United States, Canada, and other Western countries, have taken advantage of our Soviet ideas and in record short time developed industrial extraction of gas from coal beds. In the United States, for example, 40 universities and firms began working in 1987 to carry out a generously subsidized state program. They most likely assumed a "capitalist obligation," and in 1991 fortunate California had already obtained 5 billion cubic meters of gas from the San Juan coal deposit alone. In light of that, the extraction of coal from beds that have first been degassed from the surface increases by one and one-half-fold and the prime cost of extraction is reduced by 30 percent. The brainstorm related to the underground deposits continues. There are already 84 universities and firms working on the coal gas program. By the year 2000, it will reach 60 billion cubic meters of gas. Enough for the whole of Ukraine. I have in front of me an advertising prospectus. It presents the process of extracting methane in plain, intelligible language. "In principle everything is very simple," Anatoliy Mikhaylovich continues, "a shaft well is drilled and water is pumped into it with compressed air under a pressure of hundreds of atmospheres. The bed is hydraulically fractured. Cracks form. The cracks must be kept open for the methane to drain along them. But gas does not pass through water. And if the water is pumped out, the mine pressure will close the cracks. Water, then, must be replaced with a material which will `eep' the bed fractured and at the same time let through all the gas." That is the point where many years of domestic research stopped. Water is replaced by a solidifying foam. It must solidify at an exact time and place and in addition increase the release of the methane. That is the crux of the entire technology. There are no chemicals for this foam. Nor is there any high technological sophistication. The slightest mistake and the crack may "close off." But we must get started! In the far abroad this was done long before a shortage of natural gas appeared in order to meet it with all weapons ready. In Ukraine the shortage appeared soon after independence was proclaimed. And even in other republics it was more or less clearly hinted. Even in gas-producing republics. And deliveries of gas from the countries of the Near East are unlikely to save the situation. Back in 1991, specialists of a number of firms of the United States and Canada suggested creating joint ventures to extract gas in the Donbass on a commercial basis, under the condition that payment for expenditures was in metal and coal. But at that time there was no legislative basis for allocating parcels of land for drilling wells, and none has appeared yet. Nor has the appropriate infrastructure been built on the surface. So the initiative of the Western firms vanished in an instant. And isn't it absurd that we are crying about the lack of what we ourselves have in abundance? Instead of rescuing Ukraine from the trouble, Donbass methane continues to kill and cripple people. And Kuzbass and Karaganda methane too, any methane which hides menacingly in the depths of the earth and is ready at any time to explode with indomitable force. Is it at great depth? Are special equipment and enormous capital investments needed? That means efforts in Moscow, and in the Donbass, and in Kazakhstan, and in the Urals must be combined; the half-forgotten "Talmuds" of research on the problem of extracting coal gas must be gotten out and the work pulled ahead. It will not be an amorphous but a concrete scientific-technical alliance. For the sake of that, everyone should focus themselves and put in great effort and capital and the military-industrial complex enterprises with their mighty human, scientific, and technical potential should be involved. People say that some things are already being produced in Azerbaijan, and in Russia and Ukraine. In short, we cannot do without a serious interstate program. But we would have more than enough capital to realize the program in Ukraine, for example, but it continues to be squandered and stolen and escape abroad.
