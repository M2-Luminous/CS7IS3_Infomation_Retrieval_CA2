At a delayed news conference following his one-hour meeting with the GCC foreign ministers held in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia today, Christopher, who arrived there to start his Middle East shuttle to push forward the stalled peace process, described the meeting as excellent. He said the talks dealt with relations between the U.S. and the GCC -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman -- and the Middle East process. They also discussed the Gulf security situation in the light of Iraq's intransigence, the GCC relations with Iran and the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added. Christopher reiterated the necessity for the GCC countries to stand firm in alliance against Iraq, the Kuwait news agency KUNA reported. He also expressed hope that the GCC states would help in lifting the Arab boycott against Israel, explaining that the boycott would now harm the Palestinian side as well, KUNA quoted informed sources as saying. The GCC ministers reiterated their countries' commitment to the Arab League resolutions on imposing trade embargo against Israel. During the meeting, the ministers did not discuss the reported normalization of relations with Israel or offering more financial aid to back up the self-rule agreement signed between Israel and the Palestinians. Christopher left Riyadh this evening to continue his Middle East shuttle, which will also take him to Egypt, Israel and Syria.
