The Senior Officials Committee met in Tallinn on Jan. 20-21. A final decision on establishing the new commissioner's institution with the Council of the Baltic Sea States must be made by the council's foreign ministers at conference to be held in Tallinn in May, said Mare Kukk, the head of the Estonian coordination bureau of the council. Kukk said the new office was designed as an expert institution to consult the council's member countries, coordinate the activities of human rights organizations and inform the international community about the human rights and minority rights situation in region. The commissioner will not engage in resolving conflicts, Kukk added. The draft of the commissioner's mandate was approved by the senior officials in September. The budget of the new office, established at about 270,000 German marks, is much smaller than that of the CSCE High Commissioner for Human Rights and Ethnic Minorities. Expenses will be covered proportionally by all members of the council according to the size of the country.
