Pyrozhkov, director of the National Institute of Strategic Studies: "The Crimea and Ukraine: Problems of Mutual Relations"] [Text] Developments in and around the Crimean Republic are becoming a more and more important factor in all-Ukrainian political life and an object of careful attention at the interregional and international levels. Before our very eyes, the situation in the Crimea (so far only in terms of politics) is gaining more and more symptoms of a strategic problem, the resolution of which may turn out to be a tough challenge, not only for Ukraine and its neighbors, but also for the world community. One can often hear complaints against the fatal mistake, which was, in the opinion of certain politicians and analysts, the restoration of Crimean autonomy. It is deemed as a concealed betrayal of Ukrainian statehood, as well as a result of a nomenklatura plot. It would be, however, hardly correct to boil down the restoration of Crimean autonomy to highhandedness and shortsightedness of certain politicians. It must be kept in mind that at that time, in early-1991, Ukraine's leadership was facing two problems. First, an all-Crimean referendum was held in January 1991, which precisely defined the Crimeans' positive attitude toward the very idea of autonomy. This had to be taken into account, at least on the eve of the March all-Soviet referendum and all-Ukrainian poll. The Ukrainian Supreme Council, headed by Leonid Kravchuk, was trying to ensure the broadest possible social basis to preserve its political influence on the situation all over Ukraine, preventing a loss of control over the situation to Moscow politicians. Second, Ukrainian politicians understood that if they were not able to reach a quick compromise, first of all with the Crimea, Soviet structures would interfere in the developments, and then, Ukraine's territorial integrity, which had been recently confirmed by the Declaration of State Sovereignty, would undoubtedly be threatened. The adoption of the Constitution by the Crimean Supreme Council in May 1992 and the appointment of the all-Crimean referendum became the apotheosis of confrontation. The decisive resistance of the Ukrainian leadership on the one hand, and the pressure of the pro-Russian Republican Movement of Crimea on the other, called forth a great probability of social conflict. It was the weighed position of the Crimean Supreme Council Presidium and its Chairman Mykola Bahrov which made it possible to put the resolution of the problem on a negotiating process, which resulted in a moratorium on the referendum and the adoption of the Ukrainian law "On Division of Powers Between the State Authorities of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic." The Crimean Constitution, altered in accordance with this legislation, was adopted on 25 August 1992. At that very time, a certain political intrigue was devised around the question of whether legislation on the division of powers was in force or not. On the one hand, the Ukrainian Supreme Council did not return to the question of adherence of the Crimean Constitution to the Ukrainian one. On the other hand, the Ukrainian president stated twice in the Supreme Council that legislation on the division of powers was in force. The Ukrainian Constitutional Court, which would have had to deal with this issue, had not yet been established at that time. Thus, the development of state authorities in the Crimea was proceeding along these lines. Even though it was the very August Constitution that envisioned the office of Crimean president, the question of whether its provisions conform to the Ukrainian fundamental law was only readdressed 15 months later, when the presidential campaign in the Crimea was already in full swing. This confirmed, in my opinion, that the state leadership was trying to maintain the freedom of political and judicial maneuvers in the event of unconstitutional, extremist actions of the Crimean ruling structures. On the other hand, Kiev saw Mykola Bahrov as a moderate politician willing to accept reasonable compromises and able to keep the situation in the Crimea under control. Mykola Bahrov consistently pursued the line toward expanding Crimea's economic powers, unconditionally regarding it as an integral part of Ukraine. He understood that proceeding on the path of economic reforms: - Would provide for the Crimeans a real confirmation of the advantage of Crimea's autonomous status; - Would politically isolate extremist forces in the Crimea of any geopolitical orientation; - Would ease pressure on the Ukrainian president and Crimea on the part of Ukraine's national-radical forces, which display very suspicious attitudes toward developments in the Crimea. The June 1993 Ukrainian president's decree and the August 1993 protocol on introducing the so-called open economy regime on the territory of the Crimean Republic were aimed at this very goal. Based on these documents, worked out was a whole range of fundamental socioeconomic documents which significantly expanded Crimean powers within Ukraine. Unfortunately, however, they did not become an impulse to action, due to their contradictions with legislation already in force. The Ukrainian Supreme Council's consideration of the documents concerning the "Europe-center" free economic zone showed that the idea of decentralizing economic responsibility would not be supported by a majority of deputies, who had already joined the election marathon, in which it would be the most dangerous thing to be accused of having an inefficient dose of old-fashioned patriotism. In this way, Mykola Bahrov ended up in front of his voters with the collapsing Crimean economy, unimplemented programs for economic reforms, and in the crossfire of Crimean and Ukrainian "patriots," who have finally achieved their goals: The former have obtained a president sharing their political views; the latter will continue to consider themselves defenders of the nation, since in the Crimea, power was apparently assumed by an opponent of Ukrainian statehood and dangerous challenger to Ukraine's integrity. It is doubtful that the situation will be changed by the 24 February 1994 Ukrainian Supreme Council resolution which, a year and a half after the adoption of the Crimean Constitution, dared to consider a whole range of its provision contradictory to the Ukrainian Constitution. The same can also be said about an appeal by Supreme Council deputies to the Ukrainian president demanding the implementation of the Ukrainian law "On Ukrainian President's Representation in the Crimean Republic," which was only voiced several weeks after the adoption of a fundamental resolution on liquidating the office of presidential representatives for the issue of holding the following elections for local authorities and self-governments. What is next? Apparently, Kiev has been left without any interlocutor in the political dialogue with the Crimea since Mykola Bahrov left the political scene. Is this true however? The Crimea is currently represented by Yuriy Meshkov. It is interesting that his first visit in this office was to Kiev. There was nothing new, however, in his proposals: As a matter of fact, they included an appeal to continue the dialogue on economic issues, primarily, on implementing the important agreements which had previously been reached with Mykola Bahrov. Actually, what can be seen in the actions of the newly elected president is succession. Although his campaign rhetoric and slogans still stand due to their inertia, the common wisdom saying that it is easier to win power than preserve it becomes more and more evident. In our hard times, it is possible to preserve power by only taking positive steps toward stabilization of the economy. One could assume, of course, that Yuriy Meshkov regards such developments as a coerced, temporary compromise on the path to real independence for the Crimea. There is no doubt, however, that there is an objective need to take into account the economic situation, the improvement of which obviously depends on Crimea's economic integration with Ukraine. Undoubtedly, the social basis supporting Yuriy Meshkov's most radical steps will diminish, as changes for the better appear in the Crimean economy, since the majority of those who voted for Yuriy Meshkov did so basically because they expected changes for the better in the socioeconomic sphere. The invitation of Yevhen Saburov to assume the office of Crimean deputy prime minister confirms that the Crimean president is reasonable enough in making the most responsible decisions. The well-known Russian economist-marketeer, who was born in Yalta, is probably the optimal candidate for this high office. He has the image of a man who deals exclusively with issues of economic transformations, reducing personal political ambitions to requirements essential for ensuring conditions for reforms. It would be very appropriate if Yevhen Saburov managed to carry out his plans in the Crimea, because the peninsula's positive experience could be used in other regions of Ukraine. It should be noted that Yevhen Saburov, as early as on the first day of his appointment by the Crimean Supreme Council, announced that political stability is needed to accomplish his mission. He also emphasized that, in his opinion, Ukraine's borders must remain unviolated. By the way, the new Crimean deputy prime minister asked the then Ukrainian president to grant him Ukrainian citizenship. A poll conducted in the Crimea in March 1994 showed that Yevhen Saburov's nomination to the office of deputy prime minister was fully supported by 77 percent of those surveyed, partially -- by 9.4 percent, and not supported -- only by 3.9 percent, which means that the new deputy prime minister's ratings are very high. Gradually, a situation is evolving in which Yevhen Saburov may become a compromising figure in the dialogue between representatives of both old and new political elites of the Crimea, as well as between Simferopol and Kiev. This provides for all participants in the political process substantial chances of reaching accord, as well as of saving political face in the eyes of their supporters. As everybody knows, on 10 March 1994, Yuriy Meshkov issued the well-known decree on holding a poll. The following detail is very interesting. Few people paid attention to the fact that the main demand included in his political program -- the annulment of the moratorium on a referendum regarding the fate of the Crimean Republic -- was replaced with merely a poll in the form resembling a referendum. Also interesting is that when the issue of annulling the moratorium was put on the Crimean Supreme Council agenda, it got stuck in the procedural maze and was not even discussed, at the quiet consent of Yuriy Meshkov. For his part, the Ukrainian president reacted quite operatively to the Crimean president's decree, annulling two out of three questions that were to be included on the poll, and which would require rather a consultative referendum, which the Crimean president does not have the right to approve. However, there were no objections to the poll (in a limited version), meaning that the Crimeans can absolutely legitimately put in force Yuriy Meshkov's decrees which have not yet been regulated by the legislation of the Crimean Republic. This is what Yevhen Saburov's team needs most, in terms of organization, to quickly implement reforms. The U.S. Department of State has emphasized in this regard that Ukraine has demonstrated restraint since the new Crimean president was elected in January, and that the new Crimean leadership also wants to ease the confrontation, and that it has hinted that it does not demand that Crimea's status be changed. In the background remains the question of why were similar activities by the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast Councils, which scheduled their own polls, not met by an adequate reaction on the part of the Ukrainian leadership. This once again shows that the Crimean problem is becoming a part of a broader problem, such as mutual relations between the center and the regions, or the administrative-territorial system of our country. It is quite possible that if local elections are held in June 1994 and heads of oblast councils are elected by the people, Ukraine will obtain 25 "regional presidents" who will wage a fierce battle to expand their own powers. Taking this into account, it is currently expedient to concentrate on resolving the most fundamental issues concerning the state system, as well as on preserving the initiative with the central authorities. The situation in the Crimea requires weighed actions on the part of both Simferopol and Kiev. It is important to understand that Russia is currently not able to incorporate the Crimea, either in terms of politics or economics. Unquestionably, political pressure from Russia is possible. One must take into account, however, the fact that this would be hampered by the tripartite declaration of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on nuclear weapons and security guarantees for Ukraine, the Helsinki Act, the negative attitude of many neighboring countries toward Crimea's secession, and finally Russia's unstable domestic situation. The point is not to aggravate relations between Kiev and Simferopol, just on the contrary, it is to arrange them in a civilized manner. It is therefore expedient to hold negotiations with the new Crimean Government, as represented by Yevhen Saburov, to improve mutual relations between Ukraine and the Crimea. Working out concepts and programs for an open economy regime may become a foundation for this. The options provided by legislation "On Division of Powers Between the State Authorities of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic" should be used more efficiently. This requires a new normative-legal mechanism for regulating the status of the Crimea, which would eliminate contradictions and consequences of actions of any state authorities. Such a mechanism could be defined by a normative document between the state authorities of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic on dividing subjects of authority and delegating powers while resolving social, economic, and property issues. Naturally, foreign policy of the Crimea must not contradict Ukraine's Constitution or international commitments. In particular, this actually means that the Crimean Republic cannot be considered a subject to international law. It is unquestionable that Ukraine must act as a guarantor of the rights of all nations and ethnic groups living in the Crimea, and it must not allow itself to assume a dominating position toward any of them, developing direct ties with all civil organizations of deported nations, including the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar population. Delaying the resolution of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol problem is becoming more and more dangerous. The Massandra agreements (despite the ambiguous stance of all parities' toward them) opened a possibility to resolve the problem by means of negotiations, and they provide a chance to resolve a whole range of military, property, and financial issues. Kiev's loss of initiative is leading to an interference of other entities in this process, and this particularly relates to the Sevastopol City Council and officers of the Black Sea Fleet, which apparently only destabilizes the situation surrounding the fleet and the city. Ukrainian state authorities must primarily take into account the fact that, from an economic point of view, Sevastopol cannot exist as only a part of the Crimean Republic. The city's future is connected with preserving its status of a city subordinated to the center, which allows to resolve economic, financial, and social problems much more efficiently. It would therefore be expedient to adopt legislation on the status of Sevastopol city (there are currently two draft laws worked out respectively by a group of Kiev specialists and the city administration). The nomination of the Ukrainian president's representative to the Crimean Republic was an important step. Currently on the agenda, in my opinion, should be the drafting of an agreement between the Sevastopol City Council and Administration on the one hand, and the Crimean Supreme Council and Government on the other, which is provided by Article 7 (Paragraph 3, Part 2) of the Crimean Constitution. This would allow to conclude the establishment of the judicial triangle: Kiev -- Simferopol -- Sevastopol, and its strength would guarantee, to a considerable degree, an optimal resolution of any possible problems. Ukraine and the Crimea have yet to encounter serious challenges in the economic, political, and social spheres. The latest developments on the peninsula have shown that there is no other way to untangle taut knots than through dialogue and negotiations. Only common sense, political responsibility for the lives of millions of people, understanding of current realities, and good will in suppressing personal passions and needless ambitions are a trustworthy beacon for all who are involved in problems of the Crimea and sovereign Ukraine as a whole.
