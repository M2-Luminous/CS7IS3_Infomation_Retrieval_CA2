Nugmanov: "From the City Soviet Session: Budget Deficit and Emergency Budget"] [Text] Budget deficit and emergency budget--these were undoubtedly the words most frequently heard on the first day of the 18th session of the Kazan City Soviet which opened yesterday. Indeed, the city's economy had a deficit overall of 6.3 billion rubles [R] at the end of 1993, and predictions for the current year show this could grow to R181 billion! City authorities have therefore been forced to adopt emergency financial measures. True, inroads have somehow managed to be made in mending the deficiencies of last year's budget, primarily through diligence on the part of the tax inspectorate and efforts by the city administration and a number of enterprises. But now, how do we "leap over the financial abyss" of the current year? V. Titov, director of the city's Finance Administration, cited a number of emergency measures in his presentation during the session aimed at extricating the city from its crisis: replenishment of the working capital of city enterprises, the introduction of promissory notes in clearing-account transactions, and even state regulation of prices and wages, etc. In her supplementary report, T. Antropova, chairman of the Planning and Budget Commission of the city soviet, also attempted to locate nontraditional sources of revenue, not overlooking the prospect of conducting lotteries and auctions, or even of collecting revenue from the Kazan Racetrack. Deputies taking part in the debates also proposed their solutions for fortifying the "financial health" of the city. Thus, G. Naumov called for the establishment of a municipal bank with all its appropriate infrastructure, following the example of a number of Russian cities. D. Galyautdinov focused attention on "hot" facilities that "fell out" of the 1994 budget. In particular, in his view there is no way Kazan can do without a new trolleybus depot and a number of new automated telephone exchanges. Adoption of an emergency budget will assist in resolving a number of burning issues. Following the allocation of R6.4 billion to meet the city's electric transport needs, the acquisition and replacement of 48 streetcars and 55 trolleybuses and the modernization of water and sewage networks become entirely real prospects. G. Kobelev, chairman of the Budget and Planning Commission of the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet, then took the floor. Along with the stunning information that the total nonpayments amount throughout the republic had reached the astronomical figure of R1 trillion, he provided favorable information concerning the expected gradual lowering of the interest rate on bank credits by the end of the year to 190-100 percent, the planned adoption of a number of new Tatarstan Republic laws, and an anticrisis program.
