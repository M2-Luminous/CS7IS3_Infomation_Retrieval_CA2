A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says the ulterior intention of Japan in hosting the "forum" is to divert elsewhere the cautious eyes of the international community against its nuclear armament and moves toward a military power and to give itself a boost, increase its say and exercise its influence in the security issue by dint of its economic potentials and take the leading position in the Asia-Pacific region. The news analyst goes on: Japan has grown into a dangerous aggression force in the Asia-Pacific region. Peace and security not only in northeast Asia but in the Asia-Pacific region is gravely threatened by Japan. It is the height of folly for Japan to play host to a "forum" on security matters, a country which has defined a broad sphere of the Asia-Pacific region as its operational theatre with an aggressive design on the countries in this region. It is a customary practice of the Japanese ruling quarters to satisfy their own interests by taking issue with others. Japanese trigger-happy elements may call for "joint countermeasures" against somebody's "nuclear threat" when the "forum" is opened. By so doing the Japanese reactionaries are intending to cover up their nuclear armament and moves toward a military power and step up their preparations for overseas aggression in real earnest behind the facade of "security". The Japanese ruling quarters' talk about a "forum" on security in the Asia-Pacific region and the like is nothing but a petty trick to prettify their aggressive and dominationist nature.
