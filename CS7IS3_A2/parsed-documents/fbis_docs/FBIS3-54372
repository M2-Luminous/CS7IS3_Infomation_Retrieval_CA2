It added that the Tunis [PLO] leadership thinks the world supports it at a time when the Palestinian Oslo group began to split up. Hamas said the U.S. Administration is trying to activate the Syrian track to make up for the stalled Palestinian track. Official Hamas Spokesman Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah urged Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi to join the Palestinian opposition because it is the origin. He accused Faysal al-Husayni of representing a phenomenon opposed to that of his father. He urged him to stop following this path and return to the road followed by 'Abd-al-Qadir al-Husayni, the martyr of Palestine. Ghawshah told SAWT AL-SHA'B that no force can prevent Hamas from performing its duty and struggling against the Israeli occupation. [passage omitted]
