They were freed overnight Wednesday after the Syrian military command in the al-Biqa' Valley threatened to arrest Hizballah militants in retaliation, the officials said. The men were seized in the Ba'labakk region after three of them were seen taking photographs outside the home of Hizballah's former secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. Two of the men were identified as Lebanese expatriates who had returned to their home villages after long stays in the Gulf state of Qatar and the United States.

Hizballah has been on alert since June 2 when Israeli warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees on a base near Ba'labakk. [passage omitted]
