Here is an excerpt from that statement. [Begin Horbatov recording, in Russian] In accordance with the Ukrainian president's edict, I am assuming the duties of the Ukrainian president's permanent representative in the Republic of Crimea. Here, at the beginning, I want to point out that the main, primary goals of this endeavor are political. These goals include peace and political stability in the Crimea; control over the observance of Ukrainian law and the Constitution on Crimean territory, as envisioned by the Law on the Division of Powers Between State Bodies of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea; control over the observance of Ukraine's commitments to the Republic of Crimea; and representation of the Crimea on the international level. I want to say that I am deeply convinced that there are a sufficient number of educated, experienced, and knowledgeable specialists in the Crimea to carry out concrete economic work. I am positive that we will not have any problems in terms of economics. Our primary task and main goal is to make the combined potential of the Crimea and Ukraine work for the benefit of our people, to eliminate from our lives the still existing ambiguous issues of contention and confrontation, as well as problems of nationalism. Our lives are too complicated to be aggravated further by artificial factors. Let us all unite our efforts for one goal, that is the well-being of our people. Let every person remember that he lives only once. We should live our lives in such a way as not to feel ashamed in the face of those who will come to replace us. I [words indistinct] that we will have no friction with the Crimean government. I am sure that our cooperation will be harmonious and agreeable, because we have a common goal of making the lives of the Crimean people better. [Words indistinct] to attain peace and accord.
