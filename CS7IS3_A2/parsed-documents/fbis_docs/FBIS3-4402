China Labour News reported over the weekend that they will face trial. Seven other technicians and officials concerned have also been dismissed from their official posts. The explosion killed dozens of coal miners and caused damages of 4.5 million yuan ($517,000). The main factors in the mishap-which caused the northeastern provinces biggest death toll from mining since 1949--were poor management and violations of the Safety Law in Mines and other rules on safety in mines. Labour officials blamed the frequent accidents in this industry on the mishandling or shielding of those at fault.
