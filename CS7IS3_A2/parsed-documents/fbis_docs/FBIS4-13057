The delegation includes Qattam al-Jumhur, a member of the assembly's Missing Persons Committee [Lajnat al-Murtahanin]; Du'ayj al-'Anzi, chairman of the National Committee for POW's; and Muhammad al-Haddad, a member of the National Committee for POW's. Following the meeting, al-Nassar said he discussed with 'Abd-al-Majid the latest developments on the POW's in Iraq, praising the Arab League stance on this issue. Al-Nassar reacted to Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi's announcement in Sanaa yesterday that Iraq has revoked its decision to annex Kuwait and make it the 19th governorate. The Kuwaiti official affirmed that his country has received no official Iraqi offer to revoke the decision on annexing Kuwait or to invite a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to visit Baghdad to discuss the POW problem. He said Kuwait refuses to engage in a "political game" with Iraq away from the UN and Arab League resolutions. He added that Kuwait cannot give an opinion about the Iraqi initiative until it is authenticated, particularly since Iraq has made it a habit of raising "untrue issues," as he put it. Touching on the Kuwaiti POW's in Iraq, al-Nassar said that the case is now in the hands of the international community and that worldwide efforts are under way to release them. He remarked, however, that Iraq is not cooperating. Du'ayj al-'Anzi, for his part, noted that Iraq denied holding any Iranian prisoners and then released thousands of Iranian POW's. He affirmed that Kuwait has presented documents to the Arab League, the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Nonaligned Movement confirming that a large number of Kuwaiti POW's are being held in Iraq. He hoped the League's efforts will succeed in solving this ongoing problem.
