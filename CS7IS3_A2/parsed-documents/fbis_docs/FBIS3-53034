Dhar] [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 1 -- China has reportedly given Pakistan a firm assurance about continuity of arms supplies in future, even though Premier Benazir Bhutto failed to persuade its leadership to finalise a Sino-Pak military pact aimed primarily against India. As a follow-up of the credit agreement signed between the two countries recently to finance arms purchases, Chinese and Pakistani defence officials will conduct negotiations on the items Islamabad is looking for and the delivery schedules, from Beijing. The two countries have a longstanding defence relationship, including in the nuclear field, and China has emerged as Pakistan's major arms supplier. After having launched a low intensity war against India through sponsorship of terrorism, Pakistan has been trying its utmost to involve China in a formal security relationship which could deter India from attacking Pakistan, even if the level of interference in its internal affairs became extremely grave and unbearable. The subject was broached by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also with Chinese Premier Li Peng several times during his Beijing visits, as also Mr. Peng's Islamabad journey in 1989. But China, which has accorded top priority to establishing good neighbourly relations with the countries bordering on it, has refused to get involved in any security arrangement. When Ms. Benazir Bhutto raised the issue with Mr. Peng in Beijing early this week, she was reportedly told that, at a time when the international situation was marked by turbulence, Asia-Pacific was the only region achieving rapid economic growth and perceptible political stability. China's moves to establish closer political, economic and cultural ties with these countries and, principally its neighbours, had helped promote regional stability and development. At the same time, with the world witnessing turmoil in several spots -- Europe, Middle East, Africa -- and the growing trend towards defusion of tensions, any military pacts were becoming irrelevant. Even NATO had lost its focus. The Chinese leadership, according to diplomatic sources, laid stress on resolving the present, as well as, future crises among countries through peaceful negotiations without involving third parties, which would only complicate matters further. Under an agreement on military cooperation signed during the Premiership of Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, Pakistan had assumed that the same would operate as a defence pact and China would automatically intervene on Pakistan's side whenever it chose to commit hostilities against India. But the Chinese have put no such interpretation on, nor acknowledged any defence obligations, under the agreement as per which considerable quantities of military equipment were supplied to Pakistan on "friendship prices". Ms. Benazir Bhutto did not succeed in persuading the Chinese to commit themselves to a military pact where Mr. Nawaz Sharif had failed many times. Though China accords top priority to its relations with Pakistan, it is in no mood to do anything which would create apprehensions amongst its neighbours about its "expansionist" or peace-keeping role in the Asian region. Ms. Bhutto was also assured that China's friendship with Pakistan would not be affected by normalisation of relations with India with which it had signed an agreement recently on maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border. The Chinese treat the relations with Islamabad as abiding, developed as these were in the military field first and, later, extended to the economic and technological (including nuclear) spheres. China's unwillingness to play the U.S. game of trying to destabilise the situation in the Asian sub-continent by backing one of the parties to the Kashmir dispute has been clearly expressed. The Chinese leaders were also lukewarm in responding to Ms. Bhutto's allegations of repression and violation of human rights in Kashmir because Beijing is accused precisely of the same in Tibet and also parts of China. The Chinese leadership has thus adopted a correct attitude keeping in view Indian sensibilities, though the credits for arms supplies it has offered to Islamabad is causing some anxiety in New Delhi because Pakistan has already acquired huge quantities of weapons and has an on-going programme of cooperation in defence industries with Beijing. Sino-Pakistani missile cooperation started as far back as 1987-88 initially focusing on the sale of Chinese built M-9 ballistic missiles. Chinese assistance in developing Pakistan's 400 km range HATF-2 surface-to-surface missile was confirmed in 1989, although information on the extent of assistance was not fully available. The Chinese transfer of about 40 M-11 missiles capable of carrying 1100 kg warhead up to a distance of 300 miles has now been confirmed, though it is said that it has a shorter range of 290 km with 800 kg payload. The M-11 is a fully mobile, single-stage solid propellant missile, and can be loaded and readied for firing in about 45 minutes. According to unconfirmed reports, China has on-hand contracts to sell missile and other related technology to the tune of nearly one billion U.S. dollars to Pakistan, Iran, Syria and other countries in West Asia. The U.S. Administration has alleged that China is shipping components, technology and materials that directly contribute to a covert indigenous missile-production programme in Pakistan to justify its decision to impose sanctions on China and Pakistan under MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime]. Ms. Benazir Bhutto's visit to North Korea also assumes significance from the military angle, because Pyongyang had also been a major recipient of Chinese missiles and components as well as technical assistance. North Korea has been assisted by China in designing rocket engines and provided metallurgy and air-frame expertise. North Korea is now trying to develop new Nodong-I ballistic missile with range of 1000 km. Obviously, Pakistan may be trying to import missile components and related technology besides other equipment from North Korea which in turn is getting them from China. China insists that it has been prudent in exporting arms and military technology, and says that export of weapons must help countries improve their defence capabilities. These should not harm regional peace, security and stability and the arms sales must not be used to interfere in the internal affairs of others. However, going by Pakistan's conduct since 1988 when it began sponsoring cross-border terrorism against India, none of the conditions stipulated by China on arms transfer have been observed.
