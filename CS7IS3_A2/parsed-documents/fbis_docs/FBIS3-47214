"That's not possible," Fujii told a regular press conference after the morning cabinet meeting. He was referring to reported comments Monday by a senior government official hinting at an economic package including only an income tax cut in view of the strong opposition by the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] to a consumption tax increase. The SDPJ, the largest party in the coalition government, decided Monday to set up an action group to call for a large income tax cut without increasing the rate of the consumption tax, now standing at 3 percent. Fujii also strongly rejected the government official's remarks that a November report by the Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, proposing an income tax cut and a consumption tax hike in a single program, could be reviewed. The finance minister stressed that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to "respect the tax panel's report" and this is publicly recognized. Concerning the timing of the new pump-primer, Fujii reiterated that the Economic Planning Agency is working to have it ready by around mid-January as instructed by Hosokawa. In press remarks earlier this week, Fujii indicated the government may launch the package on schedule even without including the tax cut, saying "inclusion of a tax cut was unclear" in Hosokawa's instructions. Turning to the budget, Fujii said the Finance Ministry has never mentioned any intention of compiling a 15-month budget for fiscal 1994, as rumored in some quarters. He said the ministry just intends to handle a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the fiscal 1994 budget together.
