Such unacceptable customs should be abandoned. His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i criticized and rejected tyranny against women and girls in some regions of this province and said: Islam hates and detests any man who subjects his wife or daughter to cruelty. The Prophet of God condemns any man who relies on his physical ability to oppress a woman. The ugly and un-Islamic tradition practiced in some regions of the province, where girls are forced to marry against their will, must also end, because God's blessings are conditional and will only come to those who observe Islamic ethics and divine instructions. Referring to the all-embracing propaganda and political efforts of the enemies of Islam and the intensification of the economic sanctions against the country, the leader of the Islamic revolution said: The enemy is trying to make the Iranian people despondent, to turn their backs on Islam. The enemy intends to create division among the people and the officials and intends to weaken the spirit of work and endeavor among the people. Despite all the hostile efforts against Islam's sovereignty, the spirit of faith, enthusiasm, allegiance to the Islamic Republic, hope for the future, and determination to continue the path of the revolution and the imam is observed in every corner of Iran. [passage omitted]. The esteemed leader also described the claim of the United States to be the leader of the world's nations as a futile dream, a false hope. He said: Today it has become clear to the Americans, to their allies, and to their rivals in Europe and Asia -- and even to affiliated weak states -- that neither the United States nor any other power can lead other nations, because the nations will never again submit to oppression and imposed puppet leaders. The events in Palestine, in Africa, and in Europe demonstrate that Westerners -- particularly Americans -- cannot control the world. [passage omitted]
