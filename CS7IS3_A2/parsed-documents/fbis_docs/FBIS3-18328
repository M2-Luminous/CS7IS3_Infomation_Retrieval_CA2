[Martinazzoli] I am well acquainted with my face and I have no problem with it, even though it is not the Hollywood type. I certainly do nothing to make it smoother, because I refuse to show off, and I am irritated by stereotyped smiles and unnaturalness in politics. I will not disguise myself, because I am convinced that at least a little truth is fundamental in politics. [Statera] But to go from that to the funereal.... [Martinazzoli] I know, I am even said to be able to cast the evil eye and to lower audience ratings. But Funari [television presenter] for one does not think so. In any case, my face makes me the real leader of the neo-centrists, by virtue of all my skin blemishes... [Statera] That is a good one... [Martinazzoli] As for my language, the ultimate would be not to speak at all, since television encourages not thinking but watching. But since I do not expect an Oscar nomination, I reject this mystification. Politics needs words, not looks, teeth, and banalities. [Statera] So will the centrists not make much use of television? [Martinazzoli] Look, this is not just an anti-conformist option; it is also a financial necessity. The resources available to the right and the left are infinitely greater than ours. We will spend some 3-4 billion lire, and [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi's right 10-15 times more. [Statera] You mean 40 billion? [Martinazzoli] More, more. An entrepreneur can throw his money around however he pleases. I admit that I do not know the anthropological profile of the Berlusconi man, but I must assume that he is not only a yuppie but must also be a supporter and in some instances also a volunteer, otherwise Berlusconi would go broke: How much must those strange 11,000 clubs cost him? Be that as it may, do not make me say that I want to disinvent television and its political product. It is not true: I am simply well aware of what Popper said, of the danger of the manipulation of consensus, the problem of freedom connected with the domination of the mass media. We need new ethics, for which even the foundations are lacking. [Statera] Do you mean self-regulation for television? [Martinazzoli] Self-regulation makes me laugh. For the first time Giuliano Ferrara is right, when he ridicules it. Moreover, I support Fede, who broadcast Berlusconi's first remarks. True, it took considerable faith [fede] -- pardon the pun -- to sit there and watch that program, but I did so and found it interesting, though I perceived some grim warnings in it. [Statera] Of what? [Martinazzoli] Though, of course, Berlusconi is not the devil incarnate, unfortunately the idea of a charismatic, publicity-based, and plastic democracy is taking hold amid this desert. But politics extends beyond merely the home, health, and certain sacrosanct necessities: It is the complex relationship among all these things, which must not be oversimplified in order not to create false hopes. You cannot make handfuls of promises using arguments that do no hang together. [Statera] You yourself said that the sublimation of television is to remain silent, simply to be seen.... [Martinazzoli] Yes, but I am still convinced that the people are not simply an audience and that life is not entirely confined to television; indeed, life conflicts with its televised image. Face powder is not everything; I hope that arguments still count for something. Some American friends agree with me in this: When they heard that in our constituencies some 35,000 votes are needed in order to be elected, they told me: "In that case you can meet with the voters individually and promise something to each one." We are not relinquishing direct contact with the people and are thus exorcizing invisibility, which is a curse in politics: It is like betting on a lame horse. A moderate visibility, not a vulgar, spectacular one. Kafka said that if Ulysses had not put wax in his ears he would have died not from hearing from Sirens' song but from the silence. [Statera] Do you refuse to answer reporters' questions because you fear banality? [Martinazzoli] At one time we had Gorresio, but now authoritative opinion makers stay in their offices and write about things they know nothing about, and journalists have been taught only to report witticisms. I do not like to talk in witticisms. I hate appearing to be something that I am not: I am a lawyer from Brescia, precisely as your fellow journalist from Cuneo said, dismissively. But what more than witticisms can be produced by a politics that is now conducted with the abacus? [Statera] Who now conducts politics with the abacus? [Martinazzoli] When I visited Berlusconi around Christmas I told him: Look, if you use the arithmetical logic of the abacus, even the traditional mistrust of the Italian Social Movement [MSI] will cease to exist. I tried to explain to him that we have been part of Italian history since 1919: We saw Mussolini grow up and saw many Popular Party members go with him. But Sturzo and others went into exile instead -- an exile which De Gasperi then legitimized. You need to take the long view, I told him. He replied still using the abacus. If it is he who is that the Italians want, then let them have him, but they must know that the exile of politics will not benefit anyone. I am talking not about threats of dictatorship but about the disappearance of the very substance of democracy: The mere fact of appealing to a savior who makes all kind of promises means that democracy is losing its very meaning. We are in danger of becoming what Arbasino calls a Country Without. [Statera] Without what? [Martinazzoli] Without history, without any authoritative voices. People talk about a country reduced to rubble, but that is nonsense recounted by people with bad memories: It is nonsense to say that everything that existed before the Second Republic should be rejected. This displays a shortcoming on the part of Italy's intellectuals: It is not clear whether they are more quick-change artists or conformists. This is a clumsily revolutionary period which some people have exploited. [Statera] Who? [Martinazzoli] What do you mean, who? Berlusconi -- who, if he deserves any credit, it is for having arrived at the right moment, when the whole scene was in disarray, to put forward a change with no sense of direction. [Statera] Upstaging [Pact for Italy leader] Segni? [Martinazzoli] Yes, with a kind of cheap trick. After the trouble over the lists, Segni must at least have realized that referendum movements are not politics and that you really cannot conduct politics without some kind of organization. In modern democracies parties are not redundant, as some maintain: We need to start drawing a distinction between corruptions and the value of parties that have been cured of them. That is, unless we want the leading role to be performed by television stations and mass media conglomerates, instead of politics itself. [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martinazzoli, but do you not have the impression that while you are competing for seats in parliament, other centers of power are defining a new order for Italy? [Martinazzoli] I certainly do have that impression: Several major vested interests think that they can do without the mediation of politics. The eclipse of politics also embodies a contest between economic potentates -- telecommunications, television, the banks, and so forth. We risk becoming subjects rather than agents, or watching the cake being sliced up among various businesses directly by their leading figures, one of whom, moreover, is also personally involved in politics. [Statera] So is this invisible center becoming increasingly marginal? [Martinazzoli] Keep in mind that we have two years of honorable conduct behind us, and I would like that to be acknowledged: We have supported the policies of [Prime Ministers] Amato and Ciampi, and indeed we have helped Ciampi more than anyone else, and I have had enough... [Statera] Of what? Of Ciampi? [Martinazzoli] No, I really have had enough of hearing [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary Achille] Occhetto portraying himself as a Quintino Sella [prefascist finance minister]. He is not. It is we who have supported this government, even though we recognized its political limitations. [Statera] But do you think that this can be considered a merit by the Berlusconi man, by voters poisoned by rather stupid cliches? [Martinazzoli] Many respectable things in this country were the outcome of minorities -- the Risorgimento, the Resistance... [Statera] So you would not mind being in a minority? [Martinazzoli] I do not like being in a minority at all; I have no vocation to be a martyr, but I am sure that politics is not like a restaurant, where the customer is always right. You engage in politics for the sake of you own personal ideas, and I am rather stubborn about mine. [Statera] Very well, but Berlusconi enjoys a virtual monopoly of support, Occhetto has his own tough kernel.... [Martinazzoli] Forget about the opinion polls. Let us talk about serious matters. Maybe one of the three blocs will win. If Berlusconi's wins, on the basis of the abacus, then it will govern. Otherwise, I see a gloomy future for that front. Can you not see that Bossi is muzzled and that his leading role has been undermined? If they win, perhaps they will succeed in staying together, otherwise.... [Statera] What if Occhetto wins? [Martinazzoli] More or less the same applies. Occhetto-Quintino Sella criticizes me from London -- he who is allied with the man who wants to tax government stock. How is it possible, either on the right or on the left, to accept alliances that exist solely for technical reasons? [Statera] Very well, Mr. Martinazzoli, the centrists too might win, but let us consider the most likely hypothesis -- that none of the three alignments wins. [Martinazzoli] I do not believe that if someone is sick he can be operated on every six months, so if that does happen I would try to salvage this legislature. [Statera] How? [Martinazzoli] Since we do not know how the new parliament will behave and we do not know how the seats will be distributed, I have in mind not a second Ciampi government but a constituent government, which will tackle the mass of constitutional problems. [Statera] Do you mean that you are resisting the rule of alternation to the bitter end? [Martinazzoli] Not at all; we want alternation, but not fictitious alternation or, worse, something that is not alternation but the splitting up of the country. [Statera] What exactly would this constituent government have to do? [Martinazzoli] Complete an electoral reform that is anything but complete, establish a forum for the debate on the specter of federalism, provide a guarantee that constitutional amendments will not entail sudden violent wrenches or excesses but will take place possibly by means of a number of referendums -- not only on abrogation but also to indicate preferences. [Statera] A new form of associationism? [Martinazzoli] No, I repeat: Whoever wins will govern. And I also repeat that we will not merge with the left, as many suspect. But if nobody wins, the patient must not be killed. There must be a constituent forum that will take the place of the assembly elected directly by the people, which I myself, Cossiga, and Miglio had in mind. And this forum could be precisely a constituent government. [Statera] What would its purpose be? [Martinazzoli] There are several differences within the Pact: I am not in favor of the direct election of the prime minister, which is what Segni wants. I have in mind, rather, a German-style system with a chancellor. [Statera] What will your own role be? [Martinazzoli] I would like to think that I have helped to prevent a disintegration, and on that basis, to take my leave. [Statera] Thus regaining true invisibility? [Martinazzoli] Look, we may be somewhat invisible, but we do have a core of popular support that those people with all that face powder and make-up can only dream of. [Statera] Are you pledging that there will be no television appearances between now and 27 March? [Martinazzoli] Since nobody is giving us any free half-hours... Be that as it may, you can be sure that you will not be seeing me on "Il Rosso e il Nero," [The Red and the Black] where opium and various other drugs are consumed -- ideological ones, of course.
