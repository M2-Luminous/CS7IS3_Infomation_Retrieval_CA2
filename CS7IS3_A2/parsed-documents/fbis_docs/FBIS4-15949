Viktor Chernomyrdin Has Been Tasked With Promoting Collaboration With the Russian Commodity Producers Federation"] [Text] As has become known, Boris Yeltsin recently considered and approved proposals by the Russian Commodity Producers Federation [CPF] urging prompt measures to salvage domestic industrial and agricultural production. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reported earlier, the message by CPF Chairman Yuriy Skokov to the Russian president presented proposals on organizing a system of interaction between the federation and the government to map out and undertake concrete joint actions. Boris Yeltsin tasked Viktor Chernomyrdin with setting up contacts with the CPF in the interests of overcoming the catastrophic production decline and slowing down the growth in unemployment. Interestingly, the CPF's initiatives are meeting with approval not only in the Kremlin but also abroad. During Yuriy Skokov's visit to Germany in March and to France in April, representatives of government and business circles in those countries accepted the CPF's proposal to conclude agreements with the major employers' associations of these countries. Such agreements should make up the foundation for a system of nongovernmental interaction between Russian and foreign commodity producers which is expected to resolve a whole number of complicated problems of international economic cooperation and collaboration. Practical activity to create a system of basically new interrelations between Russian manufacturers and their own government and foreign partners is a real step toward forming a complex market infrastructure, without which a free enterprise system cannot work effectively. In this context Yuriy Skokov's activity finds understanding not only among large Russian businesses but also, for example, in U.S. financial and banking circles. Thus, a member of the U.S. delegation led by the U.S. commerce secretary who visited Russia at the end of March stated that the period of reform "from above," associated with the name of Yegor Gaydar, has passed. Today reforms will produce an effect only if the painstaking efforts by Skokov and others to create viable elements of a modern market economy, based on Russia's specifics, are a success. Next to Yuriy Skokov's declared intention to contest the 1996 presidential elections, the tactics and strategy of his actions appear peculiar. Unlike other potential presidential candidates, he has practically given up active self-promotion in the mass media, apparently believing that the best advertising is his strongly consolidated position as a leader in domestic financial-industrial capital.
