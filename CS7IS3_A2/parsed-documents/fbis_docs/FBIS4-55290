[Vacaroiu] The revolution in December 1989 marked not only a break with the totalitarian regime; it also launched a process of radical transformations in political relations. It thus established the basis for a democratic state of rights and for an economic reconstruction based on market mechanisms. In November 1992 we began to implement a social economic strategy that will be in force until 1996. In 1993 the government adopted measures to speed up the reforms by deregulating prices, eliminating subsidies on some goods and services, and introducing the goods movement tax. In industry, privatization provoked new steps and stimulated the activities of medium and small enterprises. [O GLOBO] How can bilateral economic relations be developed? [Vacaroiu] Bilateral trade last year totaled $54 million and this does not satisfy us. Our two countries recently signed the Economic Cooperation and Trade Accord, which eliminates the old compensation system and allows economic agents to sign import and export contracts within the context of the free market economy. Romania is interested in balancing its trade with Brazil. We hope to resume exporting Romanian-made railroad cars and tractors. We will continue to export fertilizers and plan to sell cars manufactured in Romania on the Brazilian market. We will import Brazilian iron and manganese ore, soybeans, and other products. Romania has an increasing interest in investing in Brazilian companies; the number of Romanian-Brazilian mixed capital companies has increased to 15, and their capital totals nearly $50,000. [O GLOBO] What has the Romanian Government been doing to improve the people's standard of living? [Vacaroiu] The economic reform has had a high social cost and made an already precarious situation even worse. The end of the economic decline in 1993 and the recovery expected for 1994 will allow the people to improve their standard of living in the second half of this year. The government is adopting social protection measures for all strata of the population, especially the most destitute. Salaries and pensions will be protected from inflation by deindexation and we will reduce the imbalance between them. [O GLOBO] What are the main objectives of the Romanian privatization program? [Vacaroiu] For us, 1994 is the privatization year. By the end of 1993, the State Asset Fund had privatized 270 commercial corporations; 142 were privatized during the first months of 1994, and 100 more still have yet to be privatized. Another 2,000 commercial enterprises may be transferred to the private sector. The people will be able to buy shares of these companies or exchange certificates they already have for shares. [O GLOBO] How are representative democracy and political participation getting along? [Vacaroiu] The Constitution grants all citizens full democratic rights. We have a multiparty system. Romanians are interested in politics -- as a result of our Latin temperament, sometimes too interested. Compared to countries like the former Yugoslavia and the USSR, Romania is an island of stability in East Europe. [O GLOBO] What about bilateral cultural exchanges? [Vacaroiu] We signed a five-year accord for cultural cooperation in 1991, which must be extended. For example, two works of Brazilian literature were translated into Romanian in 1993 (Antonio Olinto's "Copacabana," and Erico Verissimo's "The Time and the Wind"), and an exhibition of Romanian rugs in several regions of Brazil. In 1994, the National Theater of the city of Craiova will tour Brazil. [O GLOBO] What advantages does Romania offer foreign investors? Are Brazilians investing in Romania? [Vacaroiu] Our laws allow the establishment of commercial enterprises with 100-percent foreign capital, ensure there is no discrimination against foreign participation, and offer guarantees against expropriation. All regions and sectors of the country are open to foreigners, except the materiel industry, the manufacture of explosives, and the manufacture of psychotropic substances. The Romanian Government stimulates investments through tax exemption for two to five years. We are, therefore, awaiting Brazilian investors. [O GLOBO] Romania may be needing know-how [preceding word in English] in fields like managerial training, marketing [preceding word in English], quality control, market research, industrial modernization, administrative decentralization, and management of public works. Brazil has universities, organizations, and professionals specialized in these fields. Brazil can thus help the Romanian Government and the Romanian state-owned and private enterprises. Will you seek this sort of assistance? [Vacaroiu] My objective is to visit these sectors and seek this sort of cooperation. The evolution of the bilateral trade relations is marked by integration processes that are currently under way in the South American continent as well as in the European continent. Romania wants to benefit from the valuable experience of other countries, including Brazil.
