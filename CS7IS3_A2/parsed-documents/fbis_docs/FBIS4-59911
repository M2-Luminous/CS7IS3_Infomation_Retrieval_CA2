He affirmed the importance of reaching an agreement between the two sides in this regard. At the news conference he held together with the U.S. secretary after their talks, which lasted 45 minutes, President Husni Mubarak affirmed the importance of continuing the peace process until they reach their conclusion and peace is established in the whole region. He said that we are working very hard together with the Americans to resolve the complicated problems between Syria and Israel with the objective of reaching a final solution. President Husni Mubarak said that Syria and Israel are both working for peace, but the problem between them needs some time to be resolved. On the situation in Yemen, President Mubarak said: I have repeatedly warned against the use of force and pointed out that force cannot resolve the problem. Since the beginning, I have advised that the forces should be separated and that a dialogue should be started. The Yemeni president did not accept this advice and maintained that there can be no dialogue with these people. President Mubarak said that it is very difficult to predict what will happen in Yemen. On his part, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said: I have once again come to this country, which has exerted great efforts, just as President Husni Mubarak has done his best, to help the Palestinians and Israelis sign an agreement. He added that Syria plays an important role in establishing peace in the region and that Egypt is always ready to give all the necessary help on all levels. President Mubarak made a statement at the beginning of the news conference in which he welcomed U.S. Secretary of State Christopher. He said: Christopher told me about the efforts that have been made in the talks between Syria and Israel, "because it is very important that the two parties reach a peace agreement as they realize their dire need for peace." He stressed that the two sides want to continue their negotiations, noting that this is the appropriate time to resolve the problem. He said that the current developments in Gaza and Jericho were discussed, adding: "I am personally following the situation there. The morale of the citizens is very high, and the police and people are happy because they wish to solve the problem. They want to build their homeland after 27 years [of occupation]." It is very important to continue the peace process until the end so that peace may prevail in the entire region. He said: We will work hard toward this goal along with the United States to resolve this very complicated problem and to reach a final agreement between the Syrians and Israelis. Christopher then made a statement in which he thanked President Mubarak. He said: I am happy to return to this land and meet the man who contributed such a great deal toward the signing of the agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis. He said: When I was in Jericho yesterday, I was reminded of President Mubarak and saw that dreams have come true. I also remembered him when I saw that real progress has been made. He said that he remembered President Mubarak because he contributed a great deal toward this goal, stressing that Egypt is worthy of utmost appreciation for the role it played in this respect. Christopher said: Our feeling on the importance of achieving peace in the region has been revived. We hope to build on what has already been achieved in Gaza and Jericho. This is a sign for the people of the region and we hope to build on what has been achieved in Gaza and Jericho. This achievement is a sign for the people in the region as to what peace can achieve. Christopher said he spoke with President Mubarak about the Syrian track, noting that President Mubarak is fully aware of developments on this track. I told President Mubarak that we have started down the road but it is still long, and Egypt wants to help make progress on this track. He said: I am happy to exchange views with President Mubarak who always receives his guests warmly and always plays an effective role in establishing peace in the region. In response to a question on whether he received a message from Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat regarding yesterday's crisis, Christopher replied in the negative. He said: I understand that contact took place between 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo, but I have no details about their discussions. Anyway, let me tell you that it is important for 'Arafat to keep his commitments to the Washington ceremony, putting an end to (?violence) and terrorism in the region. He said: "I believe that it is important for him, in his capacity as an important leader to whom the world looks up, to realize the consequences of his deeds. I hope that this situation will be cleared up and hope to receive a report on this issue because the United States believes that compliance with obligations is fundamental under the circumstances. Answering a question on whether Syria and Israel are close to reaching agreement based on what he has heard from Secretary Christopher, or whether there still is a gap between them, President Mubarak said: I can safely tell you that what I have felt this time around is that the two parties are working for peace. I have already said that it is a complicated problem that needs time, but as long as the talks continue, there are great hopes for peace. On whether he received any messages or envoys from north Yemen, President Mubarak said: I have not received any messages from the Yemeni president about sending an envoy. However, about four or five days ago, I asked him to send a special envoy to Cairo, so he sent his foreign minister. I held extended talks with him. I also stated publicly that the use of force is not a form of unity, but a form of occupation because unity needs the willingness of both sides to achieve it. [passage omitted] With regard to the stand of Egypt, the Arabs, and the United States on the crisis in Yemen, President Mubarak affirmed that it is difficult to predict what will happen in Yemen. He said: All I can say is what I have said many times before, that battles and war are an endless condition in Yemen. We have much experience in the region. War will not resolve the problem, but will cause more hatred, even after the war ends. He added: I advised right from the beginning that the forces should be separate, that the forces of the north should be distanced from the forces of the south, and that dialogue should start. But they did not accept this and now there is no other way but a cease-fire to remove the forces from the battleground so there can be a dialogue. The president of Yemen ha said that there can be no dialogue with these people. I believe that this will not go anywhere in the future. [passage omitted] Answering a question posed to President Mubarak on the message he would like to send to Syria after helping with the achievements between the Palestinians and the Israelis, President Mubarak said: I do not wish to compare the situation of the Syrian track with that of the Palestinian track. However, I can tell you that the Syrians want to resolve the problem and find a comprehensive solution to it. There is no basis for comparison between one case and the other. On whether President Mubarak is ready to play a similar role to the one he played in the Palestinian track, the president said that they are ready to help if the situation requires their help. He pointed out that the U.S. secretary of state held discussions with the Syrian officials and exchanged viewpoints with them, in addition to listening to various ideas. He is trying to help the two sides. The president said: When I meet with President al-Asad, I will raise all these issues with the objective of making some progress in that direction. Christopher answered the same question, saying: We are at a very early stage of this process. The issues presented before the Syrian and the Israeli sides are very difficult, as are their sub-issues. The road ahead is still very long and I do not wish to make any predictions now on whether anything in particular will happen in the near future.
