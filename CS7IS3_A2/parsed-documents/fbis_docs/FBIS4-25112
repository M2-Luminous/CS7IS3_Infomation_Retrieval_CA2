Because of its expectation that China will persuade the DPRK to accept full inspections, the United Nations Security Council recently issued a non-binding presidential statement while avoiding the adoption of a resolution urging North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. Nonetheless, Vice Premier Qian's remarks during the interview suggest that China also finds it difficult to deal with the DPRK issue because what it can do is just call for PRC-DPRK talks. Behind China's soft stance lies its fear that if hard-line measures such as economic sanctions are adopted, this will deal a decisive blow to North Korea, which is currently in a serious economic crisis. Such being the case, social unrest will be produced and this will inevitably affect China. Unlike the United States which is separated from North Korea by the Pacific Ocean, China is the DPRK's neighbor. Thus, it is a matter of course for Beijing to cautiously handle the DPRK issue. Although China is now hastily promoting a shift to a social market economy, problems such as inflation have arisen in the process. Thus, China itself has already had the seeds of social unrest. It appears that Beijing is trying to avoid another disturbing factor, which is political unrest in North Korea. It is also possible that China's influence over the DPRK is not as great as Western nations expect. Vice Premier Qian flatly denied the possibility of mutual visits by top leaders of China and North Korea in the near future, thus giving no indication that China will take action to persuade the DPRK. There is a report saying that North Korea recently provided weapons to the Cambodian Government army. This suggests that North Korea is making its own efforts to avoid being isolated from the international community. For the time being, China will keep watching such efforts by the DPRK to pay respect to its independency. Although Western nations believe that China possesses a diplomatic "weapon" toward Pyongyang, which is its influence over North Korea, it might be valuable for China not to use it.
