In mid-March, the office received a letter containing information about Xu Peide [1776 1014 1795], a worker of the Gaohua Engineering Company who was temporarily transferred to the job of port supervisor at another unit. Xu was accused of illegally operating a restaurant named Xiaosha in Gaoqiao for eight months; he opened the restaurant in April 1993 but applied for a business license only in December. Even after he began running the restaurant legally, Xu continued to evade taxes by issuing fake receipts. At the same time he secured a business license he also secured special receipts for traders at the Fengjing Shopping Mall. He then made use of the preferential tax break for the Fengjing Shopping Mall to write receipts for others who intended to evade taxes and charged them a "management fee." Chen [7115], chief of the tax prosecution office's investigation team, went to Gaoqiao with his subordinates, Pan [3382] and Zhang [1728], to investigate the case and found some two dozen fake receipts written by Xu Peide. Later, they also discovered that Shen Wenhu [3088 2429 5706], a nonpermanent resident of Shanghai, had, by using receipts issued by a tax-free unit, evaded 10,000 yuan in taxes payable for a 100,000 yuan project he contracted for at the Baohua Ready-Mixed Concrete Plant. That evening, Shen Wenhu's case was placed on file for investigation and prosecution. Next, the public prosecutors learned that Xu Peide had collected 11 unused receipt booklets in less than one year after he opened the restaurant in April 1993. They took swift and fierce action against Xu. Xu first gave the names of six buyers of his fake receipts that evening, and disclosed two more names while under investigation. In the course of investigating the eight cases, the public prosecutors uncovered two more serious cases each involving over 50,000 yuan in evaded taxes.
