His partners in the new shop wore suits and Rolexes--but Wang's low-profile blue jacket and unassuming black slacks made him the most eye-catching man in the shop. Deputy-manager Wang's other identity is that he is one of the most prominent political dissidents in China, well-known throughout the country and the world. Almost a year after his 12-year prison term in Guangzhou Huaiji prison came to an end last February, Wang joined an old friend's company and opened the jewellery business. Wang, 46, was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment in 1981 for "engaging in counterrevolutionary incitement". He had also been jailed from 1977 to 1979 after taking part in a wall poster campaign in Guangzhou on socialist democracy and the rule of law. With his full head of white hair now dyed black, Wang looks 10 years younger than he did after his release. Looking at the $20 million worth of jewellery on display, Wang looked puzzled. "I am not familiar with this business but I will try hard to learn," he said. Wang said business was a practical way to promote the country's economic development: "The democratic movement doesn't necessarily mean you have to go out in the streets. It is something you have to do practically for the society," he said. Starting a business is sure to be a rocky road for a political dissident in China, and Wang knows that well. After his release from jail, where he was spared the abuse other political prisoners received from fellow inmates, the Chinese government did not allow him to start a business. But an incident in July last year altered that, and the government changed its tune. Wang had to abort an interview with an American trader because police, keen to prevent the contact, "invited" him on a one-day sightseeing jaunt to Zhuhai. "I was so upset about this incident--I told the government that I needed my own business for my living," Wang said. "I told them if they did not give me permission, I would rather go back to prison or have my meals in the police station," he added. Now, every week when Wang goes to the police station to fulfil his parole requirements, police officers never forget to bless him in the hope that he "earns a fortune". Wang secretly started a trading company in June last year, registering the business under a friend's name to conceal it from the government. At that time, Wang only had a few pennies and had to borrow $400,000 through connections. The trading company is now a going concern. "I hope my efforts to earn a better living will be a kind of compensation for my family," Wang said. "My wife and son lived in hardship during my imprisonment and I feel I owe them a lot--a lot," Wang said. At first, Wang's label as a political dissident was a barrier. Early last year, he planned to open a bookstore with some friends but they later refused to co-operate. "I understand some people's fears that my special identity might bring them trouble from the authorities, where good relations are of the highest importance," he said. His aspiration is to open a bookstore selling history and political texts--a way to "educate the grassroots to know more about their country and the world". He said his current business was not a lifelong career but just a foundation to finance future political activities. "I will never give up my life mission to write political articles," Wang said. "But it is not an appropriate time for me to do that because I don't feel free to publicise my political thinking during my parole period. Also, I have to wait for my political rights to be reinstated," Wang said. "If I can only write with reservations, I would rather not do it at all. It would be meaningless." Wang's parole will be complete by April 1995. He will be denied his political rights for four and a half years after that. He is now living under close government surveillance. "I am told not to leave Guangzhou, not to write political articles and not to talk to the media. But I only follow the first rule," he said. Right after his release from jail, Wang planned to visit the United States on his first overseas trip. But he changed his mind after considering the possible effects. "It is so easy for the government to arrest you for making contact with other dissidents there," he said. "Or they might not let you back (to Guangzhou) once you are out, like they did to Han Dongfang." He has also avoided going to other provinces. Wang said that, for the time being, he planned to keep his distance from other political dissidents and human rights groups. "I don't want to have an open conflict with the authorities, which will hinder both my business and my future political activities." Looking back on his 14 years behind bars, Wang proudly says he feels no guilt or regret. "I was not a democratic fighter, I am just an ordinary man who did something good for my country." Wang has been struggling to clear his name as a criminal, and has put forward his appeals to the high court 44 times. Last year, Wang asked Cheng Yiu-tong, Hong Kong representative of the National People's Congress, to take letters to the congress but so far he has not received a single reply. Enduring the ordeal in prison, Wang refused to plead guilty even though he was told it could be a trade-off for his release. "I don't blame other people who pleaded guilty in order to get out of the prison to fight other political battles," he said. "China is still a country not ruled by laws but by people," he said. "Even development of human rights is faster than before-- people's rights are not stated in laws."
