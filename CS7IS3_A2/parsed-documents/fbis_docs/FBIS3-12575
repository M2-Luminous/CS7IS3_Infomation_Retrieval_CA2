Kuwait said that it would be appropriate for the International Committee of the Red Cross to have special responsibility for civilians living under Israeli occupation with a view to ensuring their safety. In his address to the UN Security Council during a debate on the situation in occupied Arab territories last night, Muhammad Abu al-Hasan, Kuwait's permanent representative at the United Nations, stressed the need to disarm Israeli settlers, some of whom had perpetrated the vile massacre in Ibrahim's mosque in Hebron last Friday. The Kuwaiti representative said that the Security Council had to make Israel responsible for protecting Palestinians from the recklessness of those who wanted to hinder the peace process. He said that settlers had to be disarmed and the extremists among them had to be put under constant surveillance. [passage omitted]
