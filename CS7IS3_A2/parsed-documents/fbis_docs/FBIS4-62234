In the opinion of the Defence Ministry, all the articles of the military budget are underfinanced. Particularly alarming is the problem of cash allowances to servicemen. The Russian Finance Ministry monthly issues funds for this purpose which are not enough to pay allowances to one-third of the officers and noncoms. Under the new budget 50 per cent of the personnel will get their cash allowances with intervals, sometimes lasting from two to three months. "The situation is also alarming as regards allocations for armaments, military hardware, property, capital repairs and maintenance, scientific and technological needs," Vorobyov stated. Shortage of money for the minimum requirements of the Army, the latter's insolvency has brought about a situation when some regional authorities have begun to cut off electric power supply to military installations, ensuring Russia's security. For instance, power workers of Archangel region had cut off power supply to a considerable part of the local strategic missile forces testing ground. Notifications are being received regularly by anti-aircraft defence units, including their central command station. "It is clear to everybody, even to a person poorly versed in national security problems, that such a situation is frought with very dangerous consequences," the general stressed.
