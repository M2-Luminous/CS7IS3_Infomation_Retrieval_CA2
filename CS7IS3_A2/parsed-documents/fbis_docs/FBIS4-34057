"Love for the Fatherland maintains our discipline," he said, repeating the words of Navy Minister Admiral Ivan Serpa. Lobo attended the commemoration of the 63d anniversary of the National Air Mail Service at Campo dos Afonsos, in northern Rio de Janeiro, where he attended a mass and air shows. "For a long time now we have been trying to show to the government and to the people the distressing situation we are experiencing," the minister said. Lobo, one of the designers of the bill that provides for an average 35 percent salary increase, hopes that President Itamar Franco will immediately sign the provisional measure on the new law for military salaries. "It is unfeasible to continue to earn a salary with which we cannot live even a modest life," he claimed. "We know the entire country is going through difficulties, but it is important to solve this matter as soon as possible," he added. The minister recalled that all military demands have been made with due respect for the institution's hierarchy and discipline. "We have no union, and we hold no marches," he said. Brigadier Armando Arquimedes, chief of the Social Communications Center of the Aeronautics Ministry, who was accompanying Lobo, denied that the mistakes in the playing of the national anthem last Friday, during a ceremony attended by President Franco and the Navy minister, were meant to protest the low salaries. "We do not protest that way. It was a protocol mistake," Arquimedes said. Concerning the proposal by PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to create a defense ministry gathering the three military ministries, Lobo said that the idea must be carefully studied. "We have worked with a spirit of cooperation for more than 50 years," he said, hinting that it is not necessary to unite the three forces. The minister said that if asked -- as has been promised by some of the candidates for governor in the state -- the Air Force will cooperate in the fight against violence in Rio de Janeiro.
