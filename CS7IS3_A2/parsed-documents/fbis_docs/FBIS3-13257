Did you read the minutes of the meeting between Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad yesterday? [Peres] Yes. [Zissowitz] Did you detect any new messages? [Peres] No, I just detected softer language. It is interesting to note that this was a meeting between the Syrian president and Israeli representatives, although they did not enter the country with their Israeli passports and did not highlight the fact that they are Israelis and members of the Knesset. This, too, is one of the signs of the times. You know, we have long outgrown the era of charades, of hiding, disguising, and pretending. What good is it? That, however, seems to be the way of the world up north. [Zissowitz] In the meeting, President al-Asad reiterated his formula of full peace in exchange for full withdrawal. Is Israel prepared to accept such a formula? [Peres] First of all, I do not know what full peace is. When he talks about full peace, what is it filled with? For example, he did not undertake to fill it with diplomatic representations, commercial ties, and open borders. So what does full mean? [Zissowitz] Did you hear the utterances of MK's Talib al-Sani' and Darawshah during a tour of the Golan Heights and in other meetings? [Peres] I think they are both MK's, and whatever their criticism of Israel is, they should voice it in Jerusalem rather than in al-Qunaytirah. In my opinion, both good manners and logic call for highlighting the positive and the things we have in common. [Zissowitz] Do Israeli MK's who talk on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights about the terrible oppression of the Palestinians and who say that the lot of Israel's Arabs is worse than that of Syria's Jews truly represent Israeli Arabs? [Peres] I do not believe that. I do not recall the Syrian Parliament ever having had a Jewish member. As you know, every Syrian Jew may come to Israel, but can every Israeli Arab go to Syria? We all know that not even all Arabs are allowed in, but only people who belong to a certain party, group, and belief. Even then, they are not issued passports or allowed to publicize their identity. In this respect, if you were to compare the Israeli delegation's visit to Syria with visits to Israel by foreign delegations to meet with Arabs and others, the difference would immediately strike you.
