Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said the mobilisation of hundreds of Serbian refugees to fight on the warfronts in Bosnia was "illegal." She said that often trucks went to the refugee camps at night to take away people by force. She said the UNHCR had also protested to Zagreb about similar actions going on in Croatia with Croat refugees from Bosnia. Foa said the UNHCR was also concerned at a new wave of killing and terror in the Banja Luka region, where Serbs are trying to evict the last Moslems and Croats living in the region and confiscating their property. The bodies of three old men were found with their throats cut on January 22 at Prijedor. Sixteen mosques were destroyed in the region in December and there have been 40 emergency evacuations every week, she said. Expelled refugees were moreover being made to pay for their entry visas into Croatia and were forced to sell their belongings, she added.
