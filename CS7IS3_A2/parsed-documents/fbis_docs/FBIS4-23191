He was speaking after a lunch at Tuynhuys with an SADC delegation, which was also attended by President Nelson Mandela. Mr Manuel said the purpose of the delegation's visit was to deliver a letter from SADC Chairman and Botswanan President Quett Masire inviting South Africa to "seek accession" to the SADC. "It's an invitation that is more than welcome," he said. It would merely formalise a de facto situation and the fairly strong relationship that already existed between most of the members of the government of national unity and the Frontline States. The letter referred to the fact that an SADC summit of heads of state and government would be held in Arusha, Tanzania, on August 29. The formalities of South Africa's admission would be dealt with there. The delegation was led by Botswana's Vice President Mr Festus Mogae and SADC Executive Secretary Dr Kaire Mbuende.
