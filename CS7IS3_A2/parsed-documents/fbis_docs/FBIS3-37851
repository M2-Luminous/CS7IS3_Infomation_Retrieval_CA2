After the Russian initiative averted air strikes on Sarajevo, "statements came from NATO and several high-ranking diplomatic circles which contain barely hidden disappointment that NATO had not used its assault airforce. The idea is being imposed that the NATO ultimatum should be used to 'ensure order' in other places of the conflict. Moreover, attempts are made to shade the Russian role in initiating a diplomatic solution of the conflict. Special bewilderment is caused by attempts to doubt the capability of the Russian peace-keeping force to professionally and impartially fulfill its duty", Vyacheslav Kostikov said in a statement on Wednesday [23 February]. "There is an impression that NATO, despite peace-making rhetorics, is still imprisoned by the ideology of the Cold War. Psychologically one can understand that it is difficult for NATO to adapt to a sharp change in political realities caused by the birth of a democratic Russia. However, the price in human lives, the risk which, as it turned out, the NATO command is ready to take to support its status cannot but cause concern", the spokesman said. The Russian president is sure that Russia should and will participate in solving all major international problems, according to Kostikov who added that Russia will not allow any discrimination regarding itself. "However, the new Russia is not going to participate in any ritual sacrifices", he stressed. "Russia rejects the language of military ultimatums and welcomes the language of diplomacy. A return to the psychology of the Cold War, heightening mistrust, a new wave of spy mania would contradict the ideas of international partnership for peace", Kostikov said. The Russian president is convinced that "the arguments of peace in Europe are weightier than the arguments of war and invites leaders of Europe and the United States to draw a line under the Bosnian conflict at a table of negotiations", he stressed.
