All this time the Russian military headed by P. Grachev have been saying over and over again that a combat-effective Army is being created from the Soviet Armed Forces rear which Russia inherited, and that is why there are so many shortcomings and problems. They say that the Army is being reduced, but to defend the enormous expanse the numerical strength of the Armed Forces should be not one percent of the population as provided by law, but 2.1 million servicemen. The say that a reduction in officers costs enormously more than their pay and that the problem of Armed Forces manpower acquisition is "one of the weakest points of military organizational development" and consequently it is necessary to keep the draft until the year 2000, placing all persons of draft age "under arms." Finally, they say that what "previously was worked out and implemented over many years" has been done in the Army in two years. Is this so? Transferring Instead of Scrapping According to USSR Ministry of Defense data, after disintegration of the USSR there were over two million servicemen on the territory of Russia as of 1 January 1992 out of a Union Army of three million, including 575,000 officers and 280,000 warrant officers, 80 percent of nuclear weapons, over 60,000 pieces of armored equipment, around 60,000 artillery tubes, 6,000 combat aircraft and helicopters, over 500 combatant ships and 70 percent of supplies. On the territory of Russia there also remained 813 of the main enterprises of the military-industrial complex, supplying 80 percent of arms and military equipment to the USSR (the annual output was over 400 aircraft and helicopters, around 500 tanks, over 500 artillery systems, over 20 combatant ships, around 400 missiles and 25 space vehicles). In the following two years Russia gradually increased its military potential by subordinating to itself groups of forces abroad and troops on the territory of a number of former Union republics (Georgia, Armenia, Belorussia, Moldavia, Tajikistan, Kirgizia...). During 1992-1993 270,000 servicemen, 3,100 tanks, 6,000 BMP's and 1,500 aircraft were removed to Russian Federation territory from the far and near abroad. In essence there was a gradual transfer of the Union Army together with the military department from certain hands to others (initially unified USSR Armed Forces, then combined CIS Armed Forces, and finally Russian Federation Armed Forces). That is how it always has been in world practice: with a change in state leadership, the army has been resubordinated by the traditional method--the military leadership was bought (or bribed), concessions were made in the form of partial reforms or the promise of them for the lower Army strata, and the oath was administered to military units, with actions by enemies of the new authority suppressed. That was how it was this time as well. The exceptional experience of the Bolsheviks, who created the Red Army through a scrapping of the old one, was not repeated. Thus, the Russian Armed Forces were formed by changing uniform and name, with resubordination and maximum preservation of the Union Army. Preservation Instead of Reduction In 1850 it wa believed that one million soldiers were sufficient to defend all European countries. A half-century later, in 1900, the numerical strength of standing armies had been brought to three million. Toward the end of the 20th century there are 25 million persons under arms in the world (including around 8 million in Europe, 3 million in the Near East, around 10 million in Asia, 3.5 million in America and 1 million in Africa). In Russia the numerical strength of the standing army also rose: in 1725 there were 210,000 in the regular Army, 28,000 in the Navy, and 100,000 Cossacks; in 1913 there were 1.35 million, including over 1,700 generals and 150,000 officers. After disbanding the Russian Army of 10 million in a few months in 1917, the Bolsheviks subsequently introduced the practice of sharp reductions in the Army, which repeatedly led to social shocks both in the Army as well as in society: - 1922-1923--Army reduced from 5.5 million to 562,000; - 1945-1947--8.5 million demobilized (2.8 million remained); - 1953-1955--1.1 million, including 119,000 officers, discharged because of reduction; - 1956-1958--a reduction of 600,000, including over 100,000 officers. With the beginning of perestroyka in the USSR, the reduction in the Army proceeded basically through a decrease in the authorized strength of servicemen, which greatly exceeded their actual number: - 1989-1990--from 4.2 to 3.7 million, including 100,000 officers and 50,000 warrant officers; - 1991--by 700,000, including 150,000 officers and 90,000 warrant officers, with a shortage of 660,000 persons in the USSR Armed Forces. Thus, in the Soviet period a reduction in the Armed Forces as a rule took place in 1-2 years, and at the proposal of the military department itself, but without a program being developed to settle servicemen being discharged to the reserve. This was explained either as a transition from war to peace, or as a reduction in those who even so already had served the prescribed terms, or simply as a reduction in "dead souls" from the shortage of personnel, or as a "reduction" through removal of troops from the Armed Forces makeup (1989--Railroad Troops, MVD Internal Security Forces, KGB Border Guard Troops; 1991--Civil Defense troops and road construction units; 1994--according to the plan, "peacemaking forces" and the Airborne Troops. In January 1992 B. Yeltsin announced a reduction in the Armed Forces of 700,000 persons from their actual number. In September of that same year the Russian Federation Law "On Defense" established that by 1 January 1995 "the actual number of Russian Federation servicemen in the peacetime Russian Federation Armed Forces cannot exceed one percent of the Russian Federation population," i.e., in 2.5 years there was to be a reduction of another half-million in the size of the Army. The military department committed itself to preparing a program for the Armed Forces reduction. But in February 1993 the Russian Federation Minister of Defense announced, and the Russian Federation President confirmed then as well, an authorized strength of Russian Federation Armed Forces of 3.5 million, including 2,218 generals, 692,000 officers, and 2.8 million privates and NCO's, with an actual numerical strength of 1.8 million servicemen. A half-year later Grachev announced the authorized strength of the Armed Forces already as 2.34 million with an actual strength of around 1.5 million, although, as we know, nowhere did anyone announce a reduction of 1.2 million in the Army during this period. The state program for Armed Forces reduction just had not been prepared, but on the other hand the task of "reducing the Armed Forces to the prescribed level" according to basic provisions of military doctrine had been postponed for a year (until 1996), and the Armed Forces numerical level itself, established by law, was arbitrarily raised by Grachev from 1.5 to 2.1 million. While he had declared repeatedly in 1993 that the Army had to be "small and completely professional" and the numerical strength of the Armed Forces, as specified by the Law "On Defense", would be brought to 1.5 million, in 1994, admitting that the Armed Forces were only at 54 percent strength in privates and NCO's, he nevertheless asserts that we need an Army of two million, but a reduction in the Armed Forces is possible in 1994 by 200,000 and in 1995 by another 200,000. For the umpteenth time he explains his position by the need to defend the homeland and by the threat of social shocks, although the task of reducing an Army of 1.5 million by increasing it by 400,000-600,000 persons does not lend itself to understanding. One might ask why such sly statistics are necessary. They permit the following: - preserve over 150 formations and the entire gigantic superstructure above them (hence the 7 to 50 percent personnel strength of units, by which an attempt is made to patch "Trishka's caftan" of combat readiness [from a Krylov fable, meaning that fixing one thing results in damaging another]; and substantiate the need for 2,500 generals and greater expenditures for Army upkeep; - preserve the existing military system, including universal military obligation, and not hasten with military reform; - announce, if necessary, another "peaceful" initiative in reducing the Armed Forces. That is how it was under M. Gorbachev, and that is how it is under Yeltsin. As a result, with an Armed Forces reduction of 2.7 million announced over the last five years, the overall number of those under arms in Russia's 16 departments remained practically the same--3.5 million. But even if everyone who reaches the age of 18 (in Russia this is around one million persons annually) were to be placed under arms, as Grachev wishes to do, even then one could not reach the level announced by our generals in the interests, of course, of "ensuring Russia's security." What Does History Teach? As follows from the unclassified report which the USSR submitted to the League of Nations in April 1931, the numerical strength of servicemen in the USSR as of 1 January 1931 was 562,000 in the Armed Forces, including 38,000 command personnel; 28,000 in the Border Guard Troops; and 17,000 in OGPU [United State Political Directorate] Internal Security Forces. At that time 1.2 million persons reached draft age annually, of whom 300,000-350,000 were not physically fit. The principle of an "armed people" professed by Napoleon and von Moltke, who even intended to provide the Army as the teacher of their nations by passing all people through the barracks, required teaching military affairs to 900,000 persons annually. But with a two-year term of service it was possible to pass only 270,000 temporary duty personnel through the RKKA [Workers' and Peasants' Red Army] and other troops. It was necessary either to increase the Army to 1.7 million or combine a regular army with a militia system (a regular division passed 1,900 persons through a year and a territorial division 3,500, with expenditures for training one fighting man being R535 in 2 years and R291 in 5 years respectively). With the economic and political isolation of the USSR, which did not possess nuclear weapons, the second path was chosen as being most economical and effective. The situation has changed fundamentally under present conditions, as follows from Russian Federation military doctrine. First of all, "the immediate threat of direct aggression being unleashed against the Russian Federation has dropped considerably" and Russia "does not regard a single state as its enemy," considering "as partners all states whose policy does not harm its interests and does not contradict the UN Charter." Secondly, traditional Armed Forces have a tertiary significance as a deterrence factor in ensuring military security after nonmilitary means and nuclear weapons, first use of which we rightly rejected. Thirdly, the Russian Federation ensures its security through entry into or cooperation with collective security structures. And finally, an overall reduction of armed forces and military expenditures is occurring in the world. The country's economic capacities changed substantially simultaneously with this: - Russia's territory and its population and draft resources are less than in the USSR by one-third and one-half respectively; - gross domestic product [GDP] for 1992-1993 dropped 30 percent along with a growth in domestic debt and the budget deficit; - over 40 million Russians were below the subsistence minimum in 1994. The situation has changed, but we continue to try to fit the practice of military organizational development to the theory of "massive war" and an "armed people." Speaking recently in the State Duma to substantiate increased military expenditures, Chief of Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff Colonel General M. Kolesnikov asserted that "armed conflict will require a mass army four times larger than the present one" and that today we cannot fight for four years in a row as during World War II. Having 30 million persons on military registration, of whom 6 million are the top-priority reserve, we continue to try to place all youth under arms, sending one-third of draftees to "other troops" to perform duty--Border Guard Troops (150,000), Internal Security Forces (around 400,000), and Railroad, Road Construction and other troops (in 15 departments in all), including troops under joint-stock companies (such as Rostelekom, Dalspetsstroy and so on), which altogether contradicts the Russian Federation Constitution. The demand is not to increase the number of privates, but to reduce the number of supervisory personnel with a change in the table of organization structure by reducing the number of highly paid general and officer positions and increasing the proportion of NCO's and civilian personnel. But only 10 of the 115 military educational institutions on the territory of Russia with an annual graduation of 37,000 officers have been reduced in two years. As before, up to 30,000 young officers are graduated each year with a simultaneous increase in monetary allowance for cadets to R130,000 per month. It would appear that neither world experience nor our own history teaches us anything. In Czarist Russia before World War I only 26 cadet schools and 38 warrant officer schools were training commanders for an army of 1.5 million, with an annual graduation of 3,000 officers and 19,000 warrant officers. In the summer of 1941 there were 1.3 million officers in a Red Army of 10 million, while by the end of 1941 Germany had only 148,000 officers at all fronts, of whom only 23,000 were regular. In 1941 both Russia and Germany were relying on NCO's--professional junior commanders. In the world practice of military organizational development today, the norm for states with a highly developed economy is a ratio in which 0.05 percent are generals, 10-15 percent officers, and 35 percent junior commanders, with an overall numerical strength of servicemen not exceeding 0.7-0.8 percent of the country's population and with the proportion of military expenditures at 3-4 percent of GDP. For Russia this would mean having the numerical strength of the Armed Forces at one million, including up to 700 generals, up to 200,000 officers and up to 350,000 junior commanders. `Be, Rather Than Appear To Be' These parting words left for the German General Staff by A. von Schlieffen seemingly acquire special pertinence in our Russian reality. On the one hand, Russian generals record and the Russian Federation President approves among basic provisions of military doctrine such principles of ensuring military security in the Russian Federation as "conformity of Armed Forces organizational development to the country's political goals and economic capacities and to the course of reforms," and "use of domestic and world experience in military organizational development." On the other hand, with growing military expenditures, the practice of military organizational development does not conform to the country's political goals and economic capacities. Dissipation of allocated forces and assets to a large number of formations and units, an absence of interest in service among officers, massive draft dodging among civilian youth, and "commercialization" of service all lead to decay of the Army. As a result there is neither money nor an Army. This is occurring because, using military reform as a cover and speculating on problems of servicemen and workers of the military-industrial complex, state and military bureaucrats demand increased expenditures not for transformations, but for preserving the previous system, partially canceling the dissatisfaction of its representatives through increased pay. This enables keeping the military-bureaucratic apparatus at the previous size and permits its uncontrolled use of sources of incomes in the military department for their personal goals. Only through military reform is it possible to obtain a combat-effective army with a real and inevitable reduction of military expenditures. The goals proclaimed in Russia of building a democratic, rule-of-law state and civilian society demand a decisive rejection of the practice of mass education of society through the Army, general militarization of citizens, and militarization of their labor. A professional army of one million on a volunteer basis must come to replace the "armed people," with introduction of alternative (civilian) service and with retention of service by conscription only in wartime. Today every third state in the world has a fully professional army on a volunteer basis, including the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Japan, India, Pakistan and Australia. How can we shift to a professional army with fewest losses and costs, in the shortest time and with greatest effectiveness? An optimum solution to this problem requires fulfilling the following basic conditions: 1. If we immediately recognize the actual numerical strength of the Armed Forces to be authorized and plan military expenditures, withdrawal of troops, real reduction and military reform on this basis. 2. If we cut the number of units and formations in half and man the rest with the freed-up personnel (1994-1995). 3. If we change the ratio of branches of Armed Forces through a significant reduction in the proportion of ground troops and air defense and shift to Armed Forces organizational development based on missions (1994-1995). 4. If we reduce military schools (by 40-70 percent for branches of the Armed Forces) and military academies (leave one per branch) and bring the annual graduation of officers to 10,000 (1994-199(5)). 5. If we reduce the size of command and control entities (above all at the expense of the intermediate level) with a threefold reduction in the number of generals' positions and with the granting of pensions and of the benefits prescribed by law (1994). 6. If we reduce the number of officer positions, with the discharge (at their wish) of those who have served the prescribed terms, with presentation of an opportunity to fill previous positions in administrative management entities and logistic, medical and financial support entities, positions of technical specialists and positions in military science with civilian personnel, and with the discharge and settling of the remaining portion of officers under a reduction (1994-1998). 7. If we reduce the number of positions filled by warrant officers (by 80-90 percent), with the right granted to fill a number of previous positions by civilian personnel (storekeepers, chiefs of depots, storehouses and messhalls, and so on) and positions of junior commanders, with nonextension of contract with persons who have not been certified (1994-1996). 8. If we revise the time periods, conditions and curriculum for training junior commanders based on a number of military schools being reduced, bringing in servicemen from among cadets and warrant officers, and increasing the prestige of their service (1994-1995). 9. If we carry out the reduction and certification of cadets, warrant officers, officers and generals for further service through competitive professional selection, with mandatory reorganization and professionalization of military cadre entities and with greater rights granted to servicemen's assemblies (1994-1996). 10. If we revise the conditions, time periods for going over to contract service, and content of the contract (not only obligations of the serviceman, but also responsibility of the state is necessary), with priority conclusion of contracts (for 2-5 years) with officers and persons certified for positions of junior commanders and of technical specialists in combat teams and crews (1994-1995). Fulfillment of these ten "if's," which define the concept of transition to a professional Army through a structural reduction in the Armed Forces, will permit having a professional army in Russia already in this century. A professional army is not an end in itself. Transition to a volunteer method of manpower acquisition and to contract service permits resolving problems and tasks which are difficult to resolve under the present system of military organization: - preserve combat effectiveness and increase combat readiness of the Armed Forces with a reduction in their numerical strength; - perform selection and manpower acquisition based on strict competition with increased demands on candidates instead of registration without competition and mass call-up; - relieve officers of performing duties of junior commanders and privates, and relieve the Army of the function of a "cheap labor force"; - ensure high professionalism through an interest in service and responsibility of both parties to the contract (both the civilian and the command element); - lower the number of accidents, breakdowns and crashes and increase the operating life of equipment, reducing the volume of military orders for its production; - substantially reduce the number of instances of loss and injury among personnel, eliminate causes of "dedovshchina" and elevate the level of military discipline; - free up additional working hands for the country's national economy (by reduction and non-call-up) and also free up real estate, equipment and property in the Armed Forces, which in other countries led to an increase in GDP and full compensation for additional expenditures for transition to a professional army; - ensure stability of the Army in an unstable society, and prestige of military service amidst strong anti-Army sentiments among draft-age youth and their parents. In agreeing with the Russian Federation President's statement that "the military department does not reform itself," it is evidently necessary to examine this matter in the Security Council, in the Federal Assembly, and in society, creating a Committee for Assistance to Military Reform in the Russian Federation based on results of the discussion.
