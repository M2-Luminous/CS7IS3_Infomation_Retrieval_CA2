According to the findings, MSZP supporters are also far less inclined to favor economic reform than supporters of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the main party of the defeated right-of-center government, while the views of MSZP and MDF voters differ little in terms of social tolerance. Published in the 2 June issue of the Budapestweekly BESZELO, the poll was conducted 21-23 May between the two rounds of election balloting and reflects views expressed on a questionnaire by 1500 Hungarians "representing all voting-age inhabitants of the country nationwide." Although 15 parties ran in the election, the poll results published in BESZELO pertain mainly to the six parties that made it into parliament by getting at least 5 percent of the vote, the threshold set by law. Gallup Official's Commentary In the commentary accompanying the data, Hungarian Gallup official Gyorgy Fischer suggested that the voters' dislike of economic reform played a key role in determining the outcome of the election and that this antireform attitude may undermine the stability of any MSZP-SZDSZ governing coalition. "The most promarket voting camps," Fischer noted, "are those of the MDF and the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz)," the parties that lost the most--MDF dropping to 38 seats from 159 in the 1990 election, and Fidesz barely surmounting the 5-percent barrier into parliament with 20 seats, even though for a time last year it had led popularity polls. At the same time, Fischer indicated, the fact that voters of the SZDSZ--which came in a distant second to the MSZP, with 69 seats--support a market economy "to a great degree" suggests that if the MSZP and SZDSZ form a coalition, the two parties' leaders will be under conflicting pressures from their respective constituents. Voters of the two parties are "far from each other" on key economic issues, Fischer stressed. "SZDSZ voters are characterized by a promarket attitude and almost completely lack support for the redistribution of wealth by the state," while "in contrast, the MSZP's voting base is characterized by strong hostility to the market and supports on a large scale the idea of redistribution." Views on Economic Reform The contrast between MSZP voters and supporters of the other parties was sharpest on the question of whether private property should be dominant, with only 18 percent of MSZP voters saying they agree, as opposed to the following percentages for other parties: SZDSZ, 40; MDF, 40; Independent Smallholders Party, 49; Christian Democratic People's Party, 34; and Fidesz, 37. Conversely, 43 percent of MSZP voters rejected outright the proposition that private property should be dominant, while the percentages for the other parties are significantly lower: SZDSZ, 22; MDF, 28; Smallholders, 21; Christian Democrats, 24; and Fidesz, 30. The antireform attitudes of MSZP voters was shown, for example, by the fact that only 22 percent of them agree that "unprofitable enterprises must be allowed to go bankrupt." This is well below the percentages for other parties: SZDSZ, 30; MDF, 44; Smallholders, 30; Christian Democrats, 33; and Fidesz, 38. Conversely, the following percentages disagreed with allowing bankruptcy: MSZP, 47; SZDSZ, 41; MDF, 33; Smallholders, 42; Christian Democrats, 39; and Fidesz, 37. Only on one question, asking whether respondents agreed "that Market competition should be limited," did supporters of another party, the Christian Democrats, score higher than those of the MSZP in opposing reform. The breakdown in the "agree" column was as follows: MSZP, 45; SZDSZ, 37; MDF, 35; Smallholders, 43; Christian Democrats, 53; and Fidesz, 37. The percentages in the "disagree" column were MSZP, 24; SZDSZ, 36; MDF, 41; Smallholders, 25; Christian Democrats, 23; and Fidesz, 36. Although the aggregate data indicated that the MDF and Fidesz voters are the most consistently promarket, Fischer noted, the survey showed that on "attitudes toward the redistribution of wealth and toward the market," the MSZP and the SZDSZ are the most sharply divided. The desire to increase the state's role in redistributing wealth "is least characteristic of the Smallholders and SZDSZ," while "social envy and the desire for redistribution are by far the most characteristic of MSZP voters," he said. Social Tolerance The poll indicated that among Hungarian voters there is little correlation between socialist economic attitudes and social tolerance. According to Fischer, the aggregate data show that, along with Smallholders voters, supporters of the MSZP are "more intolerant than the average," while the "most tolerant" voters are supporters of the SZDSZ--indicating that, as in the case of economic reform, the respective voters of the MSZP and the SZDSZ have "radically" different views, which could strain a coalition between the two parties. Fischer noted that this difference in social attitudes is also "what sharply separates the SZDSZ from the Smallholders, to which it is so close in terms of economic attitudes." At the same time, the data indicate that the Christian Democrat camp, which stands closest to the MSZP in socialist economic views, comes closest to the liberal SZDSZ in social tolerance. The Gallup Institute's survey provided a breakdown of voter attitudes toward three groups: Gypsies, Jews, and "people of color." The survey indicated that about half of the population, with only an 8-percentage point spread among the parties, has "an aversion to Gypsies": MSZP, 47; SZDSZ, 46; MDF, 49; Smallholders, 52; Christian Democrats, 44; Fidesz, 44. Responses to a question about anti-Semitism, on the other hand, suggest that hostility to Jews is far less prevalent than toward Gypsies, with socialist voters more inclined to anti-Semitic views than supporters of the liberal parties, SZDSZ and Fidesz, and more than supporters of the three right-of-center parties. Percentages of those who said that they "dislike Jews" are as follows: MSZP, 15; SZDSZ, 7; MDF, 10; Smallholders, 13; Christian Democrats, 10; and Fidesz, 10. The MSZP was in the middle of the pack, however, on the topic of racial tolerance. Asked if "it would be better to limit the number of people of color in this country," the following percentages of party voters answered in the affirmative: MSZP, 30; SZDSZ, 27; MDF, 27; Smallholders, 35; Christian Democrats, 31; and Fidesz, 34.
