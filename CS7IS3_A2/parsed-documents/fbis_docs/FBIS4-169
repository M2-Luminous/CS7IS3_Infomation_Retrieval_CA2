FBIS4-169 "drafr064_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA National Party Campaign Ad Emphasizes `Change' National Party Campaign Ad Emphasizes `Change' MB0304152894 MB0304152894 BFN [Editorial Report] The following two-page advertisement appears on 3 April in the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on pages 16 and 17 and in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on pages 22 and 23. A one-page version of the ad also appears in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 3 April, on page 11. The text of the Afrikaans ad is the same as that used in the English. "`Now is the time to make the change' "Imagine that you live in a country which has a strong government, with a plan that works -- a plan which attracts money to the country, so that factories and businesses are built -- so that everyone can get a job. "Imagine proper housing for all the families; hospitals for the sick; and decent schools for the children -- so that everyone might make the most of the gifts God gave them. "Imagine all this in a truly free society. A society where all people are equal in their right to vote, in their freedom to state their views, and to worship how they wish. "Imagine all the inequalities, which have damaged the life of the nation, disappearing as it becomes a truly colour-blind country. "A country which truly values the brightest and best of its people, whatever their colour. A country which recognises that ALL of its people have a contribution to make. "A country in which law and order are respected. Where the people feel safe in their homes, in their cars, on the streets, in the fields -- and on their way to work. "Imagine South Africa as that country. "South Africa the peaceful! "South Africa the prosperous! "Africa's -- if not the world's -- first genuinely successful multi-racial society. How we would be envied. "That is THE PRIZE. It is not a dream. It is perfectly possible. It is there for us to grasp. All of us. "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE. "For too long we have, as a nation, been obsessed with the things that divide us. Now it is time to think instead of all the things we have in common. "We all desire the strong economy, the jobs which come from it, the houses, hospitals and schools. And above all, peace. "In other words, we all want The Prize. "In the last five years we have begun our long journey towards it. "Of course there have been bumps; but however rough the ride, it is to the credit of ALL our people that we have come so far, so fast, with so much willingness to understand each other and so much desire to build our new nation together. "The vast majority of the people of South Africa want the change that is coming. They have fears about it, yes. They are anxious that their futures should be safe, yes. But they want the change to come. "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THAT CHANGE. "For this election is not about looking backwards. It is not about liberation -- we are already liberated. It is not about Black Power -- why replace domination by one race with domination by another? "Nor is it about revenge. Apartheid was wrong, and it hurt the lives of millions of people. But President F.W. de Klerk, has both apologised for it, and abolished it completely. "This election is about one thing only. The future. It is about us. All of us -- Blacks, Whites, Coloureds, and Indians. It matters not the colour of our skin or where we came from. What matters is where we are going to. "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE. "But who can we most trust to bring us The Prize? "Consider two simple points: First: After the elections, the next Government will be a partnership; and the two largest parties in it will be the National Party [NP] and the African National Congress. "They will have to work together. "But no partnership works if one of the partners is too large, the other too small. Each needs to be strong enough to have an influence on the other. But to be sure of it working, the NP with its plan for the future needs to be the leading one. "Second: Both parties promise very much the same thing -- a better life for all the people. "But which one is most likely to be able to deliver its promises, to deliver The Prize, in other words? "Ponder the following questions. - "Which party has lost jobs through strikes, stopped the building of houses, disrupted the children's education, and intimidated and threatened people? "The answer to all this is the ANC and its supporters and partners. - "But which party has already given its people -- ALL its people despite the inequalities -- the best life, in the whole of Africa? The answer is the new National Party. - "Which party has taken the lead in transforming South Africa and brought us to our first full and free election? The answer is the new National Party. - "Which party will be the most truly multi-racial party contesting those elections? The answer is the new National Party. - "Which party has the best plan, and knows how to make it work -- so that the jobs will come -- and the houses, the hospitals and the schools? The answer is the new National Party. - "And which party is dedicated to peace and the rule of law -- because only if we have peace can all this be achieved? The answer is the new National Party. "SO NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE THE NEW NP. "On April 27, we all get a chance to vote. Your vote is the heartbeat of democracy. It is yours and yours alone. It is secret. And no-one can tell you how to use it. "If you vote for the new National Party, you will be voting for a party which can grasp The Prize. "A party which is pledged to bring the jobs and make possible all the houses and schools that we need. A party with the strength, the experience and the determination to live up to its promises. And a party dedicated to peace and a secure future. "If you vote for the ANC, you are taking a gamble on the future. You will be voting for an organisation which promises dreams; but simply does not have the experience to deliver. "You will, in other words, be voting on hope. Which is better -- to vote for the party you hope might deliver The Prize? "Or the one you KNOW can do it. "Don't just hope for a better life. Vote for one. "Half the world is rich. The other half is poor. Ours are the policies which have made nations rich. The ANC's are those which make them poor. "Vote for us, and look ahead, five or ten years, and imagine this beloved country of ours with the economy booming, the jobs coming, the houses and schools and hospitals being built. "Imagine what we could be! "NOW IS INDEED THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE TO THE NEW NATIONAL PARTY. "BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE "VOTE FOR F.W. DE KLERK AND THE NEW NATIONAL PARTY "We've made the change" Between the previous two lines is a graphic depicting the National Party's line on the election ballot with a "X" marked in the space next to F.W. de Klerk's picture.
