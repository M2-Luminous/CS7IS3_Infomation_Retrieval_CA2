He said the fighting was concentrated along a strip running north and south that separates territory controlled by the two belligerants along the region of Sapna and the towns of Olovo and Brgule. Chaperon said "30 detonations were reported in the region of Sapana Wednesday, 73 in Brgule and 11 in Olovo." He said farther north in Brcko, five shells fell in the region of Posavina around 1730 GMT Wednesday without claiming any casualties. Two of the shells hit the town's main power generator. Chaperon added that the situation was also tense in the western enclave of Bihac where both sides were reported to be bringing in reinforcements. He said eight soldiers wearing civilian clothes had attempted to enter the UN-imposed exclusion zone around the eastern town of Gorazde Wednesday carrying light weapons and a machine gun hidden under a blanket but were stopped by UN soldiers and turned away. In Sarajevo, the UNPROFOR said the "usual" ceasefire violations were continuing in the capital with small arms fire and a few detonations. Chaperon said that an UNPROFOR vehicle was targeted Wednesday afternoon at the Sarajevo airport. "Fifteen shots were reported," he said adding that there were no injuries. The latest fighting came as foreign ministers from the United States, Russia and five European Union countries including Britain and France prepared to meet in Geneva Friday to try to revive the stalled Bosnian peace process.
