Mr. Ali Alatas arrived here on a two-day official visit today. The two sides are not expected to sign bilateral documents during the visit. There are no political problems between the two countries, Mr. Alatas said upon his arrival, a statement later confirmed by his Bulgarian counterpart. We have already established cooperation on many problems at international forums and we have similar stands on a number of issues, Mr. Alatas said. We will focus on the possibilities for deepening economic cooperation and will seek ways to a further improvement of our relations, the Indonesian foreign minister said. Later on Mr. Alatas described his meeting with the Bulgarian minister as very useful. The meeting continued an hour longer than scheduled. The two sides discussed bilateral relations and possibilities for promoting cooperation between the two countries and exchanged opinions on some regional problems. The two sides shared the opinion that it is necessary to broaden economic cooperation and trade between Bulgaria and Indonesia, Mr. Alatas said after the meeting. The two ministers agreed that the present trade is far below the potentials of the two countries. It was agreed that the next session of the joint Bulgarian-Indonesian Committee, which held its first session in 1990, should be held as soon as possible. The two countries have already signed several basic agreements: a trade agreement and an agreement on avoiding double taxation. "We agreed that to these we should add an agreement on reciprocal investment protection," which will be signed soon," Mr. Alatas said. After the successful visit to Indonesia of a Bulgarian delegation headed by Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev a similar Indonesian delegation will visit Bulgaria, the Indonesian foreign minister said. Economic contacts are most important in our bilateral relations, the Bulgarian foreign minister said in response to a question on the results of the meeting. According to Foreign Minister Daskalov both sides wish to establish more regular contacts -- both as regards bilateral relations and at international forums in areas of mutual interest. From the economic point of view, Bulgaria is of interest to Indonesia not so much as a market, which is quite far removed, but rather as an opportunity for coming out on third markets -- the former Soviet republics and the countries of the Balkan region. Bulgaria has already gained experience and can provide transport for a joint coming out on third markets, Mr. Daskalov said. Tomorrow the Indonesian Foreign Minister will be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and will meet parliamentary leaders. Before leaving Bulgaria Mr. Alatas will give a press conference.
