This time the threats are made by entrepreneurs who wish to set up a project for desalinizing water in Israel. According to them, the project would cost some $3 billion, and apparently not less than $5 billion. The project may well be very profitable, but please, stop scaring us by saying that a water shortage would lead to war. Economists are not familiar with the term shortage separated from the notion of price. Shortage, they say, is always relative -- it is related to the price of the commodity in question. For example, when the price of gold was $12 an ounce, there was a terrible shortage of it on the world markets. At $660 an ounce, there was an enormous oversupply. Eventually, the forces of the market created a balance. The same holds true for any commodity: gold, water, or oil. The oil lesson is the most studied and the most outstanding example. In the spring of 1981, an oil barrel went for $60 (in 1994 prices) on the free market. Since then, the price of oil dropped by 75 percent. Today you can buy a barrel for $14. What happened? The high prices of oil led to worldwide searches for it, from the North Sea to the China Sea, not to mention the oil drills on the Tel Aviv stock exchange. Worldwide proven oil reserves have doubled (!) despite pumping and consumption. The high prices motivated oil consumers and energy producers to save by any possible means. Energy conservation was discovered as a new source of wealth for the nations. New free markets of all types of oil were created. OPEC, the oil producers cartel, began losing its power. Oil-producing countries started cheating, producing and selling more than they had agreed to. They discovered the appealing charm of the free market, where you are king if you sell your oil at $.001 less than the agreed-upon price. And we have not yet mentioned the secret oil treasures of Russia, the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, only a little of which has been uncovered. The case of the oil shortage is important for us to understand that there is no such thing as "water shortage," just as there never was an oil shortage. Furthermore, unlike oil, water can be recycled. The real economic question, therefore, is whether it would be possible in the future to supply most of the amount of water in demand while maintaining a "reasonable" price -- that is, a price that would not cause entire production fields to collapse, would preserve a good public health system, and would not financially devastate the poor water consumers. The answer to all of the above is positive. Water conservation in our region has enormous potential. Just by preventing waste, promoting efficient use, and improving water pipes, we could reduce all types of water consumption by 30-40 percent without seriously harming anything. Water desalination could prove very profitable. Desalination techniques are constantly improving and production costs keep falling; hence, water prices will constantly drop. Small- and medium-size desalination plants are profitable already at this time. Consumption of purified water -- which is cheap and has almost unlimited sources -- is expected to rise. Here too, technologies constantly improve. There will be no "war over water" in the Middle East, and peace between us and our neighbors will not rise or fall over the water issue, which is economic and technical. The problem of water shortage will be solved if it is dealt with by economic experts and engineers, and not by politicians and lobbyists.
