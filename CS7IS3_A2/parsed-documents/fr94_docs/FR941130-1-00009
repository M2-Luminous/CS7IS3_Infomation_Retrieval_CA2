FR941130-1-00009 FR941130-1-00001 (6) Section 945.42 Assessments deals with the administrative funding of committee operations. The Act authorizes establishment of an agency, the committee, to administer the order. Currently, the order authorizes the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, to make expenditures and establish an assessment rate for each fiscal period for assessable potatoes shipped under the order. Any assessment in excess of expenses incurred during a fiscal period may be carried over as a reserve, provided that reserve funds do not exceed approximately one fiscal period's budgeted expenses. Each handler who ships potatoes into regulated markets is required to pay a pro rata share of the committee's expenses. Currently, the order specifies such assessments shall not exceed $1 per carload, or equivalent quantity. Potatoes for canning, freezing, or other processing are exempt from regulation, including assessments. Record evidence supports revising paragraph (b) to remove the outdated assessment limitation of $1 per carload. Since railcar capacities have increased significantly after this limit was set more than three decades ago and the load per carload may vary greatly, it has become impractical to base the assessment rate on this fixed rate per carload. Committee operating costs have continued to rise over the years along with the cost of living and presumably will continue to do so. However, total assessments collected during the past five years have tended to stabilize at an average of $78,434 per year. Thus, assessment income under present order authority is not expected to keep up with rising costs. Although the committee presently has adequate operating reserve funds and does not anticipate any need to increase the assessment rate in the near future, record evidence indicates that the current maximum assessment rate of $1 per carload will not be sufficient to properly fund committee expenses for the long term administration of the order. Therefore, the evidence supports providing authority to establish an assessment on a different unit basis of potatoes. The proponents recommended that the assessment be levied at a rate per hundredweight of potatoes or equivalent quantity. Such rate would be recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary through informal rulemaking. This section should also be amended by adding a paragraph (c) to provide authority for the committee to impose a late payment or interest charge, or both, upon any handlers who are delinquent in their assessment payments. Currently, there is no such incentive to pay assessments in a timely manner. It is unfair to other handlers who pay assessments promptly if another handler fails to pay assessments when due. A delinquent handler has an advantage in the use of these unpaid assessment funds. Also, delinquencies by some handlers leads to delinquencies by others. Moreover, nonpayment of assessments can have an adverse effect on the stable financial operation of an order and may require the committee to borrow money and pay interest to continue operation. Record evidence indicates that the charging of late payment or interest charges, or both, on all late accounts would defray some of the added cost of collecting such accounts and discourage handlers from delaying their payments. The late payment and interest rate charges would be recommended by the committee, subject to approval by the Secretary through informal rulemaking. An example of such charges would be similar to what commercial businesses charge, such as a five dollar late fee and one and one-half percent per month on the unpaid balance. Other similar programs which had experienced problems in collecting assessments promptly have found such provisions useful and effective. The provision should be of similar value to the Idaho-Eastern Oregon potato order.
