"The Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry will now look at the details of the NATO initiative and see how we should proceed. We will also discuss this with other countries, chiefly with Finland, which has more or less the same attitude as we do," the prime minister said after the meeting. Prime Minister Bildt also stressed that Sweden is almost best in the world at peacekeeping operations and could contribute its special competence. "We can offer other countries training at the UN school at Almnas outside Sodertalje." Social Democratic leader Ingvar Carlsson was generally positive. He said that the meeting had chiefly had the character of a briefing. In the past, the Social Democratic leader has called for consultations among party leaders on Swedish security policy. The prime minister's response has been that the question would be discussed at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council after the Christmas and New Year holidays. The meeting yesterday did not touch on the question at all, however.
