In 1993 the northwest China province shipped more than 224 million tons of coal, or 72 percent of its total output, to 26 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions as well as 12 cities. The amount of electricity that Shanxi transmitted last year to other parts of the country was some 10.785 billion kwh, or 26.46 percent of its total electricity production. The figure was 10.33 percent more than in 1992. Shanxi's coal output accounts for more than one fourth of the national total. It ships some 300 million tons of coal every year, about three-fourths of the national total transported out from coal-producing provinces and regions. During an inspection tour to China's largest industrial city of Shanghai, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said that the city's economy to a large extent relies on coal resources from Shanxi. So do many other fast-developing but energy-short provinces and cities, the vice-premier added. However, Shanxi itself suffers from the low state-set prices for coal and coal-related products, and it remains one of China's backwater regions. As one of China's most important powerhouses, Shanxi has in recent years stepped up the pace of building more coal-based power plants, in a bid to tap its coal resources and better serve the country's economic boom. Included in Shanxi's energy development blueprint is the construction and upgrading of some ten electrical plants, which will transmit electricity to neighboring provinces and regions as far as east China's Jiangsu Province and the country's most dynamic province, Guangdong in the south. Under the plan, Shanxi will be capable of generating some 100 billion kwh a year by the end of this decade. The amount of electricity it sends out will also jump from the present 10 billion kwh to 43 billion kwh annually by then. Experts said transmitting electricity instead of coal to the outside has considerably reduced the burden on railway transportation and has turned low-quality coal and coal byproducts into high-value-added electricity. Shanxi's endeavors to turn coal into electricity have caught the attention of the country's energy-importing regions and has gained support from them. Consumers of Shanxi coal and electricity, such as Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, and Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Guangdong Provinces, have funded Shanxi's fledgling power plants. Meanwhile, companies from 13 countries and regions, including the United States, Germany, Britain, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have signed with Shanxi 15 investment contracts and letters of intent for co-operation. One of the big joint ventures is the Hepo electrical power plant, a co-operative project between Shanxi and two U.S. companies, involving more than 110 million U.S. dollars in total investment. Last year Shanxi pumped more than 1.94 billion U.S. dollars into its power industry, a move that has helped raise its total installed electricity generating capacity to 8.4 million kw. Currently the construction of a group of electrical power plants is well under way, and a power-transmission network is also taking shape in Shanxi. Officials said that another 6.1 million kw of installed generating capacity is expected to be added to the province's power network, making the electricity industry the second-largest mainstay industry in Shanxi after coal.
