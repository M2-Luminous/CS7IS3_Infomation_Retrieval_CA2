He was the first Greek prime minister to do so in the past 20 years. Yeoryios Papandreou, his son, made the preparations for his visit. He is the deputy foreign minister responsible for the affairs of Greeks who live in foreign countries and is also responsible for Greece's relations with the Greek lobby in the United States, AHEPA [American-Hellenic Educational and Progressive Association] affairs, and matters related to the Patriarchate in Istanbul and the Turkish minority in Western Thrace. Prior to leaving for Washington to prepare for his father's visit, Yeoryios Papandreou arrived in Istanbul and held talks with the patriarch. He also attended a mass in the Patriarchate. Yeoryios Papandreou held talks with the AHEPA members and made several initiatives with the support of Archbiship Iakovos, head of the Orthodox Churches in Washington. Meanwhile, George Stephanopoulos, who is an adviser to the White House, was asked to help him gain the support of the Greek-American voters. Meanwhile, a warning in Clinton's letter, which Prime Minister Tansu Ciller leaked to the press prior to the local elections in Turkey on 27 March, has drawn attention. It said: "It will be in Turkey's interest to work with all its neighbors, including Greece, to reduce tensions in the region to a minimum. Your government may take certain symbolic steps to reduce the latest tensions in relations between Turkey and Greece. In view of that, I am convinced that an effort should now be made regarding certain developments. One of the symbolic steps that you may take could be related to the Greek Orthodox Partriarchate in Istanbul. I hope that you will consider easing certain difficult problems to help the Patriarchate become a functioning institution." That message reemphasized the views U.S. officials have for many years conveyed to Ankara under the pressure of the Greek lobby. What Clinton has requested from Ciller is the recognition of an "ecumenical status" for the Patriarchate. In fact, Clinton's statement at the press conference he held in the White House after he met Andreas Papandreou was interesting. President Clinton asked for a change in the Patriarchate's status; he did that under pressure from the Greek lobby. The Patriarchate's status is not provided for in the Lausanne Treaty, it has been outlined verbally. The Patriarchate does not have any political or administrative authority. According to the Lausanne Treaty, the Patriarchate is nothing more than a Turkish institution. Its task is to function as the spiritual institution of the Orthodox community in Turkey. The Patriarchate functions in accordance with Turkey's laws, as do other Turkish institutions. The Patriarchate's wish for an "ecumenical status" is based on Orthodox tenets. It has dreamed of attaining a "state status" in Istanbul, like the Catholic Church has in the Vatican. There are several patriarchs in the divided system of the Orthodox Churches. However, the patriarch in Istanbul is more influential than his colleagues elsewhere in the Orthodox world. There is a strong desire for the patriarch of Constantinople [Istanbul] in the Orthodox world to gain a status similar to that of the Pope in the Catholic World. This is based on two reasons. The first is their wish that he be the most influential patriarch in the Orthodox world; and the second is the wish to have an equal ecumenical status with the Pope so they can have a balance, in status and protocol, among the Christian Churches. However, any move in that direction may create a religious state within a state, which would conflict with the Lausanne Treaty and the republican principles in Turkey. From Turkey's viewpoint, the concept of an "ecumenical status" is meaningless. As far as Turkey is concerned, the Patriarchate is just an ordinary Turkish institution. Clinton's request for an improvement of the Patriarchate's working conditions is tantamount to interference in Turkey's internal affairs. However, is it not true that Prime Minister Ciller's request for a letter of support from Clinton, which she would use as a trump card in the elections, was tantamount to inviting him to "interfere in Turkey's internal affairs?" Obviously, such a request would encourage him to raise the question of the Patriarchate's status. Naturally, Clinton has not missed this opportunity to support Andreas Papandreou in Greece's domestic politics and bow to voters of Greek origin in the United States. An interesting point is Yeoryios Papandreou's arrival in Istanbul from Washington. He gave first-hand information to the Patriarchate on his contacts in Washington. All that has a very important aspect for Turkey. The Pan-Slavic trend was resurrected after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the Orthodox Church, which has had an important political role throughout history, has moved to step up its activities in the region. What can be more natural than coordination between an Orthodox organization based in Istanbul and the Greek Megali Idea [Great Ideology], which Greece has never abandoned?
