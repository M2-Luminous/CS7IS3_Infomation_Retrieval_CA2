In order to promote the Jordanian economy and upgrade the level of its performance and achievement, and also to work out the appropriate legislation required by the coming phase, stronger cooperation between the legislative and executive authorities must be effected. This explains the primary reason for the cabinet reshuffle and the nature of this reshuffle. Moreover, we know that the entire region will witness developments that have begun to surface as a result of the peace process and the events taking place in the region. In fact, this will basically make Jordan the focus of attention. Jordan will have a clear and effective role in these events.
