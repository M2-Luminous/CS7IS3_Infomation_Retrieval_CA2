PAC and IFP Presidents Clarence Makwetu and Mangosuthu Buthelezi met in Johannesburg on Thursday morning and discussed the ballot system and violence. "The PAC and the IFP decided to contact the Democratic Party, Dikwankwetla Party and others in favour of the two-ballot system to develop joint strategies to ensure that the fraudulent undemocratic one-ballot system does not take place," PAC President Clarence Makwetu told a press conference afterwards. PAC Political Secretary Jaki Seroke said later the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] and the Conservative Party might also be approached. Mr Makwetu and Mr Buthelezi agreed violence could jeopardise the elections and suggested meetings between them and the African National Congress [ANC]. "Joint activities between the PAC, the IFP and the ANC is the route along which the solution should be found," Mr Makwetu said. Mr Buthelezi said the PAC last year offered to mediate between the ANC and the IFP, but the ANC had rejected the offer.
