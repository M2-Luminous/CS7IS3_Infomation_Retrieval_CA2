At several polling stations in Lagos, the commercial capital inhabited by some six million people, nobody at all had registered in the first three hours after the polls opened, while at others visited by AFP, fewer than a score of names were recorded. After registration, the election proper began at noon (1100 GMT), with voters expected to stand behind the portrait of the candidate of their choice in a controversial "open ballot" system. The aim Monday was to choose electoral colleges in each of Nigeria's 30 states and the federal capital territory Abuja, which would in their turn, next Saturday, elect 273 delegates to the conference, which the regime has said will chart Nigeria's political future. Pro-democracy movements, including a powerful group known as Middle Belt Forum consisting of prominent politicians and other figures in central states, have dismissed the vote as a "charade" aimed at perpetuating military dictatorship. They asked junta leader General Sani Abacha to invite, by May 31, the presumed winner of presidential elections annulled by the military last year, tycoon Moshood Abiola, to form a government or face mass protests. The Campaign for Democracy, a coalition of some 40 pro-democracy and human rights organisations, has also warned that it would try "physically" to block the vote and called for a boycott of the conference. The junta, which plans itself to appoint 96 people to the conference, won the support at the weekend from a group of traditional chiefs in the ethnic Yoruba heartland in the southwest, Abiola's home region. The Yoruba rulers said they would back the government conference in June on condition that the annullment of last year's presidential poll be part of the agenda. Sources reached by AFP in major cities in other parts of the country reported widespread apathy about the poll.
