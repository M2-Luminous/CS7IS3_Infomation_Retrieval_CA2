French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee, the Security Council president, told journalists following the council's consultations tonight that the council completed its review of the embargo on Iraq in accordance with Resolutions 687 and 715, without giving further details. This is the first time in three and one-half years that the UNSC has refrained from issuing its traditional statement on extending the unjust siege on Iraq. Diplomatic sources in the United Nations told an INA correspondent that this was due to the division between UNSC permanent members, which are divided into two groups. The first group comprises France, Russia, and China, which insists on recognizing the positive development that has taken place between Iraq and the United Nations. The second group comprises the United States and Britain, which wants to maintain previous UNSC president statements, which usually say that the council did not note progress in Iraq's abidance by UN resolutions. The United States and Britain insist on this formula, and the two countries suffered a severe failure at the council today. The diplomatic sources added that the result of the council's three-day consultations are considered an important diplomatic gain for Iraq, and that the second group, which comprises the United States, Britain, and Argentina, have become isolated in the council. Following the council meetings, Yuri Vorontsov, Russia's permanent UN representative, explained his country's position during the three-day consultations. He said during the consultations the Russian delegation said there are positive elements in Iraq's implementation of Resolution 687 and long-term monitoring according to Resolution 715. Vorontsov added that the Russian delegation has behaved out of conviction, and demanded that the positive elements in Iraq's position be encouraged, therefore, the Russian delegation demanded to include in the periodic presidential statement a clear paragraph that points to this positive position adopted by Iraq. Vorontsov said: At the council's consultations, we clearly stressed the need to specify when the long-term monitoring measures began and the duration of the experiment. We proposed that the experiment be for a period of six months, for example, at the end of which Russia would be prepared to discuss lifting the oil embargo in implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. As for British Envoy Sir David Hannay, he attempted to belittle the importance of the outcome reached by the UNSC. He did not make statements to attract the attention of reporters, as has been his custom after each and every session of the UNSC. Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright made no comment. She left this for her secretary, who reiterated the U.S. position, saying: "It is no secret that we want to maintain the embargo against Iraq. However, some UNSC members do not wish this to happen." An ambassador of a UNSC member who preferred to remain anonymous said that the climate of today's consultations is a crucial factor that will be to Iraq's advantage in the next periodic review due to be held on 18 May. Some diplomatic sources said that the climate at the UNSC today was the first of its kind, as there was a clear rift between the two groups. It is a turning point in favor of Iraq, the sources added. The sources went on to say that U.S. Ambassador Albright attempted to raise irrelevant issues to distract the deliberations, alleging that her government has information indicating that Iraq is massing its troops to attack Kurds. However, the U.S. attempt has failed, because the French, Russian, PRC, and other ambassadors ignored this attempt, and insisted that the statement clearly acknowledge the positive developments in Iraq's position. Nonetheless, the Americans and Britons maintained their anti-Iraq position, thus eliciting this outcome of the UNSC review, namely, the decision to maintain the sanctions for two more months pending the next review of the sanctions on 18 May, which is expected to be in favor of Iraq.
