Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong said on Monday the money supply expansion ceiling has been set at 14 to 17 percent for this year. "Unlike past practices, however, we will operate money supply a little tightly without regard to the ceiling," Hong said. In a policy consultation with senior Bank of Korea officials, the finance minister said, "Money supply should be operated in consideration of the trend of money interests in view of industries' financial burden." Touching on the ceiling of foreigners' investment in stocks, Minister Hong said the government plans, if possible, to reduce the influx of foreign money into the stock market this year. "We must develop mid- and long-term policy devices over this issue in consideration of our country's entry into the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) next year," the minister said. He thus implied that his Ministry would expand the ceiling of foreigners' investment in stocks by next year at the latest as planned. "To open the stock market without developing devices for the management of money supply is like pushing a brakeless car down from the top of a hill," Hong said. "Yet, a winter comes anyway even though you didn't prepare a coat."
