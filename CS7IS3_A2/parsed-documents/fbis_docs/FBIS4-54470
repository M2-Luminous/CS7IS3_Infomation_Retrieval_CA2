After the talks, which were held behind closed doors, Aleksa Buha, foreign minister of the republic of Srpska, and German representative Michael Steiner made brief statements. Steiner said that the group had presented its views and ideas and that several interesting views and positions had been presented during the talks. We sincerely hope that the ideas that we presented here will be accepted, and that will have an effect on the Serbian side, because our motive is to turn the situation toward peace, Steiner said. Aleksa Buha, foreign minister of the republic of Srpska, said that the group that came to Pale today to hold talks with the representatives of the republic of Srpska should connect up the broken threads of the peace process again. The two sides exchanged views on that today. Our side, the Serbian side, wanted the contact group to note everything that has happened in the mean time, the bombing, the ultimatums, and the creation of the Croatian-Muslim federation. We wanted the peace process to continue with a different methodology and we informed the representatives of the contact group about that. Buha also said that both sides share the view that a good start was made today and that they should continue in the same direction.
