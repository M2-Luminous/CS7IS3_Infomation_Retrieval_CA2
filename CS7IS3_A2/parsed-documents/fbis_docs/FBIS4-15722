The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said he expressed his profound concern that the world may be engulfed in a very perilous situation of an exchange of blows and urged him to display utmost restraint. We believe that all the sides must renounce any use of force. This equally applies to the Muslim side, which, unfortunately, provoked the Serb side in some localities. But of course we regard the shelling of towns by artillery as impermissible. At the same time, air strikes can have different results from those intended; that is, an escalation of the conflict instead of its suppression. We are worried by the fact that the decision was made in a hurry, without taking into consideration possible consequences, the minister continued. Unfortunately, the UN Security Council's permanent members were not consulted. The responsibility for the grave consequences that can be expected rests, therefore, with those who took this decision. All this is especially annoying because by last Saturday we already had signs of a possible political settlement, stressed Kozyrev. Russian representative Vitaliy Churkin is now in Pale, where he arrived after talks in Belgrade. The foreign minister called on all sides to refrain from all military actions, including air strikes. He recalled that Russia and Spain are members of the so-called `Yugoslav Five' within the UN Security Council. They have now agreed to act in close cooperation. Andrey Kozyrev ended by expressing hope that this critical situation will be overcome. To make a decision on air strikes without Russia was "a big mistake and a great risk," the Russian minister added. In his words, he would not like to aggravate the situation, but he would like his words "to be understood correctly and taken very seriously." Andrey Kozyrev recalled that Russia was the initiator of the practice of UN operations aimed at maintaining peace and of the principle to protect the peacekeeping forces by all possible means. We are not against using force to protect "the blue berets." It is a vitally important issue for Russia, the head of the Russian diplomacy stressed, and explained that many of our servicemen are participating in the peacekeeping forces in various conflict zones. We cannot allow them to be turned into hostages or targets for the conflicting sides. That is why we are firmly adhering to the position that the peacekeepers will be protected reliably. It is a different matter as to what extent in this specific case there was now no other way out in Bosnia but to deliver an air strike and to what extent this was an optimal decision, the minister noted. That is why, in his opinion, consultations were needed, and even more so, they are being envisaged by the resolution of the UN Security Council. If we proceed from the fact that consultations should be held only when we wish to hear "yes," then what is left of the concept of consultations and cooperation?
