The chamber's chairman, Anatoliy Vengerov, granted ITAR-TASS an interview in which he said the new chamber was designed to reinforce the information rights guaranteed in article 29 of the Russian constitution, and assist the president in protecting the freedom of the press. Vengerov was the chairman of the Information Court of Arbitration, which was formed to handle disputes arising from the recent electoral campaign and gave rise to the new chamber. He is sure that his experience in that post can become the basis for the judicial chamber's work. The new chamber, just like its "predecessor," will not be included in the federal court system and will use moral and legal methods to carry out its resolutions. The main task of the judicial chamber is to assist the president in implementing the constitutional guarantees of rights and freedoms. Besides that, the chamber will deal with the truthfulness and objectivity of information and ensure that the principle of pluralism is followed. The chamber will have wide powers concerning disputes over the amount of radio and TV coverage given to the parliamentary factions in the Federal Assembly. A completely new aspect has also been attached to the chamber's functions, the defence of the "moral interests" of children and youth in (or perhaps from) the mass media. In addition, the former press and information ministry's job of issuing warnings to mass media which break the law "On the Mass Media" has been transferred to the judicial chamber for information disputes. The chamber's personnel has been appointed. It includes four members of the former arbitration court besides the chairman: Igor Yeremin (deputy chairman), Aleksandr Kopeika, Viktor Monakhov and Mariana Panyarskaya. Igor Ivanov, the chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, and Yuriy Feofanov, editor-in- chief of the ZAKON (Law) journal, have also become members of the judicial chamber.
