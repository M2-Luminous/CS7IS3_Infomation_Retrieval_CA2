FR941122-0-00025 FR941122-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Part 529 Certain Other Dosage Form New Animal Drugs; Formalin Solution; Technical Amendment AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule; technical amendment. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to clarify approval of a supplemental new animal drug application (NADA) 140&hyph;989 filed by Western Chemical, Inc. This action is being taken to reflect that only Western Chemical, Inc., has approval for the use of formalin to treat shrimp infected with external parasites. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 8, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steven D. Vaughn, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;130), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1642. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of November 8, 1993 (58 FR 59168), FDA published a document reflecting approval of a supplement to NADA 140&hyph;989 filed by Western Chemical, Inc. The supplement provides for use of formalin solution (aqueous solution of 37 percent formaldehyde) in tanks, raceways, and ponds to control the external penaeid shrimp protozoa Bodo spp., Epistylis spp., and Zoothamnium spp. The regulations amended 21 CFR 529.1030 to reflect that approval. Although the preamble to the November 8, 1993, final rule specifically limited approval of Formalin for this use, the regulations did not specifically limit approval to Western Chemical, Inc. Because Western Chemical, Inc., is the only firm that has an approved supplemental NADA for this use, this document corrects that amendment. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 529 Animal drugs.
