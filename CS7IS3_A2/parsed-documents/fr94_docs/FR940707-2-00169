ACTION: Notice of roundtable discussion. SUMMARY: This is to give notice that the Commission will conduct a roundtable discussion on July 18 and July 19, 1994, at the Willard Hotel, Washington, DC, beginning at 8:30 a.m., to inaugurate a comprehensive study of regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The public is invited to attend. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William C. Weeden, Associate Director, (202) 942&hyph;0545, Office of Public Utility Regulation, Division of Investment Management, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission will conduct a roundtable discussion on July 18 and July 19, 1994, at the Willard Hotel, Washington, DC, beginning at 8:30 a.m., to inaugurate a comprehensive study of regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (``1935 Act''). The 1935 Act was New Deal legislation, enacted by Congress to eliminate abuses that had plagued the United States electric and gas utility industry and threatened the interests of investors and consumers. The statute is complex and far-reaching. Although there have been fundamental changes in the industry in the past sixty years, the 1935 Act has remained largely unchanged. The Commission believes that it is time to undertake a thorough evaluation of the 1935 Act, to review the regulatory framework in light of developments in the industry, and to consider how federal regulation of utility holding companies can best serve the public interest and the interest of investors and consumers in the approaching century. To that end, the Commission recently announced that it will undertake a comprehensive study of the 1935 Act. 1 The study will be inaugurated by a roundtable discussion in which representatives of the industry, state, local and other federal regulators, consumer groups, trade associations, an economist, investment banks, rating agencies and others will participate. The public is invited to attend. The agenda is set forth below: 1 See Testimony of the Honorable Richard Y. Roberts before the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce (May 26, 1994).

The Energy Policy Act of 1992, in particular, has accelerated the development of a competitive electric industry, and freed United States companies to invest in utility operations around the world. The momentum in this area is not abating_retail wheeling is only the most recent issue. How will the profile of the industry change in coming years? What role, if any, is envisioned for a federal holding company statute in this evolving industry? Afternoon Session 1:30 pm_State and federal regulation A federal holding company statute should supplement, not supplant, the work of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state and local regulators. What is the role of a federal holding company statute in the regulation of the gas and electric utility industry? Given the roles of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state and local regulators, is a federal holding company statute necessary for effective regulation? 4:50 pm_Questions and comments 5:30 pm_Session ends
