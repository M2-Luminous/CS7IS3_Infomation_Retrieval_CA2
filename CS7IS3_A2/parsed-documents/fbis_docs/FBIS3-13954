Kamath: "The Fate of Kashmiri Pandits"] [Text] An international conference of Kashmiri Pandits was held in Delhi in the last week of December 1993 to focus the attention firstly of all Indians and secondly of the world beyond, on their present fate. And what is their fate? Their fate is to live as refugees in places outside the Vale of Kashmir which has been their ancestral home for centuries, in make-shift tents, braving the cold in winter and the searing heat in summer with no proper sanitary facilities and less medical attention. Organisations like Asia Watch while raising howls about the difficulties of Kashmiri Muslims, make no more than passing reference to the inhuman brutalities with which the Muslim terrorists have dealt with them. Over three lakh Kashmiri Pandits have been forced to flee their homes under threat of death. The terrorists have indulged in the rape of women and the killing of men in the best style of invading Muslim hordes of the Middle Ages. The latest incident is the shooting down of a hundred-year old Kashmiri Pandit in Wanpora in the first week of June 1993. In what way an aged man could have menaced Islam only the terrorists can tell. The Kashmir Government is silent on this as on other reckless murders. The Government of India is embarrassingly silent. Nobody wants to speak out lest their secular credentials are questioned by anyone. In 1941, according to census figures, Muslims formed 83 percent of the population of the Vale of Kashmir and Hindus 15 percent. In 1991 Muslims formed 97 percent of the population and Hindus 0.1 percent. Ethnic cleansing is complete. Aurangzeb would have been proud of the Muslim terrorists for the splendid work the latter have accomplished in the last four decades. According to a booklet published by the Kashmiri Samiti on human rights violation in Kashmir, the terrorist killings have been accompanied by torture unheard of in the annals of human history and includes strangulation by using steel wires, hanging, impaling, branding with red hot irons, burning alive, lynching, gouging of eyes before assassination, dismemberment of body, dragging to death and just plain slaughter. The booklet gives details including the names of those killed and the dates they were killed. The Government of India is free to challenge these facts and if they are untrue, this should be publicised. If they are true, we need an explanation. According to the booklet "the (Kashmiri) State Government is yet to disclose the identity of about 400 dead bodies recovered by the police and disposed of at its will". The booklet accuses the State Government of an attempt "to cover the anti-Hindu character of the terrorist violence and has tried to play down the massacre of Hindus". It is true that the terrorists have also killed Muslims not in their good books. Total civilians so far killed number 2,256 in five years (1988-1992) for which figures are available. The majority, of course, are Hindus -- Kashmiri Pandits. The unpleasant fact about Kashmir and its terrorist faction is that the crusade is to merge the State with Pakistan and drive every single Hindu out. Already the ethnic cleansing is almost complete. The brunt of hatred has been borne by the Kashmiri Pandits who have been denied elementary human rights. But to this date the fate of the Kashmiri Pandits is of no concern to anybody. But let it be said clearly and precisely: Kashmir belongs to the Kashmiri Pandits, the original inhabitants of the state -- and NOT to the Muslims, just as Kuwait, or Oman or Bahrain which have non-Muslim majorities belong to the local Muslims because the latter are the original inhabitants of the areas. Islam came to India only in the 12th century. That a good number of the original Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam does not hide the fact that the background and the past of all Kashmiris is Hindu and should be recognised as such. The list of distinguished Kashmiri poets and scholars in Sanskrit from the Vedic period right on to the 12th century is long and impressive. The list tapers off following the advent of islam in the Vale. To say that Kashmir is Muslim is a negation of history and a pandering to the whims of the neo-historians. Kashmir was, is and shall remain essentially Hindu and cannot be permitted to go into the hands of Pakistan for the last traces of Hinduism to be wiped out for ever. That is why the Kashmiris have been asking for a "homeland" of their own. That homeland can only be in Kashmir, not in Dandakaranya or somewhere in the wilds of Madhya Pradesh. And there is nothing fanciful in the demand of the Pandits. If Jews in their diaspora could dream and fight for a Jewish state two thousand years after they were dispersed in the four corners of Europe and get the support of modern states like Britain, France and United States and other smaller nations, there is no reason why the Kashmiri Pandits should not ask for a homeland here and now, while their status as refugees is temporary. There is an attempt made by our "intellectuals" to fob off the Kashmiri Pandits with false promises by saying that, why, of course, they could get back to their homes they were forced to vacate when the Kashmir issue is "settled". Nobody asks the question: Settled how? Or when? Or under what conditions? They are not consulted when the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan discuss the so-called "Kashmir Question" as if their fate is of no moment. Aren't they entitled to know? Are they destined for ever to live as refugees at the mercy as much of a callous government as of a callous class of "intellectuals"? There can be -- and there should be -- no Kashmir "settlement" without the guaranteed return of the Kashmiri Pandits to their ancestral homes. And even that is not enough. The State should guarantee that they will not be treated as second class citizens as has been the case these last four decades. They cannot be left to the tender mercies of ex-terrorists and their ilk. One can be sure that if Pakistan has its way, there will be no place for Kashmiri Pandits in Kashmir, which is their legitimate home. Under no circumstances should this be allowed to come to pass. Islamic terrorists should not be allowed to get away with murder. To support Kashmiri Pandits in their just cause -- which is a demand for a homeland -- is not communalism. Conceding that Kashmir is "Muslim" is reverse communalism. Kashmiri Pandits have a sound case and it should be presented in every international forum. The Government has to stop being defeatist. Kashmir cannot be given away to Pakistan; nor can it be handed over on a platter to Islamic fundamentalists. The safe return of the Kashmiri Pandits to their ancestral homes is -- and should be -- the special responsibility of the Government of India which cannot be dodged or made slight of. Kashmir is the homeland of the Pandits -- and so it will remain. *
