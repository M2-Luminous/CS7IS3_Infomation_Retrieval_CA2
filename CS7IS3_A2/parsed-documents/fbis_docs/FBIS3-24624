The scientific-production association engaged in interplanetary flights realizing the need to urgently mend the situation and assess soberly its prospects in the market of medical equipment, has started the production of equipment for disinfection. The equipment enjoys success but, according to Marina Polyakova, head of the marketing department of the Kront company set up by the scientific-production association, because of money shortage many medical institutions cannot afford such equipment. Therefore, the newly-fledged businessmen decided to simply give them several of the new instruments. For instance, the International Mother-and-Child Care Fund and the St. Petersburg Children's Home received EKO installations for preparing disinfectant solutions and plastic boxes for the treatment of medical instruments. The value of the gifts (about 2.5 million roubles) is not so high according to the present standards, but the precedent is important: among sponsors is the world-famous, but no longer wealthy space company which actually does not get allocations from the budget for its conversion and itself experiences serious financial difficulties.
