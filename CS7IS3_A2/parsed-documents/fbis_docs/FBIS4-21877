This is reportedly a gentlemen's agreement, without any written documentation to attest it. According to the understanding reached, Hamas will not act against Fatah or against the potential benefits of the peace process. Both sides prefer the wording here to be intentionally vague. This is how Husayn al-Shaykh, one of the prominent Fatah leaders in the West Bank and an adviser to the Palestinian peace delegation, defines the situation: [Begin al-Shaykh recording] There is no war between us and Hamas; therefore, no agreement is required. I am sure that Hamas knows its limits and our red line very well and that in the future, it will share power with us. [end recording] The understandings were reached recently, following a series of secret meetings between some seven to 10 people from both organizations. The gist of the Hebron agreement is that Hamas accepts Fatah as the leader in the political process, even if it does not agree with it. It should be emphasized that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military arm, does not recognize and is not bound by these understandings. [passage omitted]
