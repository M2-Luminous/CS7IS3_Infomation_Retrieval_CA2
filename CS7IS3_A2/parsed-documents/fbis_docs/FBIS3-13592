He explained to our correspondent in Jerusalem why Israel refuses to make any concessions prior to reopening negotiations with the PLO. [Rousselin] What condition set by the PLO are you ready to satisfy to ensure the reopening of negotiations? [Beilin] We cannot talk of preconditions. We have taken steps to deal with the settlers. These are not concessions with regard to the PLO but the result of internal discussions. It is a serious mistake to impose preconditions for the reopening of negotiations. That simply slows down the process whereas we should be accelerating it to conclude a deal as soon as possible. [Rousselin] The Oslo agreements did not cover the problem that is being posed today, namely protection for the Palestinians... [Beilin] No, that has been considered very seriously and they will have their own police force. That is the best way for them to protect themselves. That can be implemented very quickly. [Rousselin] Would not an international presence contribute to Palestinian security? [Beilin] Such a presence would not have avoided the massacre. We can avoid that sort of thing as long as we are present. The Palestinians will be able to avoid it when they have their own police force. However, I admit that the issue of an international presence is still open to discussion. [Rousselin] The Gaza and Jericho agreement does not settle the problem of Hebron... [Beilin] Would an international presence settle the problem? [Rousselin] I do not know. Maybe if the settlers were disarmed or moved...? [Beilin] The most important thing is not to take a settler's pistol away from him. For 26 years we considered that we had to protect the Israeli people in the territories from the Palestinians. That was not totally crazy because they were constantly threatened by the Palestinians. We must now deal with the opposite situation. It is an upheaval in our way of looking at things. It was so clear that it was the Palestinians who had to be searched at the entrance to the Tomb of the Patriarchs! That will not occur again. [Rousselin] Since you have changed your way of looking at things, why not now negotiate provisions for the security of the Palestinians as you did in Cairo for the security of the settlers? [Beilin] We must discuss the details of how the agreements signed will be implemented. That can be done in just a few weeks. However, that does not require a new general agreement such as the one concluded in Cairo. [Rousselin] How can you justify the continued presence of settlers in the heart of Hebron? [Beilin] We have to distinguish between the wisdom of having founded this type of settlement in Hebron, and the question of whether we should change the current situation. Expelling the settlers would be very difficult legally speaking. We would have to justify our actions before the Supreme Court. If they have committed crimes, they will be dealt with by the judicial system. If they are innocent, we will be asked why they are being evacuated. Having said that, I was personally against any cohabitation in the territories from day one. [Rousselin] You admit that the presence of settlers in Hebron is a mistake yet you refuse to correct this mistake under the pretext of not making concessions to the PLO... [Beilin] It is a "fait accompli..." The PLO agreed with us in Oslo that we would not move a single settler. To go back on an agreement that was a major step forward for our two peoples would be the gravest error we could ever make. The cost would be enormous. It took us a year to get as far as Oslo... [Rousselin] Could you not amend the signed agreements? [Beilin] Rightly or wrongly, we agreed in Oslo not to move a single settler. I understand the criticisms which they (the leaders of the PLO) are being subjected to. I understand their isolation and bitterness. However, if it means taking a step backward, then it is not acceptable. I understand that they want to know what we are doing. [Rousselin] So you are ready to discuss it? [Beilin] We will explain to them the measures we have taken on our own initiative and not as a result of discussions with them. We understand their pain and their anger. Naturally, we are prepared to talk about it, not as an obstacle blocking the path to an agreement but to explain to them that we are taking steps as the ruling authority in the territories. [Rousselin] Why will you not consider redeployment outside of the Arab-populated zones like Hebron, as planned for July on the eve of the elections in the territories? [Beilin] This redeployment will only come if there are elections. The agreement is very clear on that point and, as you know, the Palestinians are not in full agreement where the elections are concerned.
