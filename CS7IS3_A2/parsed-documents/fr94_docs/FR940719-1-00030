FR940719-1-00030 FR940719-1-00009 Following the January meetings and public comment period, the four Federal agencies developed a draft Summary Report which was distributed on March 28, 1994, for the stakeholders to review. The final Summary Report was developed in light of these comments and in coordination with the Administration's Interagency Working Group on Wetlands Policy and issued concurrent with this Federal Register notice. The results of the Alaska Wetlands Initiative address 11 major areas of concern with the wetlands regulatory program identified by Alaskans. These areas include the mitigation sequence; compensatory mitigation; no overall net loss of wetlands goal; alternative permit processing procedures; the individual permit process; State, local, and Native roles; advance planning and watershed management; wetlands inventory, classification, and categorization; outreach and education; special Alaska circumstances_physical environment; and special Alaska circumstances_legal issues. The major recommendations of the Alaska Wetlands Initiative address a number of regulatory and non-regulatory actions, including: (1) Issue written clarification that recognizes existing flexibility to reflect circumstances in Alaska afforded in the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines in implementing alternatives analysis and compensatory mitigation requirements; (2) Acknowledge pre-application mitigation efforts; (3) Encourage greater use of advance planning that incorporates consideration of the mitigation sequence; (4) Initiate a mitigation banking pilot project in coordination with the State; (5) Assess the effectiveness of mitigation techniques in Alaska; (6) Develop a comprehensive mitigation strategy for past, current, and future oil and gas development activities on the North Slope; (7) Explore application of bonding procedures for permit requirements; (8) Issue written statement clarifying that although the Administration's goal of no overall net loss of wetlands is National policy, it will not always be achieved on a permit by permit basis in the Section 404 regulatory program; (9) Implement Abbreviated Permit Processing Procedures for water, wastewater, and sanitation facilities in Alaskan villages; (10) Publicize availability, for public review, of cumulative impacts evaluations for General Permits; (11) Render individual permit decisions within 90 days consistent with final regulations currently being developed for the Nation; (12) Conduct exit polls or interviews with permit applicants; (13) Seek sufficient regulatory resources to ensure timely decision making; (14) Provide applicants with better information on how to respond to comment letters received as part of the Corps' public notice process; (15) Establish written partnerships between the Federal agencies and all interested stakeholders and organizations regarding the Section 404 regulatory program;
