Even moderate deputies now come out against the signing of such a document. According to them, the members of parliament were not even told about the treaty signed in Moscow by the presidents of the United States of America, Russia, and Ukraine. In the opinion of the members of parliament, the signing of the Moscow treaty would mean that the president took a stand which totally differs from that approved by the parliament. The actions by Kravchuk play into the hands of Russia and the United States and were carried out by him under pressure, stated the members of parliament. Many of them say that they will come out against any attempt by President Kravchuk to ignore the reservations which were signed and expressed during the discussion dedicated to the ratification of the START I treaty. The communist deputies speak out for impeaching President Kravchuk if the trilateral Moscow agreement is signed.
