The message says: It is a significant event to hold the international seminar on the chuche idea to discuss the question of independent development and mutual cooperation of the world people in a historical period when independence has become an irresistible trend of the times. To dismantle neo-colonialism, the leftover of the old era, and achieve complete economic liberation of countries and consolidate their political independence is an urgent requirement of the present time which is advancing along the road of independence and a common task of the peoples of the developing countries. The chuche idea is the most humanitarian and democratic idea which opposes all manner of domination and subjugation and defends human dignity and national sovereignty. It is a genuine internationalist idea which requires friendship and cooperation among the peoples be strengthened for the common prosperity of mankind. The Korean people could build a socialist country, independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence, and strengthen the bonds of friendship and cooperation with the peoples who champion independence as they have regarded the chuche idea as the guiding idea in the building of a new society and applied it in all domains of social life. There is no doubt that when the people advance under the banner of independence and cooperation as required by the chuche idea a historical change will be brought about in building a free and prosperous new society, a new world. Now the people's cause of justice is undergoing trials due to the moves of the old forces seeking domination and subjugation, but no force on earth can arrest the historical trend of the times toward independence, and the aspirations of the people who want to live independently would surely be realized. Firmly believing that the seminar will greatly contribute to strengthening the independent development and mutual cooperation of the world people, we sincerely wish the seminar success in its work.
