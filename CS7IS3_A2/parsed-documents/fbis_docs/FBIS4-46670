Total financial dependence on state subsidies in the context of the current budget deficit is cutting off the wings of new projects before they even get off the ground. Meanwhile, unlike medicine for the human body, the medicine for the industry's body has long been found. It is commercialization of the aerospace programs. How "They" Set Things Up In the United States, for example, under conditions of rather strict secrecy, the job of developing the commercial sphere of the space program was conferred on NASA from the very beginning. As far as 10 years back, an entire Department of Commercial Programs was set up for that. That department created the Strategic Plan for the Commercialization of Space, which was designed to cover 25 years. In that same year of 1984, the U.S. Congress approved a law for the development of commercial operations associated with the use of space transportation systems. We note parenthetically that, in the previous decades, the reliance was primarily on communications systems. Then came a succession of commercial uses of launch vehicles. In a word, without getting into detail, one can state that the enlistment of commercial structures in the exploration of near-Earth space was, from the beginning, "their" program goal. With that, they killed two birds with one stone: "Deriving economic benefit for all the people and raising the quality of life on Earth," plus "encouraging investment in the space program from the private sector." The quotation marks here house the actual words from the 11 February 1988 directive of the U.S. president on the commercial space initiative. In the West, as we know, the return on space investment is $3-15 for every dollar invested. Our Domestic Draft The draft was drawn up as the State Space Program for the Period Ending in the Year 2000 by the Russian Space Agency (RKA) and the Russian Academy of Sciences, along with interested ministries and departments. Everything, it seems, was provided for in the draft. First, the basic principles were enunciated: competitive development and independent advisory councils for the projects; program-specific planning based on alternatives; economically efficient combination of unique, uniform, standard elements; compliance with legal regulations and improvement of the regulatory system; and regular informing of the public of the plans and results of space activity. Second, spheres of application were enumerated -- from communications and television broadcasting to systems for defense and the transfer of scientific-technical and technological achievements to other sectors of the economy. There was talk of the introduction of those achievements to the world market. And not just talk. Our aerospace complex is a dainty morsel to foreign business circles. Under acute financial strain, Russian enterprises were forced to sell unique know-how to Western partners. NPO Energiya, for example, sold its spacecraft rendezvous and docking system; the KB [design bureau] Salyut and the Scientific Research Institute Khimmash sold the technology for producing a cryogenic oxygen-hydrogen engine; and the Yuriy Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center sold the system for screening, training, and post-mission adaptation of cosmonauts. The entry into the world market is basically a good thing. But with the investment into our aerospace complex, things are worse. Domestic private and joint-stock capital, because of its rudimentary nature and weakness, is not rushing to open its purse strings. And the West is in even less of a hurry. After all, foreign partners are trying to sell their own products to us. Aircraft of the well-known Sergey Ilyushin aircraft complex, the Il-96M and the multipurpose Il-103, are being outfitted with the motors of two American firms. What to do? How can the entrepreneurs of Russia be enticed to participate in the commercialization of space? The draft of the state program is quiet about that. Oh, these days, hopeful assurances are being tossed about to the effect that Russia was, is, and will be a great space power. One of those assurances issued from the mouth of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in his speech at a solemn celebration of the Space Program Day. But let's not look at words, let's look at realities. Not having yet passed the draft, but only having approved it, the government has thereby agreed to allocations of more than 16 trillion rubles [R] (at prices of the first quarter of 1994) all the way to the year 2000. Some R1.7 trillion is expected to be allocated as early as this year. That's no small amount, but it's not exorbitant, either -- it's 0.23 percent of the budgetary outlays (in the United States, the percentage is 0.97). The high-tech sector probably deserves the better part of that. Especially since, as experience shows, the actual monies for it will come in irregularly and in small amounts. For example, although the decree specifies that at least 30 percent of the monies allocated for the year be appropriated every quarter, the RKA in three months has received 1.9 percent for deliveries of series-produced equipment and 2.9 percent for cosmodrome maintenance. With such drops in the bucket instead of the promised injections, it's impossible to guarantee prepayment of the many special orders, and specialists feel that within two or three years, our space program will be agonizing if... If Business people Are Not Brought In It's naive, of course, to think that small- and medium-sized enterprises are, by themselves, capable of competing with state infusions into the space program. But what's to keep them from following the West's example and creating funds of risk (or venture) capital? That, in particular, was a topic at the Fifth Scientific Workshop and Conference "Business People and the Economic Development of Space," which took place recently at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation. In discussing the problems of the commercialization of space, scientists and entrepreneurs reached the same conclusion. Business people, commercial banks and insurance companies, and representatives of regional authorities are fully capable of coordinating efforts, creating venture funds, and becoming involved in the financing of the commercial projects of the space sector. Similar funds in the United States, for example, are created as TOO [not further expanded]. For a specific period (usually 7-10 years), the accumulate money from the most varied of sources: individuals, industrial companies, retirement funds, foreign investors, and so forth. Such a consolidation of sources is capable of gathering a considerable amount of capital and reducing the potential risk for each individual contributor. The risk become even less with the cooperation of regional and other venture funds (in the United States, they number upwards of 600) and the creation of a team of professionals capable of investing money in promising, prestigious space projects with a maximum of return. Our newspaper has already named a number of them -- satellite communications, which is five to six times less expensive than cable or radio communications, and space-based prospecting of natural resources, which is capable of returning R7 for every R1 spent (see DELOVOY MIR, 8 April 1994). At the conference, representatives of the space department told of dozens of similar projects. Just one of them involves the Bankir system of NPO Sergey Lavochkin, which is capable of replacing our extremely archaic, awkward banking transactions with paperless technology. There are no such systems abroad yet. Bankir will service more than 40,000 subscribers, and all finance operations will be effected instantaneously, by ground standards. The traffic handling capabilities of the system are so great that, in the next three to five years, all Russian banks will be able to keep only about 15 percent of it busy. Unused channels you could, for sure, sell right and left. God only knows, if I were a wealthy banker, I would break my neck on one such project, if only to put together with my colleagues a venture fund and use it, and then expand the system so that it would envelop the entire globe: if would you be so kind, gentlemen Western bankers, as to allow me to be of service to you. Alas, at the conference, the voice of the business people was timid and muffled. Where Are You, Entrepreneur-Enthusiasts? Why are the business people being slow about this, why are they being so cautious? The question of what is getting in their way is not at all rhetorical. The obstacles are manifold. One of the main obstacles is that there are no real levers of interaction between state and commercial structures in the development of space. No legal basis has been drawn up for such interaction. There is not yet in Russia a market infrastructure capable of flexibly and reliably distributing capital in priority sectors and projects. And we've already mentioned above of the weakness and lack of coordination of private owners and entrepreneurs. The list could go on and on. Everybody knows it well. It is the misfortune of our Russian reality that the upper echelons of power are deaf to the earthly needs of goods-producers and that they don't give them a helping hand. And the entrepreneurs, despairing in turn of ever reaching the higher offices with their innovations and requests, are up to their ears in humdrum concerns and can't see the forest for the trees. Meanwhile, our space wagon can't pull away from the curb to get onto the high road without a commercial wheel. And it's not a fifth wheel -- it's one of the front wheels. And it needs to be put on by the authorities -- who need to set up a clear-cut program and a legal basis for the commercialization of space research -- and by the business people -- who need to assemble the capital and lobby the standard official circles. God willing, one or the other will rouse us from our sleep. Anything could happen -- even the newcomers could surge ahead of our great space power.
