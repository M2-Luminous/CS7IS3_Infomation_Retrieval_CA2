In an interview granted to the TASR news agency, he said that he learned from circles close to the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] that proposals similar to this one are being prepared to be raised at the next meeting of parliament. Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said the debate on no confidence in Roman Kovac documented the poverty of the political culture of certain sections of deputies and political groups. At the same time, he did not rule out that similar proposals on no confidence will appear in the future, too. He said, however, that he is convinced that these moves do not at all affect the stability of the present government.
