FR940811-2-00103 FR940811-2-00066 In many cases, particularly in the case of a product patent, there may be little to be gained by analyzing competitive effects in a separate technology market in addition to analyzing effects in the associated goods market. Moreover, there may be practical problems in gathering appropriate data to determine ``prices'' for the technology and its substitute processes. For example, the technology may be licensed royalty-free in exchange for the right to use other technology, or it may be licensed as part of a package license. When complicating factors preclude delineating a relevant market in which the licensed technology competes, the Department may focus its attention on effects in the associated goods markets. To estimate the market share of a participant using new technology, the Department generally will forecast market acceptance over a two-year period using the best available information. For technologies not yet commercialized, the two-year period will begin with commercial introduction. When market shares or other indicia of market power are not readily available, and it appears that competing technologies are all equally efficient, 12 the Department's analysis will treat each participant in the technology market as having an equal market share. 12 In this analysis, the Department will regard two technologies as being ``equally efficient'' if they can be used to produce, at the same cost, goods perceived by consumers to be close substitutes. 3.2.2␣Goods markets. A number of different goods markets may be relevant to evaluating the effects of a licensing arrangement. A restraint in a licensing arrangement may have competitive effects in markets for final or intermediate goods made using the intellectual property, or it may have effects upstream, in markets for goods that are used as inputs, along with the intellectual property, to the production of other goods. 3.2.3␣Innovation markets. Firms compete in research and development that may result in new or improved products or processes. If the capacity for research and development activity that likely will produce innovation in technology is scarce and can be associated with identifiable specialized assets or characteristics of specific firms (which may or may not currently participate in the relevant technology or goods markets), in may be appropriate to consider separately the impact of the conduct in question on competition in research and development among those firms. The firms identified as possessing these specialized assets or characteristics can be thought of as competing in a separate innovation market. See Complaint, United States v. General Motors Corp., Civ. No. 93&hyph;530 (D. Del., filed Nov. 16, 1993). Alternatively, innovation markets may be used to assist with the identification of competitive effects in relevant goods and technology markets. See, e.g. , Complaint, United States v. Flow International Corp., Civ. No. 94&hyph;71320 (E.D. Mich., filed Apr. 4, 1994). Example 2 Situation: Two companies agree to cross-license future patents relating to the development of a new component for aircraft jet turbines. Innovation in the development of the component requires the capability to work with very high tensile strength materials. Aspects of the licensing arrangement raise the possibility that competition in research and development of this and related components will be lessened. The Department is considering whether to define an innovation market in which to evaluate the competitive effects of the arrangement. Discussion: If the firms that have the capability to work with very high tensile strength materials can be reasonably identified, the Department will consider defining a relevant innovation market for development of the new component. If the number of firms with the required capability is small, the Department may employ the concept of an innovation market to analyze the competitive effects of the arrangement in that market, or as an aid in analyzing competitive effects in technology or goods markets. In this analysis, the Department would take into account the specific nature of the restraint, the likelihood that other firms may in the future acquire the requisite capability, other competitive factors, and any efficiency justifications for the licensing arrangement. If the number of firms with the required capability is very large (either because there are a large number of such firms in the jet turbine industry, or because there are many firms in other industries with the required capability), then the Department will conclude that the innovation market is competitive. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that any single firm or plausible aggregation of firms could acquire a large enough share of the assets necessary for innovation to have an adverse impact on competition. If the Department cannot reasonably identify the firms with the required capability, it will not attempt to define an innovation market. Just as goods markets are improperly defined if the firms in the market, were they to coordinate their decisions, would not profitably increase price above competitive levels, so too innovation markets are improperly defined if hypothetical coordination among the firms in the candidate market would not profitably retard or restrict innovation in the technology. When a relevant innovation market has been defined, the Department may assess the competitive significance of each participant based on shares of those identifiable assets or characteristics upon which innovation depends, on shares of research and development expenditures, on shares of the related product, or on equal shares assigned to reflect the equal likelihood of innovating, depending on the facts of each case. Cf. 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines §1,41 & n.15. In evaluating competitive effects, the Department would also take into account other factors such as competitive harms from the elimination of alternative research paths and efficiency benefits from the integration of complementary research and development programs. 3.3␣Horizontal and Vertical Relationships As with other property transfers, antitrust analysis of intellectual property licensing arrangements examines whether the relationship of the parties to the arrangement is primarily horizontal or vertical in nature, or whether it has substantial aspects of both. A licensing arrangement has a horizontal component with respect to a technology market if it involves the acquisition of rights to technologies that are economic substitutes for technologies that the licensee owns or controls. For analytical purposes, the Department ordinarily will treat a relationship between a licensor and its licensees as horizontal with respect to a particular goods market when the licensor and its licensees would be actual or likely potential competitors in that market absent the license. An arrangement has a vertical component when it affects activities that are in a complementary relationship, as is typically the case in a licensing arrangement. Such a relationship exists when the licensor and its licensees stand in a seller-buyer relationship, or operate at different levels of the chain of production and distribution. For example, the licensor's primary line of business may be in research and development, and the licensees, as manufacturers, may be buying the rights to use technology developed by the licensor. Alternatively the licensor may be a component manufacturer owning intellectual property rights in a product that the licensee manufactures by combining the component with other inputs, or the licensor may manufacture the product, and the licensees may operate primarily in distribution and marketing. Although licensing arrangements typically have a vertical component, the licensor and its licensees may also have a horizontal relationship in the market containing the technology being licensed or in other markets in which they are actual or likely potential competitors. The existence of a horizontal relationship between a licensor and its licensees is not inherently suspect. Identification of such relationships is merely an aid in determining whether there may be anticompetitive effects arising from a licensing arrangement. Such a relationship need not give rise to an anticompetitive effect, nor does a purely vertical relationship assure that there are no anticompetitive effects. The following examples illustrate different competitive relationships among a licensor and its licensees.
