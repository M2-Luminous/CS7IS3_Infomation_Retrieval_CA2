The project was presented one day before the opening of Eurosatory '94 (Le Bourget's land-based weapons show). The armored vehicles will be manufactured in two basic versions: a six-wheel and an eight-wheel model. Production lines will start running in 1998 and the vehicles are scheduled for delivery to the Armed Forces in 2002. By the year 2000, both the French and German Armies will need 3,000 such vehicles, whose unit cost must not exceed 5 million francs. The future troop transporter will accommodate up to nine soldiers with their equipment and weapons, in addition to a crew of two. It will be able to carry various types of turrets such as one fitted with a 45-mm gun, or even the 120-mm gun turret which is being developed for the future French weapons system carrier. It will also be able to operate as a command car or an ambulance. Two Assembly Lines Designed to blend the tactical mobility of a battle tank with the strategic mobility of a truck, the new armored vehicle will feature a light and very strong body made of a special aluminum alloy. Its maximum speed will be 120 km per hour, its maximum range will exceed 750 kilometers, and it will be equipped with a central system for inflating or deflating its tires while running to ensure optimal adjustment to the terrain. The formal timetable is as follows: The four members of the consortium will sign the joint venture agreement in late 1994, before establishing, in June 1995, a common subsidiary whose ownership will be 50 percent French and 50 percent German. Germany's Krauss Maffei and France's Giat Industries will both operate an assembly line, while Panhard will manufacture custom vehicles made to specific consumer requirements.
