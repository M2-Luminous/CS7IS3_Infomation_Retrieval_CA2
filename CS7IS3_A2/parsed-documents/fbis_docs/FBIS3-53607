Pointing to the main topic of the meeting which will be Iran's foreign debts, the daily 'TEHRAN TIMES' said it can be foreseen that Clinton's representatives will be using irrelevant issues such as human rights violation, Iran's stance on 'Arafat-Rabin accord and Iran's so-called arms purchases to distract the attention of the Europeans from America's real economic objective. "The truth of the matter is that in the present economic conditions dominated by a general recession in the U.S. the most urgent objective for the U.S. companies and trusts is to capture the large Iranian market or to have access at least to certain sections of that market", the daily noted. Therefore, noted the daily, the real objective of the American pressure on the European countries in the Paris meeting is to make them exert pressure in turn on Iran for the purpose of opening up opportunities for the American companies. Referring to a recent telephon conversation of President Rafsanjani and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the daily said the chancellor had clearly promised that differences over the repayment of loans between the Iranian and German companies would soon be resolved. "It is quite surprising to find out that the German central government is acting contrary to the promises of its chancellor and the interests of its companies", the paper concluded.
