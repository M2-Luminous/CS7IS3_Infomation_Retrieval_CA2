Luis Becker, a member of the URNG's political-diplomatic commission, told AFP that "the report (issued by the Guatemalan Army) aims to misinform to create confusion and problems." He insisted there are no links between the URNG and EZLN, and he stressed that "we absolutely respect the political situation (in Mexico), and therefore we refrain" from issuing an opinion on the emergence of the guerrilla movement in Chiapas State in southern Mexico. In Guatemala, the Army said today, there "are signs" the URNG "might be involved" with the guerrilla EZLN, which is occupying several towns in southern Mexico. Becker said he does not know whether the "disinformation" seeks to prevent the return of thousands of Guatemalan refugees who live in Chiapas and other southern Mexican states and who for several months have been preparing to return to their places of origin. The Guatemalan guerrillas, who are planning to hold a round of peace negotiations with the Guatemalan Government on 6 January, have said that they will issue a communique "later" on the "disinformation" spread by the Army about their links with the EZLN. The EZLN has said there are no foreigners in their movement and that their members come from various Mexican locations.
