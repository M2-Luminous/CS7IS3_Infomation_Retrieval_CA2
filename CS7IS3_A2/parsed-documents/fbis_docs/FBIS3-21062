Ten years of research into forest damage have not yielded any strategies for stemming the tide of damage. In addition, criticism of the methods for surveying the damage is growing. To summarize the results of the new damage survey, the State of the Forests Report needed only one short page. According to this report, 24% of the trees in Germany show clear damage, 40% show slight damage, and 36% show no signs of damage. The forest in northwest Germany is relatively well off. In this area, the portion of trees showing clear damage is 16% on average. In southern Germany on the other hand, every fourth tree shows clear damage. In the new Federal Lands, this figure is 29%. In Thuringia, every second tree is dying. Different types of trees react differently. One fifth of both the spruces and pines show clear damage. However, this is the case with 45% of the oaks and 32% of the beeches. The data show little that is new. The rates in the individual damage stages have changed little since 1991. Accordingly, 2% to 2.5% of the trees have lost at least 61% of their needles or leaves (damage stage 3) or have already died (damage stage 4). Also, 22% to 25% exhibit needle or leave losses of 26 to 60% (damage stage 2), 40% still have at least three quarters of their original needle or leave mass (damage stage 1), and 32 to 36% have been declared healthy because they have lost a maximum of 10% of their needles or leaves. "The forest continues to be in a difficult situation," comments Jochen Borchert. He is the Federal Minister for Agriculture and said this during the presentation of the report at the beginning of December in Bonn. "However, we are not ready to ring the disaster alarm." Indeed, sick trees do not frighten anyone any more. One reason is that the forest is dying more slowly than believed ten years ago. The chronology since 1984 shows that, in northwest Germany (former Federal Lands), the rate of trees "showing clear damage" (damage stages 2 to 4) increased from 10% to 16% by 1993. The rate of "healthy" trees (damage stage 0) dropped from 62% to 50% in the same time. In southern Germany, the portion of sick trees increased from 20 to 25%, the portion of "healthy" trees fell from 45 to 33%. For the survey, the individual Lands first covered their forest areas with a grid. Depending upon the size of the forest, this grid was between 4 km by 4 km and 16 km by 16 km. At the points of intersection of the grid, the crowns of 24 marked trees at each point were assessed from the ground in July and August. The leaf or needle loss of these trees was estimated. Numerous associations and environmentalists, however, warn against overrating these data. On the one hand, the broad mesh of the measuring network only permits the assessment of trends over an entire Land, differentiated only according to the types of trees and age groups. Soil composition and the annual increase in biomass are important indicators for the progress of damage. Data on these items have not yet been included in the survey and will not be available until 1994. Merely counting leaves or needles is not very suitable for assessing forest decline, points out the study group of the Association of German Forest Owners. A slight recovery of "trees showing clear damage" as indicated by this year's report is, according to information of the forest owners, not to be attributed to improved air quality, but rather to a summer with growth-promoting weather. In addition, the results are distorted in that about 2% of the test trees die and are felled annually. Also, environmentalists criticize that even young trees that are scarcely knee high are counted in the survey just like old, mature samples. In addition, larger areas where the trees have died off no longer appear in the statistics as former forest areas. The declining forest still generates a number of questions for science. Why do different types of trees react so differently? Why do many forests grow at a greater rate now than 50 years ago in spite of a reduced mass of needles and leaves? What portion of the decline can be attributed to air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, hydrocarbons, ammonia and ozone, what portion to weather, what portion to insect pests and disease-causing agents? The "Forest Decline" advisory committee had already determined in 1989 that "in the face of the numerous relationships of location, composition, management, and pollution factors, there cannot be a simple explanation of the causes for the new type of forest decline valid uniformly for all forests." The scientist have not advanced their knowledge much further at this time. In the meantime, the Federal Research Ministry (BMFT) established forest ecosystem centers at the Universities of Bayreuth and Gottingen. Here, research should change its emphasis from the previous study of individual pollutant effects to the analysis of the entire forest ecosystem. The annual budget of about 33 million Deutsche marks, however, appears rather meager when compared to the 477 million Deutsche marks that the Federal Government and its Lands have expended since 1984 for so-called accompanying forest measures -- 175 million Deutsche marks for liming and compensation fertilizing of the forest soil and 170 million Deutsche marks for reforestation. The many question marks in forest decline research should not prevent politics from acting. Environmental associations have been demanding this for years. "In reality, there is still no such thing as forest preservation policy," criticizes Dr. Helmut Klein. He is from the Association for the Preservation of the Environment and Nature of Germany. Just how difficult it is to provide concrete political measures to preserve the forest is shown by the example of the Fertilizer Use Ordinance. Besides air-borne sulfur and nitrous oxides, agricultural fertilizers containing nitrogen throw the forest ecosystem out of balance. An ordinance prohibiting excessive fertilization has been kept in the wings for years. Another important question is still on ice. Should forest owners be compensated for the dying trees? An inter-ministerial study group was to calculate what economic damage was done to the forest by which air pollutants. In the meantime, this study group has stopped work. "There is no money available for such compensation," fears Assistant Secretary Peter Splett from the Forestry Management Department of the Federal Ministry for Agriculture. If forest owners are compensated for their sick trees, the owners of monuments or public buildings would also have to be compensated for the loss in value caused by air pollutants. The question of compensation is about to be clarified by the Federal Constitutional Court. If the justices decide in favor of compensation, "That would become a bottomless pit," says Splett.
