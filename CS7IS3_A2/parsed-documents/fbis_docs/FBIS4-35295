He noted that if the UN Security Council is concerned about human rights, then it should rescue the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. These statements emerged in a news conference held by the brother House of Representatives speaker in Abu Dhabi yesterday. He explained that the Yemeni people are offering everything for the sake of unity because it is dear and is worthy of sacrificing lives. Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar said Yemeni unity is considered a foundation stone on the path of Arab unity. Therefore, he said, any recognition of the separatists is tantamount to hostility against the Yemeni people. He added: Doors are open and bridges are built with all fraternal Arab and friendly states. The door to dialogue has not been closed with the unionists in the Socialist Party.
