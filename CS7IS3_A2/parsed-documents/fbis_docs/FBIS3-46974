This phenomenon set in as soon as the audit-and-inspection drive, carried on by new government since its launching seemingly for the liquidation of the past, somewhat slowed down. On the other hand, it is also true that the disputes effectively put the brakes on the drive and the reform movement in both their speed and width. The party line disputes are likely to reach all the way up to the Kim Yong-sam government. They are something totally new to the nation's political history which is run through with confrontations between "power and relationship." Needless to say, it is also a fact that the party line dispute is a double-edged sword in that it is a very risky experiment that can produce a fatal impact on the whole spectrum of the political situation. The dissensions within the ruling camp including the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] led to controversies over whether to extend the current audit-and-inspection drive, and to a government-opposition dialogue, a leadership-level dialogue, and further to abortive National Assembly sessions. The disputes centered on two factions in the DLP--the RDP [former Reunification Democratic Party] faction dedicated to reforms and its rival, the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party] faction. Although it was not open, the most serious of the disputes within the ruling camp was over the method of reform. In late March, when three lawmakers, including former National Assembly speakers Pak Chun-kyu and Kim Chae-sun, were forced to retire from politics and Reps. Chong Tong- ho and Yim Chun-won left the DLP--all in the swirl from the public disclosure of properties--the handwriting was on the wall. The former ruling forces led by the DJP faction protested that the crackdown on "the past" is outrageous. They unanimously insisted that "reforms should be carried out in accordance with law and system." "The audit-inspection drive against selected targets as in the cases of `targeted investigation' and `individual investigation,'" they charged, "points to a possible ulterior motive." They contended that the crackdown was politically motivated, that it targeted members of the DJP and NDRP [former New Democratic Republican Party] factions and on ex-military leaders. However, under the pressure of the prevailing circumstances, their voices faded before having any chances of stirring an open debate. The reformists of the RDP faction brushed off the charges as "a nonsense." The group argued that reforms are inevitable and that the political purification under the keep-the-upstream-water-clean slogan is one thing that has to be done even if there are differences over the method. It also argued that to say that the past should not be questioned is to say that there should be no reform. The factional difference continued and it came to the fore at every opportunity. The so-called "policy shift controversy" was a variation of the party line dispute. Whenever President Kim Yong-sam issued a new "declaration," it prompted different interpretations between factions. The first clash came over the president's policy speech to the National Assembly on 22 October. The speech, focusing on "the future," suggested the unity of the two forces--the "Han River force" which performed the Han River economic miracle and the "democratization force." Leaders of the former ruling factions took it as a signal for a policy shift. They welcomed it. "The abominable audit-and-inspection drive is nearly over," they said. Further, they saw the president's references to the unity of the two forces as the show of an intent to form a new ruling force unattached to the past. However, it was not the case with the reformist group. "Shelving the reforms? No way. ..." The reform program is the central, keynote policy of the new government, they insisted, and therefore it will be firmly kept in place through to the end of the President Kim's tenure. They warned against "distorting the meaning" of the president's speech. Chongwadae's response was even stronger. It usually jumps to its feet whenever there is a talk about a policy shift. Trends were even more obvious after the 8 November Chongwadae meeting held to push for a new economy, in which President Kim called for the "building for the future." The former ruling faction saw it as a "policy shift" but Chongwadae officials explained the next day that "any interpretation suggesting a policy shift is at variance with the fact." At Feud Over Everything The dispute between Reps. Yu Song-hwan and Kim Yun-hwan over the latter's past record was a case typifying the difference over "the past" between the RDP and DJP factions. At a 12 October National Assembly Education Committee hearing on the administration of the Education Ministry, Yu questioned the past record of Kim, the virtual leader of the DJP faction. He dropped a bombshell by saying "How about inviting Rep. Kim Yun-hwan to this hearing? He was a member of the Yujonghoe in the National Assembly [in the Pak Chong-hui era] and the head of the Chongwadae staff in the Chon Tu-hwan government. In the No Tae-u government, he served as the minister of state and the floor leader of the ruling party. I propose that we ask him what prompted him to do what he did in those days and what sort of patriotism he has these days to justify what he is doing now." The DJP faction flew into a rage when Yu's remarks were reported. The faction was seized with group psychology, contending that if that should be a sin, there would be no one clean in the DJP faction. The RDP faction and even Chongwadae worked feverishly to allay the fury. According to a widespread observation, however, the episode eventually proved to be a contributing factor to about 36 "rebellious" votes cast by DJP faction members in a vote on a proposal for the release of Reps. Kim Chong-in and Pak Chol-on. Kim Yun-hwan made no open rebuttal of Yun's remarks. He only expressed his feeling by saying that "the important thing is not the position a person held in the past but what he did in that position." In the RDP faction, while some accused Yu Song-hwan of a "grandstand play," it was an undeniable fact that many others basically shared the same feelings with Yu. Similarly, the record of Chairman Kim Chong-pil became an issue. Although there has been no formal debate inside or outside the party, the RDP faction--the reformist group in particular--openly discussed an image of incompatibility between "reform" and Kim Chong-pil, a former "key leader of the 5.16 [l6 May, 1961, coup] force." Then came the controversy over the qualification of former Secretary General Choe Hyong-u as member of the party Supreme Committee, sparking dissensions within the DLP. In the wake of that controversy, calls for changing the party chairman are not about to subside. The squabbles over the presidential decree that prohibited financial transactions using false names or aliases and the follow-up measures, plus the wrangles over the key economic policies and the government's foreign and unification policies, have all added to the political line disputes within the ruling camp. The party line disputes, when viewed from a wider perspective, extend all the way to the North Korea issue, the nuclear issue in particular. Some DLP members of the National Assembly Committee on Foreign and Unification Affairs would assail cabinet members, particularly Foreign Minister Han Wan-sang, at every party-government session, and even at the committee's meetings in the National Assembly, for the government's appeasement policy toward North Korea. Some even accuse Han of espousing a peculiar ideology. Meanwhile, other lawmakers criticize the government's political lines, charging that some presidential secretaries belong to the activist camp and have connections with chaeya [reformist camp] groups. They would argue loudly at private gatherings that no leftist or progressive reform has ever succeeded. Those presidential secretaries, they argue, have given the impression as if the government were being pushed around by them and, as a result, business communities are left unable to dispel their uneasiness. And the uneasiness is making an economic recovery impossible, they add. Political Line Dispute in the DP, Too The Democratic Party [DP] under the Yi Ki-taek leadership is also seized with a serious case of party line dispute. In the configuration of its internal factions, however, the DP today is markedly different from what it used to be. First of all, factions became far more complicated and diverse. Groupings, large and small, cropped up after the retirement of Kim Tae-chung from politics, while many former chaeya activists have raised their collective voices against conservative cliques within the opposition camp. A more important change since the launching of the Kim Yong-sam government is the fact that diverse voices began to be heard on the role of an opposition party and that polemics on the political line thus started are heating up as days pass by. Opposition parties in the past also had their shares of the party line dispute. And such disputes proved to be a leading factor drawing the line between the mainstream and the nonmainstream. But in those days, the dispute was structurally simple. It was over how to fight a seemingly formidable dictatorial regime. Thus, it led to the polemic on a clear-cut opposition party, which remains a legacy of the opposition camp. This is not to say that there were no differences within the opposition over economic and other policies. Such arguments, however, were obscured by the absolute proposition--the overthrow of the dictatorial regime. Things have changed now. It is true that the various policies successively announced by the Kim Yong-sam government under the banner of reform triggered numerous disputes over their contents and speed and the method of implementation; however, they reflected the "opposition's perspective" of the past to some degrees. This drove the opposition into a new situation in which it was compelled to tackle the question of how to deal with the new government--more specifically, how to respond to the policies of the new government. In this sense, the past 9 months were an ordeal and experiment for the DP. Amid this ordeal and experiment, wrangles over the party line in various areas came to the fore in full details, without being obscured by an overthrow-the- dictatorship slogan as was the case with the opposition in the past. The dissension is essentially different in nature from the "clear-cut opposition party" debate in the past. In the past, the question was who resists the dictatorial regime more staunchly. The focus of internal struggle now shifted to who can develop policies that can captivate the hearts of people and who can cultivate the capabilities to take power. Anti-government struggle is no longer the only task of an opposition party. The opposition is confronted by the new task of self-help and self-development. Unveiling itself to the full in the face of the new task is the "difference in philosophy" which had been dormant within the opposition and which could spawn a long-term intraparty discord if not handled properly. This is not to say that the DP is all through with the obsolete "clear- cut opposition party" polemic. A typical example in this respect is the joint session of party executives and legislators of the DP held on 3 November in the National Assembly. At the session, Kim Sang-hyon, leader of the nonmainstreamers, who lost to Yi Ki-taek in a runoff vote in the DP national convention in March, launched a frontal attack on Chairman Yi Ki-taek's political line ("New Line"). He said: "I do not think that the Kim Yong-sam government is a civilian government. Have we ever defined it a civilian government as a consensus of the party? It is a government created by a collusion with the military government in the three-party merger. Therefore, President Kim Yong-sam can be called a civilian president but the Kim Yong-sam government cannot be called a civilian government. Presently, the people think that the opposition is missing and drifting. We should take on the Kim Yong-sam government as an object of reform. We must not cling to or be sucked into the reform program of the Kim Yong-sam government. During the parliamentary inspection of the administration, Chairman Yi said that the DP would shelve the drive for the liquidation of the past and instead focus on the economy. I do not mean to say that the economy can be put on the back burner, but his speech contained no alternative plans for a positive liquidation of the past nor an agenda of opposition struggle. "Most important is the liquidation of military culture. Morality cannot be established without the liquidation of the past. We are running the risk of playing bridesmaid to the Kim Yong-sam government. The Kim Yong-sam reform is a deception as long as an ex-leader of the 5.16 coup stays on as DLP chairman. As long as the ex-leader of the 5.16 coup remains as DLP chairman, it is necessary for us to cut off official contacts with the DLP and maintain unofficial contacts, and to lead on the public opinion." Earlier, on 28 September, DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek told reporters that he would "put greater emphasis on the economy of the people than on the liquidation of the past." And in the subsequent National Assembly speech, he declared the future-oriented party New Line. Kim Sang Hyon was attacking the announced party line. It is a "strategy running the risk of reducing the opposition to a bridesmaid's role for the Kim Yong-sam government," he charged. At the joint session that day, Yi Pu-yong, member of the Supreme Committee, spearheaded the attack. He is the leader of a reform group in the DP led by former chaeya activists. He said: "There was a conflict in substance between Chairman Yi's National Assembly speech and the interpellation by DP legislators, causing confusion to considerable degrees. During the parliamentary inspection of the administration, while legislators requested the presence of many witnesses, the chairman held that we should not bring in too many businessmen as witnesses, causing a disarray among them. Furthermore, it is a problem that the chairman declared that there would be no linkage between the liquidation of the past and budget and reform legislation." More scathing criticisms were heard at a general meeting of DP lawmakers held the next day. Chang Ki-uk, a member of the reform group, referred to the "clear-cut opposition party polemic," a vulnerable point of opposition leaders in general. He cited the cases of Yi Chol-sung, former chairman of the New Democratic Party, who proposed a middle-of-the-road merger but had to give it up and resign as chairman, and Yi Min-u, former president of the New Democratic Party, who, during the struggle for direct presidential election system in the Fifth Republic days, adopted a lukewarm attitude toward the ruling party's offensive for cabinet system and was eventually ousted from first-line politics by the two Kim's [Kim Yong-sam and Kim Tae-chung]. "The lesson is that the opposition party should have a clear-cut goal," he insisted. The nonmainstreamers and ex-chaeya activists thus attacked Chairman Yi. Never had their offensive been stronger. Their focus was on parliamentary strategy. More basically, however, their criticism unveiled the deep-rooted difference over the Kim Yong-sam reform and the opposition's response to it. Collectively, they demand that the DP leadership recognize clearly the limitations of the Kim Yong-sam reform as a spinoff of the three-party merger and launch a more clear-cut struggle against the ruling party. They are questioning the attitude of Chairman Yi Ki-taek in this respect. Diverse Perspectives in the DP Their mounting offensive against him took some of the starch out of Chairman Yi Ki-taek. Earlier, he had shown a rejection of the word "linkage" between pending political issues and a National Assembly agenda, but he has modified his line a bit. He now says that he is "prepared for a linkage." The National Assembly proceedings are currently revolving along this line of the opposition. Then, how far can the nonmainstreamers go with their political line offensive? The history of the opposition parties shows that in a number of cases, forces that led the struggle for the cause of "clear-cut opposition party" emerged triumphant in the end. Then, does the latest party line dispute in the DP after all belong to that category? It is difficult to find an answer to that question. One thing is clear, however, and it is that judging from the trends, it is not necessarily the same as the cases in the past. There are signs everywhere that it is not. First of all, the circumstances surrounding the opposition have changed. How it should fight the government remains its problem. But more importantly, the public demands that the opposition transform itself in conformity to the change of the times. The days are gone when people applauded the DP for its uncompromising, hard-line struggles. The DP learned its lesson from the results of its refusal to attend the inauguration of the president and its controversial boycott of a by-election. On the other hand, the public reaction to Chairman Yi's National Assembly speech was relatively affirmative, unlike the uproar it sparked among the nonmainstreamers and ex-chaeya activists. Moreover, the "clear-cut opposition party" polemic in the past usually involved scandals of behind-the-scenes bargains with the ruling camp. Whenever the opposition slackened the reins of its anti-government struggle, rumors circulated had it that there were briberies or that they struck a secret deal. Morality of opposition figures, rather than their political lines, were the issue. That has now changed. Today, the line itself is literally the issue. The fact that the political line, not morality, has become the issue means that a total victory or defeat has become an impossible thing in the political game. It means that one can compromise but no one can force his or her plan on others. A typical example is the new system outlawing the use of false names and aliases in financial transactions. The DP has formed an anti-DLP front under a single, umbrella slogan--"Alternative legislation be enacted." The removal of the umbrella would expose two conflicting currents, however, including one demanding that the system be operated and reinforced in a more reform-worthy direction. If it were the old opposition party, and if the system should still be in the stage of a hypothetical one, the demand could have surely been applauded as an attitude befitting an opposition party. It was not the case this time. Many insisted that "the government plan should be eased up drastically in line with economic theories." Some lawmakers openly charged that "YS [Kim Yong-sam] is preoccupied with his popularity in disregard of the threat of an economic collapse." They even appeared to be painting a picture of "true courage" of themselves. The controversy over the new financial system did not stop at it but escalated into a debate covering the whole spectrum of the economy. Members of an Economic Justice faction led by ex-chaeya activists argued that only when there is economic justice can there be a long-term economic recovery. They pay relatively greater concerns to the problems of workers, farmers and the urban masses and to the justice of distribution. On the other hand, realists on the economy contend that the pressing task of our economy is to improve its competitiveness at world markets and to revitalize itself. Chairman Yi's New Line is an indication that the latter have become a major force in the DP. Chairman Yi's New Line is condensed in his 27 October National Assembly speech. He said in it: "Our economy is confronted by an overall crisis. It is bogged down in a serious, long-term recession. At a time when we are in what may well be called an unlimited economic war, we are growing increasingly uncompetitive as days go by." The key words in that speech were "the 21st century" and "improvement in the nation's competitiveness." And to that end, the speaker stressed the pressing need for internationalization and the promotion of science. All these expressions and the consciousness behind it were impossible to find in the opposition party textbook in the past. Although the speech was later criticized by the nonmainstreamers from their standpoint of parliamentary strategy, it was positively received by far more people in the party on the day it was delivered. Many of them found the speech fresh because it was the first attempt to push the opposition's perspective to the horizon of the future and an alternative plan. In fact, that the opposition leader focused on the future rather than the past, on alternative plans as well as on criticisms, was not the only important thing about the speech. It offered a confirmation that the New Line transcends the old framework of the opposition in its awareness of the economy and the future course of the nation. Therefore, the party line dispute over Chairman Yi's New Line essentially takes on the appearance of a confrontation over the "difference in perspective." So, it can be said that the dispute is, in its nature, difficult to resolve. In addition, the factional interests inside the DP are complicated. When former Chairman Kim Tae-chung led the opposition, he could manage the diverse forces in the party, ranging from the conservative to the progressive, and keep them together. He could do so in part thanks to his charisma, but it is also true that the circumstances at the time were in his favor. First of all, it was then imperative that the opposition should be united if it was to take power. The reverse is the case now. The DP today has neither a powerful, established leadership nor a target clear enough to rally against. Especially, the present factions in the DP are still in the phase of internal struggle and, consequently, preoccupied with gaining the control of the party. Thus, the wrangles over the political lines both in the DLP and the DP have emerged as a major factor making the whole picture of the political situation instable. With regard to future political developments, the political line disputes currently going on in the ruling and opposition camps are of extremely important significance and nature. First, in view of the inherent nature of the "political line," results of the disputes are likely to become a key factor determining future political territories. Moreover, they will seriously influence the political positions and careers of everyone, be it the primary parties in the disputes (or political factions) or the onlookers. The disputes will extend into the upcoming series of major political agendas, beginning with the DLP national convention scheduled for May next year. Second, the political line dispute is different in its nature from the competition for a position which is temporary and limited in scope. Inasmuch as it is a confrontation over principle and theory involving both the outlook on the present political situation and the blueprint for the future, the former takes on far more complicated and serious features than the latter. Although the disputes at the moment appear to be limited in scale, it is highly possible that they will further expand and intensify--depending on developments in the situation. Third, in consequence of these possibilities, the political line disputes are working as an element of political instability, at the moment at least. Based on these points, it should be noted that the current disputes in the political circles have an element in that could possibly lead to a political realignment by their "internal" energy for the first time in the nation's political history. Every transformation made by the political circles in this country to date were by the "force from outside." But the current developments in the disputes are different in that they are of internal origins in every aspect. Especially, it should be noted that unlike his predecessors, President Kim has few effective means at his disposal to control the political forces. In addition, considering the local autonomy elections scheduled for 1995, the 15th general election to be held in 1996, and the 1997 presidential election, the president has, strictly speaking, only one year before the first of these things begins. In that sense, too, politics under the Kim government will revolve around the political line disputes as its main axis, rather than factional strife. It seems that it cannot be otherwise.
