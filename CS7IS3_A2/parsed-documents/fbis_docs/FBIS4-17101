In a conversation today with the ITAR-TASS correspondent they stated that they know nothing about such plans. What is more, they say, the present difficult period requires a redoubling and not a weakening of efforts to achieve a settlement of the Bosnian crisis. Nor would a reduction of the level of diplomatic representation in Yugoslavia be appropriate, since the Belgrade leadership is making great efforts to localize the conflict around Gorazde and is urging the Bosnian Serb leadership to take constructive steps directed at halting the bloodshed in the town.
