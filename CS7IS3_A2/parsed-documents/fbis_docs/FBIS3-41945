"The state of missile installations is satisfactory. We are doing all we can and more to protect and safely store nuclear warheads and provide strategic forces with everything they need." He reports in a statement, released by the republic's Defense Ministry, that he visited a depot for nuclear warheads, removed from missiles, and says that the purpose of his mission was to impartially assess the state of nuclear sites. He notes that he checked all nuclear sites at the president's request and in line with a special program. "We have enough problems to resolve on the threshold of negotiations with Russia on these issues." He revealed plans for early talks with his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev to discuss a whole set of documents. "What's most important for Ukraine and Russia is eagerness to work hard toward nuclear disarmament," Radetskyy stressed, and warned against dramatizing the situation, as some journalists and politicians do. Meanwhile, the Commander of Ukraine's 43 Strategic Missile Troops Army Vladimir Migtyuk has admitted that "technical maintenance problems really exist." However, in his words, "there is no reason to lay it on thick." "Nuclear facilities are fully under control, he assured, we have all means for that." He dismissed as far- fetched attempts to draw a parallel to Chernobyl or anything else. The Ukrainian Air-Force Commander Valeriy Vasilyev has announced that the nuclear warheads on board strategic aircraft "are reliably protected." He refuted allegations that their condition was appalling. Colonel Valeriy Izmalkov, a member of the Parliamentary Commission on Defence and Security Affairs dismissed as "absolutely baseless" some foreign assertions that Ukraine will declassify the operative missile management codes in the coming months. In his words, these codes are not possible to declassify. Only U.S. and Russian Headquarters could re-target missiles after making essential calculations. "Ukraine is not ready for that," Izmalkov remarked.
