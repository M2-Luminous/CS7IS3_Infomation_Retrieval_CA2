This finding emerges from the latest STAR/MMR [Marketing and Media Research] survey, reflecting opinions expressed as recently as three weeks ago. The survey comes as a follow-up to the first phase poll, conducted three months ago, and published in THE STAR. There are still 17 percent of people who are undecided compared to about 19 percent three months ago. This adds up to almost four million voters who could hold the key to a two-thirds ANC majority. The "absolute majority" cut-off has emerged clearly as the main focus of the campaign -- all research indicates the ANC will win the election comfortably, but the question is by how much. Against this background the survey suggests that while interesting, subtle and important shifts have occurred in the intervening period, broad support-levels have not altered sufficiently to make dramatic changes -- as in a different overall outcome -- likely in the remaining weeks of the campaign. But percentages can still shift meaningfully, with important political spin-offs for power balances in the five-year transition period. The accompanying graph sets out MMR's estimates, within five percent ranges--ANC 59-64 percent, NP 16-21 percent, PAC 3-8 percent, FF 2-7 percent, DP 1-6 percent--of the likely performances by the five main political parties contesting next month's election. MMR's estimates -- which take into account other credible pre-election polls -- suggest the ANC is tantalisingly close to the two-thirds breakthrough at this stage, but that this remains a possibility rather than a probability. For this reason the closing stages of the election campaign take on a particular significance. A regrouping National Party [NP] could draw as much as 21 percent of the vote, indicating that it has no serious competitors for second place as the major partner in the new government. It is thought unlikely that any other parties will break the 10 percent barrier, but the estimates show that the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC], the Freedom Front [FF] and the Democratic Party [DP], all have the chance of achieving and surpassing five percent -- which, in terms of the Interim Constitution and arrangements for the transitional period would catapult them into a coalition Cabinet. The survey's extrapolations show, therefore, that the PAC's potential is higher than has been generally thought and the new factor, the Freedom Front, is also to be taken seriously. As is explained at the top of this page [see "How the poll works" passage below], many factors have been brought to bear by MMR in reaching what are "best informed guess" predictions. What will happen to the Inkatha Freedom Party's support, for example, is unpredictable. MMR calculates the "midpoint of range" election outcome predictions are as follows: - ANC, 62 percent. - NP, 19 percent. - PAC, 6 percent. - FF, 5 percent. - DP, 4 percent. The new poll points to a five percent loss of support by the ANC, with the NP being the main beneficiary. Indian voters in particular seem to be shifting, with the trend less marked among coloureds and black South Africans. Upper income voters are more likely to switch their allegiance to the NP than other voters. The ANC's supporters have stood firm, but the organisation has some male support. The ANC's appeal to women can probably be linked to its strong pro-female campaign, including speeches from Mandela. The NP is in a growth phase, attracting an increase of up to six percent in its support level. Many whites who said they were uncertain three months ago have thrown their lot with President de Klerk's party. The DP has remained largely static; it has make moderate gains among coloureds; but has lost white and Indian support. The PAC's messages is having some effect in black and coloured communities, in the 25 to 34 year-old age group. Before its formal decision to boycott the election, the IFP showed a one percent increase in voter support. Separate articles on this page spell out the other detailed findings of the survey. In the first survey 19 percent of people said they were undecided and 6 percent refused to name their choice. How the poll works The second phase of The Star-Marketing and Media Research (MMR) poll is comparable to the first in terms of the size and the methods used. A total of 2,590 people over 18 years old were interviewed face-to-face in their homes, in their chosen language, by trained Market Research Africa (MRA) interviewers. Areas representative of the whole of South Africa were chosen and random samples were then taken in these areas. This sample is representative of just under 90 percent of voters living in cities, towns and larger villages in South Africa. The survey excludes communities of fewer than 500 and, therefore, is not representative of the "deep" rural vote. The fieldwork for the second phase was carried out between February 9 and March 7, about three months after the first phase. The survey was designed and analysed by MMR, which will be happy to answer any queries about the reliability or significance of the findings. But remember this... Although the survey used scientific methods, and interviews were carried out by trained people and analysed by unbiased experts, factors outside their control could influence the final result of the election. Among these are: - When the first poll was carried out the Freedom Alliance, which included the IFP, had not decided definitely on whether or not to take part in the election. Since then IFP has refused, but the Freedom Front has decided to come in. - No one can accurately predict the voter turnout -- polls on this vary from 60 percent to 90 percent -- or spoilt papers. - Violence and intimidation. - Uncertainty in Natal. - The position of a party on the ballot paper. - The ability of rural voters to get to polling stations. - Voter education and party propaganda. - Coloured and Indian "swing" vote. - Processing of valid identity documents. - Survey sample error and the lie factor in answering questions. - Undecided voters. - Lack of accurate census figures. - Difficulty in predicting who, or if, those who support the IFP, CP [Conservative Party], Azapo [Azanian People's Organization], etc, will vote for. - Apathy or uninterest.
