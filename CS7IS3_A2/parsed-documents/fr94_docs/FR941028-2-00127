FR941028-2-00127 FR941028-2-00090 [Release No. 34&hyph;34880; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;44] Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Commencement of the Use of the New York Stock Exchange's Overnight Comparison System October 21, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 notice is hereby given that on October 17, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the Amex. On October 19, 1994, the Amex amended its proposal to exclude all references to equity transactions. 2 The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Letter from Ivonne L. Nagy, Special Counsel, Legal & Regulatory Policy Division, Amex, to Peter Geraghty, Senior Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (October 19, 1994). In the future, the Amex intends to file under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act a proposed rule change to permit it to use the New York Stock Exchange's Overnight Comparison System for the Amex equities transactions. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms and Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Amex to begin using the New York Stock Exchange's Overnight Comparison System (``OCS'') for all bond transactions executed at the Amex on and after October 21, 1994. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On October 21, 1994, the Amex will commence use of the New York Stock Exchange's OCS for the comparison of all Amex bond transactions executed at the Amex. Transactions in Amex equities and options will continue to be compared and processed through the Amex's Intra-Day Comparison System (``IDC''). The change from IDC to OCS for the comparison of all Amex bond transactions will have no impact on the efficiency and capacity of the electronic system. OCS will continue to deliver an automated, highly flexible, and efficient system for capturing, comparing, and processing bond trades as well as providing a greater measure of uniformity between the Amex and New York Stock Exchange marketplaces. Essentially, the same procedures presently in use for IDC will continue to apply to OCS. Specifically, the proposed rule change consists of amendments to Amex Rules 700(e), 3 719(b), 4 729, 5 and 731 6 and the rescission of Amex Rule 731A 7 to require Amex members on and after October 21, 1994, to submit initial trade data for transactions in listed bonds effected on the Amex through OCS for comparison. The proposal also will enable Amex members to resolve through OCS all uncompared transactions in listed bonds effected on the Amex for ``Regular Way,'' ``Next Day,'' and ``Seller Option'' settlement that are traded on an ``issued,'' ``when listed,'' and ``when distributed'' basis. Uncompared transactions that cannot be resolved on T+1 will be subject to close out. However, if a transaction remains in the system and both parties agree to the trade it will compare on T+2. In addition, OCS also will compare ``Ex-Clearing House'' bond transactions ( i.e. any transaction in which the buying and selling parties to the trade agree to physically settle the transaction between themselves) for ``Cash,'' ``Next-Day,'' and ``Seller's Option'' settlement. 3 Amex Rule 700(e) ``References and Definition of Securities Transactions.'' 4 Amex Rule 719(b) ``Next Day Comparison of Exchange Transactions.'' 5 Amex Rule 729 ``Comparison of Seller's Option Contracts and ``When Issued'' Special Contracts.'' 6 Amex Rule 731 ``Resolution of Uncompared Transactions.'' 7 Amex Rule 731A ``Resolution of Uncompared Bond Transactions.''
