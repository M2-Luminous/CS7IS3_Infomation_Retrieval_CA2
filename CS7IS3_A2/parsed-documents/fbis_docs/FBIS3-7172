As for their propaganda machines, including AFP and the French, Australian, and American radios, they have relayed the shouts in a shameless manner, showing their face as the undeniable propaganda apparatus of imperialists. While they barked that they had captured this or that village, they said that they had already postponed their military operations. Later, they claimed that they were continuing their offensives and that they were this or that far from Pailin. The general public asks: In the circumstances where the king father calls for an end to the war and the entire Cambodian nation and people abhor the battle, why do the communist Vietnamese continue to force their lackey Khieu Kanharit to bark repeatedly about the attack on the Pailin battlefield, and why do the alliance's propaganda machines tremblingly echo, in earnest, the shouts in complete contradiction of the truth? Because: 1. The communist Vietnamese and the alliance as well as their lackey puppets within the two-headed government need to bark sharply and (?lie) profusely in accordance with the tactics [word indistinct] employed in the time of Hitler to conceal their most shameful and utter defeat on the Anlung Veng battlefield. 2. They need to bark to prevent their troops from becoming further demoralized and to motivate them to further invade this or that area in line with their plan and policy to continue the Vietnamese war of aggression. 3. They need to bark to threaten the masses and people in Phnom Penh and provinces not to rise up against them with regard to the problems of land, Vietnamese nationals, wages, and corruption. All in all, their actions are a psychological war to fool their troops on the Pailin battlefield into going to war and to prevent the latter from breaking loose and ceasing to fight. Apparently, the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government have continued to live on by waging war. They need to launch the onslaughts on the Anlung Veng and Pailin battlefields to collect money from foreign warmongers who want Cambodians to get killed further. This is why they have painstakingly muffled such barks. In Phnom Penh, nobody can be trusted. The communist Vietnamese deceive the alliance; the alliance deceives the Vietnamese lackey puppets; and the Vietnamese lackey puppets deceive the two-headed government and glibly lie to the communist Vietnamese and the alliance. It is not known who deceives who and who lies to whom. So what is the truth behind this? It is that the invading forces of the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government are being surrounded by the people and National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], which have constantly attacked them everywhere, such as in the Battambang provincial town, Kamping Puoy, Thnoeng, Sdau, Treng, and along Route 10. As of 18 March, nine of their T-54 tanks have been blown up, and more than 300 of their troops have been killed and 400 others wounded. Apart from this, they have been afflicted with malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea, and many of them have died while many hundred others have been shipped to the rear. The event at the Anlung Veng battlefield is clear evidence. Moreover, the puppets and two-headed government, especially the communist Vietnamese, have already been aware that in 1985 and 1990, tens of thousands of troops from the genuine Vietnamese 330th, 309th, and 4th divisions and the puppet 4th and 196th divisions backed by nearly 100 tanks, multiple rocket launchers, and cannons could do nothing to Pailin. Now, with the untidy soldiers, illegitimate officers and generals, and Pol Sareoun always staying in an armored carrier, can they live long? This can be seen in broad daylight. Nevertheless, they need to launch such offensives only to save themselves from peril now and then.
