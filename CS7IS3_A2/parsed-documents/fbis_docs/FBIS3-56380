In the opinion of the conference's organizers -- the Russian-U.S. Human Rights Bureau, the "Memorial" human rights center, "Helsinki Watch," the "Civil Aid" committee, and other organizations -- over the past six months and particularly in connection with the October events the situation with regard to human rights compliance in Russia has deteriorated sharply. "We intend to express our concern at the present situation," the director of the Moscow branch of the Russian-U.S. Human Rights Bureau said, "and to bring to B. Clinton's notice specific instances of human rights violations." S. Ganushkina, cochairman of the "Civil Aid" committee, pointed out that, although Russia subscribed to the Geneva Convention on Refugees and adopted the Russian law on refugees in its spirit, it is fulfilling neither document. Refugees are virtually denied this status. In particular, refugees from the Caucasus and Central Asia end up in a grave situation. Ganushkina pointed out that they are being combated with all kinds of decrees, both covert and overt. The latest decision is to expel from hotels and hostels refugees who have already lived in Moscow for four years. As of 1 January this year they are obliged to pay the full cost of the room, which is totally impossible for the absolute majority -- sick people and pensioners. V. Abramkin, director of the Center To Promote Prison Reform in Russia, said: "There are now approximately 1 million prisoners in Russia. According to physicians' estimates, 100,000 prisoners are ill with tuberculosis, 20,000 of them in an acute form. There is insufficient meat, bread, and milk in the prisons and detention centers where they are held. There are many complaints about prisoners being beaten up and tortured. Prisons and detention centers in large cities are overflowing."
