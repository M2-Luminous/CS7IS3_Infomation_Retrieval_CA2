Fifty-seven thousand persons do not have a permanent residence permit. However, as V. Movsisyan, head of the state administration for refugee affairs, noted at a recent meeting at the National Academy of Sciences, although these people do not have citizenship or a defined status, they enjoy civil rights and freedom; 16,000 persons deported from Sumgait in 1988 have received apartments or built their own homes; 28,000 of those deported at a later date have a permanent residence permit; and 35,000 persons have been given land plots and participated in land privatization. There are numerous objective difficulties inherent in this sphere, which the republic authorities are striving to overcome.
