MK Binyamin Netanyahu told Juppe that the concept that every ethnic minority should have a state is dangerous for Europe even more than it is for Israel. That is why Likud is offering autonomy for the Palestinians. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the meeting was attended by MK's Moshe Qatzav, Eliyahu Ben-Elisar, and Tzahi Hanegbi.
