In an editorial on the recent occupations of the Belgian and German embassies and the Chilean consulate, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba stressed the only solution for the embassy occupiers, who number slightly more than 100 and want to travel to the United States, "is to unconditionally withdraw the same way they entered." The newspaper explains that the Cuban Government has guaranteed the German and Belgian Governments that the people involved in the incidents, except those charged with common crimes, will be granted immunity and returned to their homes. Recalling the various methods used by different U.S. Administrations to encourage desertions and proclaim "with noisy and loud publicity" the need to exterminate the "bad example" Cuba has set on the continent, the newspaper states there has been a recent intensification in the encouragement of illegal escapes and forceful embassy occupations. To foster these irresponsible actions, GRANMA adds, there has been a systematic denial of visas to individuals seeking immigration. Immigration agreements have been violated, and although legal obstacles are increasing, the coasts remain open for well publicized welcomes to individuals who survive the odyssey. Many people in Miami have made a profitable business out of trafficking humans, the newspaper states. If the purpose of this were truly humanitarian, the editorial states, it would suffice to grant visas to whomever has requested one, to ban illegal entries to U.S. territory, and to offer residency facilities. The newspaper states, however, that it is "a matter of a promised land that is not granted unless a person risks his life." This is the case of the people who are occupying the three missions, the newspaper says, explaining that among the guests at the Belgian Embassy are 25 children, among them the youngest "political refugee" on earth because he is only a few months old. Also in the group are 25 individuals prosecuted for common crimes, 34 who have been issued repeated warnings for markedly antisocial behavior, and 46 have returned to their homes. The newspaper describes as "much more serious" the fact that the alleged refugees, who have occupied the Belgian ambassador's residence, have used it to establish an alleged organization, distribute propaganda, and put up posters. The newspaper adds: "We must remember embassies cannot be used as centers of political activities against their host countries because to do so would violate the functions for which they are accredited." GRANMA states the Belgian Foreign Ministry has acted responsibly by instructing its ambassador to inform his guests of the illegality of their action. We are respectful of every individuals' right to live wherever he chooses, but we cannot allow ourselves to be taken in by allowing embassies to classify simple immigrants under nonexistent categories for personal, familiar, or economic reasons or simply to seek an adventure, the newspaper stated, adding "this just goes too far." It would be easy to clear the way for those who decide to occupy embassies, adds the newspaper, which then asks the question, "Who would be harmed by that? Who would be at the mercy of any intruder seeking the immunity of an embassy's territory for the purpose of migrating?" GRANMA also asks what the position of the governments of these countries would be if the Haitians, who are now being repatriated en masse, chose instead to break into their embassies or if the Mexican wetbacks chose to jump the fences of European or Latin American embassies in Mexico City instead of risking their lives on the border? Cuba, the newspaper maintains, is responsible for protecting the embassies and is duty bound to safeguard the immunity and inviolateness of their territories and will honor this commitment to the letter. The best guarantee for those who represent their countries in Cuba, the editorial states, is that the experience of three decades of resisting blackmail, a blockade, and direct and indirect aggressions has taught us we cannot yield 1 inch. A principle surrendered is a principle lost, the newspaper states. The newspaper asks other questions, including: What do they expect? The beginning of a new style of obtaining documents in Cuba to enter a country, different from existing methods in other capitals? Is it an effort to artificially create a political situation for purposes suspiciously similar to those with which the United States has been unsuccessful? Was it an effort to taint the atmosphere surrounding our country during the recently concluded Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias? After stressing Cuba will not tolerate pressures regardless of from where they may come, GRANMA confirmed the Cuban Foreign Ministry is totally willing to cooperate with accredited diplomatic missions to sensibly resolve their problem and even to prevent future difficulties.
