He was referring to the statement made by Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar at the Wednesday [2 February] meeting of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), of which he is chairman, announcing protective measures against imports even from the Czech Republic. Ducky said the intention was to protect the Slovak currency. The instability of the Slovak crown could cause problems with the exchange of goods. He stressed there was no contradiction between Meciar's statement and his own participation in talks on trade liberalisation. The individual partners of the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) do not agree on the timing of steps towards liberalisation. While Slovakia and the Czech Republic are progressing towards it, Poland and Hungary are moving "more slowly," he said. Ducky said the idea of expanding CEFTA, possibly by the inclusion of Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania, was good because, given the competition, the free trade zone needed about 200 million people. The present CEFTA countries have a total population of 65 million. The reason why mutual trade within CEFTA was developing only slowly was the fact that the member states were first of all attempting to try out independent policies, he explained. What is more, since their economies were all bogged down with heavy industry, the countries experienced the same shortages and surpluses.
