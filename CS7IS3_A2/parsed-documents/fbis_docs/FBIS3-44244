On the line is the South African director of foreign affairs, Mr. Rusty Evans. [Begin recording] [Evans] We had the opportunity yesterday in Gaborone to be briefed by two ministers of the ... [pauses] the deputy prime minister and the minister from the Lesotho Government. There was consensus among the heads of state present in Gaborone yesterday, that it would be helpful, at the request of the Lesotho Government, if a group of people could take it upon themselves to liaise very closely with all the parties concerned in Lesotho, with a view to, A, getting a very clear picture as to what the prevailing circumstances are, and B, to make a recommendation to government in the region as to what action might be called for or might be helpful to resolve any differences that still exist down there. [Reporter] So the team, actually, who goes down will then report back to the various presidents of the Frontline States? [Evans] In fact there is an arrangement whereby there will be a ministerial meeting in Pretoria on Monday. This has already been scheduled. The foreign ministers of the three countries concerned, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, will be meeting on Monday and the task group will be reporting to those ministers here in Pretoria. [Barker] But there is a chance that there could be a military presence from the Frontline States that you have just mentioned, if it does not work out? [Evans] I should imagine that, that's a conceivable option but at this stage I think it's a little premature, frankly. I think that one should allow the task group to do their work. They are professional people. They are diplomats and very senior personnel from the respective ministries of Foreign Affairs and the Departments of Defense of the three countries. The problem in Lesotho is essentially a military problem, so you know, it's necessary to have military expertise in a group of that nature. [end recording]
