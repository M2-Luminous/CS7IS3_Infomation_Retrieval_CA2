Taxpayer! Here Is a Package for You. It Is Hard To Resist Reporting on the Package of Edicts Recently Signed by the Russian President"] [Text] They presuppose the following: 1. The abolition of quotas and licenses for export shipments by all enterprises, as well as concessions on export duties in addition to those laid down by Russian legislation (naturally this does not apply to interstate agreements concluded previously). 2. The government's submission to the Federal Assembly of draft laws reducing the number of taxes, lowering the rates of basic taxes -- profits and value-added tax -- by 10-20 percent, and prescribing preferential taxation for enterprises involving foreign capital employed exclusively in the production sphere. What is more, there are to be changes in the taxation of individuals. 3. The creation of "state-funded" enterprises, in other words enterprises whose leaders have limited rights but bear full personal responsibility for the activity of the enterprises in their charge. In this connection there will no longer be federal enterprises in full state ownership, while those already created will either be eliminated or turned into "state-funded houses." Production units which are ineffectually managed and not liable to privatization will provide an additional base for the creation of "state-funded enterprises." 4. The establishment of chronological reporting [kalendarnaya otchetnost] on payments from enterprises' current payment accounts and the creation of a federal bills of exchange chamber. 5. The introduction of strict responsibility for tax evaders: The first violation incurs a heavy fine, the second results in the elimination of the enterprise. The adopted edicts may quite easily be regarded as a step toward administrative control of the economy. But has anyone said that Russia does not need those kind of steps? Triumphant privatization reports do of course provide inspiration for fresh achievements. However, state enterprises also produce output and, incidentally, workers at these enterprises have the worst social protection of all, creating a heightened danger of strikes in the state sector. State-funded enterprises may elicit bad associations with Stalinist methods of managing industry. But there must nevertheless be a clear distinction between concerns and corporations that have, as a result of privatization, legalized the position of monopolized feudal estates and state enterprises. The latter should come under tight state control. That is the reality of a mixed economy. The president's edicts on the whole give rise to the sense of attempting to cut the Gordian knot of Russian economic management with albeit several blows. Whether good, bad, or mediocre, clear and comprehensible rules of play have to be established some day. The tax situation is abnormal -- so here is legislation which precludes supplementary interpretation and here are punitive measures to be applied against those who do not give a damn about it. I must particularly point out that tough measures are being taken against taxpayers at the same time as guarantees of an improvement in the tax climate (although it is of course better for there to be an improvement first and then tough measures). There is a problem involved in granting export concessions, quotas, and licenses with unclear regulations that permit heaps of violations -- all three should be abolished (I think that certain countries that live off reexporting Russian resources are becoming somewhat jumpy). There is an interesting aspect to the problem of payment defaults: A debtor's ruble account is empty but his hard-currency account is full. There may be a solution: In that situation the hard currency should be immediately converted and the debts paid.... I would very much like to write the words "and so on," but that is regrettably where the adopted measures stop.
