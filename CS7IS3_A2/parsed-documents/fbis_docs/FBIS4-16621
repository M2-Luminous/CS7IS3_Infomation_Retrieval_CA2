It will be half the size of the previous parliament and will work on a permanent professional basis. The MP's, who have won their mandates during the 7 March elections, are to decide some organisational questions first, particularly the structural pattern of the parliament. They are also to elect their speaker. Then the parliament will go over to the endorsement of the agenda and to the discussion of the items included in it. But this may prove to be a difficult job. Several parties and public movements of the republic have declared that they would join the opposition against the present executive authorities. And if the MP's, sharing their views, decide to form their own blocs, the Supreme Soviet will hardly be able to avoid an acute factional struggle for power from the very outset. The MP's will also be influenced by the situation around parliament house. More than 300 veterans of war and labor, invalids, and representatives of work collectives are picketing it from early morning today. They demand better living conditions, steps to curb the inflation and growing prices. A large meeting began there a short while ago. Its participants are protesting against the government's economic and social policy, which has placed many people far below the poverty line.
