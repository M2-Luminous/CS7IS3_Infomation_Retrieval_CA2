Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Sri Lankans are all flocking into the City of Angels to buy their way to the land of the rising sun, a South Asian diplomat said. Bangkok is a popular transit point for the would-be immigrants to gather the know-how, material and connections required to bluff their way through Japan's ever-tightening screening procedures and immigration laws. Hundreds of these South Asians leave here armed with fake or tampered passports, forged immigration papers and dreams of wealth. Rackets are run by organized gangs who charge the eager job- seekers fees amounting to a couple of thousand dollars. With opportunities drying up and salaries not what they used to be in the Gulf, Japan is now emerging as the new mecca for the illegal immigrants. The scam involves forging passports, Japanese visas and work permits and even crash courses in Japanese, according to some reports. Of course, the rates rise considerably for each 'extra' service. Some clients opt to fly to a third country and then enter Japan in the hope of avoiding the extra scrutiny by Japanese immigration officials reserved for residents of some countries. Clients are put up in Bangkok hotels and houses owned by the agents and are looked after till all arrangements are completed for their departure. "Once in Japan, finding work is easy. Construction sites and small factories are our best bet. "The hitch is that for the duration of our stay there we have to remain on the site. No contact with people outside is possible," said a Tamilian who refused to say if he was Indian or Sri Lankan. "I have set myself a target and hope to achieve it within a year. We have to make a lot of sacrifices, but it's worth it," he said. Then, how do these people get out once they've achieved their goal? "It's really simple. We just come out into the open and within a week were are arrested as illegal immigrants. The good thing with the Japanese is that they deport us as soon as they can, avoiding lengthy jail terms," said another first-timer. "Most first-timers go the way we are going. It's only after a person has made some money that they come back and use the agents to get them fresh documents since they've been blacklisted in Japan," said Mohan [as published]. The Thai police arrested a number of potential immigrants from India and Sri Lanka as the group waited at a Bangkok residence prior to boarding a flight for a third country. Most of the arrested Indians were from Punjab. Recently, six Sri Lankans believed to be part of a gang counterfeiting passports after illegally entering Thailand were arrested in their hotel rooms in Bangkok, the Tourist Police said. Two Singaporean, five Dutch and six Sri Lankan fake passports were found. Police said the Dutch and Singaporean passports sold for US$8,000 while the Sri Lankan documents fetched up to US$4,000. The clients were mainly Sri Lankan's wishing to travel to the United States, France or Japan, according to news reports. Another sophisticated method employed by the agents is through the substitution of the original photographs on genuine Indian passports carrying proper Japanese visas with mug-shots of the clients. The original passports fetch between US$1,200 and US$4,000 depending on the expiry date, the amount the original owner has travelled and a number of other factors which help in authenticating the new owner. Sources in the business claim that an average of 200 Indian passports are lost each month. The migrants who sell their passports then reportedly approach the Indian mission in Bangkok for a replacement, claiming that they have lost them. Passports for sale are "prepared" for a wide range of age groups and are carefully selected and scrutinized to match the needs of the clients. A few years ago, the Thai police with the help of Interpol officials from India raided several of these fake passport outlets in Bangkok's Phahurat district. At that time the agents were sending clients to what used to be West Germany on specially chartered flights through the former East Germany. The immigrants disembarking in East Berlin would make their way to West Berlin using their fake papers to get away as "legal immigrants". Following the reunification of Germany, Poland, Hungary and Russia became the new European transit points. But, now with the stringent screening measures adopted for asylum seekers to Germany and the strict vigil on all her borders, this operation has become extremely risky and unviable. Besides, immigrants from developing nations all over Asia are discovering that Japan offers much better returns, dollarwise, for the same investment in agents and the risk of getting caught and deported. Japan currently has an estimated 500,000 illegal immigrants from the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. However, South Asians, along with illegals from Iran, Afghanistan and other Third World nations are now joining the immigration queues at Japanese airports in their quest for quick money.
