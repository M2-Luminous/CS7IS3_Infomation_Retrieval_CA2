Later in his visit, Cao Shuangming plans to visit the Gagarin air force academy and the Sukhoi experimental design bureau. The Chinese commander will visit Volgograd and St. Petersburg in addition to spending two days in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, where the Russian air force has an exclusive resort. Military experts say that Russia's and China's military departments have normal business-like ties. They have an agreement on cooperation, which aims to ensure the security of the two countries and strengthen peace in the Asia-Pacific region. The document, in particular, envisages mutual visits, including by the commanding staff. This April, head of the General Staff of the Russian army, Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov, went to China on an official visit. It is envisaged that, by the end of 1994, seven Chinese military delegations of different levels will have visited Russia. The Chinese military is especially interested in Russian aerospace technology. Russia recently sold China some Su-27 fighter planes, and additional shipments are under consideration. China is interested in obtaining a license to produce the Su-27, and has initiated negotiations on what conditions such a deal should include.
