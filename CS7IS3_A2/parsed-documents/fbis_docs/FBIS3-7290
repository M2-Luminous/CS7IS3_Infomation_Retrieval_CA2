Security Council (UNSC). In its political platform for fiscal 1994, the DSP declared it would push for permanent membership in the 15-member council as well as give its wholehearted support to U.N. operations, including peacekeeping activities. The DSP also called for amendments in the Self-Defense Forces Law to institutionalize the SDF's contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations as its main or sub-main task. The platform will be formalized at a party convention in April, party officials said.
