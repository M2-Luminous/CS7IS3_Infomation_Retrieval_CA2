FBIS4-24186 "drafr123_e_94006" FBIS-AFR-94-123 Daily Report 25 Jun 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Court Orders Police To Produce Abiola Court Orders Police To Produce Abiola AB2506201294 Dakar PANA in English 1236 GMT 25 Jun 94 AB2506201294 Dakar PANA English BFN [Text] Lagos, 25 June (PANA) -- A Nigerian federal high court in Lagos on Friday [24 June] ordered the Nigerian police to produce detained millionaire politician, Moshood Abiola on Thursday. [sentence as received] The order by Justice Tajudeen Odunowo on the police inspector-general, Ibrahim Coomassie, followed an application by lawyer Kolawole Ajayi on behalf of Abiola. The judge fixed hearing on the application on the same day, Thursday, after he rejected Ajayi's plea to discharge Abiola from police custody. Another Lagos federal high court is expected Monday to begin hearing yet another suit by Abiola challenging his arrest and detention on 23 June. The suit was filed by Lagos lawyer, Gani Fawehinhmi, who told the court that Abiola's arrest was unconstitutional and a breach of his fundamental human rights. Pro-democracy groups in Nigeria, including the National Democratic Coalition and the Campaign for Democracy, which are leading the campaign for the military to surrender power to Abiola, have protested the arrest of the millionaire, who claimed victory in Nigeria's 12 June 1993 election, which was annulled by the country's military. Meanwhile, there were indications that Abiola, who reportedly proclaimed himself president of Nigeria on 11 June, could go on trial either in Lagos or Abuja, next week. But in an interview with PANA on Saturday, the deputy inspector- general of police operations, Nuhu Aliyu, declined to confirm the report, but said that the police were trying to ensure law and order throughout the country. Aliyu said the police would tighten security against those he called "paid thugs," who may try to cause a breach of public peace. Apart from reported scattered protests in Lagos, especially in Ikeja, near Abiola's residence, north of Lagos, on Thursday and Friday, no major incidents were reported in the country.
