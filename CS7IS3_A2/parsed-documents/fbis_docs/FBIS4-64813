Political analyst I.K. Pretenderis wrote in the 31 March Athens weekly magazine OIKONOMIKOS TAKHTDRHOMOS that two different views of the presidency are taking shape. One view holds that it would be "natural" for a dominant political personality like Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to become president at the end of President Konstandinos Karamanlis' term, whereas another holds that the president ought to be apolitical. According to Pretenderis, both views have merit. On the one hand, the election of a party leader would undoubtedly risk creating a "president of half of the Greeks," but a president's resonance also stems from the majority he receives or the party from which he originates. These considerations notwithstanding, it is generally believed that the context of the presidential elections will become clear only after procedures are launched in the spring of 1995. A view of the future will be provided in the June European Parliament elections and the fall municipal contest, which will reveal the balance of the political forces. If the government majority scores successes in both elections, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) will enjoy more freedom of action in 1995: Papandreou could argue that even if new parliamentary elections become necessary--if he were unable to acquire the 180 votes from members of Parliament required for the presidency--he would still be strong enough to be elected president. However, if PASOK loses ground in the two contests, a recourse to parliamentary elections could be risky, Pretenderis contends. Even if the New Democracy (ND) and its leader, Miltiadhis Evert, were counting on the worsening economic climate to deny Papandreou a free hand in the presidential elections, they would not consider a Papandreou presidency a disaster, for with the prime minister out of the way and a "post-Papandreou" PASOK in power in 1997--when new parliamentary elections are due--the ND could handily score a victory. However, if it is in Evert's interest to have Papandreou as president, provided the ND does not vote for him, Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras should follow a different policy, Pretenderis continues. If he were to throw his party's support to Papandreou and thus avoid parliamentary elections, Samaras could claim a place in the government as his reward. While such a Samaras move would benefit Papandreou the most, another winner is Evert himself, inasmuch as an alliance between Political Spring and PASOK would push the former out of the center-right area and restore ND's unity. In Pretenderis' view, this analysis of the situation emphasizes the "serious arguments" for a Papandreou presidency, less because the prime minister seeks it than because all the others may desire it. Writing in the 10 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, regular contributor Stamos Zoulas weighs Papandreou's chances to reach the presidency. To succeed, the prime minister must do one of the following: - Secure the votes of Political Spring and the Communist Party (KKE) to reach the required 180 votes. - Attempt a redistribution of parliamentary seats by either canceling results or repeating contests to make only KKE votes necessary. - Declare early elections under a different electoral system that would give PASOK more than 180 seats. - Risk dissolving the Chamber of Deputies because of its inability to elect a president, at which time the next Parliament could elect him with only 151 votes, as required by the Constitution. In Zoulas' view, the first version is obviously the most desirable one, while the others are riskier. They are nonetheless alternative solutions if indeed Papandreou truly intends to seek the presidency. A number of scenarios about the "post-Papandreou" era are being drawn in case the prime minister decides to run for the presidency, writes Yiorgos Karelias in the 15 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA. For instance, Papandreou himself would settle the succession before launching his presidential campaign. As the incumbent prime minister, he would have the authority to approve a successor beyond the circle of his rumored "heirs-apparent" such as Chamber of Deputies President Apostolos Kaklamanis or Minister to the Prime Minister Anastasios Peponis. Another scenario envisions Papandreou distancing himself from the succession issue, allowing the party to be rent by rivalries that only an extraordinary party congress could settle. The solution would then be provided by the "historical leadership," in this case the various "heirs-apparent." In a third scenario, an extraordinary and forward-looking congress would vote "with an eye to the future" and provide a "third solution" by electing a member of the "new generation." Since the last scenario is the "most logical," Karelias concludes, it is also the least liklely to occur.
