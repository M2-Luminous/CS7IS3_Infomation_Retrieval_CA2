He has dinner with the pope; takes notes in German; writes books in Polish; and likes Father Giussani and Julia Roberts. The following is an unauthorized biography of the philosopher who wants to lead the DC. With his natural immodesty, he has defined himself as "the number one assistant of Professor Wojtyla." In other words, the most authentic exponent and interpreter of the philosophical ideas of John Paul II. All the other labels are too narrow for Rocco Buttiglione. It is probably true, however, that he is a philosopher, a political scientist, the former ideologist of the Communion and Liberation [CL] movement, the favorite disciple of Augusto Del Noce, and the intellectual who is adapted to politics, and perhaps many other things, too--but all this is as nothing compared to the friendship and esteem of the pope, who in fact appears to have accorded high praise to Buttiglione's book Il pensiero filosofico di Karol Wojtyla [The Philosophical Ideas of Karol Wojtyla]. The pope has accordingly transfigured Buttiglione into a kind of intellectual super partes who stands aloof from the worldly matters in which, however, he is actually immersed 18 hours a day. It is a continuing contradiction for Buttiglione who moves with the ease and frustrated ingenuousness of a man of culture in the environment of dramatic practicality that characterizes DC headquarters on the Piazza del Gesu [headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party] in Rome where Buttiglione has been installed as chairman of the Ethics Committee for the reform of the party. Now, however, he is a candidate for party secretary of the post-Martinazzoli period. But that is the way it is: in Italy, today, it is the turn of the professors. They have the task of rebuilding everything that the others have devastated as barbarians. It is the day of the Ciampis, of the Cacciaris, of the Demattes. These are all people who prefer the bicycle to the off-road vehicle. They are intellectuals who do not pale at the name of a poet or philosopher. Who is not daunted by the Germanophile encyclopedism of Franco Tato, the new managing director of Fininvest?, or when reading the mile-long resume of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi? Whether these gentlemen now know how to be administrators is another question. Buttiglione fits perfectly into this pantheon. Although born in Gallipoli, Apulia, he represents the most severe challenge to the old southern DC. Remember Ciriaco De Mita and the court of miracles of Nusco, that irresolute Italian who seemed perpetually to be down with a cold? And who has forgotten the histrionic speech mannerisms of Paolo Cirino Pomicino, or the variegated crowd of lovers and bagmen that surrounded him, or Claila, the boat of the provincial Onassis that was berthed in the Naples sun? Buttiglione is light years distant from that stereotype. A few details will help us to understand. In addition to English and French, the professor speaks German and Polish. He is the author of an impressive number of books, articles, and essays. Then there is the oleography [as published]: he takes notes in German (which for him is like a mother tongue). He also gives orders in German to Teo, his huge German shepherd (the name is engraved on the dog's collar), which he personally takes out for walks and treats him as his toy. The Meeting With Wojtyla The thickest part of his biography, however, is the one that involves the Polish language. Buttiglione learned Polish by reading the pope's books in the original version and by fraternizing with the Catholic intellectuals of Krakow. A priest from Romagna who was associated with the Communion and Liberation movement, Don Francesco Ricci, introduced him during the 1970's into the ecclesiastic circles of Krakow. Don Ricci was director of the Center for Eastern European Studies and was in close contact with Polish anti-Communist circles. During that period, Buttiglione collaborated with a publishing house that was close to CL--Jaca Book--which had a series dedicated precisely to the countries of real socialism. Don Ricci one day brought the brilliant intellectual to Krakow and introduced him to the then-Bishop Karol Wojtyla. When Wojtyla became pope, he brought Don Stanislao Dsziwisz to Rome as his private secretary, and Don Stanislao summoned Buttiglione to the Vatican on instructions from John Paul II. This began a relationship that has never been interrupted. Rocco's interest in the Church, moreover, is shared by his family: his two sisters--Angela and Marina--are both Vaticanists, working respectively for TG-1 [TV Channel 1 news] and TG-5. There is even an antipope in the family: the mother-in-law, Caterina Jacobelli, a theologian of the dissidence. But Rocco is something more than that--indeed, much more than that--on the other side of the Tiber. Recently, too, when the the encyclicals Veritatis splendor and Centesimus annus were being written, Buttiglione was at the pope's side. In particular, the 45-year-old philosopher from Gallipoli wrote the most important chapter of Centesimus annus--the chapter that deals with the changes in East Europe, the end of real socialism, and the advent of a new era. Very well, but what is the nature of this new era? Here is where Buttiglione emerges from limbo and the chorus of angels and plays his ace--the Church's social doctrine--which is a manual for the kind of civil coexistence that has been dear to the pope's heart ever since the 1980's and that has been forgotten by Catholics who have devoted themselves to politics, notably the Christian Democrats. Indeed, the social doctrine was disregarded to such an extent that the content was lost. Many Catholics pay the doctrine lip service, and some quote it (usually inopportunely) in speeches at the party congresses, explaining that it is the visionary third way--the evangelical alternative to savage capitalism and ferocious Marxism. God, Municipality, and Family Buttiglione, on the other hand, knows by memory the basic concepts of the doctrine, and accordingly promises miracles. The key passage calls for the application of the principle of subsidiariness, whereby each level of the social pyramid should be self-sufficient and should request help from the next higher level only in case of necessity. But the levels of the social pyramid that have been designed by the pope's philosopher also seem strange. First of all, there is the family, and then by successive levels one finally reaches God. In synthesis, it is a triad of values: God, municipality, and family. In fact, Buttiglione counters the federalism of Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Miglio--and its many microregions--with the concept of a nation of regions, parishes, and villages [campanili], as taught by Catholic tradition, which is anti-Piedmont and localist. Is it a credible plan, or an indigestible mix [preceding word in English]? Buttiglione constructed this table of values by adding up and blending various formative experiences which--as an intellectual enamored more of himself than of anything else--he subsequently surpassed and put aside. The first of these formative experiences was his discovery--as a young man--of Communion and Liberation, through a priest from Catania, Don Ciccio Ventorino. Buttiglione was impressed by the importance that Don Luigi Giussani, CL's founder, placed on the evangelical phrase "whosoever follows me shall have a hundredfold here below and eternal life." The young Buttiglione was fascinated by the "hundred-fold" concept--by the challenge posed by this kind of Christianity that deals with everyday life and aspires to redeem it. Along the way, Buttiglione also made the acquaintance of Augusto Del Noce, one of the most recent active Catholic thinkers. Del Noce was the only Catholic thinker in this century to attempt a Catholic reinterpretation of history, following the example of the great reactionaries and enemies of the modernism of the 1980's, from Joseph De Maistre to Monaldo Leopardi. In Del Noce's opinion, the right-left classification must be replaced by the sacred-profane classification. By completing CL's anthropology, Del Noce's example gave Buttiglione the ideological framework that he lacked, and Buttiglione expressed his gratitude whenever he could. Every so often the master would ask him to supply quotations from Hegel, to which the disciple responded immediately--from memory, and in German. One thing is sure. Del Noce, Don Giussani, and Don Ricci were Buttiglione's three principal teachers, but over time things changed. Don Ricci and Del Noce died, and relations with Don Giussani soured. Meanwhile, however, relations were developed with other sponsors [preceding word in English]: the Vatican and--beginning in the mid-1980's--certain intellectuals in the United States. The latter included Michael Novak and George Weigel--sociologists and theorists of Catholic capitalism--and subsequently a series of bishops and cardinals, including John O'Connor of New York and Joseph Bernardin of Chicago (who became famous worldwide because of the accusations of pedophilia). They are the right wing of the U.S Church. The triad of God, fatherland, and family is once again with us. Buttiglione is at his ease on the other side of the ocean because--among other things--his foothold in the United Sgates gives him the dimension that he had lacked, namely internationalization: a gift that only a few of the saints had ubiquitousness. To those who point out that his appearances at Teramo--where he teaches political philosophy--have become less frequent, he responds in a truly baronial manner. "If I give lectures in New York and Rio de Janeiro, in Buenos Aires and Washington," he says, "it is because they invite me, and this does no harm to the university where I teach, but in fact enhances its prestige." It is the culture of the visiting professor [preceding two words in English]. "It's A Pity He Is Naive" And as a visiting professor, Buttiglione will speak a few words of charitable common sense to anyone in the decomposing universe of Catholic power who asks him to do so. They all want him to speak; they all revere him as if he were an icon. For that reason they are running him as a candidate for the most unlikely posts: mayor of Rome (but he does not reside there); editor of the moribund Catholic weekly IL SABATO; and editor of the daily L'AVVENIRE. It is quite true that it costs nothing to promise that which no longer exists. This includes the ethics of the DC, which he is has been asked to reorganize, given the fact that for every meeting the party holds, the judiciary responds with an average of five arrests--a little too much to be allowed to continue. "He is naive," the Catholic writer and journalist Vittorio Messori told L'EUROPEO. "He is unable to recognize the bait put out by the media, and that is why his interviews and statements sometimes appear to be stupid. I hold him in high esteem, however." Will the professor who does not know how to avoid the traps set by the journalists be able to avoid the entanglements of politics? Will he be the savior of a DC that is in the process of liquidation? "If they offer me the position of secretary, I shall accept it," Buttiglione answers, with the typical terseness of someone who is at the head of his class. "He will lose," Messori says. "When there is a revolution, it is fought between Girondists and Jacobins. No one remains in the center. But one day Thermidor [Robespierre's overthrow] will come, and Buttiglione will be revalued." Be that as it may, Buttiglione does have one merit by comparison with Martinazzoli: he is good-humored and whimsical. A small example? Two years ago, he saw (in the original language, of course) the film Pretty Woman, featuring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and he was profoundly impressed by it. He accordingly went to the store, bought the videocassette, and gave it to his three daughters, praising the film's "highly educational content for the younger generations." For those who have never seen it, Pretty Woman is the story of a prostitute who falls in love with one of her clients.
