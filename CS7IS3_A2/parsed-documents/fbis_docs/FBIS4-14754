"We have just conducted cleansing of the party from temporary people who entered the party to satisfy their private ambitions," he noted. Vengerovskiy called assertions stating that the LDPR turns into the party of one man as groundless. In his opinion, it is necessary to strengthen the role of the party's chairman "because the party is on the way to power." To this effect the authorities granted to Zhirinovskiy are not excessive ones because under the present situation in Russia they are necessary for the party's survival, said Vengerovskiy. Vengerovskiy who has just returned from a trip throughout the former Yugoslavia declared that the present policy of the Russian Foreign Ministry does not meet interests of the country. "We commit a betrayal with respect to the fraternal Serbian people who are experiencing different forms of genocide," said he. In his opinion, western special services and those who would like to make the Balkans the zone of their century long influence are waging the war on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. He said that "the most terrible fact is that Russia supports the sanctions against the Serbs." Vengerovskiy believes that Moscow should strictly occupy the positions of the Serbs and recognize the republic of Serb Krajina. Vengerovsky qualifies Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program as "a national betrayal of the country."
