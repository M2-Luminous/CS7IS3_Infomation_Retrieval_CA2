The county party committee secretary Du Shuiyuan [2629 3055 3293] told me that Huangtugang is considered a poor town in Zhangshu City and Yichun Prefecture, but compared to the rest of the county, Huxia Village is average in development. On the days I was there, it was in the midst of the pig-slaughtering season, but it was quiet everywhere. I was told by the villager that it is easier to go to town to buy pork than to raise pigs. Villager Zou Liuya [6760 2696 5370] has a family of four. They only eat meat at New Years and on special occasions. On the day I visited, his house was filled with the aroma of meat cooking. He uncovered the piping-hot pan and said, "This is someone's dead pig. It died of some disease and was buried. I just dug it up." He said it is the luck of the poor--they can eat anything and will never get sick from it. How many in Huxia are living like Zou Liuya? The villagers say things are much better for the last decade or so. Prior to 1977, Menghe River which passes through the village overflew almost every year, and in bad years, one could earn only a few cents for full-time work. But two things have changed things around. In 1977, massive water conservancy and capital construction work was undertaken. Back then, Qingjiang County (renamed Zhangshu County in October 1988) made a vigorous effort to straighten out Menghe River and built a large dam, radically solving the flood problem. Secondly, after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, family-based farm allotment was implemented, which at last gave the people enough to eat and to keep warm. But a decade later, Huxia village's people are still just "fed and warm" but have made no further progress. There has been no increase in farmland, but population has increased and the labor force has increased. Huxia's village party committee estimated that of the village's 633 workers, at least one-third are surplus and the other two-thirds are farm workers who "toil half a year and sit idle half a year." Can any village absorb a labor force nearly half of which is idle? After land was alloted to individual households, the tractors and other machinery and equipment owned by the original collectives were sold. Every family, no matter how poor, now keep oxen, and people keep to the old traditional farming methods and mix of crops. Besides a small amount of rearing and breeding (a fish pond, 60-some pigs, and 50-odd cattle) and the three families that make sugar (and brew rice wine at the same time), there is no other sideline production. At one time, people grew fruit trees on a fairly large scale, but because of theft, damages, and mismanagement, they failed. It is fair to say that the land has reached beyond its limits. Huangtugang town has a labor force of 11,900 but only 13 township enterprises of different sizes which can only accommodate a little more than 2,000 people. More than half of the town's surplus workers are working out of town. Because of uneven regional economic development and various limitations in the township enterprises, it is not likely that the town can absorb more of the rural surplus labor in the near future so that the people can leave the land without leaving their homes. To Huxia village, poverty is not only a consequence, it is also the cause of deterioration in the community. Standing on the river bank, one can see the pigs and the cows boldly munching on rape and the vegetables. Rats run amuck in the village. But from the county party committee secretary to the average villagers, they all tell me that one of the reasons they cannot destroy the rats is that people may use killing rats as an excuse to settle private scores and poison their neighbors' chickens and ducks. Even worse are the high cost of getting married, the concept of freedom of love and marriage, and the closed community life. Since 1982, Huxia village have ignored a thousand-year-old taboo and have allowed marriages within the same clan and between families of the same surname. This trend has taken off, and since 1982, 15 young couples have married. What will happen in the future? What will be the consequences? Enterprises' Broken Dreams--by reporter Mao Hao [3029 3185] Once Guozi village's 28-year-old Mayor Bo asked me, "Is a place without mountains, without water, and without roads like ours doomed to be poor forever?" This question sums up the concern shared by every person in the hilly countries which make up more than 60 percent of Sichuan's total area. Actually I have learned in Guangan that like the rest of the country, there have been several rounds of township enterprise craze here, but they failed every time, leaving many unfinished projects with very few benefits. I checked Hengsheng town's enterprise list and discovered that most are brick factories and breweries. Only this kind of enterprises that requires little investment and can sell their products locally can survive. The town party committee's secretary Jiang was talking on the town government's only local battery telephone while telling me that, "In the past, occasionally someone would think about opening a plant here, but after they looked at the communications system and the roads, and they looked at the food and lodgings here, they left. Today, we are doing work of the 1990's but using equipment of the 1950's." Hengsheng holds an open-air market three times a week, and on market day, villagers from Guozi village will come to town early in the morning, carrying their goods in baskets at the ends of their bamboo poles and walking for an hour (the highway is not finished). Prior to 1989, this was their only source of sideline income. The development of Hengsheng's country market is very incongruent with its population of 36,000, and its service industry especially is out of step. In the beginning I wondered why the vegetables in the restaurants in the rural towns are more expensive than that in the county towns. Later I learned that people here still have the habit of eating only what is in season. If cabbage is in season, everybody eats cabbage, and if turnips are in season, everybody eats turnips, and if you want something different, you will have to go out to buy it, which naturally will cost more. A noodle shop owner complained, "It is hard to take precious money from the villagers' pockets!" Thus, Hengsheng town which is so close to the highway and could have made some money from the travelers is losing out; the townspeople would rather spend a few more hours on the road to get back to town even late at night. Last year, Mayor Bo was all ambitious about opening a noodle factory to fill the vacuum, because Guozi village had no enterprise. But after looking around, he was completely discouraged. Guozi village has a poor transportation system; its products can only be sold in nearby localities, but the neigboring localities have a rich tradition of being self-sufficient and have little purchasing power anyway, so who is going to buy their noodles? This is a vicious cycle. They are poor, and so they cannot afford to build infrastructure, and without infrastructure, there is no investment and no project, and without money and project, they cannot vigorously develop township enterprises, and without township enterprises, there is no place for the surplus labor to go, and if the productive forces cannot be put to use, purchasing power will decline, and in turn the economy cannot keep going, and so everybody stays poor. In recent years, some more fortunate localities (such as Guangan's Hua and Yuechi) have been able to take advantage of their natural resources to break this vicious cycle. But for a hilly area like Guozi village, prior to 1989, it seemed they would never get out of this strange endless circle. Thus, when Liu Yanlin [0491 1693 2651] and Shao Yuanshou [6730 0337 1108] left town, in fact they were paving a new way by creating a chain of workers-for-hire. That is, people can use the most primitive capital--labor--to earn their initial fund, skills, and experience. When I was in Guizi village, Secretary Liu and Mayor Bo were working on opening another brick factory. "Many people are building houses nowadays. Selling the bricks is no problem. We lack capital, but we have sent a letter to Boss Liu asking him to invest some money here." I wish them luck with their enterprise dream. Northern Jiangsu and Southern Jiangsu in Sharp Contrast--by reporter Dai Yuanzhi [2071 5913 2388] Dagang village is situated in the town of Goudun. In the office of the town government, young Comrade Zhang, in his "full capacity as representative of the town party committee," was receiving reporters. Someone told me that Comrade Zhang is the secretary. When Zhang talked about the town's 2,000-strong contingent in the service and business sector, his eyes lit up, and he said proudly, "You all know about Beijing's Wangfujing Boulevard. It is Beijing's most prosperous commercial street. There you will find 184 of our Guodun natives. It is also known as `Guodun Street.'" Later, he spoke in a more serious tone, "From the long-term perspective, the more workers we export, the worse off it will be for the economy at home, and compared to the advanced regions, the gap will only get bigger. Those who work in southern Jiangsu are creating wealth for the south; most of their money is taken away by the southerners." In his office, Yancheng's mayor Xu Qiyao [1776 0366 5069] told reporters that exporting labor can promote fresh ideas. People not only make money and learn new skills, but their minds are broadened, and they become more conscious about competition and about the commodity economy. This government official is also a high-ranking economist. He said, "Labor export promotes economic development and prosperity among the people. Today, two-thirds of the people are working in the fields, and so we must lead the surplus labor out of the fields. When they find work elsewhere, they will have income, and when they get rich, they can set up joint-household processing and develop diversified management and earn even more money, and in the future, when the economy is developed, they can come home." Guodun Town's Secretary Zhang has actually answered his own question. Guodun Town has a labor force of 27,000 people and 92,000 mu of arable land. At an average of more than a mu per person, there is plenty of surplus labor. The town has set up 29 enterprises and the village has 10 mainstay enterprises--"the per capita income is comparable to that in farming" and they can only "absorb a little over 3,000 people." Today, just those working out-of-town in construction, remodelling, water transport, and the service industry are numbered no less than 8,000. Each year, construction work generates 14 million yuan in income. In Chen Liang's [7115 0081] hometown, the villagers of Dagang have already figured out that of the village's 980 workers, only 500 are needed in the farms, and discounting the 100 who engage in diversified management and family-based factory work, it still leaves 380. Given their lack of funds and skills, exporting labor is one solution. In Yancheng, Cheng Jianjiang [4453 1696 3068], assistant manager of the city's labor market, eagerly told the reporter the following story: Xiangshui County's Zhouji Township sends its surplus labor north and south. Between the end of the year before and the beginning of last year, more than 80 women workers were sent to work in a factory in Wujiang in southern Jiangsu, and in return, the factory set up a silk factory in Zhouji. It selected a group of mainstay workers from among the young women who had gone to work there and sent them back home, and in only a few month's time, the factory was able to get into production and showed some profit. It is fair to say that without the labor export, there would have been no new silk factory. Zhouji village has also organized nearly 600 people from more than 200 households to set up camp in Beijing to work on wheaten food processing and services. In the first half of 1993, the net amount of money remitted through the post offices from Beijing to Zhouji increased by more than 400,000 yuan compared to the same period a year ago. Beijing's utility workers even took the initiative to install a program-controlled telephone for the village party committee. Those with insight in Yancheng feel that people in the economically well-developed southern Jiangsu can leave the land without leaving home, but in northern Jiangsu where the economy is less well-developed, "to get rich, one solution is to export the surplus labor." Jiangsu is a prosperous coastal province. Although it has 920,000 township enterprises which can absorb 9.06 million workers, it still has 340,000 surplus laborer to export. Of its contingent of 1.28 million construction workers, 550,000 have to find work elsewhere. There Is Sunshine to the East and Rain to the West--by reporter Liu Jian [0491 0256] As soon as I got back to the village, several old men from my grandfather's generation gave me the "news": A fortune-teller passing through the east end of the village exclaimed, "This village is going to get mighty rich!" Quite a few villagers believe in him, because in the last 10 years, Liujiaguanfang village has produced more than a dozen state cadres who were "champion growers." No other village came close. But still more and more of Liujiaguanfang's young men and women are leaving the village every year. In the first few years, the village had a fairly decent industrial project--a brick factory. The factory director was hired from out-of-town. At the end of 1992, the factory and the factory director got into a lawsuit in the village, and the factory shut down, leaving the village with a sum of debts, and adding interests, today, the amount is in excess of 20,000 yuan, and adding the village's other debts, it owes no less than 300,000 yuan. With this 300,000-yuan burden, the village in fact cannot start any more collective industrial and sideline projects. First of all, it cannot get bank loans, and second, no amount of money it earns can pay off its debts. In recent years, the village has another big burden--cotton subsidies. The village had not planted a single cotton plant in almost 20 years, but in the last two years, the higher authorities have changed their minds. Those who plant cotton are rewarded, and those who don't are penalized. The rewards alone cost the village several hundred thousand yuan. A few years back, the village complied with the "six complete projects" to rebuild a fancy elementary school. It was abandoned after only a few years. According to the authorities' new program, village children in first and second grades and those in third, fourth, and fifth grades are separately sent to two nearby village schools. Money invested in building schools just went down the drain. Development of the individual economy has also run into serious problems. They do not have sufficient accumulation funds to set up factories. They can get into the tertiary industry which may be easier. But then everybody begin to come up with the same idea. A few years back, five families opened up small department stores in the village. In the tiny little village, where would the business come from? Before long, three of them went out of business. The villagers have limited purchasing power. Liu Hanming's best cigarette in his canteen is the "Qingzhou" cigarette which costs 1.2 yuan a pack. He can't sell two cartons in a year. The most reliable is still the traditional handicrafts handed down from previous generations. The village has several old carpenters; their crafts are handed down from father to son. Today, 19 of them are making furniture for families in the county towns and nearby barracks for people who "hold government jobs." They earn a fairly good income. A carpenter's son is almost of marrying-age, and people are breaking down their door offering marriage proposals. Another business that has attracted many young men is driving small, 12-horsepower tractors. These small tractors are inexpensive, and they can haul and plow. Liujiaguanfang already has 24 of these small tractors. Their main function is to haul bricks and gravel for the construction plants and construction units and peasant households. During the plowing season, they can also make some money by doing some plowing in their own villages. During the busy season, they can make a good sum of money, but when there is no work and the machines stop running, they must pay out of their own pockets, because they still have to pay road toll. Another market has only just developed in recent years, and that is in the construction service industry. In the old days, when the peasants built houses, their friends and families would help out, and the host would provide the food and drinks; nobody paid money; it was a personal favor. Today, may be people have lost this kind of human touch or perhaps they are getting too mercenary, and anyway, everybody is having a difficult time, and when building houses, nobody ask their friends and relatives anymore; they hire constractors, and they negotiate prices beforehand and pay them off in one payment. Thus there is a construction team that is partly well-organized and partly not-so-well-organized, and that is a good sign. The One, Two, Threes of Enterprises--by reporter Sun Kai [1327 0418] Xinzhuang village's Huang Erhu [7806 0059 7579] who spends all year selling clothes in Xinjiang may be only 23 years old, but his weather-worn face says it all. He told the reporter, "There is so little land, and there are few township enterprises to give us jobs. If we don't get out and make a go at it, how are we going to survive?" The reporter has learned that not just in Xinzhuang village but in the entire Liufeng Township there is hardly a single township enterprise. Today, most township enterprises are construction companies and construction engineering teams that work out-of-town year-round. When I asked why nobody has opened industrial enterprises there, Xinzhuang's peasants said, "We have many province-run and county-run enterprises in the county, but most are failing and can't even pay wages. What peasant would dare set up enterprises?" Xinzhuang village's clerk, Huang Shengzhao [7806 0524 2156] is the village's learned man. He said, "To set up enterprises, one, we need money; two, we need projects; three, we need skills. When it comes to money, to be honest, Xinzhuang's people probably have some, but nowadays it is difficult to pick a good project. So many enterprises that have been around for so many years are failing. We are backward, and information is hard to come by. Who dares to run an enterprise?" Director Zhang of Gangu County's Labor Services Office said, "We export labor and often have to travel abroad. I contacted a Hong Kong businessman. I worked hard to recruit him to invest in Gangu and build a factory here. I told him that Gangu's workers are good and abundant, and labor cost is low, and he is bound to make money if he invests and builds his factory here. But he said even if our workers worked for free, he wouldn't build a factory here. He said that our county didn't even have a direct-line telephone (it was installed at the end of 1993), and if anything should happen, he would simply worry sick. Furthermore, he has a factory is in the Zhujiang Delta, and his products can get to Hong Kong in no time, and whatever new product Hong Kong has, information travels fast and he can react immediately. But to build a factory in Gangu, the products would have to be transported by train, through Baoji and then Zhengzhou and so on, and who knows when they would reach Hong Kong. That is why he would rather pay more to hire our workers to go to work in the Zhujiang Delta." Ganzu County's party committee vice secretary, Li Pingding [2621 1627 1353] said, "The county worked hard at one time and mobilized people to set up township enterprises and collective enterprises. But at a meeting, some leading individual business units said, `Many enterprises are failing these days. We should be careful, for if we are reckless, if we fail, it would affect some people, and so we ask the county not to be too demanding.' The county leaders agreed with that reasoning and took Gangu's actual conditions into consideration, and that is why it is not emphasizing number but are striving to build one enterprise at a time." Xinzhuang's peasants say, "We hear that the peasants are having no trouble setting up enterprises down south and that they are always successful, which is something we can't measure up to. It will be great one day when we too can build that many factories, because then we will not have to suffer night and day by working away from home."
