Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 8 February reports that a miscellaneous crops plenum was held in Cienfuegos Province at which it was announced that an additional 400 caballerias of plantain are going to be planted in Cienfuegos Province, above and beyond those under the current agricultural plan. Also, in salute to 26 July, 42 organic plots are to be added to the present 15. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 8 February reports that in 1993 Cuba received approximately $50 million in diverse donations -- mainly food, medicine, and school supplies -- channeled by the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples [ICAP] from 72 countries. ICAP President Sergio Corrieri added that 11 international brigades visited Cuba in 1993, and 32 cultural delegations traveled abroad. Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 9 February reports that the Faustino Vega rice mill in Manzanillo, Granma Province, has fulfilled its 1993 goal by husking a total of 8,500 tons of rice. This rice mill belongs to the Fernando Chenique Rice Company, which must plant 2,000 caballerias of rice this year, the largest number in the country. With an industrial performance of 64 percent, the Faustino Vega rice mill is also one of the best in this area. Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 9 February reports that the Antillana de Acero enterprise produced 8,000 tons of steel in January. This year's plan per four-month period is 50,000 tons. Radio Reloj at 1508 GMT on 9 February reports that Pinar del Rio Province has approximately 170 caballerias of land planted in miscellaneous crops, earmarked for use by schools. These are self-sufficiency plots. In 1993, 62 percent of the schools' needs in food were provided for by these plots. Over 64,000 quintals of miscellaneous food crops were produced in Pinar del Rio Province in 1993. This year, the School of Medical Sciences and other centers of higher learning will be given land to cultivate for self-sufficiency. Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 10 February reports that Federico Ramon Puerta, governor of the Argentine province of Misiones, announced a donation to Cuba of 28 tons of paper. He announced this shortly before his departure for Argentina after a visit to several Cuban provinces. He was accompanied by Argentine Ambassador (Susana Sara Grane) [Diplomatic List shows Adolfo Enrique Nanclares as Argentine ambassador to Cuba), and Pedro Chavez, president of Havana's People's Government. Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 10 February reports on an "experiment" underway in the food industry in Sibanicu Municipality, Camaguey Province, where workers are receiving a portion of the profits from sales at all centers, in lieu of salaries. "The worker earns according to his sales, receiving some 20 or 30 percent of what he sells." Omar del Risco, the local first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, explains that a unit's administrator is authorized to negotiate and purchase products from specific places and to manage the entire supply process for the unit. The administrator also decides, after consulting with the workers, how many workers should be kept at a given unit. Del Risco notes that "by distributing 20 percent among the workers, the workers try to have as few workers as possible. They do not keep anyone they do not need. Since they are paid in profits, they try to reduce costs to a minimum. They are tripling sales but lowering costs, and of course, there is an improvement in income." Del Risco notes that working for profit seems to motivate workers. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 11 February reports that at the end of an extensive tour of San Cristobal Municipality cane-growing areas, Fidel Ramos, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Pinar del Rio Province, has issued a call to catch up and to increase both efficiency and the amount of sugar produced during the current harvest. Rebelde's correspondent notes that workers are working around the clock at the 30 de Noviembre agroindustrial complex to get a 1,000-cubic-meter water tank operative again because problems with it paralyzed the sugar mill's operations. Ramos also inspected the Basic Cooperative Production Units' [UBPCs'] planting areas and a Youth Labor Army military grange. Along with Jose Marrero Camacho, like Ramos a member of the PCC's Central Committee and also president of the Provincial Assembly of the People's Government in Pinar del Rio, Ramos participated in a seminar for the economists of the 47 cane sector UBPC in the province, as well as in an overall inspection of the sugar harvest in Pinar del Rio. Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 11 February reports that the country's objective is to plant more than 18,000 caballerias of sugarcane by the end of June 1994, the largest figure over the past 13 years. Thus far, 61 percent of that program has already been achieved. Havana and Cienfuegos Provinces are leading in this planting program. Rebelde adds that the Armed Forces will be in charge of maintaining more than 11,000 light and heavy tractors, and more than 11,000 previously inoperative light trucks, to participate in this new Cuban agricultural project. The Armed Forces has the most experience and best techniques for maintaining both Armed Forces and agricultural equipment. The same newscast reports that despite the economic crisis affecting the country, there are and have always been the fraternal hands of many governments and institutions supporting our government. Such is the case with the Spanish Government, which in 1993 alone contributed approximately $5 million worth of donations. Spanish ambassador to Havana Jose Antonio San Gil said his government hopes to maintain and further develop cooperation with Cuba. In 1993, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation brought 337 tons of powdered milk for children. Spain also contributed, with $550,000 worth of medicine in 1993.
