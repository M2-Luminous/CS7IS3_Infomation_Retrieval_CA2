Laoag is a city in the northern Philippines. Xiamen is in coastal southern Mainland China. "It will take about two hours and NT [new Taiwan] $11,000 (US$407) to travel from Kaohsiung to Xiamen via the Philippines," said Makung's Chairman, Chen Wen-wu. It costs at least NT$15,08, (US$555) and three to four hours to travel from Taiwan to the nearest spot in the mainland via Hong Kong. "The new route will significantly benefit residents in southern Taiwan who previously have had to travel to Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport in northern Taiwan because of the shortage of seats for Kaohsiung-Hong Kong flights," Chen added. Makung Airlines made the announcement that it would start servicing the route Tuesday [31 May] after the company was given permission by the government to conduct direct charter flights between Kaohsiung and Laoag. After arriving in Laoag, Taiwan travelers will be flown on the same flight to Manila, there they will then board South China Airline planes to Xiamen. Makung will service the Kaohsiung-Laoag route with a Boeing 757 recently leased from the United States, while South China Airlines is planning to offer a Boeing 737 service for the Manila-Xiamen flight, Chen explained.
