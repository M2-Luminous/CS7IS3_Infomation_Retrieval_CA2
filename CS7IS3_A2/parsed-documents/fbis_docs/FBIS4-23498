Heavy shelling and small arms fire rocked several parts of the city in the morning as several empty UN trucks for Kabale on the Ugandan border to load up with relief supplies flown into Uganda's Entebbe airport Monday. Kigali airport has been closed since Sunday when it was shelled by government forces just after a UN flight had landed. The fighting died down during the day in a city largely deserted by its inhabitants, where the rebels are pitted against the army and extremist Hutu militias who have holed up in the southwestern Nyamirambo district. Government forces also battled the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) about three kilometres (two miles) from Gitarama, 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Kigali, Colonel Mooen Ahmed, operations chief in the UN mission, said. The leader of the General Paul Kagame, late Monday said his men had pushed back the government troops, who had begun what UN officials described as a "major counter-offensive." Fighting was also reported to the north of Kigali, in the direction of rebel-held Ruhengeri. The army has sent reinforcements northwards to try to halt rebel advances. [passage omitted on previously filed material] A UN spokesman announced that ceasefire talks planned for Wednesday had been postponed for at least 24 hours because the chairman of the talks, Ghanaian Gen. Henry Anyidoho, was out of the country and had been unable to fly directly back to Kigali. "Even if he arrives on Tuesday night, he'll need time to prepare for the talks, which will now be held on Thursday or Friday," UN civilian spokesman Pierre Mehu said. Anyidoho, the deputy chief of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), had left the Kenyan capital Nairobi for Kampala in Uganda, flown by helicopter to the border and was to make his way to Kigali by road, Mehu said. Two sessions of UN-mediated talks took place last week, enabling agreements to be reached on evacuating civilians and providing food and medical aid amid the battle, but led to no ceasefire accord. [passage omitted] The international Red Cross has evacuated more than 700 orphans and abandoned children from Butare in the south, a town still in government hands, to Burundi, a Red Cross official said. [passage omitted] About a hundred more children, some with dreadful injuries perpetrated in cold blood, arrived overnight in Rome in an evacuation operation mounted by the Italian Red Cross and government. The children, some under a year old, were all taken to Rome hospitals and will eventually find foster families, Maria Pia Fanfani, president of the Italian Red Cross, said.
