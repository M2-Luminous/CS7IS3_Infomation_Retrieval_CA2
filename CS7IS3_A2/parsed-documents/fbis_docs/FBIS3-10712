Specifically referring to the commercial opening implemented in the country, Portillo said: "We always carefully study the economic conditions prevailing in each country, and I believe that as a result of the Brazilian economic reform the conditions are there for offering guarantees for export credits." Portillo arrived in Brazil at the end of the week at the head of a business delegation. Yesterday, during a luncheon sponsored by the British Chamber of Commerce in Rio de Janeiro, where he met with Brazilian businessmen, he expressed interest in the Brazilian privatization program. So much so that during the morning, after visiting Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] and Shell, he visited the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) where he met with National Privatization Program Director Elena Landau. "There is interest in all privatization areas," he added, and specifically in the telecommunications and energy fields. He believes that because of their experience in the privatization process in Great Britain, British banks may take part in the Brazilian privatization program through the sale of certificates in those companies that are being privatized on the international market. Well versed on the issue, Portillo stated that the Brazilian privatization program has already yielded a total of $6 billion, while in Great Britain the program totaled $75 billion. British interest in the Brazilian privatization process is also attested to by the members of the official delegation -- British Gas, Northwest Water International, Powergen (all companies that were privatized) and the Barings Kleinwort Benson, Rothschilds, and Schroders and Warburgs banks, all of which have played an active role in the privatization process. Today the British delegation will be in Sao Paulo, where it will hold meetings with Sao Paulo State Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf. On 9 March they are scheduled to visit Brasilia, where they will hold meetings with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso and with representatives from the Mines and Energy and Aeronautics Ministries. The British companies are interested in participating in the Amazon Region Surveillance System (Sivam); their bid for the supply of telecommunications equipment totaling $600 million has already been opened by the Aeronautics Ministry.
