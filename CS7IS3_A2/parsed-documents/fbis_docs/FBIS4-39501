The ATP's headquarters on the territory of a missile base, which was dismantled in 1993, is owned by Konza. On 25 March, 1994, President Leonid Kravchuk issued an instruction involving "a technical-economic experiment" in Brody, which served as a legal foundation for setting up the ATP. The ATP project, which extends to the year 2032, encompasses a series of economic subprojects, [word indistinct]: - A serving station for maintenance, repair and upgrading of agricultural equipment and machinery. The project involves Germany's Hagema, which will supply and service equipment and machinery against credits it has been granted. Hagema will be entitled to the ATP-Brody's stocks when the latter is converted into a joint-stock society; - The Brody canning factory's reconstruction (the project is estimated at $8 million); - Optimized forestry in zones of intensive agriculture; - Upgrading of the Brody sewing factory (recently, imported equipment worth about $600,000 has been mounted at the factory, which has business ties with firms in Germany and Finland); - Application of food irradiation technologies ($2,631,000). In June the ATP-Brody expects to receive technical aid from the US Public Association of agrobusinesses. Similar aid is due to come from Canada's Association of agrobusinesses in the fall. According to Yevgeni Pushchik, the Brody district presidential emissary, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is contemplating to invest about $50 million in the ATP-Brody project in 1995. In the meantime, the Joint-Stock Society for the Agrotechnipark-Brody project is reported to have been established in Philadelphia, Pa. with a view of searching for partners and setting up the ATP- Brody's affiliates. Such affiliates are envisaged for setting up in Germany, Hungary, Russia, China, Slovakia, and Czechia. In particular, Czechia's FDH and Slovakia's Milispol, whose representatives attended the presentation ceremony, are reported to have intimated their willingness to be involved in the ATP-Brody project. A governmental decree is expected to be shortly issued, which will specify the ATP-Brody project's implementation terms and mechanisms to make the territorial innovative center functioning.
