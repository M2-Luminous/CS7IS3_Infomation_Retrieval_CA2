FR940913-0-00048 FR940913-0-00015 The USEPA has conducted Level I, II, and III quality assurance reviews of the Illinois emission inventory submittals and has concluded that the State of Illinois has met the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act by submitting an ozone precursor emission inventory that includes comprehensive, accurate, and current actual emissions from all identified sources in the subject ozone nonattainment areas. In particular, the Illinois submittals meet the 10 crucial criteria contained in the Level III quality assurance review. The emissions inventory is, therefore, approved for incorporation in the SIP as satisfying the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the amended Act. This approved SIP revision and the emission levels contained within it will form the basis for subsequent SIP revisions dealing with RFP and attainment of the ozone standard. The USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the USEPA is proposing to approve the requested SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective on November 14, 1994, unless adverse or critical comments are received by October 13, 1994. If the USEPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent rule that withdraws this final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective November 14, 1994. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976). Under section 307(b)(1)of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 14, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purpose of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).
