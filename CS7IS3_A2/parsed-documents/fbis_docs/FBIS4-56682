An official Foreign Ministry note states: "This has been confirmed publicly and unequivocally on several occasions. The only points requiring definition are the methods to be used, the bilateral agreement, membership to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the date to officially begin negotiating." The foreign minister thus answered a report that an unidentified Foreign Ministry official had mentioned difficulties in the negotiations, or that Chile is not a priority for the United States in the free trade agreement. The mentioned report says, among other things, that the United States has made environmental demands that Chile cannot meet. Figueroa said: "I want to say that such a report is absolutely false because all the information we gathered through the Foreign Ministry, the public, and through several involved U.S. Government officials, shows that negotiations between Chile and the United States over a free trade treaty or over joining the NAFTA are open and ready to go."
