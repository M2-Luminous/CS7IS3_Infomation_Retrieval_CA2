Kolodziejczyk told journalists he was optimistic regarding regional cooperation of the Central European countries and the Partnership for Peace project. This is a way of creating a joint defense area which has no alternative, he added. Kanis (left-orientated Democratic Left Party, SDL, appointed to the post on March 16) said that Slovakia's orientation towards the West would continue. This is evidenced by the identical view of the ministers that the Visegrad Four countries (Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) should enter NATO jointly, he added. Kolodziejczyk said the Polish offer to jointly use military training areas, including that above the Baltic Sea, was still topical and it was being discussed by experts. Poland is planning a string of joint military exercises with NATO countries. It would like Visegrad Four representatives to participate as observers, Kolodziejczyk said. Kanis added that the exchange of smaller units had been proposed as well.
