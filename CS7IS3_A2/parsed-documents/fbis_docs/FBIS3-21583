The elimination of chemical weapons will start after parliament has ratified the international convention on the destruction of chemical weapons, signed in January 1993, Colonel Viktor Kholstov, doctor of chemistry and deputy chief of the radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops, told the ITAR-TASS corespondent. He said that the convention may come into force from January 1995 if 65 world states sign and ratify it before this July. According to this document, a signatory undertakes not to carry out any new development. Viktor Kholstov stated that chemical weapons are not being destroyed anywhere yet. All agents are in special arsenals, are well guarded, and do not represent a threat to the environment. If munitions become defective, V. Kholstov continued, Russia has a unique unit that makes it possible to neutralize them. This unit is without parallel and was inspected by 40 world delegations who saw for themselves how reliable it is. As far as a national program for the elimination of chemical weapons is concerned, in Viktor Kholstov's opinion, it is necessary both for the adoption of political decisions and to substantiate financial outlays. After the convention is ratified, the state is obliged to completely destroy over 10 years all chemical weapons on its territory, Colonel Kholstov said. This requires special facilities and specific financing. Such a draft program was drawn up while the USSR still existed, but the implementation of the measures it prescribed was thwarted for various reasons. For instance, the facility built near Chapayevsk was not made operational due to mass protests from the population, which was deliberately misinformed by certain groupings for their own ends. The program was taken up again in 1992 after Boris Yeltsin stated that Russia had inherited earlier disarmament commitments. Around two dozen ministeries and departments and several hundred specialists have been involved in drawing up the new version of the program. The government has allocated resources for testing the technology, and Russian and American scientists and engineers inspected the Chapayevsk facility near Samara for safety. Authorative commissions of experts assessed the facility highly and recommended that similar facilties be set up in other regions of the country. In reply to a question by the ITAR-TASS correspondent as to whether new types of chemical weapons were being developed, Viktor Kholstov said that nobody would be so brave as to assert that no such work was being undertaken abroad. "Russia is not violating international agreements, but the strengthening of national security lies within its scope just as it does in any sovereign, self- respecting state."
