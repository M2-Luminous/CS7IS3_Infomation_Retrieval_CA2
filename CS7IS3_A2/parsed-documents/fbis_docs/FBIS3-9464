He then met leaders of the three largest opposition parties. Anna Gulyas reports: [Gulyas] We told the prime minister that when judging the situation in Hungary it is necessary to consider the fact that, bearing in mind that these are the second free, democratic elections, neither the politicians nor public opinion have really learned the rules of the game, Ivan Petoe, chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], said in a statement summing up the discussion. He added: The room for maneuver in forming coalitions is influenced by the fact that not only rational but very often emotional factors have an impact on the parties' coalition plans in Hungary. Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP], called the attention of Jean-Luc Dehaene to the fact that the European Union should take greater account of the characteristics of the region's countries. It would be good if Brussels acknowledges the achievements of the states concerned -- including those of our country -- in the development of a market economy, and if it desists from treating the issue of the east-central European countries' accession as one package. In connection with NATO, we accept that the region must be treated as a unified whole, Gyula Horn said, adding that during the discussion he emphasized the Socialist Party's opinion that in Hungary a referendum should precede NATO accession. The Hungarian political parties are committed to membership in NATO and the European Union. This was also affirmed by Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], at the discussion. In connection with full membership in the European Union, the Belgian prime minister again highlighted the importance of preparation. The extent of this influences the time it takes to gain membership.
