FBIS4-8309 "dreeu070__a94077" FBIS-EEU-94-070-A Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Readiness To Negotiate Danube Division Reported Readiness To Negotiate Danube Division Reported AU0804200694 Prague CTK in English 1638 GMT 8 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0804200694 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) -- A note sent today by the Slovak Foreign Ministry to the Hungarian Embassy in Bratislava expresses Slovakia's readiness to resume as early as possible the talks on the establishment of a temporary water regime on the Danube. The Slovak Ministry thus responded to a note from the Hungarian Foreign Ministry of March 28, in which Budapest urged the Slovak government to resume the negotiations immediately. The Hungarian note reacted to Slovakia's rejection of a compromise proposal by European Union experts for the method of division of the Danube's water between the original bed of the border river and a derivation canal built by Bratislava on Slovak territory. Budapest itself accepted the compromise proposal, though with reservations. In opposition to this, the Slovak note recalls that the EU experts had also recommended to build weirs in the Danube's original bed to prevent drying up of some river's branches, but the Hungarian parliament recently rejected the weirs' construction. Nevertheless, in its document Bratislava says it favors further search for a rational and effective solution to the problem.
