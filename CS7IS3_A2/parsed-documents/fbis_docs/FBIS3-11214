Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin will ask the Cuban Government for an explanation. [Begin recording] [Unidentified Reporter] Madam Minister: A few days ago, you ruled out this possibility; you said you trusted the Cuban Government. What made you change your mind? Why are you asking for an explanation? [Sanin] Things happen between states the same as between individuals, and while one does not have evidence, demonstrations, or proof, the principle of good faith is maintained. Otherwise, we would be engaged in completely aggressive international relations. That day, I said that if the Colombian Government obtained proof or evidence of Cuban or any other nation's interference in its internal affairs, we would act accordingly. Yesterday, the prosecutor general visited me and he gave me the evidence. There are serious signs of a guerrilla presence at a meeting held in Cuba. We still cannot label it treason or subversive; this still has to be investigated. Therefore, in keeping with the offer and our obligations, we are asking the Cuban Government for an explanation. Once we have their reply we will proceed. [end recording]
