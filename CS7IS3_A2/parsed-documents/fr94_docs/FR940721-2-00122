FR940721-2-00122 FR940721-2-00070 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34381; File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;93&hyph;04] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Modifying Exercise Settlement Date and Buy-In Procedures July 14, 1994. On December 27, 1993, Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;94&hyph;04) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 On February 16, 1994, and on March 4, 1994, DGOC submitted substantive amendments to the filing. 2 Notice of the proposal was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1994, to solicit comments from interested persons. 3 No comments were received. This order approves the proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (1988). 2 Amendment No. 2 completely superseded all previous submissions filed in connection with the proposed rule change, File No. SR&hyph;DGOC&hyph;93&hyph;04. 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34083 (May 18, 1994), 59 FR 27087. I. Description of the Proposal The proposed rule change modifies DGOC's exercise settlement procedures. Under current practice, the exercise settlement date, depending on certain factors, occurs from two to five business days following the expiration date or the date on which an exercise notice is tendered. For an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury note exercised on a day preceding the expiration date, the exercise settlement date is the next business day following the day on which the exercise notice is properly assigned to a participant. The proposal makes no change to this provision of DGOC's rules. For an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury note exercised on the expiration date, the exercise settlement date will now be the next business day following the expiration date for those contracts. Currently, the exercise settlement date for such contracts is the third business day following the expiration date. Also, under the proposed rule change, for an option contract on a Treasury bill, the exercise settlement date will be the next business day after an exercise notice is properly tendered. Currently, the exercise settlement date is Thursday of the week in which the exercise notice is properly tendered. In connection with the modifications to the exercise settlement date, DGOC has amended Section 1005 of its Procedures to provide that DGOC will allocate exercise settlement obligations prior to 8:00 a.m. on the business day prior to the exercise settlement date. Previously, DGOC allocated exercise settlement obligations on the second business day prior to the exercise settlement date. DGOC also has amended Section 1102 of its Procedures to clarify its buy-in process applicable when a participant fails to make a required delivery of Treasury securities to DGOC. First, upon the request of the participant failing to deliver and with good cause shown, DGOC is now authorized to defer the execution of a buy-in if Delta has reason to believe that the delivery default will be cured on that other arrangement adequate to protect Delta's interests have been made. 4 Previously, DGOC could defer the execution of a buy-in for no more than twenty-four hours from the time delivery was due. Second, the timing for the execution of a buy-in has been set forth with specificity. Under the more specific procedures, DGOC may transmit a notice of buy-in to the participant which failed to deliver after the elapse of thirty calendar days after the failure to deliver. DGOC must deliver in duplicate a written notice of buy-in no later than 12:00 noon five business days before the proposed execution date of the buy-in. The amended section also sets forth the information DGOC must supply to the participant in the buy-in notice. 4 Section 1102 of DGOC's Procedures authorizes DGOC to buy-in Treasury securities for the account and liability of a participant that fails to fulfill its delivery obligation. II. Discussion The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act. 5 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act 6 require that the rules of clearing agencies be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and to assure the safeguarding of funds which are under the custody or control of a clearing agency or for which it is responsible and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 5 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). 6 15 U.S.C. 78&hyph;1(b)(3) (A) and (F) (1988).
