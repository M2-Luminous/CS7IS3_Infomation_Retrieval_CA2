President/Director of PT Duma Na Napu Soy Martua Pardede said Friday his company is currently preparing the proposal to be handed over to the Ministry of Mines and Energy director-general for electricity. Pardede, after his meeting with Lampung's deputy-governor Man Hasan, said here Friday that the proposal is expected to be submitted in May. The steam-power plant will be built on a 50-hectare site, a land that has been relinquished by the state-owned electricity firm PLN [National Electricity Board]. "We are obliged to pay PLN for compensations only," Pardede said. In constructing the steam-combined-cycle-power plant, PT Duma Na Napu will also cooperate with local contractors such as Bakrie Brothers and the Wirataman consultants, a consultancy firm also hired by the Paiton PLTU in east Java. The Southern Electric International is a giant American company and manages a number of electricity-generating projects with a combined capacity of 36 million megawatts, Pardede said. This capacity is three times the size of PLN's electrical capacity, he added. The Lampung project construction will begin late 1995 and is expected to be operational in 1998. The power-plant will get its coal supply from Bukit Asam, a coal mining area in the same province. The location of the plant is adjacent to the Bandar Lampung Tarahan coal port that has so far served as terminal for coals being transported to Suralaya's PLTU in west Java. The Tarahan coal port is able to accommodate 10 million tons of coal annually, and will be expanded to accommodate at least 12.5 million tons yearly. [passage omitted]
