The base, on a mountain called Phnom Malai, is where up to 30,000 Cambodian refugees were repatriated by the Thai military, after fleeing the fighting at Pailin, with the assurance that they would be safe there. Not far from the northwest Aranyaprathet-Poipet border crossing, Phnom Malai is believed to be the permanent home of Khmer Rouge second-in-command Ieng Sary, as well as the part-time residence of the clandestine leader of the radical guerrillas, Pol Pot. Border intelligence reports reaching Phnom Penh indicate that Pol Pot divides his time between his house in Phnom Malai, a second residence in a compound just inside the border from the Thai town of Trat, and a third in the Thai capital, Bangkok. The fanatical Maoist is responsible for the deaths of a million Cambodians in the "Killing Fields" during his rule in the 1970s. "We are waiting for orders from the Royal Government. Then we can attack Phnom Malai at any time," said General Lay Vireak, quoted in the daily Khmer-language REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA newspaper. "The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces are ready to capture Phnom Malai, which is a stronghold of 5,000 Khmer Rouge fighters," he said. "It is not as easy to attack as Pailin, because it is a real Khmer Rouge soldiers' base, whereas Pailin is only an economic base." Pailin's ruby and sapphire mines and its rich hardwood forests provided an estimated one million dollars per month in revenues to Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who allowed concessions to Thai mining companies. Although invading government troops have found several hundred tonnes of weapons hidden around Pailin, its primary purpose was economic and strategic rather than military, diplomats and observers here say. The road to Phnom Malai is paved on the Thai side of the border, but on the Cambodian side, the mountainous, jungle-covered and malarial slopes will pose a formidable challenge to government troops already under pressure as they hold onto Pailin. In addition, the government is still using its resources in an attempt to retake parts of the Khmer Rouge's base in northern Cambodia, at Anlong Veng, which it captured and lost in February, diplomatic sources say. Co-premier Hun Sen, who controls the Army, is likely to wait until the areas are more secure, before ordering the opening of another front, according to diplomats. Khmer Rouge troops at Phnom Malai shelled government troops reinforcing Pailin -- about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) to the south -- for one hour on Monday, the newspaper said. It reported 62 Khmer Rouge and seven government soldiers dead, three Khmer Rouge captured and 600 AK-47s seized, but did not give the time frame for the fighting. Another general reached by telephone denied a claim on Khmer Rouge radio that guerrillas had completely surrounded the government troops at Pailin and at a second location, Sala Krau. "We are not in the Khmer Rouge trap," he said. "We don't need to worry. We can match any manpower of theirs with our own.
