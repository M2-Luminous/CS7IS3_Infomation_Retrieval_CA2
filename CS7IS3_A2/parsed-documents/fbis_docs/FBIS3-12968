Observers say this measure will paralyze a large sector of the Jordanian economy. AKHIR KHABAR has learned that Iraq will confine transportation to the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Company. Iraq did not explain this measure or announce it; it implemented it on the ground. Sources told us that Jordanian transportation firms are trying to take a unified stand and address the Jordanian and Iraqi Governments in order to explain the extent of damage they will sustain. It is noteworthy that approximately 80 percent of these firms' work is devoted to Iraq. This shows the size of this problem. Truck drivers are living in extremely difficult conditions at the Iraqi-Jordanian border area of al-Ruwayshid. AKHIR KHABAR has learned that world television networks will today begin to raise this problem as a political issue, taking pictures of the al- Ruwayshid area.
