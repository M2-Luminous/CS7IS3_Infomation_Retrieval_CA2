FR940720-0-00108 FR940720-0-00007 Many of the comments concerning this definition were similar to those comments provided regarding the definition of farm equipment. Several manufacturers and trade groups were concerned that the definition was too narrow. They thought it necessary to change the words ``primarily used in'' to ``designed for use in.'' Caterpillar, the Construction Industry Manufacturer's Association (CIMA) and others were concerned that the word ``commercial'' might exclude equipment used on public works projects or in residential construction. The EPA exclusion of mining equipment from this preempted category drew unfavorable comments from EMA, EMI, CIMA, and the American Mining Congress (AMC). The American Association of Nurserymen (AAN) requested that EPA explicitly recognize that landscape contracting involves earthmoving and is thus construction. CARB, SDAPCB and MECA, on the other hand, thought the definition was too broad. CARB and SDAPCB recommended that all auxiliary equipment such as compressors and pumps be excluded from preemption. Both believed that the phrase ``commercial construction sites'' be defined. MECA suggested that the definition should be site and use specific. Both CARB and SDAPCB approved of our mining equipment exclusion. EPA's response to the comments that the phrase ``designed for'' should be part of the construction equipment definition is identical to the Agency's response to the same comments under the Definition of ``farm equipment'' section of this rule. Please refer to that section for further discussion. The comments on the use of the word ``commercial'' may be approached in a manner similar to the way they were addressed under the definition of ``farm equipment.'' EPA believes that defining ``commercial'' in the final rule as ``an activity engaged in as a vocation'' is as appropriate in the context of construction equipment as it is in the context of farm equipment. ``Commercial'' in the construction equipment definition is meant to distinguish equipment that homeowners typically use to perform repairs on their own property from equipment typically used by contractors. Construction of public works projects is ``commercial'' under this definition. MECA suggested that the definition be changed to ``.␣.␣. used in construction and located on .␣.␣.'' to specify the activity involved. This is a reasonable suggestion. EPA believes that including these recommended words in the definition will make it clear that the function of machinery is as important as its location on a site on which construction occurs. EMA, EMI, CIMA, AMC and others pointed out that mining operations (surface mining) share with construction sites the use of many of the same machines. While this may be true, Congress expressed no intent to preempt from state regulation equipment used in mining operations. According to Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1971 unabridged) construction is ``the act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object.'' Although EPA's definition includes operations such as demolition and painting which take place outside the actual structural fabrication, the definition still would not include mining, which Webster's defines as ``getting ore, metals, coal or precious stones out of the earth.'' These are not construction activities. Additionally, underground mining usually employs uniquely designed equipment unlike equipment found on a construction site. Surface mining, while sharing some equipment, is a separate activity not associated with construction. The regulation of equipment, however, that is used in surface mining and is also primarily used in construction activities, as defined in this rule, would be preempted. As discussed in the NPRM, a number of diverse activities take place on a construction site. Earthmoving is one such activity, and thus, landscape contracting could use construction equipment as AAN notes. AAN made no mention of the specific earthmoving equipment in question; thus, the primary use test (See Scope of Preemption section) must be applied to such machinery. Groundskeeping is not a construction activity. AAN did state its support of EPA's definition of construction equipment. Ingersoll-Rand thought that the words ``commercial'' and ``primary use'' should be deleted and that the definitions of farm and construction equipment should be broadened to include any machine that includes an engine belonging to an engine family which is used in construction equipment. The issue of commercial is considered above. Ingersoll-Rand's use of the engine family concept is addressed, as is the primary use issue, in the Application of Definitions, Primary Use Test section.
