As a result of amendments made by the Finance Ministry, the budget deficit has increased by nearly 6.5 trillion rubles, totalling 70 trillion rubles. It will be funded by credits from the Central Bank. According to the document, the deficit grew because the expenditure part increased by 8 trillion rubles. This money has been earmarked for food purchases and investment in agriculture. The income part has also slightly increased because export and import duties have been raised. Aleksandr Pochinok, deputy chairman of the committee for budget- related issues, told a correspondent of Ekho Moskvy that a joint parliamentary and government commission will now start work on the document since there are still many criticisms targeted at the budget.
