Albania holds that not interruption but continuation of the dialogue helps overcome the difficulties in the Greek-Albanian relations and the lowering of tension. I would like to stress that the detention of six Greek minority people under charges which are already known took place several weeks before we agreed on the meeting. No other arrests have been made regarding the above process, but Albanian citizens of Greek origin and Albanians have been interrogated as witnesses according to penal procedure. This is a right of the Albanian independent justice for which it has to ask permission from nobody. The judicial process will be normal, open and independent. During this period Greece has blocked the EU assistance for the balance of payments of Albania. With this act they aim not only at discouraging the reforms but also to change the radical European direction and orientation of Albania. On this occasion, I would like to declare and confirm that neither this blockade of the assistance for the balance of payments nor other measures or decisions of Greece towards Albania will succeed to divert Albania's European direction and its integration into Europe. I am confident in the EU Commission and the European Union member countries and governments that they have their own positive independent opinion for the Albanian policy as a factor for the stability in the region and for the efforts of Albania to expand cooperation in the region according to the interests of the EU. I also am aware that they will not accept to prevent reforms in Albania, because this union, its member countries and international institutions have been those that have encouraged and supported Albania mostly. I agree with the call of Greece to the EU member countries to deal with the problems created in the Albanian-Greek relations. Albania is ready and open to cooperate with them and also welcomes their contribution to the re-establishment of the Albanian-Greek dialogue, unilaterally interrupted by the Greek party. Lastly, regarding the fuss of the Greek propaganda on the lack of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, I would like to say once more that Albania is fully determined to create a pattern of the treatment of minorities in the region and that the Greek minority enjoys all the rights and freedoms envisaged by the charter of Copenhagen. International institutions, the CSCE, European parliament, the US congress know and have reconfirmed several times these uncontested facts. On this occasion I would like to tell Mr. Papandreuo that despite his abusive statements, which is not the first time, and which have been inspired by electoral interests or long-term goals, Albania's policy towards the Greek minority will not change. It is dictated by our determination to establish the rule of law and the market economy in Albania. It cannot be dictated by other tendencies to manipulate the minority. By offering dialogue and insisting in it, Albania will never accept that the questions of the minority be manipulated and put at the disposal of nationalistic or electoral fevers.
