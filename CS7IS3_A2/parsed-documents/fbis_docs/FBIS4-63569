For seven generations the tradition has been for the eldest sons in the Krasnyanskiy family to became jurists. In 1971 Valeriy finished postgraduate studies. In 1980 he began to teach at the university's law school. In 1986, together with Petr Filippov, Anatoliy Chubays, and others, he took part in creating the Perestroyka Club; in 1989 he was in charge of Yuriy Boldyrev's election campaign. In 1990--elected to the city soviet; 1993--appointed a member of the Central Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation. [Krasnyanskiy] I have not had any illusions regarding communism almost since childhood. In school, I studied with opposition-minded professors and associate professors who ended up there via the second Leningrad case. I envisaged the reform of the Soviet system as more evolutionary, through. I was not a supporter of shock therapy: First we needed to correct the situation in the economy, then free people's spiritual life from control, and only then change the political structure. However, we want everything and right away. Well, this seems to be Russia's fate... [Shestakova] Does it not seem to you that there is something insulting to the individual about voucher privatization? [Krasnyanskiy] Each of us received a voucher and had the opportunity to invest it. Those who were luckier and smarter found a good place for their vouchers and receive dividends. In addition, each employee owns part of his enterprise's property. Everybody was given a chance to become an owner. [Shestakova] St. Petersburg is ahead of practically all the regions in the pace of privatization. But have we not paid too high a price? Do you not think that running in front of the locomotive was somewhat artificial? [Krasnyanskiy] On the all-Russia scale--no. Life always makes it difficult for those who are ahead. But what has been taking place is moral, because the concept of voucher privatization turned out to be viable. Vouchers stimulated the formation of the stock market and created conditions for attracting investment for enterprise development. Seven million privatization vouchers have been collected in the city, which exceeds St. Petersburg's population. The process of secondary privatization is beginning, where small investors' shares will pay off. The second stage will begin after 1 July and will proceed in keeping with the "Post-Voucher Privatization Concept" developed by the State Committee for Administration of State Property. Those who did not want to undergo reorganization have been left on the sidelines. Now they face either gradual privatization or getting the status of a state-owned entity. Socialist methods of administration will be applied to such organizations: record-keeping and control, strict limitations on wages, and so on. [Shestakova] Grounds keepers will appear on the streets again... [Krasnyanskiy] Apparently so. After 1 July stock will be sold only for money. Therefore, before assuming 51 percent of stock, the labor collective will have to think it over many times. The best privatization option will be the first one, under which the collective keeps 25 percent of nonvoting preferred stock, which is more attractive for investors. No restrictions are envisaged for foreigners in buying and selling stock. Although we should not count too much on foreigners' help--they are in no hurry to come to Russia. [Shestakova] Will there be land vouchers? [Krasnyanskiy] As securities--probably not. But investors want to have ownership rights not only to the enterprise but also to the land lot on which it is situated. The Property Fund has prepared the corresponding documents; they are currently in the approval stage. So selling land will be permitted de facto. Its value will be determined by a scale approved by the city council, after applying certain coefficients. Among the new features in the government program of privatization of state and municipal enterprises in the Russian Federation after 1 July is the possibility of putting up for investment auction both entire enterprises as a whole (not just a block of stock) and selling through an investment bid the rights of cofounder. At the end of May the concept of the St. Petersburg program will be submitted to the judgment of the government. [Shestakova] And here, again, "there are possibilities," since the program of post-voucher privatization is not yet ready, which means that the legislative base will be formed as we go. [Krasnyanskiy] Unfortunately, you are quite close. First, the program does not specify the time frame for the transfer of payments, and on these grounds frictions may develop with the treasury and the tax inspection. Also, it is not clear what constitutes directly privatization activities of our fund, since part of it is taxable and the rest is not. The confusion arises mainly because normative acts are drafted by people far removed from jurisprudence. [Shestakova] Any person in a government job is guilty all-around these days. Remember, like in the movie "Wedding in Malinovka": "a change of authority..." Today it is the whites, tomorrow the reds, and then the striped. The one at the end of the line is at fault. And this usually befalls the direct implementers of privatization at the slightest shift in the political course. Does this not frighten you? [Krasnyanskiy] Every reform is associated with difficulties; it inevitably brings down the standard of living, causes discontent, and becomes associated not with the objective process but with the people implementing these reforms. If I find myself to be the last in line, I will be guided exclusively by my own convictions and the law. [Shestakova] What team do you associate yourself with? [Krasnyanskiy] The reformist one. And as a functionary--with Sobchak's team.
