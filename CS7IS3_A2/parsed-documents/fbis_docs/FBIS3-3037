Zhu Kaixuan announced this news while answering a question from a XINHUA News Agency reporter. He affirmed the achievements in solving the problem of delays in the payment of teachers' salaries and pointed out at the same time: Some individual localities still owe teachers a small amount such as bonuses and subsidies, which are not included in the basic pay. Zhu Kaixuan said: We should give in-depth thought to ways of preventing the problem of delays in the payment of teachers' salaries from recurring. At present, the State Council, government departments in charge of education, and local governments are working hand in hand in three fields: 1) improving and perfecting current regulations on managing and raising funds for education, and those on managing and paying teachers' salaries; 2) establishing a legal system to protect the basic rights and interests of the broad masses of teachers. The main thing we should do now is to publicize and implement the "Teachers Law." In the "Teachers Law," two articles concern legal actions against delays in the payment of teachers' salaries. 3) arousing people's awareness of respecting teachers and valuing education. The key to carrying out these tasks is to establish a responsibility system for major persons in charge in governments at all levels. Zhu Kaixuan said: The State Education Commission is paying close attention to the problem of delays in the payment of teachers' salaries to prevent this situation from recurring. A reporter asked him about the issue of requiring students at institutions of higher education to pay tuition, Zhu Kaixuan said: Changing the situation in which the state is responsible for arranging students' schooling and jobs is an important aspect of China's educational reform. The future reform goal is to gradually require students to pay for their tuition and to look for jobs on their own. Zhu Kaixuan said emphatically: Asking students to pay their tuition does not mean that students have to go to school at their own expense. In light of the current practical situation, it is difficult for students to attend schools at their own expense. After we took two major factors into consideration -- the cost of education and the people's financial capabilities, we asked students to pay some fees for their schooling. Zhu Kaixuan said: The fees for each student at colleges and institutions under the State Education Commission are 1,000 to 1,500 yuan this year. The cost will go up in coming years. However, students who enrolled in colleges before the new regulations took effect will not be affected. Now more than 50 percent of the 2.5 million college students nationwide are from rural areas. They have difficulty paying for tuition, which is why we must establish relevant scholarship and student loan program. The state has established profession-specific scholarships for students trained in some special and vigorous professions and in specialized fields which enable them to attend school free of charge. Zhu Kaixuan said: Under the socialist system, we cannot let students drop out of school for economic reasons. Answering a reporter's question on how the educational reform accommodates the establishment of the socialist market economic structure, Zhang Xiaowen, vice minister in charge of the State Education Commission, said: First, we should reform the administrative system of higher education by changing the current multilevel administration to a two-level administration by the state and localities and by giving more decision-making power to localities and universities. At the same time, we should vigorously and smoothly reform the enrollment of college students, the collection of tuition and other fees, and the employment of college graduates. Second, we should adjust the current structures of personnel and courses and should accelerate the development of courses related to finance, economics, politics, law, and high technology, which are urgently needed for social development. When asked whether China was able to realize the goal of making nine-year compulsory education universal by the year of 2000, Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State Education Commission, said: China needs and is able to basically realize nine-year compulsory education by the turn of the century. "To basically realize this goal" means that around 85 percent of China's population and regions will have nine-year compulsory education by that time, while the other 15 percent probably will have only six or four years of compulsory education. As for Chinese students studying abroad, Zhu Kaixuan said: China has sent 210,000 students to more than 100 countries and regions worldwide for study. Of these students, more than 70,000 have returned home after finishing their studies. The Chinese Government has adopted a policy of supporting people studying abroad, encouraging Chinese living abroad to return to the motherland, and allowing them to come and go freely. We do not have any reason to change this policy. We can understand that some students want to stay longer in foreign countries for various reasons, and some of them have applied for "green cards." These students are keeping in close contact with China. Some countries use various pretexts or even make laws to prevent Chinese students from returning home. In view of this situation, the Chinese Government has made serious representations to the countries concerned. At today's news conference, persons in charge at the State Education Commission also answered reporters' questions on investment in education, raising and managing educational funds, and maintaining the ranks of teachers.
