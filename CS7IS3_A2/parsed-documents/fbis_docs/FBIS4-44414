By the end of 1992, the total number of rural enterprises reached 20.78 million, employing 105 million people, producing an annual output value of 177 million yuan, of which 127 million yuan represented industrial output value or about one-third of China's total. The abrupt start and rapid development of rural enterprises represent an unanticipated major byproduct of the reform and opening policy as well as great historical progress in China's rural economic and social developments. Therefore, establishing rural enterprise labor unions by a planned and systematic approach, adjusting as required to the trend, firmly adhering to reality and testing the approach under different circumstances, has significant meaning in terms of promoting development of rural enterprises in China. I. Theoretical Basis for Establishing Rural Enterprise Labor Unions Rural enterprise development is both an important component and a notable feature in establishing socialism with special Chinese characteristics; it is a road that socialist China must travel in order to industrialize. In carrying out industrialization, capitalist countries generally have built up industries by bankrupting agriculture and developed urban cities at the expense of rural areas. China as a socialist country cannot travel down this road. It is a fact of life that some 80 percent of China's population live in rural areas. Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the Party and Central Government, therefore, have advocated giving strong and enthusiastic support to the new initiatives represented by the rural enterprises, vigorously mobilizing millions of peasants to enter into industry and commerce, promoting a new model of laborers who "leave their farmland without leaving their village homes, and who work in factories without going into the cities," and accelerating and strengthening the growth and vigorous development not only of the labor rank and file but of the rural enterprises themselves. Rural enterprise development is important not only in liberating and developing the society's productive force under Marxism, but also in terms of minimizing the three great discrepancies. For a developing socialist country like China with a large population and limited resources, the question of how to gradually eliminate the three great discrepancies and realize common prosperity has very serious theoretical as well as practical implications. Rural enterprise development opens up a major route for reducing the three great discrepancies by effectively strengthening grass-root political power in the new era represented by an industrial-agricultural alliance and at the same time maintaining the integrity of the socialist system. Development of a market-oriented economy implies that more and more people will no longer depend on agriculture for their livelihood. China is in the early stages of socialism and will gradually be changing from an agricultural nation with a majority of population engaged in farming to a modern industrial nation in which nonfarm population will be in the majority. The rapid development of rural enterprises has changed the structures of industrial enterprises and labor rank and file concentrating in urban cities and areas. By 1992, among the 105 million people employed in rural enterprises, approximately 20 million were classified to be "of farming origin, now employed as laborer;" these people basically have completed the peasant-to-laborer transition and now possess the basic characteristics of the labor class. A majority of these laborers are found in the large and medium-sized cities and suburbs along the southeastern coastal areas, and mainly employed in enterprises operated by villages and townships. Although as a category these laborers originally came from rural areas, they have basically left agricultural pursuits to devote full-time to industrial production; their source of livelihood come from wages and their lives are increasing integrated with socialist production. Some of the rural enterprises have come close to or reached domestic and international advanced standards in terms of technological facilities, production scale, management standard and economic strength. Along the coastal areas and in the large and medium-sized cities and surrounding areas, there are many townships that now possess the special characteristics of modern life. The workers in these townships are radically different from the traditional peasants in methods of production, social living, economic and labor relationships as well as concept of values; these workers attach greater importance to the ideology of collectivism and to organizational rules and regulations and they themselves are becoming a major driving force in reform and opening and economic construction. II. Establishing Labor Unions Is An Objective Requirement in Rural Enterprise Development Rural enterprise labor unions are the inevitable products at a certain stage of rural enterprise development. For rural enterprises to continue to develop rapidly, labor unions need to be established because of economic imperatives as well as the need for public support of the masses. Rural enterprises have numerous advantages. From the time they were established, they have developed under market competition in which only the strong and fit survived, and they have demonstrated strong vitality. But in the process of development, several rather common contradictions have remained unresolved: First, the contradiction between the ideological and technical-cultural quality of the work force and the increasingly modernized enterprise management. According to studies, close to 20 percent of the rural enterprise work force has a cultural level of less than secondary or primary education, less than 3 percent has completed secondary schooling or specialized training, and some 43 percent of the total work force are employed in non-technical jobs. Second, the contradiction between the enterprise management and the lively and vigorous market operating system. Rural enterprises have their own lively special characteristics in production management, labor utilization, internal allocations, etc. But due to special circumstances and certain historic conditions, some rural enterprises are still weak in management. Third, the contradiction between the speeding up of enterprise development and the lack of coordination in labor relations. Many rural enterprises still have problems in labor utilization and allocation, working conditions and social welfare. Establishing labor unions represents the urgent and sincere desire of the rural enterprise work force. The workers consider it honorable and satisfying to be members of the labor class by joining labor unions; their desire to join is increasing daily and they hope to exercise their democratic rights through the labor unions and, as union representatives, enter into discussions with management on enterprise production, labor utilization and protection and social welfare; they hope that labor union representatives can help maintain and protect their personal benefits; they also hope that labor unions can assist by providing them with opportunities for further study and training. The majority work force in rural enterprises has shown a great deal of enthusiasm for joining labor unions; according to a survey of 1,200 rural enterprise laborers conducted by Wuxi City, 86 percent of those surveyed indicated they would like to join labor unions. Establishing labor unions also represents the desire of many rural enterprise party and government leaders. Faced with fierce market competition, many rural enterprise cadres in Suzhou City deeply feel the need to catch up in "five aspects in which they are falling behind," namely, as the scale of enterprise is enlarged, the leadership system is falling behind; when enterprise development requires that ideological, moral and technical qualities of the work force be raised continuously, the education of workers is falling behind; because important enterprise decisions also require taking into account the feelings of the masses and their benefits, democratic management is falling behind; while enterprise leadership needs to understand in a timely fashion the thoughts and feelings of the work force, the work in communicating with workers and labor welfare are falling behind; and finally when factory directors and party secretaries are busily engaged in production management, the task of studying and improving labor protection and welfare is falling behind. Many enterprise managers in Wuxi City generally agree that they are "too busy to cope" with four problem areas, namely, enterprise management, ideological education, technical training and solving issues of labor protection and welfare. It is urgently hoped that [rural enterprise labor unions] will effectively "assist" in the same way as labor unions in State-owned enterprises to organize the masses for self-management, to help the enterprise by exercising oversight, and to assist the enterprise leadership to carry out tasks which strengthen the enterprise's drive and competitive strength. According to a survey of over 2,000 rural industrial and commercial enterprises in the suburbs of Wuxi City, 98 percent of the managers agreed that labor unions should quickly be established among the rural enterprises. For rural enterprises to get on track with modernized management and socialized production and to more effectively engage in market competition, we will need to depend on the Party and Government to devise progressive, comprehensive and relevant policies and regulations; much work remains to be done by all parties, with labor unions helping to organize the work force and the laborers themselves relying on their own strength to make progress and at the same time to help promote progress in the rural enterprises. 3. Basis in Policy and Law for Establishing Rural Enterprise Labor Unions It has been exactly 10 years since China's first rural enterprise labor union was established in 1983. During the past 10 years, the Party, Government and labor union organization have paid close attention to the growth of this new army of labor rank and file. In 1984, the All-China Labor Federation began to organize rural enterprise labor unions on a trial basis. In 1988, the CPC Central Committee Politburo Standing Committee, after discussion, approved in principle the "Basic Concept of Labor Union Reform" which states: "All rural enterprises which meet the required conditions should establish labor unions based on the principle of free will of the workers." In August that same year, document No. 17 (1988) of the CPC Central Committee Office of General Administration points out that with rural enterprises developing and strengthening on a daily basis, the trend to establish labor unions should be followed. In 1992, the "Labor Union Law of the People's Republic of China" was promulgated, which clearly specifies that: All workers whose main livelihood is based on wages received from rendering physical or mental labor in any enterprises, organizations or work units -- regardless of nationality, ethnicity, sex, occupation, religious belief or educational level -- shall have the right to legally organize and join labor unions. Not long ago, given the concern of leader cadres and comrades in the Central Government, responsible personnel of the All-China Labor Federation and the Agricultural Ministry, after discussions and coordination, reached agreement on the issue of rural enterprises establishing labor unions and made a number of joint recommendations in the minutes of the meeting. These recommendations provide the basis for political support, legal protection and implementing steps for rural enterprises to establish labor unions. With support from party and government leadership and joint efforts of labor organizations at all levels, close to 20,000 rural enterprises have established labor unions with a total membership approaching 3 million persons, while some 2 million persons are in the process of being unionized. Practically speaking, establishing labor unions in rural enterprises is beneficial in several areas: it strengthens party leadership of having rural enterprises to follow and fulfil in practice the labor class objectives; it strengthens ideological political work and technical job training to raise the quality of the work force; it stabilizes coordination of enterprise-labor relations to maintain the legitimate benefits of the work force; and it strengthens management, promotes development and improves economic benefits of the enterprises. IV. Positively and Practically Carry Out the Work of Establishing Rural Enterprise Labor Unions Gradually establishing rural enterprises labor unions is a glorious mission which history has assigned to us. However, in establishing rural enterprise labor unions, certain concrete and practical conditions must also be met. These conditions include: the enterprise having a legal corporate status, a fixed production site, a certain scale of production, facilities as well as technical expertise, engaging in normal production with a stable work force and earning relatively good economic returns. Based on analysis of data, only 2 percent, or about 400,000, of all rural enterprises at present meet all the conditions for establishing labor unions, and their work force totals approximately 20 million workers. These enterprises are mainly located along the southeastern coastal areas and in the large and medium-size cities and their environs, and most of these are collective enterprises operated by villages and townships. From China's overall standpoint, establishing rural enterprise labor unions at present is still in an experimental stage and should be expanded in principle, but it cannot be done in one stroke. Rural enterprises in the coastal areas, being developed, ready and able to meet the requisite conditions, can gradually proceed on a trial basis; for rural enterprises in China's central area, labor union organizing work is only in the preliminary stages but can be expanded on an experimental basis; in the western area, however, the requisite conditions for establishing rural enterprise labor unions should strictly be observed; but all "foreign funded" rural enterprises, particularly the "three-sources combined" type, should speed up the establishment of labor unions. Among the already established rural enterprise labor unions, we should focus on their special characteristics, concretely develop them and strive to raise their working standards. There are some commonalities between rural enterprise labor unions and their urban counterparts. The former should concentrate on learning from the rich experiences of the latter. At the same time, rural enterprises have their own special characteristics. They cannot copy or transfer wholesale the modus operandi of their urban counterparts; rather, by studying and learning from the work experience of their urban counterparts, rural enterprise labor unions should bravely explore, experiment, gradually shape and perfect the operational parameters of labor unions with special rural enterprise characteristics. Rural enterprises should view enterprise production and economic returns as an integral whole, and mobilize the work force to contribute to the various missions and tasks involved; carry out effective education to raise the quality of the work force; organize the laborers to participate in democratic management, and tap the strength of the masses to run a good enterprise; protect and maintain the legitimate benefits and interests of the work force by coordinating labor relations and stabilizing the labor rank and file; pay special attention to difficulties encountered by the workers, and assist in making and administering gradual improvements in labor conditions and worker welfare; perform more practical services for the workers; prepare and concretely develop cultural and physical programs to energize and enrich the workers' spiritual livelihood, etc.; and fully develop the special advantages of labor unions. Establishing rural enterprise labor unions is a major task that requires an overall, political and mass-oriented focus, it absolutely should not be treated simply as an operational task. With leadership party and government support at all levels, we must probe deeply into the lower levels and investigate, study and constantly summarize experiences of our work in order to shape and perfect relevant policies and measures to promote healthy development in the work of establishing rural enterprise labor unions.
