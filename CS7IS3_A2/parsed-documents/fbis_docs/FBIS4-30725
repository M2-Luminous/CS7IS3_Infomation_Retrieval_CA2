Speaking to THE CAMBODIA TIMES, Under Secretary of State for Tourism, Chenda Sophea Sok said: "The Australian consultancy, Lewis & Partners, are among those who have been holding discussions with the Ministry of Tourism." "The chosen consultancy will have to draw up the terms of reference for the calling of international tenders, marketing and promotional aspects of the tenders worldwide and related aspects. Lewis & Partners have the knowledge relevant to the implementation of casinos and integrated casino-related commercial and tourism projects. However, they will have to rope in, as with other proponents, the relevant real expertise in casino operations," Chenda said. He added that the successful consultancy will have to work with the Cambodian Development Council (CDC) and the Ministry of Tourism for the final preparations of the international tender. "With the establishment of the CDC and the impending ratification of the Investment Law, the international tender for the casino and the airport project will have full transparency and professionalism." Chenda said that the international standard airport to be built on the existing airstrip, about 18 kilometres from the town centre of Sihanoukville, will serve as the catalyst for growth and investments. "The airport will offer operational synergy to investors and casino patrons will be ferried to the island casino, most probably located on Koh Puos island, just off the Sihanoukville navy base." The entire project is expected to be completed by 1997. The key words and essentials which the Ministry of Tourism and the CDC will be looking for is financial capacity, expertise and professionalism. THE CAMBODIA TIMES has learnt that the casino project at Sihanoukville will be the only one as this will be one of the terms of reference demanded by the proposed investors of the project. As such there will not be any other casinos situated elsewhere in the nation, such as in Siem Reap and Koh Kong as initially expected. Lewis & Partners was established in 1986 as a small dynamic agency specialising in Brisbane commercial sites and related projects. Currently, they have ventured into various aspects of real estate development, including the Gold Coast of Australia and various other international standard projects. Chenda added that among the early interested parties for the casino and comprehensive tourism project at Sihanoukville were two large public-listed Malaysian companies, Pilecon Bhd and Genting Bhd. Genting Bhd already operates the casino in Malaysia and also operates various other casino and other hotels worldwide. "With the establishment of the CDC and the new Investment Law, the proposals submitted by the two Malaysian companies will be integrated into the international tender." "The tenders are to be completed by year end and a memorandum of understanding with physical works targeted to commence in early 1995," Chenda added. He added that the Royal Government had decided to initiate the comprehensive casino and airport project as the casino project alone will see the payment of "Up-Front Funds" to the Government. These funds can then be used for other related infrastructural development projects, THE CAMBODIA TIMES has learnt. Besides the casino, Chenda said that various proposals have also been received for quality seaside resort projects at Sihanoukville. "These are currently under review and will be forwarded to the CDC for its comments soon after the proposals are made more concrete and transparent," he added. The casino, airport and hotel are expected to contribute greatly towards the socio-economic growth of Sihanoukville and create numerous employment opportunities.
