China had invited Kim to talk with him about the North Korean nuclear problem and ways for China to help North Korea which is suffering from economic difficulties, according to the source. He quoted Chinese Premier Li Peng as having said to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam during his visit to China in last March that China had asked for Kim Il-song's visit to China. But North Korea judged that it is untimely for Kim Il-song to visit China shortly after South Korean President Kim visited Beijing, Li was quoted as saying. Li expected that the North Korean president would visit China in an appropriate time. The source said, "the Chinese Government recently sent a senior military official to Pyongyang to persuade on North Korean officials to give up alleged nuclear development. I understand that Kim Il- song's visit to China is being pushed for in this context." Meanwhile, China asked South Korea to postpone the visit of Mun Chung-su, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), to China because of the Kim Il-song's visit, the source said.
