"The time is ripe for the economy to recover, with personal consumption showing improvements," Fujii said in a speech read by Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito at a meeting of the National Association of Shinkin Banks. Mieno said, "The economy is showing signs of hitting bottom, with some indicators pointing to improvements in economic activities led by personal consumption." The central bank chief also cited various factors that underscore the improvement of conditions over the same period last year when the economy fell off after showing signs of recovery. They included progressing inventory adjustments and corporate restructuring, the spreading effects of the latest fiscal and monetary measures and recovering overseas economies led by the United States. Fujii also repeated his "confidence" that the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package launched in February and the fiscal 1994 budget would "contribute greatly to putting the economy on a full-fledged recovery." But the two financial leaders noted that the economy also faces possible downward trends. Fujii said, "the economy remains sluggish with tough situations prevailing in capital investment and labor." Mieno said, "cautious watching is still necessary" to see if the recent improvements are sustainable enough to spread to the overall economy. "We must also keep in mind that negative factors prevail," he said, citing continued volatile currency rates, "strong adjustment pressure" on labor, and time needed for balance-sheet adjustments by companies and financial institutions after the collapse of the "bubble" economy boom in the late 1980s. Regarding exchange rates, the central bank chief said, "further careful watching is necessary," suggesting his unchanged stance of intervening in currency markets to stem excessive volatility. Mieno called for continued positive efforts by banks to clear nonperforming loans, saying that liquidations are still "mid-way," although emergence of new bad loans is slowing down.
