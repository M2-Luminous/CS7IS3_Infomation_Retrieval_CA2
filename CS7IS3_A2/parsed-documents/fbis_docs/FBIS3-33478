In an official note, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry stated that the cease-fire can contribute to the successful conclusion, in the short-term, of the negotiations under way in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, between the Angolan Government and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) guerrillas. The note emphasizes that both sides should accept the result of the elections held in September 1992, in which Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos emerged as the winner, and should observe the UN Security Council resolutions calling for a cease-fire. The Brazilian Government stated that the aggravation of the Angolan war in the past few weeks "is more deplorable at a time in which there were sound hopes for peace on the basis of the conversations under way in Lusaka."
