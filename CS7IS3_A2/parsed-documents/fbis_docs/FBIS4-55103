Havel was speaking at a ceremony at Prague Castle at which he appointed two new generals on the occasion of the 49th anniversary of the end of World War Two. Rostislav Kotil will hold the rank during his tenure as commander of the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] South sector. Havel stressed that it was important that the Czech society "be capable of expressing through concrete deeds our willingness, will and courage to both defend our own freedom and independence and to take part in the joint international defence of democratic values anywhere where they are being trampled on." "No one will give us any security guarantees unless he is sure that we ourselves are capable of defending our country and of taking on the broader responsibility which we are demanding on the part of others at the same time," Havel stressed. Present at the ceremony were military attaches from Russia, the United States, Britain and France, and World War Two veterans.
