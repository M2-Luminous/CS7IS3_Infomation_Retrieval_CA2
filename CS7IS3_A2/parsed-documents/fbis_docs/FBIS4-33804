The spokesman pointed out that if the Clinton administration decides to ban commercial flights between the United States and Haiti, the families of diplomatic personnel would have to leave this country and other U.S. nationals would have to be put on alert. President Bill Clinton is expected to announce new sanctions against the Caribbean republic on 10 June. The same source explained that the sanctions could include banning commercial flights and bank transfers with the United States. By the evening of 9 June, the White House had not confirmed that the U.S. President would make such a statement on 10 June. The U.S. spokesman added that the United States is in touch with diplomats in other countries on the sanctions. Less than 100 people continue to work at the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. Their dependents, including women and children, total 70. Fewer than 6,000 U.S. citizens live in Haiti, including those of Haitian origin and 600 U.S. tourists who, among other things, are visiting their families, the U.S. Embassy told AFP. American Airlines, which serves Miami and New York from Port-au-Prince daily, has advised Haitian travel agencies that it will add a daily flight to Miami 16-22 June.
