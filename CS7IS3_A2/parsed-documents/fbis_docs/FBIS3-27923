The steps came on heels of a steep rise of share prices to the highest in four years. The new measures feature expanding the volume of shares to be additionally supplied to the market by 3,200 billion won worth of shares from the initially planned 7,000 billion won worth to 10,200 billion won. Securities authorities announced the first-stage measures to contain excessive stock price increase on last Jan. 17. The government also decided to prepare very shortly steps to have the stock market stabilization fund sell off those shares it holds whose prices have risen recently and buy low-priced issues instead. The 3,200-billion-won increase in the volume of additional supply of shares is set to be made through the listing of some unlisted firms, selling of those shares held by institutional investors, and the selling of government-held shares of those public banks set to be privatized. Depending on the effect these second-stage steps will have on the stock market, the government will, if it is deemed necessary, allow banking institutions to increase their capital beginning May this year.
