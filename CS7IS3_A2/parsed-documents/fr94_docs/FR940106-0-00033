This regulation is needed to control vessel traffic in the immediate vicinity of the event. The regulation will restrict general navigation in the regulated area for the safety of spectators, participants and through traffic.

Dean, Chief, Boating Affairs Branch, Second Coast Guard District, 1222 Spruce Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63103&hyph;2832. The telephone number is (314) 539&hyph;3971, fax (314) 539&hyph;2685. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The drafters of these regulations are LTJG D.R. Dean, Project Officer, Second Coast Guard District, Boating Safety Division and LCDR A.O. Denny, Project Attorney, Second Coast Guard District Legal Office. Regulatory History In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. Specifically, the sponsor's late submission of the regatta application left insufficient time to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in advance of the scheduled event. However, the Coast Guard deems it to be in the public's best interest to issue a regulation now as the benefits of holding the training during the winter, as scheduled, rather than later in the spring will mean less impact on the boating public. Background and Purposes Operation Anzio Reenactment consists of river crossing training for the 19th Engineer Battalion, Fort Knox, Kentucky. The Training will take place over three days, January 20&hyph;22, 1994. Each day's training will begin at 12 p.m., and will end at 3 p.m. local time. In order to provide for the safety of spectators and participants, and for the safe passage of through traffic, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regatta area. The river will be closed during part or all of the effective period to all vessel traffic except participants, official regatta vessels, and patrol craft. These regulations are issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1233 and 33 CFR 100.35. Regulatory Evaluation This regulation is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979), it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and it contains no collection of information requirements. A full regulatory analysis is unnecessary because the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal due to its short duration. Federalism Assessment Under the principles and criteria of Executive Order 12612, this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment Under section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this regulation is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
