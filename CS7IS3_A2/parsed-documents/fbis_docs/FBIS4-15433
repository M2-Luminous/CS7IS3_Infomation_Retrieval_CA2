"In the given situation it will not be possible to sign the agreements initialled and additional talks are needed," the head of government stressed. "But they can only take place after the order in question is recalled at official level." Valdis Birkavs spoke on local television on Thursday evening. He arrived in the studio after cutting short his attendance at a meeting of the governing coalition in the Saeima, and laid out the position of the "Latvias Tselsh" faction, which is part of the coalition with the Christian Union faction. Birkavs has frequently stressed that a treaty on withdrawing troops from Latvia is necessary, but "all obscurities should be removed." In his words, "if a treaty is not signed, great uncertainty will arise given the aggressive aims of Russia expressed in the document signed by Mr. Yeltsin." In his opinion, "Russia has shown that it does not need a treaty, but for Latvia it is necessary." Concern has been caused at the Latvian Foreign Ministry by the information that Russia's Foreign Ministry had not taken part in the drafting of the document. "If that is the case how are the President's orders prepared?" Maris Riekstinsh, Latvian Foreign Ministry state secretary asked. "We have not received any clarifications and have only the report that a mistake was made."
