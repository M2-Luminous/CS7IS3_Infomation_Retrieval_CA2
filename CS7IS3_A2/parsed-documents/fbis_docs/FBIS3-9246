The Greek daily claimed that the pressure exerted by U.S. Ambassador Montgomery was the reason for Zhelev's halfhearted attitude. The nervous reaction of the president's spokesman following the article was counterproductive as usual. Instead of denying the Greek daily's report, it practically confirmed it. Ambassador Montgomery himself further complicated the situation by bringing a whole delegation of highranking U.S. officials to Bulgaria immediately after the denial. Even an acknowledged member of the National Security Council was among them. They admitted discussing the Balkan situation with Bulgarian political forces. People from the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] somewhat self-consciously admitted that they had supported the official Bulgarian policy on the conflict in Bosnia, the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] members did not say anything, and the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] representatives boasted of being the only ones who have a consistent approach on the Balkan issue. As a matter of fact, none of them denied KONTINENT's information that the Americans had tested the approach of the political forces to a more specific interpretation of the nebulous "active neutrality" concept. The interpretation in question would also be likely to include such things as granting an air corridor to Turkey, placing our airports at the disposal of NATO aircraft patrolling Bosnia, and so forth. The current situation can be described as ludicrous not so much because the United States is trying to exert pressure upon us for such activities. It is their right to do so. However, it is our right to refuse them. It is preposterous that we should not do so. It has long since been known that our political forces cannot agree even on matters as elementary as two plus two. Nevertheless, whenever foreign emissaries are touring their party headquarters trying to persuade them to support one state to the detriment of another, their unfortunate Bulgarian constituents who still live in a country situated between these two states are entitled to hear a firmer stand than the little jokes about "we would be glad if Mr. Montgomery interfered in our domestic affairs."
