We held talks with Minister of Foreign Affairs Hikmet Cetin and Under Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Ozdem Sanberk. One of the issues we discussed was the relationship between Turkey and the United States. In other words, we exchanged views on the new kind of relations emerging between the two countries since the cold war era ended. The matter came up when we were exchanging views on whether or not the U.S. aid package for Turkey should be rejected. That is currently an important issue on the diplomatic back burner. A number of diplomats argue that it should be immediately rejected.... Several others are inclined to take a more professional approach on the matter. They maintain that an effort should be made to find an approach more effective than ostentatious and daring initiatives. Meanwhile, several diplomats have described Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's statement that her government may reject the conditional U.S. aid as an example of diplomatic blunder. As far as the U.S. aid package is concerned, the general view is that it should not be accepted if conditions are linked with it.... However, the diplomatic struggle must be maintained against this bias in the U.S. Congress.... Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin shares that view. What can be done? It will be useful to discuss several points before that question is considered. We still have the old habbit of referring to what we receive from the United States as U.S. aid. However, what we actually receive from that country is not aid but credits in accordance with the existing market conditions.... The U.S. Congress is gradually reducing the U.S. aid package to foreign countries because the Soviet Union has collapsed and the cold war has ended. The U.S. military aid is expected to end in a few years.... That is why the Turkish officials think like this: The aid is going to end. Let us be the side which is more daring. The material aspect of the matter is not important. Therefore, the aid package should be rejected right now, at this moment. Another reason put forward by those who support that view is as follows: The anti-Turkish lobby in the United States--that is, the Greek Cypriot, Greek, and Armenian lobbies--have exploited the question of U.S. aid to Turkey for many years. (The Serbs have now moved to support those lobbies) They have harmed Turkey-U.S. relations by imposing conditions because of the Cyprus problem and other issues. The rejection of the aid will deprive them of their opportunity to harm Turkey. The Human Rights Lobby The general view among the Turkish Foreign Ministry officials is that the U.S. aid package cannot be accepted in its present form, that is, with the conditions that have been linked to it in connection with the Cyprus problem, human rights issues, and the Kurdish problem. However, it is a fact that the rejection of the aid package will not resolve the problem. Human rights has been an important issue in the relations between Turkey and the United States for several years. Therefore, even if military aid is taken off the agenda, the question of human rights will continue to be discussed in the congressional back rooms. That point must always be kept in mind. Even if Congress approves the conditional aid package to Turkey, President Clinton is not expected to veto it. That state of affairs will affect not only Turkey's relations with the United States, but also with the European Countries. Congress' decision will set an example for the European countries on matters related to Cyprus, human rights, and the Kurdish problem.... This matter should be considered calmly. The conditional aid package should be rejected. However, that will not resolve the problem. Looking at the relations between Turkey and the United States only from that angle would be wrong. Let us consider the matter from a wider perspective. Dangerous trends -- such as chauvinism, extreme nationalist-conservative forces, and religious trends -- are gradually strengthening in Turkey.... Those forces must not be allowed to influence Turkey's policy toward the United States and Europe. Turkey has decided to join the European club. It is a member of the OECD, NATO, the European Council, and CSCE. It is in the customs union with the European Union. It is striving to take a place among the top countries in the world, not the Third World countries. Turning its back on the Western countries and allowing its relations with the United States and Europe to deteriorate would not be in Turkey's interest. Nor would it be in its interest to close its doors to the outside world, concern itself only with its own problems, and seek nonexistent horizons because of the rhetoric that "the Western countries do not like us." It can be said that the same situation applies to the United States and Europe from the geostrategic viewpoint. That is true. Losing Turkey would not be in the interests of the United States and Europe.... That, however, must not be exaggerated.... To See the Greatness.... What can be done under the existing conditions? It is essential for Turkey to put its house in order. It has to rectify its economy, improve its adherence to democracy, separate the Kurdish problem from its struggle against the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], and take the necessary steps in that regard from the point of view of democracy and human rights.... Turkey has no alternative as the new century draws closer. Turkey, which has a population of 60 million people, will draw closer to the United States and Europe if it improves its economy. The United States and Europe will regard Turkey as an inalienable partner if it removes its deficiencies in applying democratic principles and adhering to human rights.... Turkey is a great country. Neither the PKK nor the Kurdish problem should be allowed to influence its relations with the Western countries. Let us hope that the officials have enough foresight to realize its greatness. In short, whether or not U.S. aid is rejected is not important. Turkey has to have a broader concept of the future.
