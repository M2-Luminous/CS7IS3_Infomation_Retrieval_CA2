Firemen are still in front of the prison caring for inmates who jumped from the third floor of the prison to avoid a raging fire and sustained broken bones. Some of them do not know how the massacre started; others say that hooded individuals initiated a war that culminated with the death of innocent people. Apparently, the people involved in these incidents are very dangerous. [Begin recording] [Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Bocony, Zulia State National Guard commander] We removed the bodies of 101 inmates and 49 injured people yesterday. Of the 49, two died later. The official count so far is 103 dead. There are 15 inmates registered in various local hospitals right now. [Judge Salvador Cubillan] This was the result of a vendetta from inmates in the rehabilitation area of the prison against inmates in another area. [Unidentified reporter] Why a vendetta? [Cubillan] For having banning visits Sunday, when shots were fired; as a reprisal, these inmates tried this. [Reporter] How many bodies have been identified? [Cubillan] Approximately 60. [end recording] Once informed of the tragedy, Justice Minister Fermin Marmol Leon arrived in Maracaibo to meet with Governor Lolita Aniyar de Castro and to inspect the prison. Marmol Leon said that in view of this situation, security measures will be adopted. These measures include the transfer of certain inmates to other prison centers as well, and, most important, as thorough changes in the prison directorship. [sentence as heard] [Begin recording] [Marmol Leon] Perhaps our judicial processes are too slow. I do not want to say that the Judicial Branch is to blame for what has happened. I am going to present to the new Congress a bill calling for reforms to the criminal trials code so that this procedure can move faster. Perhaps this will help those being tried. [Aniyar de Castro] We are going to appoint a new team to direct this prison and a new guard personnel. We have been in contact with the Rafael Urdaneta Center, which is in charge of building new prisons, so that it will build a prison as soon as possible, perhaps before December, even if only half of the cells are ready at that time, and we are going to use space available in the National Prison, which was partially set on fire, to take some preventive measures that will help until the new prison begins functioning. [end recording] Regarding this massacre in the National Prison of Sabaneta, Maracaibo, it has been reported that the prison system director will be arriving in Maracaibo within the next few hours to initiate the transfer of the individuals responsible for this accident, which has shocked both the national and international public.
