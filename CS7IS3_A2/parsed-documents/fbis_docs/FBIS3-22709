The number is low compared to the United States which already has 340,000 patients with full-blown AIDS and where one person in 200 is estimated to either have AIDS or is HIV positive. The team said their forecast is lower than original estimates. It would mean that by early next century only one in every 7,000 people in Japan would have AIDS or be HIV positive. Mitsuhiro Kamakura, a member of the team who lectures at Keio University's school of medicine, attributed the low forecast in part to what he said was Japan's high average standard of education, and its low numbers of homosexuals and drug users. The team's findings will be announced in detail at a meeting of the Japanese Society for Hygiene in Kanazawa from April 6. In late 1993, the ministry's AIDS Surveillance Committee said Japan had 1,410 known HIV-positive and AIDS patients, excluding those infected through tainted blood transfusions, but that the real figure could be nine times as high. In July last year, the committee also predicted some 26,000 HIV-positive and AIDS patients in Japan by 1998. The revised estimate was reached after consulting 80 experts on all aspects of AIDS. The estimate also takes account of the probability of the development of an AIDS vaccine. The estimate for 2000 includes about 3,100 AIDS patients and about 14,700 persons who are HIV positive. The committee said there is a 52.6 percent chance of a viable AIDS vaccine by 2005.
