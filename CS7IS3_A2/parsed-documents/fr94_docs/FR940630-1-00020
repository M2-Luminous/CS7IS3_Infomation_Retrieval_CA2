FR940630-1-00020 FR940630-1-00005 The Commonwealth submittal contains the written technical specifications for all test equipment to be used in the program. The specifications require the use of computerized test systems. The specifications also include performance features and functional characteristics of the computerized test systems which meet the federal I/M regulations and are approvable. Quality Control_40 CFR Part 51.359 Quality control measures shall insure that emission measurement equipment is calibrated and maintained properly, and that inspection, calibration records, and control charts are accurately created, recorded and maintained. The Commonwealth's submittal contains the RFP and the contractors' proposal which describe and establish quality control measures for the emission measurement equipment, record keeping requirements and measures to maintain the security of all documents used to establish compliance with the inspection requirements. This portion of the Commonwealth's submittal complies with the quality control requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 51.359 and is approvable. Waivers and Compliance Via Diagnostic Inspection_40 CFR Part 51.360 The federal I/M regulation allows for the issuance of a waiver, which is a form of compliance with the program requirements that allows a motorist to comply without meeting the applicable test standards. For enhanced I/M programs, an expenditure of at least $450 in repairs, adjusted annually to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as compared to the CPI for 1989, is required in order to qualify for a waiver. Waivers can only be issued after a vehicle has failed a retest performed after all qualifying repairs have been made. Any available warranty coverage must be used to obtain repairs before expenditures can be counted toward the cost limit. Tampering related repairs shall not be applied toward the cost limit. Repairs must be appropriate to the cause of the test failure. Repairs for 1980 and newer model year vehicles must be performed by a recognized repair technician. The federal regulation allows for compliance via a diagnostic inspection after failing a retest on emissions and requires quality control of waiver issuance. The SIP must set a maximum waiver rate and must describe corrective action that would be taken if the waiver rate exceeds that committed to in the SIP. Act 166 and the Pennsylvania I/M regulation provide the necessary authority to issue waivers, set and adjust cost limits, administer and enforce the waiver system, and set a $450 cost limit and allow for an annual adjustment of the cost limit to reflect the change in the CPI as compared to the CPI in 1989. The Pennsylvania regulation, RFP, and the contractors' proposal include provisions which address waiver criteria and procedures, including cost limits, tampering and warranty related repairs, quality control and administration. These provisions meet the federal I/M regulations requirements and are approvable. The Pennsylvania I/M regulation requires repairs for 1980 and later model year vehicles to be performed by a recognized repair technician. The Commonwealth's regulation allows for compliance via diagnostic inspection and the policies and procedures outlined in the submittal meet federal I/M regulations and are approvable. The Commonwealth's regulation does not allow for time extensions. The Commonwealth has set a maximum waiver rate of 3% for both pre-1981 and 1981 and later vehicles and has described corrective actions to be taken if the waiver rate exceeds 3%. This waiver rate has been used in the performance standard modeling demonstration and is approvable. The waiver provisions of the SIP meet federal requirements and are approvable. Motorist Compliance Enforcement_40 CFR Part 51.361 The federal regulation requires that compliance shall be ensured through the denial of motor vehicle registration in enhanced I/M programs unless an exception for use of an existing alternative is approved. An enhanced I/M area may use either sticker-based enforcement programs or computer-matching programs if either of these programs were used in the existing program and it can be demonstrated that the alternative has been more effective than registration denial. For newly implementing enhanced areas, including newly subject areas in a state with an I/M program in another part of the state, there is no provision for enforcement alternatives in the Act. The SIP shall provide information concerning the enforcement process, legal authority to implement and enforce the program, and a commitment to a compliance rate to be used for modeling purposes and to be maintained in practice. Both Act 166 and the Pennsylvania I/M regulation provide the legal authority to implement a registration denial system. The Pennsylvania SIP commits to a compliance rate of 96% which was used in the performance standard modeling demonstration and is approvable. The submittal includes detailed information concerning the registration denial enforcement process which meets the federal I/M regulation requirements and is approvable. Motorist Compliance Enforcement Program Oversight_40 CFR Part 51.362 The federal I/M regulation requires that the enforcement program shall be audited regularly and shall follow effective program management practices, including adjustments to improve operation when necessary. The SIP shall include quality control and quality assurance procedures to be used to insure the effective overall performance of the enforcement system. An information management system shall be established which will characterize, evaluate and enforce the program. The Pennsylvania SIP describes in general how the enforcement program oversight is quality controlled and quality assured and includes the establishment of an information management system.
