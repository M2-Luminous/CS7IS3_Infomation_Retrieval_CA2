FBIS4-37019 "drnes116_l_94005" FBIS-NES-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 ISRAEL General Describes Situation in Autonomy Areas General Describes Situation in Autonomy Areas TA1606053094 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 0400 GMT 16 Jun 94 TA1606053094 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] Just about one month since the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, Israel's coordinator in the territories described the transition as smooth, but said the problem for the Palestinians remains that of lack of funds. Major General Dani Rothschild, in a briefing to reporters, said the Palestinian Authority needs startup funds for salaries and operating costs. In a meeting in Paris last week, donor countries gave $42 million for operating costs. But the Palestinian budget is three to four time that of what had been under Israeli administration. Rothschild said the increase comes from having to finance the police force. Previously security needs had been supplied mostly by the Israel Army. Those costs came from a separate budget. Rothschild also said Israel is continuing to provide basic services, including electricity, water, and telephones to the Palestinians in the autonomous areas, but the Palestinians will recompense Israel when they can. [Begin Rothschild recording] We didn't leave a paradise there. With a population as big as in Gaza, with a poor infrastructure, with lack of jobs, and with a very high birth rate, it's almost impossible to create a paradise. Having said that, we ensured that everyone who needs the basic service will get it. Now, here and there we hear about people who didn't get the services, and we are dealing every day with exceptions, but at the end of the day those are exceptions, because the Israeli Government has the responsibility to finance all those services which I just mentioned until the Palestinian Authority will have sufficient resources to finance itself. The answer is no, the Israeli Government will not finance those services, but having said that, the Israeli Government will ensure that those services are going to be given to the Palestinian Authority and in the meantime Israel will pay for it, and in the future Israel and the Palestinian Authority, in a joint economic committee which was decided upon in Paris, will sit and will arrange all those bills, so eventually the Palestinian Authority will have to pay.
