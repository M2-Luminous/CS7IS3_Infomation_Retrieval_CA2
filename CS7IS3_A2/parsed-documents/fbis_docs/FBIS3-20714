Vasic and S. Colakovski: "Party Boomerang: Youth on the Margins of Political Life"] [Text] Does the formation of a new generation for the parties, immediately before the elections, mean that young people will only stick up election posters or serve as stage decoration in the electoral campaign? To "those for whom the future waits," there is a feeling of disorientation, that the compass shows a constantly changing direction in the current social environment. It is reflected impressionably in political undertakings; young people do not eagerly attend our political gatherings. In the last election, not a single party considered them a serious part of the voting public. They were only -- literally only -- used by the parties with extremely nationalistic orientation. By the same token, their voice and considerations (isn't there a paradigm: youth means progress?) could be heard to the same extent that they would obtain in commitments. In the final analysis, it adds up to negligence. In the domestic political atmosphere, only some parties formed their own political youth groups and, then, two years after the first multiparty election. First of all, it was done when the necessity of "fresh blood for the party" finally became clear and probably when the significance of the youth factor began to be seriously considered. What is perhaps symptomatic, everything that is happening now is precisely for encountering a new election. Up to now, young people were only one of the marginalized items in prescriptions in the party programs. Perhaps because of the already mentioned reasons, the political life this autumn, despite other distractions, also emphasized the trend of forming political youth groups in a few more parties. Except for brief party announcements to the public about the formation of their youth groups, the public has had little way to discern young political activism. Perhaps, it was a matter of strictly controlled party secrets or because the youth groups existed only formally. "We Are Not `Guerrillas'" How do all the political youth groups that currently exist on the Macedonian political scene work? The first parties that formed youth groups, approximately at the same time two years ago, were the SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia] with the Social Democratic Youth and the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization -- Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity] with the Union of Youth Forces. During the next few months, the political ambience was enriched by another three youth groups: the Democratic Youth of the DP [Democratic Party], the Youth Forum of the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity], and the Liberal Youth Union of the LP [Liberal Party]. Generally, the organizational appointments of all the youth groups are arranged according to the model of the senior part of the respective party, and in every case, without exception, the primary people in the youth groups are incorporated in the leading body of the mother party. We already mentioned that the SDMM [Social Democratic Youth of Macedonia] and the UMS [Union of Youth Forces] have had the longest period of existence. According to Toni Apostolovski, general secretary of the SDMM: "The Social Democratic Youth of Macedonia fundamentally acts in an independent manner. It clearly understands that fact and usually expresses its opinion on all the problems of young people. Through the speakers' platforms, which we often organize, we try to listen to the views of our members and, more broadly, those of young people. All the activities of the SDMM are financed by the party, and we have formed our own projects, but things have not worked as it should up to now." While the young social democrats are proud of their international collaboration with foreign youth groups sharing similar origins, the extent of cooperation with youth groups from the other Macedonian parties is a different matter. The SDMM maintains that there is no concrete cooperation. The reasons were reflected in the political situation existing at the time of their formation and in the difference in attitudes the groups represented. In connection with the approaching election, it is said that the SDMM will participate in the development of the electoral campaign. A definite number of young people are expected to appear on the electoral lists, and Apostolovski concludes that, "considering the fact that the majority of our members are students, we are focusing on that part of the population in the approaching election." Bearing in mind the current activeness of our political youth groups, one gets the impression that the Union of Youth Forces of the VMRO-DPMNE started out in a more organized way. "The UMS has autonomy in its work and a degree of financial independence," asserts Robert Ljusev, chairman of the UMS. According to him, unlike the other youth groups, those under age 18 can become members of the UMS, but only those of legal age can commit themselves politically. Frequently, the fan clubs of the "guerrillas" are identified with the youth group of the VMRO-DPMNE, however, Ljusev says that: "The `guerrillas' are something different. The UMSM [UMS-Macedonia] has no connection with them; it does not work with them. Some of the `guerrillas' are, however, members of our youth group. Sometimes, we have even tried to make an armistice between the `tripe-eaters' [ckembarite] and the `guerrillas,' but without success. I think it is a matter of an unhealthy rivalry between Skopje and Bitola." In a subsequent conversation concerning his international contacts, the UMS chairman said that their basic goal is to join the European organization of right-wing-oriented youth groups of the political parties, DEMYS [Democratic Youth Community of Europe]. As far as cooperation with other political youth groups in Macedonia, the UMS thinks that it is at a correct level. They had made arrangements for their mutual debut with the SDMM at an international youth meeting that was held in Bulgaria where only the views of Macedonia's youth were represented. Finally, Ljusev explained the basic political strategy of the UMS: "from the members of our youth group, we will try to create an elite of skilled young cadres who will be educated abroad and will, in some future election, be the `thrusting needle' of the VMRO-DPMNE." Juniors and Seniors The Democratic Youth of the DP, the Liberal Youth of the LP, and the Youth Forum of the PDP are political youth groups of a more recent vintage. Characteristic of them is the fact that they were established initially throughout the country, but up to now, they have lacked particular activeness. Nevertheless, they have announced a serious commitment to the approaching election. "The function of the youth group is to assist the seniors, but we are independent in conveying the resolutions of the organization and its activities," says Vesna Jovanova, the general secretary of the Democratic Youth. "In our youth group, we will try to work in a decentralized manner, and the Coordinating Body is the highest organ. We have not had international contacts up to now, and probably will not implement any until the party makes [similar] ones. We expect a victory in the coming election, and that is the basis for our ever-increasing membership," Jovanova concludes optimistically. The Youth Forum of the PDP was formed three months ago. The members of the Forum say that among young people there is the greatest interest in the organization. Drita Osmani, secretary of the Youth Forum, emphasizes: "We do not act independently, but only within the framework of the party. That means that we pursue the tasks which are already endorsed in the program. Up to now, we have been active only in the jurisdiction of the PDP in Opstina Centar [possibly Tetovo] where the initiative to form the Forum also arose. First of all, we will propose changes in the educational system, as well as for the eradication of the anomalies of life: drug adiction, prostitution, and alcoholism." The youth group of the LP -- the Liberal Youth Union -- was established formally not quite 30 days ago. The Chairman of the Liberal Youth Union Andjelka Peeva tells us: "The initiative to form such a union already existed two years ago, but our appraisal was that for Macedonians, liberalism was still early and, therefore, our Initiative Committee attended international meetings of liberal youth groups in Europe and benefitted from their ideas and experiences in order to develop a program like the one the LUM now has." She continues: "The opstina committees do not currently operate as they should; we will have to work on that. We have some projects in mind, and sports days and media presentations to promote the message and to inform drug abusers that it is possible to live without drugs." The formation of youth groups opens a new chapter in our political life. The necessity of rejuvenating party ranks is a customary practice in countries with much longer democratic traditions. When will it finally be understood that it is the parties that need young people, not the reverse? Does the formation of youth groups, coming immediately ahead of an election, mean that these young people will mainly serve by sticking up campaign posters or by providing stage decoration for the electoral campaign? Shortsightedness about domestic political supporters along those lines could, doubtlessly, come back like a boomerang!
