We must not try to blindly compete for higher growth rates. In order to realize an organic combination of speed and benefit, we must carry out the unified industrial policies of the state and improve production structure, product mix, and enterprise organizational structure. We must also try hard to promote scientific and technological progress, raise the quality of workers, strengthen the management of our enterprises, and lower production costs. In the past year, under the leadership of Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, the economy of our country has grown rapidly, reform has entered a stage of overall progress, and the whole economic situation has been going well. Since the beginning of last summer, in light of the conspicuous contradictions and problems arising in the course of rapid economic development, the party Central Committee and the State Council have taken prompt measures to deepen the reform and strengthen and improve the macroeconomic regulation and control using mainly economic methods. We have achieved positive results. While fully affirming our achievements, we should also soberly recognize that many deep-level problems have not been solved once and for all, and that the macroeconomic regulation and control measures already implemented have worked on the surface but have not yet solved the underlying problems. Our ultimate purpose is a fundamental reform of the economic structure and the establishment of a socialist market economy. What merits our attention is that, due to the excessive scale or unrestricted expansion of investment in fixed assets, excessive price increases, and the excessive volume of currency put into circulation, the inflationary pressure has not eased and the macroenvironment as a whole is still rather tense. These are, however, hardly unavoidable in the process of establishing a socialist market economy. Practical experience tells us that the process of marketization must be coordinated with macroeconomic regulation and control capabilities. The better the macroeconomic regulation and control, the fewer problems there will be and the more easily they can be solved. At present, the focus of macroeconomic regulation and control is strict control of the scale of investment in fixed assets. Our construction scope must correspond to the power of the country, and be well within the limit. We cannot "adapt" to the continuous expansion of the scale of construction by issuing excessive currency. We are determined to carry out to the full and put into practice in every aspect and every field of endeavor the series of policies and measures of macroeconomic regulation and control determined by the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core for a fundamental reform of our economic system after long meticulous study. Things like "lower-level authorities having their own ways in dealing with policies from higher-level authorities" and each unit going its own way without listening (to the central government) must be totally eliminated. The interests of the whole should be taken into account. The authority of the party Central Committee should be upheld. This is the first point I want to make. What should we do to correctly handle the relationship between speed and benefit? On 2 February, at a symposium on "Improving Economic Benefits in China," I gave a lecture entitled "Organically Combining Speed of Development With Economic Benefit" based on my practical experience. In this talk I expressed some of my opinions and quoted Comrade Xiaoping's words on his southern journey: "Development is the last word." "Do not hinder the development pace if it is possible to achieve it. Wherever conditions permit, you should develop as fast as possible. So long as attention is given to economic returns, quality and export-oriented economy, there is not much to worry about." "China's economy should strive to mount a new level in several years. Of course, I am not calling for high speed beyond our ability. We should work in a down-to-earth manner, stess economic returns and develop steadily and proportionately." I think this has been Comrade Xiaoping's consistent thought. The key to maintaining a sustained, rapid and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of our national economy lies in an accurate and comprehensive understanding of this thought, and carrying out an organic combination of development speed and economic benefits. It should be pointed out that in our economic work, carrying out this guiding thought of Comrade Xiaoping has not been entirely voluntary. Given that the rate of development is now already sufficiently high, and people are quite enthusiastic, I would like to emphasize that we should concentrate our attention on increasing economic benefits. Compared with advanced countries, our low industrial economic benefits have as yet remained relatively unchanged. One-sidedly seeking high output value and quantity without regard to quality or variety; being concerned only with what one can produce without regard to sales or market demand; seeking greater production scope without regard to improving the economic structure; seeking high investment volume, large production scope and new projects without regard to whether they can be sustained by national power and financial and material resources--all these are in fact influences from the product economic thought of the past. In some enterprises and some places they have almost become a chronic ailment, bringing about serious problems in the development of our cause. Along with the development of the socialist market economy, it is now high time to wake up completely. We should have an accurate and correct understanding of the central authorities' idea of seizing the opportunity and speeding up development. We should not one- sidedly take it as allowing us to neglect economic laws and blindly seek higher growth rates. I remember what Comrade Xiaoping said in 1985 when the Seventh Five-Year Plan was being discussed: "A 7 percent growth rate is not low. A rate that is too high will bring about many problems and will have a negative influence on the reform and social conduct. It would be better to be steady. We must control investment in fixed assets. The scope of construction should not be too large. We must put management and quality first, and strive for economic and overall social benefits. Such a growth rate is good." The central authorities have set the rate of development during the Eighth Five-Year Plan at 8 to 9 percent. I think this is both active and safe. We should genuinely shift the emphasis of our economic work onto the track of taking improvement of economic benefits as the only link. Only such a rate of development can be said to be both down-to-earth and practical. Since an excessive scale of capital construction is beyond the power of the country, we would finally be forced to make adjustments and lose the opportunity for development, and this would slow down our socialist modernization. When speeding up development, we must stick to seeking truth from facts. We must not try blindly to compete for higher growth rates. We should combine speed with efficiency, quality, and the market in light of the specific conditions in different enterprises and localities. We must strive to reach achievable faster development on the basis of raising efficiency. In order to realize an organic combination of speed and efficiency, we must implement the unified industrial policies of the state, and improve the industrial structure, product mix, and enterprise organizational structure. Imbalance in structure has always been the major obstacle to the healthy development of China's economy. It is also the major obstacle to raising economic efficiency. In terms of industrial development, we must concentrate on solving the problem of basic industries, especially energy and transportation, lagging behind processing industries; the problem of overdeveloped processing industries being much too overdeveloped, and the underdeveloped processing industries being much too underdeveloped; and the problem of the low-level specialization and socialization of enterprises. We should strive for a great improvement in economic structures, and base the improvement of economic efficiency on continuous structural improvement. In order to realize an organic combination of speed and efficiency, we must try hard to promote scientific and technological progress, and raise the quality of workers. Comrade Xiaoping's idea that science and technology are the primary productive force is of great strategic significance. Science, technology and education are the key to changing the low economic efficiency of our industries and to the strategic transformation of extensive management into intensive management. We should conscientiously do a good job of training in-service staff, raise their quality, create a generation of new people who have ideals, morals, education and a sense of discipline, and raise the quality of workers. While digesting and assimilating imported technology, we should carry out a strategy of upgrading technology, gradually moving from a policy of adopting imported technologies to a policy of independent research and development, so that we can shorten the distance between China and the world's advanced countries in the field of science and technology development. In order to realize an organic combination of speed and efficiency, we must strengthen the management of enterprises and lower production costs. The end results of the materialized labor in factories--products--will finally enter the market in the form of merchandise, for which there are no national borders. Higher quality products and lower prices will win in market competition. Comrade Xiaoping has pointed out: "China has many things that can be exported." "The key to sales in foreign markets lies in improving quality. If our quality is poor there will be no competitive power." To achieve this, it will not do not to establish a modern enterprise management system and it will not do not to have strict scientific management; it will not do not to turn our eyes inward, practice strict economy, and put a lot of effort into improving productivity. In this sense we can say that management brings about benefits. In general, it is an arduous and complicated systems engineering task to follow the path of development with an improvement in economic benefits as the key link. We have to continuously make explorations in practice, promptly summarize our experiences and hold on to it persistently.
