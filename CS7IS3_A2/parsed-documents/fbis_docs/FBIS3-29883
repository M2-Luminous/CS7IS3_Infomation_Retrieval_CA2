(KOTRA) said yesterday. KOTRA quoted statistics from the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry as indicating that Korea suffered a trade shortfall of $420 million with Japan last month, up 46.3 percent from a year before. The country's exports to Tokyo in January increased 14.3 percent from the corresponding period of last year to $970 million, while its imports from it grew 22.4 percent to $1.39 billion. "The increase in the trade shortfall with the neighboring country will continue for the time being because Korea has to buy more parts from Japan at more expensive prices as a result of the strong yen," a KOTRA official said. He said Korea will find it difficult to correct the chronic trade deficit with Japan as it still heavily relies on Japanese imports of capital goods to make more products and increase exports. Shipments of light industrial goods and electronic products face an uphill battle in maintaining their market shares in Japan now that those products made by China and Thailand, Japan's major overseas production bases, are expected to take bigger shares. China posted a $596 million surplus with Japan in the first month of this year, down from $753 million a year ago, KOTRA said citing Japanese estimates. Japan's whole exports stood at $25.9 billion in January, up 7.5 percent from the same period of last year and its imports rose 4.8 percent to $19.8 billion. Its trade surplus increased 17 percent to $6.1 billion. As advanced countries, mainly the U.S., mounted trade pressure on Japan to correct its huge trade surplus, Japan's exports to industrialized countries declined by 21 percent last month, while those to developing countries grew by 27.4 percent. Japan saw an increase in exports of such manufactured goods as electronics parts (39.2 percent), metal products (54.3 percent) and auto parts (15.1 percent). However, Japan reduced shipments of vehicles by 16.6 percent, audio equipment 7.5 percent and automatic data processors 11.1 percent. Japan's imports of crude oil and petrochemical products declined by 21.9 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively, while those of semiconductors rose by 50.5 percent, autos 42.9 percent and machinery 27.8 percent.
