The Helsinki report refutes the claims of the Macedonian authorities that the government's policies have resulted in improving relations between the different nationalities in the country. The report declares that the policies of the present Government of Macedonia to promote better relations among different nationalities is essentially the same as those of the previous governments of the country. The present government, in fact, has done nothing to improve the position of the Albanians, who make up 40 percent of the population, according to a statement by the Democratic Popular Party with headquarters in Tetove. Observers agree that the future of Macedonia will depend on harmonious relations between the Albanian and the Slav Macedonian populations. One of the most important requests of the ethnic Albanians is for a census, which has been the subject of a heated debate in the Macedonian parliament. The Albanian deputies have supported the request of the European census commission experts, that all nationalities in the republic be represented on the national and communal commissions which will carry out the census.
