FBIS3-24974 "drafr024_a_94001" FBIS-AFR-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 February 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Burundi Situation Described as Tense; Death Toll Rises to 60 AB0302225194 London BBC World Service in English 1515 GMT 3 Feb 94 AB0302225194 London BBC World Service Language: English Article Type:BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] It's today since the Burundi opposition postponed the two-day general strike call until next Monday [7 February]. [sentence as heard] The idea was to allow people in Bujumbura to get some shopping and for workers to collect their pay packets. The strike call was a protest against the appointment of a new president to replace Melchior Ndadaye, who was killed in an Army uprising last October, and the final trigger was the sacking by the largely Hutu government of the Constitutional Court at the weekend. It was dominated by Tutsi judges. Since then, there's been a wave of ethnic killings in Bujumbura. The death toll has been put at around 60, and that kept a lot of people off the streets yesterday. And last night, more violence left a further 10 dead. On the line to Bujumbura, Josephine Hazely asked our correspondent, Bonaventure Ndiguimana, what the situation was today: [Begin recording] [Ndiguimana] I think the situation is very tense and dangerously evolving. Since yesterday night, there were so many grenade blasts, and gunfire was heard all night long. If we consider the number of casualties, 10 in one night, 10 wounded--including three gendarmes--and if we add those to the 46 announced yesterday by the gendarmerie, we can say that the situation is seriously jeopardized. [Hazely] So, have you been down to the town center today at all? [Ndiguimana] Yes, I have been downtown. The traffic was at minimum. Many businesses were closed down. Public offices were closed down, but private cars could circulate freely, since the road blockades were removed. But I can say that public transport was very much disrupted. [Hazely] Now, I understand the opposition met with the Army yesterday. Is there any word on what went on between the two groups? [Ndiguimana] No, nothing released out of the meeting. No official statement was released. Some rumors had said that they were plotting a coup d'etat, but this has been denied by the chief of staff in charge of gendarmeries. Some news had said that the Army and the opposition were organizing the coup. It is not true. [Hazely] I understand that the human rights league has made a statement about the situation in Burundi, especially in the capital, Bujumbura. What is the main source of the message? [Ndiguimana] The two human rights leagues, ITECA and SONERA [expansions not given], have issued statements, calling politicians to be aware of the situation of their people who are in the countryside and those who are dying in the capital city. So, they have condemned acts of violence, and they have called the government to restore the judges of the Constitutional Court in their duties. The UN special envoy in Bujumbura, Mr. Abdallah, also issued a strong message to the political class, saying that they should look into the direction of restoring peace and order because war is not solution in this country.
