The war in Abkhazia has overshadowed the tragic events taking place there. Sometimes the press or mass media remind us in short reports that the situation in Samachablo is ostensibly normal.... A Georgian would use this word ironically as anyone who has a good knowledge of the prevailing situation there would, I believe, not call it normal.... Let us begin with the fact that the so-called South Ossetian supreme council has adopted a new constitution whereby so-called South Ossetia consists of four rayons: Tskhinvali, Znauri, Java, and Leningori. Tskhinvali, the capital of so-called South Ossetia is preparing for new elections. Georgian jurisdiction does not extend to Georgian territory in Samachablo. The Russian ruble is the only currency in circulation there. This probably contributes to the fact that the so-called [Russian] peacekeeping troops brought into Samachablo are naturally defending the interests of the Ossetian side. Samachablo and, in particular, Tskhinvali have become a thriving center for the narcotics business that is so widespread in Georgia. It is a known fact that 80 percent of the cars hijacked in Georgia are driven to Samachablo and exchanged for drugs that are brought in freely through the Roki Tunnel [linking South and North Ossetia]. We have also learned that, apparently, "brave" Georgian men are bringing to Tskhinvali girls aged between 14 and 17 and are now starting to exchange this "live commodity" also for drugs. One way or another, the current authorities either are "unable to see" or do not want to see the complex political situation that has taken shape in Samachablo. [passage omitted] Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Guram Beruashvili, a member of the all-Georgian Merab Kostava Society, has been elected chairman of the gamgeoba [board of administration] of the Eredvi temi [commune, embracing a number of villages in Gori rayon]. [passage omitted] In our conversation with him, Batoni Guram pointed out with chagrin that, leaving aside the political situation that had taken shape, the narcotics business had become one of the most painful problems in Samachablo today. In spite of the fact that the Georgian police were doing everything to capture the car thieves and those supplying them with drugs, the Ossetians, with the help of the Russian peacekeeping troops, were nevertheless managing to secure their release. Those involved in the narcotics business here are mainly Ossetians who freely bring in drugs via the Roki Tunnel from the North Caucasus. The authorities should probably devise additional measures to halt these crimes as the actions of the Ossetian side, encouraged by Russian support, have already become brazen. [passage omitted]
