It is true that the draft of the new constitution as a whole still has to be adopted. But everyone understands very well that this is only a formality. Moreover, it is already known when it will be feasible to hold nationwide elections of the first president. The deputies cite the very earliest date -- 26 July this year. The first president will have great powers. He is the head of state and of executive power. Already there are disputes in full swing in the parliamentary corridors over the figure of the future president. By law a candidate president can be nominated only by at least 70 people's deputies or at least 100,000 voters through the collection of signatures. Political parties and associations do not have this right. But the most influential political forces will find the opportunity to use either the former or the latter option. The disposition of political forces in Belarus is now as follows. At one extreme is the People's Movement of Belarus [PMB] and at the other the Belarusian National Front [BNF]. And between them is the "Spring-94" association. So far there is only total clarity about the BNF. This organization is gambling on its undisputed leader Zenon Poznyak. The PMB -- the most mass-based movement -- has still not found its bearings. Perhaps it will support the present premier, Vyacheslav Kebich, perhaps Aleksandr Lukashenko, who made a name for himself in the post of chairman of the Supreme Soviet anticorruption commission. The scenario whereby the Belarus Party of Communists, which is a collective member of the PMB, will nominate its own candidate, Viktor Chikin. As for the democratic-centrist "Spring-94" bloc, it could launch an election campaign in favor either of Stanislav Shushkevich or Gennadiy Karpenko. The Belarus Academy of Sciences Institute of Sociology has already conducted the first poll of rural inhabitants. Of those polled 20.8 percent stated they would vote for Aleksandr Lukashenko. So far he is the obvious leader in the countryside. This deputy's rating rose sharply after his speeches in the Supreme Soviet exposing corruption. By creating the image of a fighter against the mafia, Aleksandr Lukashenko has been a crowd-pleaser, as they say, stating that the mafia and its patrons are to blame for everything. It is true that so far the only result of his commission's work has been the dismissal of Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, toward whom Lukashenko had a personal antipathy which he did not hide. But the fighter against the mafia, as he himself has stated, has a file on two dozen top officials from the Council of Ministers and structures directly subordinate to the government. Naturally, having made these facts public Aleksandr Lukashenko will undoubtedly gain additional points in the fight for the president's seat. Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich are almost equally popular among rural inhabitants. Today 9.3 percent of those polled are prepared to vote for the former and 8.1 percent for the latter. It is true that the head of government has gone for broke, gambling on the unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. If the union of this two slav countries succeed, the moderate politician will of course be riding high. If not then perhaps only a miracle will save the premier. Zenon Poznyak was ranked fourth with 6.1 percent by the Belarusian peasants in their unique popularity rating. But the BNF leader's recent political actions -- his statements about wanting Belarus to withdraw from the CIS, his charges of imperialism against the Russians, and the ban on professions -- will hardly give him any chance of success. Gennadiy Karpenko, the leader of the Party of National Accord, which is something like the Russian "Civic Union," and Viktor Chikin close the list of contenders, with scarcely more than 1 percent of those polled supporting them. Of course, these are only the first reports and they will change with time. It is not ruled out that other contenders could join in the struggle for the president's seat on the crest of the wave of general dissatisfaction and lack of confidence in the authorities. But the overwhelming majority of political scientists today believe that the real struggle will develop only between three candidates: Vyacheslav Kebich, Aleksandr Lukashenko, and Stanislav Shushkevich. Meanwhile.... Zenon Poznyak, the leader of the parliamentary opposition, stated that the introduction of the post of president in Belarus is one stage in establishing an authoritarian regime and restoring in full the previous power and previous relations. "The draft law on the election of the Belarus president is compiled in such a way that only one candidate could be nominated -- Kebich. In practice not a single candidate can be nominated at the Supreme Soviet and not a single one can be nominated from the people -- according to the draft law. Because at the Supreme Soviet to nominate a candidate you must collect 70 signatures (it is virtually ruled out that any deputy other than Kebich would collect as many). As for signatures from the people, it is proposed that 100,000 should be collected in only two weeks. Considering the procedure which is proposed it is in practice impossible to collect signatures in that time." Nonetheless the BNF council has examined the question of the development of the political situation and the prospects of elections in Belarus. BNF leaders believe that their organization has real chances of success but only under conditions where voters are faced with a tough choice: either a representative of the opposition or a representative of the old nomenklatura. In their opinion a third candidate and third way are a threat. Zenon Poznyak said that Stanislav Shushkevich specifically presents a threat to the BNF's prospects. "There cannot be a third way," Poznyak said, "either for independence or against it." The front will no longer support Shushkevich and it is highly likely it will campaign against it.
