"I think that the timeframe for the creation of the new executive will be very short indeed; the programme is already being vetted by the coalition," said the newly elected Forza Italia MP on the sidelines of a conference here. Asked about his own immediate future, the man touted by many to hold a key economic post in the next government quipped: "Those who predict catastrophes suffer twice over, but I'm certainly about to give my last university lecture." Before his involvement in politics, Martino was best-known as a comparatively lone voice in spreading Milton Friedman's monetarist theories from his post at a Rome private university, Luiss. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro -- who summoned Berlusconi for talks this morning -- is expected to give the Forza Italia leader a mandate to form an executive after the House speakers are elected, on Friday [15 April] or Saturday.
