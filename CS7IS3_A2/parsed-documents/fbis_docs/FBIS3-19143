His reluctance to join up with Rete and Communist Renewal is a "neurosis" that threatens to degenerate into an "obsession." "Take your mind off Bertinotti and Orlando and try to focus on the students who vote for Rete and the factory workers in the north who vote for Communist Renewal." We met the target of the article, Ferdinando Adornato, during his election campaign in Umbria. He had no intention whatsoever, he said immediately, of quarreling with Serra. [Leiss] So there is no neurotic obsession? [Adornato] We in AD [Democratic Alliance] were the ones who promoted a climate that would allow different forces to stand together. We said, "Being different is not an obstacle, it is a source of enrichment." When we proposed a single symbol for a single alliance, they accused us of wanting to dissolve the parties. Then that is exactly how things went.... [Leiss] Then why all this insistence on keeping Orlando and Bertinotti out of government, out of a future "Democratic Party?" [Adornato] Different political traditions can stand together, but not diverging political platforms. I am convinced that the progressives' job is to govern, not to continue playing at opposition. I think that this is also of interest to the students and factory workers with whom Serra suggests I take up. Many of them vote for the League, for Fini, and for Berlusconi. Does this mean we should be talking to them as well? [Leiss] Is a more moderate position needed to get through to these voters? [Adornato] No. Proposals for radical changes are what is needed. For example, we must sweep away the old method whereby the parties took possession of the state and society. But politics should speak a temperate language and make sure that rationality wins over the prevailing climate of brawling and bawling. [Leiss] Away with the parties. Nevertheless, when it came to presenting candidates and collecting signatures, it emerged that a bit of organization is not a bad thing. [Adornato] What I am talking about is the end of the single public spending party, of a political system that cut civic society out completely. There must be organized political forms, of course there must, and we are working to achieve a great democratic party taking in the Catholics who jump off the centrist fence, the nonreligious, the environmentalists, the democratic left .... [Leiss] Without Rete and Communist Renewal? Do the Italian situation and tradition not suggest a federative "path" showing greater respect for the various individual elements? [Adornato] We are not precluding anyone. We can all change, especially now that the ideological preconceptions have gone by the board. If anything, it is Rete and Communist Renewal that express positions tainted by ideological attitudes. I, too, am in favor of federative stages, indeed, it is what is already happening, is it not? [Leiss] Does not the brawling spring from turning [politics] into too much of a show, a factor for which another "neurotic obsession," with television, is responsible? [Adornato] I agree with you there. At times they tell me I appear too earnest. I appreciate that a bit of a show does no harm, but politics is a serious matter. [Leiss] Does the fault lie with the media or with the political leaders? [Adornato] There is something of a vicious circle between politics and the media, which push the Sgarbi [controversial talk show host and deputy] model. But this Grand Hotel with all its chandeliers runs the risk of having nothing real to tell the voters. [Leiss] What is there to tell them? [Adornato] At 15 days from the poll, the progressives must be made aware that the problem is not merely one of beating Berlusconi. I am not at all worried by the opinion polls that show Forza Italia in the lead. The only ones capable of providing a reliable government to rebuild the country are the progressives, and the emphasis must be placed on their platform, to give it substance and credibility. [Leiss] How, for example? [Adornato] We shall be seeking to explain in Rome tomorrow, at the event promoted by the Italian intellectuals who have launched the "Ragiona Italia" [Reflect Italy] appeal, in the Sala Umberto. The speakers will include the Norberto Bobbios and Umberto Ecos of this world, who propose the country should follow the path of reason, not the Bossi-Fini-Berlusconi union, which has no underlying principles. What Italy needs is a new pact between the professions, business, and the world of work to take the place of the old deal between evaders and those benefiting from state support, a pact that will promote the market and development but will not cut off the lifeline of solidarity. [Leiss] A pact in favor of a "constituent government?" Is Occhetto right to criticize this formula as outdated? [Adornato] I agree that the electorate must vote first, then the discussion can begin. The progressives can win. And the formula of the old political system is obsolete.
