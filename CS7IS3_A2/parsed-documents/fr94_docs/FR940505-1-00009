FR940505-1-00009 FR940505-1-00004 II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated April 13, 1994, (Administrative Record No. IA&hyph;397) Iowa submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Iowa submitted the proposed amendment with the intent of satisfying the required program amendments at 30 CFR 915.16 (a) and (b) and at the State's own initiative to improve its program. The substantive changes proposed by Iowa are discussed briefly below: (1) IAC 27&hyph;40.3(207), General Iowa proposes to add a statement that in lieu of the regulations previously deleted at 30 CFR 700.12 concerning ``Petitions to initiate rulemaking,'' rules of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship at 21 IAC Chapter 3, ``Petitions for Rulemaking'' shall serve as the basis for submitting petitions to initiate rulemaking. (2) IAC 27&hyph;40.4(9), Definitions Iowa proposes to delete its definition of ``previously mined area'' as incorporated by reference and replace it such that ``[p]reviously mined area'' means the land affected by surface coal mining operations prior to August 3, 1977, that has not been reclaimed to the standards of 30 CFR chapter VII. (3) IAC 27&hyph;40.31(14), Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing Iowa proposes to remove and reserve this subrule concerning willful suppressing or falsifying of facts or data that OSM previously reviewed but did not approve. (4) IAC 27&hyph;40.32(207), Revision or Amendment, Renewal, Transfer, Assignment, or Sale of Permit Rights Iowa proposes to replace its regulations concerning requirements for defining and processing significant permit revisions and nonsignificant permit revisions. Iowa uses the term ``permit revision'' to mean significant permit revision and the term ``amendment'' to mean nonsignificant permit revision. (5) IAC 27&hyph;40.51(7), Bond and Insurance Requirements for Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Under Regulatory Programs Iowa proposes to delete its existing subrule and replace it with the requirement that an application for bond release shall not be considered filed until a written determination of completeness for the bond release application has been provided to the applicant by the division. (6) IAC 27&hyph;40.63(2), Backfilling and Grading: Time and Distance Requirements Iowa proposes to delete its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 816.101 [Backfilling and grading: Time and distance requirements] and replace it with the requirement that (a) except as provided in paragraph ``b'' of the subrule, rough backfilling and grading for surface mining activities shall be completed within 180 days following coal removal, and not more than four spoil ridges behind the pit being worked, the spoil from the active pit constituting the first ridge; (b) the division may extend the time allowed for rough backfilling and grading for the entire permit area or for a specified portion of the permit area if the permittee demonstrates in accordance with 27 IAC 40.36/30 CFR 780.18(b)``3'' of these rules that additional time is necessary. (7) IAC 27&hyph;40.74(3), Civil Penalties Iowa proposes to adopt specific State counterpart rule cites for those Federal rule cites at 30 CFR 845.15(b)(2) that were previously incorporated by reference by the State. (8) IAC 27&hyph;40.75(2), Individual Civil Penalties Iowa proposes to adopt a specific State Code reference (Iowa Code 207.15(3)) counterpart to section 518(b) of the Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act in its definition of ``Violation, failure, or refusal.'' III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Iowa program.
