At the meeting, Director General Hans Blix will express deep regret over the fact that North Korea's nuclear issue has fallen into a deadlocked situation due to North Korea's uncooperative measures and will emphasize that strong measures at the UN Security Council level are unavoidable. The IAEA will refrain from taking independent action regarding future inspections on North Korea, but will act upon the UNSC's countermeasures.
