He added: Pursuing the population and family planning goal-directed responsibility system is a key measure for ensuring that principal party and government leaders grasp family planning work in person, and that they are wholly responsible for this work. Practice over the past years has shown that such measures have played an important role in enhancing the sense of responsibility of leaders at all levels for family planning work, enabling them to grasp two kinds of production simultaneously, and exercising control over population growth. [passage omitted] Tian Chengping emphasized: The focal point and difficulties facing family planning work in our province lie in rural and pastoral areas. From now on, we must gradually change the previous practice of relying on administrative order, taking remedial measures, and carrying out shock work to promote family planning. We must guide and help the masses to take the road of linking family planning with developing the rural commodity economy, working hard to become rich and advance toward small-scale prosperity, and establishing civilized and happy families. Party and government leaders at all levels must make great efforts to establish a service network for family planning, and to do practical work for the family planning drive. Financial departments at all levels must increase their investment in family planning work so as to ensure the necessary working conditions. It is necessary to establish a family planning work contingent in rural areas as soon as possible so as to ensure that work at the grass-roots level is taken care of and grasped. Tian Chengping stressed: Family planning work is a very difficult job of a mass nature. It is impossible to do it well simply by relying on family planning departments. He urged various government departments and all of society to make concerted efforts to participate in family planning work. He also urged fully arousing and relying on the masses to carry out family planning work in a deep-going, meticulous, and solid manner.
