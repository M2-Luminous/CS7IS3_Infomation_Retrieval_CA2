FBIS4-37136 "drnes117_j_94010" FBIS-NES-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen `Official Source' Decries South's `Fabricated Reports' `Official Source' Decries South's `Fabricated Reports' JN1706060194 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0447 GMT 17 Jun 94 JN1706060194 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] An official source has asserted that the rebellious and traitorous gang no longer has influence on foreign public opinion apart from its false wailing and spreading of fabricated reports on indiscriminate artillery and missile bombardment of residential areas in the valiant city of Aden. This gang also talks about victims among the innocent citizens after having used up its lies about the shelling of vital and economic installations. The precise details of the situation are now known in Aden, whether regarding the acts of repression, killings, and persecution carried out by the rebellious gang and those who encroached upon legitimacy against innocent citizens in all areas and neighborhoods, or regarding the involvement of children and girls in acts from which men, soldiers, and officers, who are mortgaged and linked to the rebels, have fled after finding out the truth and having been overwhelmed by immense despair. Likewise, the citizens' position is known toward these gangs, which are obsessed with blood and with creating catastrophes in order to terrorize and humiliate the citizens. Meanwhile, these gangs transferred their entire families from Aden by sea despite the will of the ships that arrived in the port of Aden to transfer foreigners from Aden. This fact is also well known by the steadfast and enduring citizens in Aden. The source found it strange that some Arab media carried these reports along with old pictures and other repeated pictures that were not taken in Aden. These media were so hostile and reckless that they carried televised clips showing the dead and wounded from Sanaa, al-Rahidah, Zinjibar, and other cities as a result of the Scud missiles fired by the rebellious criminals. These media, however, claimed that these clips showed victims of the alleged indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Aden. Concluding his statement, the source asserted that this worn out card, which depends on lies and fabrication, will undoubtedly catch fire and turn into ashes, exactly like other cards. No doubt, lies are short-lived, he added.
