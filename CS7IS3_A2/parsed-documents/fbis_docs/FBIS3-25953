Banking and price reforms would be delayed at least six months as a result of the economic crises that hit the country at the end of last year, the deputy director of the State Planning Commission's Economic Research Institute, Wang Jian, said. "The fluctuations shocked the central government leaders. They have now reconsidered plans to introduce the reforms all at once," he said. In banking, Wang said, plans to put the country's four largest specialised banks on to a commercial footing would be delayed "at least until the second half of the year." "They will just make the physical separation of the offices and the people for now. But there is no specific timetable for shifting the banks on to commercial terms." Plans for freeing prices of basic materials, electricity and transport, also set for this year, have been put on hold indefinitely. Wang said there was a group within the leadership fighting the price freeze because of its adverse effect on farmers. "In order to stabilise the whole society, farm incomes must rise more than the 2 percent of last year. "My worry is that if you keep a lid on prices of cereals and oils for too long, then the benefits of reform will continue to be enjoyed mainly by the urban people." Wang said the end-of-year grain crisis and a brief crash on the Shanghai stock exchange convinced Beijing that plans for what the party leader and State President, Jiang Zemin, called "the year of reforms" were too ambitious. "The common people must support the reforms. These fluctuations reminded the central governemnt that the people can only bear so much reform, and that chaos could easily occur in the countryside," Wang said. "They are now on guard against these dangers." The November and December grain crisis began in the bread-basket provinces of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi and Jilin, where rapid mark-ups in grain prices had caused a chain reaction of hoarding and grain shortages throughout the country. "This was a national problem," he said. Grain prices, which had already risen 30 percent in rural areas by early November compared with a year earlier, began to rocket in late November, more than doubling in some regions. Fears of tax changes and Beijing's efforts to control inflation led to the Shanghai stock exchange plummeting 13 percent on December 20, followed by a series of smaller falls. While Beijing leaders felt urban residents could bear high rates of inflation because their incomes were rising even faster, they were less confident of their ability to handle unrest in the countryside because of stagnant income growth there, Wang said. The decision to put reforms on hold was taken following a national work conference on banking run by Zhu Rongji in mid- January. The government would "earnestly strengthen financial supervision and management" in 1994, Zhu told the meeting, as the "profound problems" of the economy had not yet been "fundamentally addressed". Wang said Zhu's sudden reversal of the gradual winding down of the austerity programme had not yet filtered through. A statement last week by the Vice-Minister of Construction, Li Zhendong, that the austerity programme was "basically finished" reflected the confusion in Beijing, Wang said. Wang, whose institute is just completing a long-term economic development strategy for the State Council, said the reforms planned for 1994, which also cover taxation, exchange rates, investment policy, enterprises and foreign trade, differed fundamentally from those of the 1980s because they were designed to make the central government stronger, not weaker. He said the reforms could be implemented successfully once they were restarted.
