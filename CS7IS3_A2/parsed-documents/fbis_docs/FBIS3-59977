Pet is spending 300 million baht to develop 36 rai of land in the middle of Nakhon Phanom. He is building a huge open-air market with 1,800 stalls. He is trying to curry favor with merchants in order to win votes. He is also planning to build a trade center, commercial buildings, and a bus station. Construction is scheduled to get underway at the beginning of 1994. On the political front, he is continuing to fight even though ``Big Chiu'' [Chawalit Yongchaiyut] has announced that he will run in Zone 1. Mr. Thanong Siriprichaphong, or Sia P. Pet, the president of the Little Duck hotel group and a Thai Nation Party MP [member of parliament] from Nakhon Phanom Province, told THAN SETTHAKIT that he is developing 36 rai along Nittayo Road in the heart of Nakhon Phanom City. He is building a large open-air market, a trade center, commercial buildings, and a bus station. He is investing about 300 million baht in this project. Construction is scheduled to get underway in 1994, and it is expected that businesses will open that same year. To date, no name has been given to the project. The open-air market, which will be located on approximately seven rai, will have 1,800 stalls. Merchants in Nakhon Phanom Province will be able to buy or lease stalls at a low price. This will help solve the problems of merchants in Nakhon Phanom who lack places to sell their goods. There is now only one open-air market. Another problem is the lack of space at the existing stalls. This will also make it easier for people to buy goods. The trade center will be very large. It may have mini-stores or super-stores, but there are no plans to build a large department store. The bus station, to be located nearby, will occupy approximately four rai. Commercial buildings will be built around the area. Various bus lines will be allowed to use the facility. At present, the various buses park in different locations. If they all stop at this bus station, this will make things more convenient for the people. ``Right now, I can't give you all the details. Nakhon Phanom City plans to build a new road through this area. The exact location of the road isn't clear yet. This project must be located near this road. We should know the details in the near future. As for construction, all the preparations have been made. Once we know where the road will be built, we will begin drawing up the plans. Actually, it was villagers who came and asked me to build this project. They are particularly interested in our building an open-air market, because there are quite a few problems concerning this.'' Thanong said that he will continue to engage in politics even though it is now certain that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the leader of the New Aspiration Party, will move his base from Nonthaburi Province and run for election in Zone 1 in Nakhon Phanom Province, which is the same zone where Mr. Thanong will run for election. General Chawalit has organized an election team in the area. In the next election, he [Thanong] will definitely run for election, and he is ready. He frequently gets out to visit people. How the election turns out is up to the people. Mr. Thanong denied the rumor that General Chawalit had sent people to ask him not to run for election. He said that there is no truth at all to that rumor.
