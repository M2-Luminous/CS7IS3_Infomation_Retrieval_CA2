Four American congressmen were flying to the city of Malanje on a fact-finding visit. They never made it. The UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels launched a bombardment of the city and the plane carrying the Americans turned back. So did the United Nations plane in which our correspondent Chris Simpson was travelling. He is now back in Luanda and sent this report. Flagelamentos [shellings] is what we heard over the radio as our plane was 30 minutes away from Malanje. It is a word you hear a lot in Angola. Loosely translated, it means attacks or bombardments. Confirmation rapidly came that UNITA had indeed been shelling Malanje and the four U.S. congressmen and [words indistinct] in the other plane had been turned back for security reasons. Malanje was, at least temporarily, off limits, just as it was for weeks on end last year when the city starved for lack of food aid. At least it is never dull here, an aid official [word indistinct] observed, amid a series of urgent radio messages. The World Food Program, which is currently sending eight planes a day to Malanje, put its Malange operations on a standby and the congressmen's itinerary was rapidly rearranged. Angolan national radio later claimed that UNITA had been shelling persistently since the early hours of the morning, causing at least (?two deaths). Why now, why today, of all days, when the peace talks are back on? These were the questions everyone was asking. It remains to be seen whether UNITA will have any answers to offer. Jonas Savimbi's movement might argue, however, that all publicity is good publicity and that having been left off the visiting congressmen's itinerary, it was only fair that UNITA be allowed to spoil the rest of the program.
