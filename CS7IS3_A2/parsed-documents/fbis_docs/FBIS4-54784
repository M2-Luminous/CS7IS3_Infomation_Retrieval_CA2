"I do not accept the union which has the overthrowing of the government as its aim," Oleksy said. "Solidarity's historical achievements are enormous but the proclamation of a general strike is a last resort all over the world. I do not think that the situation in the country justifies such a need," added the Sejm speaker. According to Oleksy, workers' incomes will be ever more differentiated. "The thing is, though, not to forget about an elementary sense of social justice. The notion of social justice was rejected four years ago. This government is trying to implement a different strategy," stated Oleksy. The Sejm speaker also said that four years ago FSO was condemned to destruction by some politicians. "Today it is a prosperous plant which has prospects for development. This proves that it is necessary to create own, Polish solutions instead of plagiarizing western solutions, which often do not correspond to the Polish reality," concluded the Sejm speaker.
