No to uncontrolled laissez-faire. Yes to a market economy that protects the weak, with a public presence limited to guaranteeing the rules. A less onerous tax system which burdens companies less. A fight against waste to reduce government spending. The Lega is prepared to accept alliances on its economic and political programs. Will it be Mario Segni? Will it be Berlusconi? "The turning point of the Congress was opening the door. We are ready to talk: it is not a take-it or leave-it document. But careful: time is short. A decision must be made by 15 January." Roberto Maroni is speaking, Umberto Bossi's right arm. "Waste must be eliminated, the extraordinary assistance to the South, refinanced for 5 trillion lire. Social welfare must be limited, the system of assistance to firms reexamined. Government administration must be reformed. Not only by firing the loafers, as Segni says. The structure must be re-examined in order to improve services and cut costs." [MONDO ECONOMICO] What should be the role of the state in the economy? [Maroni] The public role must be eliminated. The state must guarantee respect for the rules. But it should be the market that makes the rules. That way, a real social state can be born, free of welfare abuse. The demise of the public presence must come about by privatization and a rewriting of the rules. But careful! Privatization must be real, actual publicly held stock companies must be created in Italy. I would not want to find the parties once again as owners, impersonated by Mediobanca [Financial Credit Bank], by the great families, by the friends of the friends. As for the rules, they must not be written only in the halls of Parliament, but with the collaboration of the interested persons. The hot subjects are: credit, Antitrust, the Mammi law and privatization. [MONDO ECONOMICO] Firms are asking for a less onerous tax system. Are they right? [Maroni] The tax system must be reformed, to make it more equitable and simpler. For firms, we are thinking not only of not taxing profits that are reinvested, but even about additional fiscal incentives for investors. And it must be done so that private savings are directed toward investing in companies. We have in mind the modernization of the stock exchange and the creation of local stock markets, more accessible to small companies. Perhaps that way the banks will stop behaving like usurers and be more ready to run a risk.
