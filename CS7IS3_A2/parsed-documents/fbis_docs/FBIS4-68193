Inquiries by THE TIMES in Afghanistan and Pakistan suggest hundreds of these highly sophisticated and deadly shoulder-held weapons have now gone astray in south Asia and the Middle East. A serious fear in British intelligence circles is that the IRA will succeed in buying or being given the weapon and the training to enable its terrorists to use it. The heat-seeking infra-red Stinger, which is difficult to deflect with flares or chaff once it has locked onto a target, would transform the military balance in Northern Ireland, allowing the Provisionals to shoot down military transport helicopters virtually at will. At a stroke this would cripple army logistics in the province and force a substantial rethink on military strategy. A constant watch for signs that IRA members or their representatives are on the hunt for the Stinger in the arms bazaars of the Middle East and Asia is being mounted by British intelligence, but so far none has been detected. However, at least one alert has been issued in the past year in Pakistan. An accompanying danger is that Iran may supply Stingers to the Provisionals or has already done so. At the end of last month, the full extent of Iranian contacts with the IRA was disclosed by British intelligence sources after a leak to a Greek newspaper, prompting a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. The Iranians are known to be among the main beneficiaries of Stingers sold by Afghan Mujahidin commanders first obtaining them in 1987 when they "confiscated four launchers and 16 missiles from a commander, and are now thought to have many more of the weapons." The IRA is not the only danger. The Americans fear Islamic radicals may attempt to use the missiles against civilian passenger aircraft and the Turks are concerned about Kurdish rebels getting them. Other countries known to have Stingers include Libya, Iraq, North Korea, and militant Palestinian groups. [passage omitted] Inquiries suggest that, of the original estimated 1,000 intended for Afghanistan, around 300 were used inside the country, 200 are now stored in the arsenals of Pakistan, a further 200 have already gone missing, and about 300 are still in the hands of former Mujahidin commanders. The numbers are unverifiable but are regarded as a reasonably accurate guide by diplomatic sources. These sources say of the 300 still in Afghanistan at the beginning of this year. about 100 have recently been sold, including around 60 to the Americans who have paid between $85.000 and more than $100,000 for each launcher. The North Koreans, who closed their embassy in Kabul last month, are thought to have bought at least 30, with another ten going to the Iranians and two to the Iraqis. The Americans are not willing to discuss the programme beyond confirming that it is still going on. [passage omitted]
