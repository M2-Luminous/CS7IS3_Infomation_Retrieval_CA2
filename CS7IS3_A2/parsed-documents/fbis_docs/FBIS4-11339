The session will be unique not only because of the decisions that will derive from analyses made by the country's labor sector but also because the legislative session will take place, for the first time ever, on a Sunday, which also happens to be Labor Day. Cuba's most prominent labor leader, Pedro Ross, told me that the best homage the National Assembly could pay the Cuban workers is to further discuss the country's toughest problems and adopt measures aimed at resolving them. This will be the first time in the past three decades that there will be no rally followed by a march to Plaza de la Revolucion on 1 May. The day will be commemorated on 30 April with events and marches in provincial and municipal capitals throughout the country. The labor leader said there will be massive celebrations in five municipalities in the city of Havana, something that will permit a better and more rational utilization of the material resources this kind of event requires. It has been estimated that, for the usual mobilizations, it will be necessary to defray the cost, in the capital alone, of approximately 50 tons of fuel to transport hundreds of thousands of sympathizers who gather at the central Plaza Municipality, an expenditure that is ill-advised in the current economic situation. Another factor that apparently was considered in changing the traditional celebration is that it is necessary not to lessen the attention being given to the harvest of products that are essential to the national economy and the people, such as sugar, tobacco, potatoes, etc. President Fidel Castro himself has talked to the National Committee of the Central Organization of Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] about the difficult material status the sugarcane harvest is experiencing and the importance of planting efforts capable of permitting higher productivity in the years ahead. The Cuban leader asked the labor movement not "to lower its guard in any of the agricultural and industrial activities in which we are engaged." Ross reiterated this a few days later in noting that April and May are decisive months for securing targeted production results. Commenting to journalists about current efforts and results, the labor leader said sugar production involves more than 600,000 workers, many of whom have to work with torn shoes and shirts. He noted, though, that this year, like last year, the labor force has not deserted. He said: There is a high spirit of sacrifice, a desire to overcome adversity and limitations. It is significant that early in April there are already 15 brigades of sugarcane cutters that can cut more than 1 million arrobas. While steps are being taken at all levels to raise economic efficiency -- the key for pulling out the evil from the root -- it has become evident that measures of a restrictive nature, which will affect everyone to various degrees, must be adopted, although an effort will be made to protect the lower-income groups as much as possible. The importance of massive participation in the discussion of and search for solutions has been established. This was done through a process called the Workers Parliament, which has prevailed as a mechanism for evaluating very special situations. Discussions of a vast network of ideas and opinions on how to resolve problems and debates on opposite points of view have produced optimistic results. In the midst of the complicated situation the country is enduring, the economically active population, which decides the future with its work, has again demonstrated its position in favor of a more just society. The general measures that will be adopted to face this situation will enhance the awareness of efficient producers, an awareness which is already practical and is evidently winning ground in the framework of a colossal and unique effort to keep the Cuban Revolution alive and faithful to its social project, while making adjustments to the real situation without abandoning its ideal of transforming the situation.
