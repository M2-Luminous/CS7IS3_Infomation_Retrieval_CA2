FBIS3-32113 "drlat022_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-022 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Feb 1994 Peru `Secret' Shining Path Document Released PY0202004394 Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 25 Jan 94 Special Supplement pp I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII PY0202004394 Lima LA REPUBLICA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Unattributed article: "Secret Document: Shining Path Uses Peace Agreement to Stall for Time," which was "approved" by the Shining Path Central Committee -- first 10 paragraphs are introductory editorial explanation] [Text] For the sole purpose of reporting the events occurring in the country, LA REPUBLICA publishes the following Shining Path document which reveals the intentions of [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman Reinoso's followers with respect to the peace treaty that they are negotiating with government officials at the Callao Naval Base prison. The Maoists believe that just because they are talking with government representatives does not mean they have to lay down their arms, and that the cease fire is only temporary until conditions are ripe for restarting hostilities. Specialists believe the following document may have been written by Abimael Guzman himself. It was approved by Central Committee members Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Martha Huatay Ruiz, Maria Pantoja Sanchez, and Angelica Sala, who are all imprisoned. The contents of the document, the quotes from books, and the reference to recent facts -- like the referendum and Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan, reveal that the author -- or authors -- have been allowed to watch television, to read newspapers and magazines and, as in the case of Guzman, allowed to consult a library. The manuscript serves to compel the majority of prisoners endorse the "fight for a peace agreement" slogan. The document reveals that the bases of a popular war have not been specifically abandoned. On the contrary, referring to the murders and attacks that stained the country with blood over the past 13 years, Guzman boasts having directed "the largest revolutionary social movement in Peruvian history." He defends his current decision to "fight for a peace agreement" on the grounds that the first stage of the "world revolution" has ended. This may be a strategy to gain time, through "diplomatic language," and to temporarily suspend terrorist actions until the "new stage" of the world revolution begins. The document is also a call to his followers "to stick very close" to the masses in the style of the political work carried out by the Shining Path in Ayacucho during the 1960's and 1970's, which served as the basis for the start of the armed struggle in May 1980. The document gives the predictions of Abimael Guzman about the probable split of his organization as well as the call "to set the basis" for the Shining Path Second Congress (the first congress was held in 1988). LA REPUBLICA discloses this important and unusual Shining Path document, making clear that it does not share its content, so that the country may learn the proposals by Shining Path leaders during the negotiations for the Peace Agreement. Key Ideas 1. The MLM-PG [Marx, Lenin, Mao - Thoughts of Gonzalo] is undefeated and imperishable (it was never defeated), because it is the ideology of the last class of history. 2. We are Communists, Maoists, soldiers of the proletariat, our essence is Maoism, wherever we fight and with the arms that we have. We should carefully bear in mind what Mao has taught: "The next 50-100 years... new things, new problems, which must consequently be resolved." It is necessary to continue to play our role, there is fear of making a decision. Those who have always fought us still do so. Why? 3. The MLM-PG is our special weapon... Bear in mind what was agreed upon at the Third Plenary Session (III S.P.). We are confronting new problems, which should be resolved by using the Thoughts of Gonzalo (PG). 4. Adopt the new decision and the new definition, and fight for them. These four key ideas should be at the foundation of our conception of things. TEXTS AND DOCUMENTS Our conception, our ideology has a base: Marxism. It should be used in our concrete circumstances. - Quotes of Mao. - Chapter V ("War and Peace"). This should be studied and applied. - "...This ML [Marxist-Leninist] Principle of the Revolution: Has Universal Validity." The principle is not being questioned. The point is how to apply it in concrete circumstances. (Bear in mind the experience of the 1960's and 1970's). The party, the organized masses, and the public have created the conditions for the Beginning of the Armed Struggle (ILA). - Quote No. 1 from Chapter V: "War is the highest level of struggle to resolve the contradictions between the classes..." "War begins and develops in specific circumstances. If circumstances change, the method of struggle should be changed. [no closing quotation marks as published] - Quote No. 3 [order as published] from Chapter V: "The classification of fair and unfair wars, what to do when there is an unfair war... The way to oppose an unfair war is to prevent it from breaking out, and -- if it breaks out -- wage a fair war to counter the unfair war, whenever possible." The "whenever possible" is also valid for us when we face an unfair war (even if it is a response to our action). This should not be read just from an abstract point of view, its application should also be understood). - Quote No. 2 of Chapter V: Relation between War and Politics: "Until the obstacle is totally removed, war will continue..." (text of 34 [not further specified]; contradictions are analyzed in 37). See Chun Chin's conversations in 1946, Volume IV; it implies continuing with the democratic revolution. Did Mao Zedong deny The Principle? No, he applied it in a creative way in the wake of the war against Japan. Public opinion was in favor of peace. Mao taught that public opinion had to be taken into account. Thus, he decided to hold talks. Important concessions were made. Where did the problem lie? Following the signing of the agreement between Mao -- who did so on behalf of the PCCh [Chinese Communist Party] -- and the KMT [Kuomintang, the People's National Party] led by Chiang Kai-Shek, the latter violated the agreement and launched a counteroffensive. But he did not violate any principle. In general one should not read without trying to see the practical application of what one is reading. It is therefore possible to say that politics is a bloodless war whereas war is bloody politics. The People's Law: "Fight, fail, ... cause social unrest." This great Class Struggle Law takes precedence over the Laws of Imperialism and reaction, and the People. [sentence as published] Class struggle is the great and ongoing class war waged against politicians that has two types: 1. Bloodless -- "politics is a bloodless war." 2. Bloody -- "war is bloody politics." These are different aspects of the great political war, which is the class struggle. Class struggle is now the development of a contradiction between revolution and counter-revolution, the essence of which is to fight and cause social unrest. These two laws constitute the great Class Struggle Law, which is a contradiction, the terms of which are -- on one hand -- to cause social unrest, which sows the seeds of ruin and -- on the other hand -- to fight, which in turn leads to victory. Failures are sure to be met in both cases -- while old ideas lead to ruin, new ones lead to victory. This is a great inexorable law. One should not be afraid of failure, the important thing is to fight -- hence the importance of the great Marxist truth -- "Revolution is Worthwhile." It is of utmost importance to study this and then put it into practice. Quotes -- page 237 [as published] Quotes -- page 225 [as published] It is of paramount importance not to be subjective, unilateral, and superficial. Subjective = not taking circumstances into account; only consider the overall picture. Chapter VIII. Left-wing Movement: Communism's Infantile Disease "Communists are Communists because throughout the intermediate stages and throughout all the commitments -- not the ones taken by them but by the progress of the historical development process -- they clearly see and unerringly strive to achieve their final objective, namely, the abolition of classes and the establishment of a society in which private ownership of land and the means of production no longer exist." Six Slogans 1. Let Us Struggle for a Peace Agreement! (Leading political guideline) 2. Become the Standard-Bearers for Our Cause! 3. Take on and Combat for the New Great Decision and the Great Definition! 4. Close Ranks behind the PG and the Central Leadership! 5. Become the Standard-Bearers for the New Great Decision and Definition! 6. Glory to M-L-M [Marxism-Leninism-Maoism]! What is a Communist? Do we understand the historical process, are we objective or subjective people? Are we in control of what is happening or does reality have us in its grip? Communists see clearly (though there may be disorder, confusion). "... The 33 Blanco followers [not further identified] are Communists because they think they can skip intermediate stages ... and that the seizure of power will happen in the next few days -- they are absolutely certain about this. Once power is seized, Communism will be imposed the following day. If this cannot be effected at once, then they are not Communists." What childish naivete it is to use one's impatience as a theoretically convincing argument! Naturally, very young and inexperienced revolutionaries, as well as little bourgeois revolutionaries --even those of a very respectable age and with vast experience -- believe it is extremely dangerous, incomprehensible, and erroneous to "reach agreements." Many sophists, petty politicians ... think along the same lines, what do they do every day? -- commitments to capitulation. "And yet, proletarians who have gone through the school of numerous strikes ... are able to assimilate the deep truth." "PHILOSOPHICAL TRUTH" = Corresponds to contradiction; it is a winding road. "HISTORICAL TRUTH" = Development process of revolutions, like class struggle. "POLITICAL TRUTH" = The day-to-day struggle to come to power, it expresses this need. "PSYCHOLOGICAL TRUTH" = How it is understood from a class standpoint; To see the difference between commitments derived from the present state of affairs ... commitments that do not lessen in the least the revolutionary negation or the willingness to continue with the struggle as a result of the commitment that the workers have taken. To differentiate the latter from subjective commitments that serve a particular interest, commitments of traitors who seek to safeguard their own interests ... Strike breakers also make commitments! Their cowardice, their desire to adulate.... for crumbs... seeking the praise of the capitalists. Not all commitments are simple, there are international and national commitments. We must assess the two situations! Lenin's words are more directly applied to our case: "No Commitment" is absurd. What is a mature Class Party that deserves to be called such, and which has leaders who deserve to be called such? .... It consists of winning over, through prolonged efforts, all representatives of a given class who are capable of thinking. Lenin: In any class there are and always will be ... representatives of that class that do not think, that are incapable of thinking for themselves, otherwise Imperialism would not be the oppressor of classes that it is. The leaders are the ones who have more knowledge, more experience, and the necessary political sagacity to achieve a prompt and fair solution to complex political problems (To have the necessary self-sacrifice to do so; not just to know things, but also to make decisions). - Volume 4 - 151 PM [Thoughts of Mao] page 430-443 - The interview granted to EL DIARIO by the P.G.

A stage of the Revolution is over. We must fight for a future wave of the World Proletariat Revolution (R.P.M.). A grandiose and unforgettable stage of the R.P.M. is over. There is an International Political Withdrawal (Strategic and Global), this stage has left us with three great banners: Marx-Lenin-Mao, which show that the MLM is unwithering, unconquerable. Engels in 1891 in his "Introduction to the Civil War in France", taught us that there would be an R.P.M. withdrawal and that it was impossible to conquer power. It was necessary to resolve the issues through new forms of struggles and organization, mainly military issues. He makes an assessment of 50 years of R.P.M.; there was a general political withdrawal. This is what Marx refers to when he established the First International (Workers International Association). The Communist Party Manifesto and the Workers International Association are different. In 1891, imperialism was being established, a new division of the world was underway. For 30 years, power could not be conquered, and the issues concerning the forms of struggle and organization could not be resolved. Things are different now. In 1917, Lenin resolved this, and in 1949 Mao resolved the problem of the road to the Revolution in semi-feudal, semi-colonial, and bureaucratic capitalist countries. In the Great Cultural Proletariat Revolution (1966-76) he resolved the problem of the continuation of the socialist revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. - Mao: Chapters on charts in the first quotation proposes the training of people to continue. - In that way we previously maintained that the World Revolution Offensive Strategy [Ofensiva Estrategica de la Revolucion Mundial] (OERM) started in the 1980's. Today we have developed and we believe that the period 1976-80 is a very short time. The OERM starts with the Great Cultural Proletariat Revolution because it occurs at the height of the R.P.M. and the National Liberation Movement [Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional] (MLN), under the leadership of the proletariat. In so doing, Mao seeks to develop and expand the R.P.M. - See Mao, Quotes chapter on Imperialism, page. 83: There are two kinds of wind, the East wind prevails. In 1957, page 80: "Imperialism Will Not Live Long." Make the effort to understand the great stages, and remember Mao: "The next 50 to 100 years...," that is from the year 2010 to the year 2060; therefore, a new wave is developing. It must be understood within the framework of the development of the contradiction between Restoration and Counter Restoration. We must consider the historical background, the Development of the Class Struggle Law. It took the Bourgeoisie Revolution 300 years to take hold. In the 16th Century the Revolution took hold in Holland. It was later crushed by Spain in the 17th Century. In England the victory of the Bourgeoisie Revolution was achieved in two stages: The Revolution led by Oliver Cromwell in 1640 (he failed); and in 1688 the "The Glorious Revolution" was victorious: Just 48 years separate the first revolution from the second. In the 18th Century, there was the U.S. Independence in 1776; in France the revolution succeeded in 1789. England became the First Power of the World after the defeat of the "Invincible Armada" (Naval Battle); It took almost 90 years for the bourgeoisie to impose and consolidate itself in England. If it took the bourgeoisie 300 years to conslidate itself as a class power, the proletariate cannot be expected to do the same in the 66 years (two-thirds of century) that it has exercised its dictatorship over the state through the Socialist Revolution. The difference with the RGR [General Withdrawal of the Revolution] of 1891 should be noted (Engels made the balance). The current RGR stems from the process of restoration, because an unfavorable public opinion has developed about this stage of the revolution (140 years). Three years have already passed since RGR. From the point of view of Maoism -- which is a decisive, key factor in designing the strategy of the RPM [World Proletariat Revolution] in the New Great Wave -- we understand why this period is the transition between the crowning point of one stage of the RPM and the future Great Wave of the RPM. This is the foundation of the general political withdrawal, among other things. Lenin: "Karl Marx taught us to analyze tactical problems." To dare to think, to dare to act, to dare to decide. Going against the stream is a Marxist principle. Does everything we have been analyzing oppose what we have maintained, that "The Revolution is the Main Trend!?" One should see the difference. 1.- TREND. It is unquestionable and inexorable that, from a historical viewpoint, the revolution is the main trend. It would be sufficient to invoke the process of development of new things, and the contradiction. Bear in mind the example: "The Pampas River is born and, after a long and winding course, it reaches the sea. It should be understood that history does not go back, that development is a spiral, uneven process. Time is measured in decades, not in years, and historical steps are not so brief." 2.- THE REVOLUTION AS A POLITICAL TREND (Study very carefully). At least five to six years are needed for the international stage and the situation to become clear. What will be the concrete results of U.S. hegemony? What will be the concrete results of Russia's disintegration? What will be the strengthening and the role of other powers, Japan and Germany? In the revolution, what will be the specifics of the RGR? What does the International Revolutionary Movement (MRI) think of these matters? Mao taught us that there are many Communist parties where Communist only appear in their letterhead. What is their situation now? See the situation of periods and the organizations of the proletariat. How are the unions? These are situations of which we have to make an in-depth analysis. What is the situation of class organizations, of peasant organizations? What does national and world opinion say? The direction of Communist parties is a key factor; the classes, the Anti-imperialist Movement. SUMMARIZING, make an in-depth analysis of the development of the struggle of classes, its rules, trends, and prospects. The old mole about which Marx taught us has not disappeared, it is alive. If there were no political trend, there would be no historical trend. The political trend is now underground, and one should realize this. The debris of disintegration and of restorations (USSR and China) has fallen upon our shoulders and we must bear it; yet the political trend lies inside Communist parties, among Communists, within the class, in the anti-imperialist war. Socialism existed and we saw it. The main right is to conquer power. Rebellion is justified! Consequently, it has not disappeared, it is an underlying political trend. Marx analyzed this process. He raised the issue of "The Deep Waters," saying that "the old mole again works the land." This is how the trend occurs from a political point of view, like underground water. The political factor is decisive: the direction of Communist parties. One should again study this, it is very important for us to reaffirm our position in the revolution, as the main historical trend, which operates politically, routinely. At a world level, there is a new distribution of the cake and new contradictions are being created. Imperialism is Slowly But Inexorably Agonizing -- Third Plenary Session (III SP) What are the current specific signs? It continues, but it is inexorably agonizing. (Bear in mind the III SP on the collapse of imperialism); yet there is also temporary recuperation. What Lenin taught us in "The Imperialist Stage ...," "Socialism... and Imperialism," "Revisionism... and Imperialism" is true and fully valid. How can we regard imperialism today? We see it in the light of the MLM to resolve new problems. What are the material grounds for this situation? The economic situation that gave rise to it was the petroleum, coal, and iron and steel industry. Today there are new sources of jobs, some of them very sophisticated, like informatics, electronic communications -- which are great development processes -- genetics, monopolies are attentive to genetic modifications (plant and animal manipulation), and even with new species. This is a new item for exploitation and oppression. Always see both sides of the contradiction. All oppressions generate an antioppression class movement. If one considers war, the development of strategic weapons causes more militarization of industry, larger investments in electronic war, costly weaponry and maintenance, which soon becomes obsolete. Their economic recession problems and their restrictions have made them foster the development of conventional weapons. Privatization of state-owned productive units is another world phenomenon. How much have the states obtained from productive units? All this is being transferred to monopolies, strengthening their power. All these matters determine the basis for this temporary recuperation. If we analyze the government from the political viewpoint we will see there is a tendency to reduce its social functions. Who will carry out these functions? In imperialist countries, monopolies -- for example -- organize areas of social security (the AFP [Pension Fund Managing Companies]), health, and education. Something similar occurs in the area of security -- not just armed security, but also regarding measures to prevent or to develop industrial espionage. All that makes us wonder about the reactionary state process represented by the grand bourgeoisie's dictatorship (in our case, the grand bourgeoisie and the large landowners who obey imperialism). Nowadays, the Armed Forces are becoming stronger and have more political decisionmaking capacity. Look at the role played by monopolies. In the past, they divided the world, currently they perform government functions. Regarding the international situation, the superpowers remain the same. Russia continues to be a superpower in view of its military power and its strategic atomic power. It has problems related to its international influence, it is riddled with domestic problems, and it is facing difficulties in international security. In Japan, Yeltsin suggested that the Japanese Government did not claim sovereignty over the four islands in dispute. Russia still has influence. We realize that international politics are undergoing a readjustment process and we are watching how the United States will structure its hegemony. Japan has become the second power, is paying increasing attention to its military weakness, and seems ready to increase and develop its own military policy. Germany is ruining France (its famous ally) to improve its currency. Ideologically, they are not structuring a new ideology, they are proving that it is obsolete. They are playing increasingly with "the failure of socialism." In spite of all this, they support an economic recovery, after having no ideology, and support liberalism. These are old banners, updated to manipulate public opinion. We must be very attentive and worry about the slow agony of imperialism, despite its temporary recovery. We must temporarily retreat because if we do not analyze imperialism, we cannot fight it. Lenin taught us that imperialism limits the development of productive forces. This is the general law. It will be decisive and prevail in the end. We can see abundant riches, while on the other hand we see 15 million children die every year before their first birthdays. We cannot overcome these realities because they are contradictory. How do Empires Sink? (III SP) We realize that these processes occur over long, not short, periods of time. During the slavery age, Roman Imperialism was the most developed and took more than five centuries to end. During feudalism, Spanish Imperialism was the most outstanding and took more than two centuries to fall. In capitalist times, it took more than a century for England to fall. Yankee imperialism consolidated as a superpower after the Second World War. This process has lasted more than five decades. We predict that it will be a long process, but it will evidently last less than the others, although we know it will take a long time. Revisionism and Revolution We have fought two sorts of revisionism: the old one that opposed the conquest of power just after World War II and the one we are fighting now, the essence of which is restoration. Thus, we have always fought revisionism. CONCLUSION: We fight for the large wave of International Revolution that will come. Our Guide is Maoism! 2. [as published] The bureaucratic path sets its foundations and becomes feasible. We begin by analyzing how they are setting their bases and developing a coherent strategy in the face of the People's War. In the economy it is clear that they set bases, not just by drafting laws, but also by implementing them. Since 1988, we have had five years of recession. The GDP increased by 6 percent in 1993, after five years of a growing recession. Inflation decreased. Seen from a strategic viewpoint, the GDP decreased by 26 percent between 1982 and 1993, while the population increased by 30 percent. If it increased by 30 percent, it would still have to increase another 20 percent even if we disregard the increase in population. We must do our best to consider the steps they take and the increases as objective deeds. As to "Politics and the Government," after electing their constituents and drafting the Constitution, they won the referendum and opened the path toward reelection. This is a way of setting the bases for reorganization the government. Regarding "Peacemaking" and their antisubversive war, they began it through civic action efforts, continued it by controlling the people, than they created peasant patrols, conducted psychological operations, and used intelligence actions to make arrests. This period of bureaucratic capitalism has a goal: To concentrate power. This process needs: A long-term plan and a long-lasting administration to promote it, lead it, and implement it. As a result, there will be a reappearance of bureaucratic capitalism. With the fall of our leadership and our central board, imperialism sees no need to interfere. During his speech on 24 September [no year specified], President Gonzalo [Abimael Guzman] shunted the Program, the FPL [People's Liberation Front], the EPL [People's Liberation Army], the New State and its relative stability as far as the people's war was concerned, the transfer of the center and all that it entailed. He then established the basis of the masterly plan for a general political withdrawal. The process of a counter-revolutionary war leads to victory. The renewed thrust of bureaucratic capitalism entails a greater imperialistic control -- "Reinsertion." Border problems with Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Brazil put our nation in jeopardy. What is the situation of bureaucratic capitalism nowadays? There are no powerful people's liberation movements, the proletariat and the people's struggle have weakened. Hence, it is neither powerful nor strong. Bureaucratic capitalism is thus fueled with renewed vigor, its plan is put into practice, and social and political rights are further curtailed. This will make the deep class struggle awaken the old revolutionary ideals. Knowing how to place and handle the laws of every process puts things in their proper perspective and course. The strong point, the most developed one in the democratic path is the People's War. 3. The People's War cannot be developed; it can only be maintained. There are six indispensable conditions for the People's War to be victorious: 1. Leadership by the proletariat. 2. Masses' bases. 3. Strategic centralization. 4. A new type of Army. 5. Prolonged People's War. 6. Favorable international conditions. Condition No. 6 does not exist, it is not the main one, but it is necessary. The most important is No. 1. The leadership should maintain a fair and correct political line, and wage a people's war following a course and direction established by the Class. We have problems in No. 1 and No. 3. New problems, the course is not analyzed (by the foreign leadership). No. 4 must be assembled and developed; it is not just the name "EPL." No. 2 is not handled or managed as it should, given the new state of affairs. Who represents the people in the election? Nobody ... Thus, everything leads to a prolonged People's War; The problem lies in leadership by the proletariat. What have we achieved? First, we have worked for a long time to bring about an armed struggle and to further the People's War, a Peasants' Revolutionary war, supported by its own bases, means, and masses, without being submitted to classes. The People's War has lasted 13 years. We have hit our three targets, semi-feudalism is less widespread, and the system is crumbling. We combated bureaucratic capitalism, proved that the latter fosters semi-feudalism; it controls the Peruvian state so that it can oppose the revolution. We have fought imperialism head-on. The spread of our People's War has been a security problem for the United States since 1989. The People's War has generated a New Type of Army. We established a new type of state directed by the Class, which has never happened before. This had far-reaching implications. In sum, the People's War gave us five successes: 1. The People's War is the greatest revolutionary social movement in Peruvian history in terms of program, development, and length. 2. It served to defend Maoism as a third, new, superior stage, and particularly to develop the strategic plan at a world level. 3. It raised the party's prestige to the highest level in its history, with the highest world's repercussion. 4. We accumulated the greatest revolutionary experience in Peru, Latin America. It is one of the richest in the world today. 5. We made a great contribution to the world proletarian revolution. It is recognized by the International Revolutionary Movement (MRI) as a vanguard theater for the World Proletarian Revolution. Today the revolution ends a great period. It is the hinge between two waves. It is an example of how to operate on our own efforts. It has shown that a People's War is invincible. 4. The leadership problem cannot be resolved in time. 5. New great decision, new great definition; struggle for a peace agreement and establish the bases for the second congress. Concrete Tasks To raise the MLM-PG even more; to struggle for a peace agreement and its implimentation; to define the importance of the people's war, the greatest Social Revolutionary Movement in Peru's history; to develop deeper bonds with the broad masses; to develop the international proletarian movement more. Mao said: "If a revolutionary party..." which is the single axis and the great fortress. We must defend and strengthen it against everything because the political and ideological structure is decisive in a protracted People's War. End of the propaganda. 6. With masses and a party, anything can be accomplished. Let us handle the general military withdrawal, a consequence of the general political withdrawal. It is complex, difficult, but necessary. Develop other forms of struggle in new conditions. II. Round of talks. 1. First contacts. 2. Talks. Acts. Peace agreements, first letter, guidelines, second letter. 3. Current situation. 4. Dissemination of agreements petition. 5. Prospects. III.Conclusions and Tasks: 1. Assume and fight for the new great decision and definition... Struggle for a peace agreement and establish the bases... 2. Party's concrete tasks. 3. Specific tasks. BASIS FOR DEVELOPING A PEACE AGREEMENT 1. The Peruvian people support peace. "It is a necessity..." 2. The people favor a solution through diplomatic negotiations. Imperialism and other imperialist powers need this. 3. The state and the government need it to achieve development. Problems with current costs; terms; reelection and long-term plans. 4. The Party's action. How to assume it and implement it?: That depends if conditions can be proposed. Delegates Commission. POLICIES TO BE ENFORCED 1. Do not engage in confrontations, neutralize and respond measure by measure. 2. Change our language, we are engaged in diplomatic negotiations which means we must follow them. 3. Define today's main target within the current context. 4. The issue is to handle sagaciously the objective convergence field. R'oo Rx'. [sentence as published] 5. It is a peace agreement between the PCP [Peruvian Communist Party] and the Armed Forces through the government. Our political positions have been confirmed, we told them how to resolve PCP-Armed Forces contradictions and this is what is happening. - To develop struggles between two lines, seeking unity, strive for the disbandment to be as little as possible; the party is politically strong but we must be aware that only a few may remain, only the best; the best defense is to attack. Let the militants become a revealing mirror of the infamous attacks perpetrated by the enemy, not even the Armed Forces act like that. - The other side also has a very clear objective: that we will never raise our heads again; that there will never be another People's War. No one can deny that it is using this issue to win today's referendum and the future reelection because the Peruvian State's long-term plan must be restructured and promoted. To make definitions and to be alert for strange machinations. "We offer uncertain possibilities now in exchange for certain and real prospects in the future." PRESIDENT GONZALO'S QUOTES 1.
