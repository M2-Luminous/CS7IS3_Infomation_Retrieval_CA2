Seven A340's (three versions of the 200 and four of the 300) in service with Air France, 9,125 flying hours with 9,309 stops, a technical on-time departure performance of 94.9 percent compared to Air France's objective of 97.5 percent, and 25 flights canceled for technical reasons. Those are some of the figures taken from the talk delivered to some 500 members of the AIR & COSMOS Club last 11 December by Roger Doguet, A340 division chief in Air France's Directorate of Air Operations. With Albert Ducrocq, president of the AIR & COSMOS Subscribers Club, presiding, the General Conference of the Cosmos Club of France was held on 11 December 1993, its topic being the Airbus A340. The first lecturer was Pierre Baud, Airbus Industrie's director of flight tests, who summed up the history of the development of the A340 in its two versions and drew the conclusion that in terms of technical specifications, the A340 has always performed better than required by contract, especially from the standpoint of everything having to do with fuel consumption. Baud also emphasized the reasons for having fly-by-wire systems on board the family's most recent models--that is, the A320's, A340's, A330's, and A321's--pending the arrival of the A319. There are two reasons: first, their presence results from recourse, as is proper, to an ultramodern technology that has now been completely mastered by Airbus Industrie, and second, it constitutes a fantastic commercial argument in that it helps reduce by a very considerable amount the time required by a pilot qualified on one type of aircraft to also qualify on another type when both are produced by Airbus Industrie. This is because thanks to the fly-by-wire controls, the flight characteristics of all aircraft in the same family are so similar that a pilot who passes from one type of aircraft to another does not at all feel "like a fish out of water." For his part, Roger Doguet discussed the A340's strong and weak points after nearly 10 months of service with Air France. Among the strong points: everything having to do with electricity, hydraulics, and instrumentation. Among the weak points: the fuel gaging system, among other things, since it has neither the reliability nor the accuracy required. Baud explained that its poor performance in that respect was due essentially to an FAA decision that was made when the A340 was already on the assembly line. That decision had to do with the installation of additional bulkheads in the fuel tanks. The problem is being solved. Other very acute problems: the poor functioning of the toilets (with all the consequences that the lack of such a convenience can have during a 13-hour flight) and of the on-board intercom system (CIDS (Cabin Information Data System)). It is becoming very urgent to find permanent solutions to replace the temporary solutions that had to be come up with very quickly. The addition of more A340's to Air France's fleet in 1994 will make it possible to use the aircraft on routes to Cayenne, Quito, Lima, and Caracas and to begin service to the Far East: to Hong Kong, Osaka, Singapore, Djakarta, and Noumea. Marc Dubois, who is in charge of the A340's commercial development, announced that 202,000 passengers had been carried on A340's by Air France, and he discussed ways of responding in the future to the wishes expressed by most of the passengers: those in business class are very demanding from the standpoint of comfort, while those in economy class want access to a video system even if they have pay for it. And many passengers want space on the aircraft for a "sociability" area, a "tranquillity" zone, or a real smoking room. The three-class formula might also be called into question. Gerard Guyot, Airbus Industrie's chief flight engineer for flight tests, spoke at length about the record-setting round-trip flight between France and Australia that took place on an A340 last June during the Le Bourget Air Show, and he disclosed that originally, the plan had called for attempting a record-setting flight between Papeete and Paris.
