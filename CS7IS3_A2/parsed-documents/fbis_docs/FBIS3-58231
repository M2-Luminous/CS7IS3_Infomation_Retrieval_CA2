FBIS3-58231 "drweu007aa_94010" FBIS-WEU-94-007 Document Type:Daily Report 11 January 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS French Minister Interviewed on Situation in Bosnia LD1001150294 LD1001150294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Paris France-Inter Radio Network in French at 0720 GMT on 10 January, in its "Questions by A Plus B" program, broadcasts a nine-minute interview with Alain Lamassoure, minister of European affairs, by correspondent Annette Ardisson. The interview begins with a discussion of calls made yesterday for air strikes in Bosnia. Lamassoure recalls that French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel put forward the EU [European Union] peace plan in November, and that it is France which is imposing the subject of Yugoslavia on the NATO summit. Lamassoure says: "The time has come to make everyone face up to their responsibilities -- the three Bosnian sides -- it is all too clear today that none of them really want peace -- and also all the important Western countries who belong to the international community, in such a way that each one should say whether they are ready to do something for peace, and what they are ready to do." Annette Ardisson then says: "But the peace plan you are referring to -- and we'll come back to it -- is a diplomatic plan. I am talking about military action, supposing that the Americans are ready to take part in air raids. This isn't very clear yet. We have been told since the beginning that this is impossible as long as the UN forces, and in particular our UN forces, are in Sarajevo, because they could become targets. So either we were being lied to before, or else we are ready to sacrifice them today." Lamassoure replies: "The French minister wrote to his counterparts expressing hope that the NATO meeting will be a chance for all the participants, in particular the Americans, to approve three things, both political and military, as you said. "First, the Americans have to recognize the validity of the European peace plan, which, rather paradoxically, they haven't formally done up to now. "Second, to get the Americans to say that they are ready, directly, or through NATO, to take part in implementing the peace plan as soon as it has been accepted by the three Bosnian parties. Then there will be a need for several tens of thousands of men on the basis that the peace plan is being applied, that the military forces on the ground, the militias, should withdraw and disarm, and here too we need a formal American commitment. "Finally, we want the Americans to say in a more solemn manner, that they are ready to deploy the means needed to apply what is being called UN Resolution No. 836, which provides for the possibility of military action by UNPROFOR with air cover, should humanitarian convoys be held up by armed forces or should the so-called security zones, such as the city of Sarajevo, be subjected to shelling." He goes on to elaborate on this, following which Ardisson says: "I repeat my question: Is France ready now, given the current positions of each side, for there to be air strikes around Sarajevo on Serb positions?" Lamassoure replies: "The French minister of foreign affairs said more than a month ago that France was ready to support the request by UNPROFOR should it deem such a thing necessary." He repeats that agreement on the modalities was reached several months ago. The UN secretary general and NATO must make the decision to carry it out, he says. They go on to discuss the partition plan for Bosnia, which Lamassoure reluctantly supports. "At this NATO summit," he says, "we, Europeans and Americans together, are applying as much pressure as possible, to see that the sides should take the final step we are expecting from them. And we are speaking to each one. We are telling the Serbs: If you go on shelling Sarajevo, you can expect air strikes. We are telling the Croats: If, in turn, you behave like aggressors, you will suffer sanctions of the kind we have been applying against the Serbs for several months. And we are telling the Muslims: If you don't want peace either, watch out, because our patience has its limits." Ardisson then asks him what he thinks about the possibility of European action in general without the United States. Lamassoure says it is time to reconsider the sharing out of roles in the defense of America. Europe still needs the Americans, he says, because there are still threats there. But for many of the crises, the Europeans should do without U.S. leadership. Lamoussoure concludes the interview by saying that he expects to see an agreement between the Atlantic alliance and the WEU.
