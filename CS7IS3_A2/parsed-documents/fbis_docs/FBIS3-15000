Franchuk, acting chairman of the Council of Ministers of Crimea, by V. Selivanova, KRYMSKAYA GAZETA correspondent; place and date not given: "Attention and Support Given"] [Text] As has already been reported, a working group of the Government of Crimea was in Kiev from 15 to 19 February to examine implementation of the instructions of the president of Ukraine in accordance with the results of his meeting with the president of the Republic of Crimea. Our correspondent asked A.R. Franchuk, the leader of this working group and acting chairman of the Council of Ministers of Crimea, about the outcome of the trip. [Franchuk] I will begin with the fact that the conference and meeting in Kiev took place in a businesslike and friendly atmosphere and at a high level. We were received by Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine V.N. Shmarov, who had invited to the meeting the ministers of power engineering and electrification, justice, agriculture, and machine-building, the deputy minister of the economy, the chairman of the State Property Fund, the first deputy chairmen of the board of the National Bank, and the managers of state committees and departments of Ukraine. Our working group also comprised ministers, chairmen of state committees, and directors of enterprises and associations. A number of questions that we had prepared for this meeting were discussed and resolved. In accordance with the findings of our group, on 19 February Ye. L. Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister of Ukraine, signed a protocol on the conference, conducted under his chairmanship, on issues regarding implementation of instructions on the results of the meeting of the president of Ukraine and the president of the Republic of Crimea. Its first point is the budget. The issue of implementation of the agreement on mutual budgetary relations between the Government of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea for 1994 was decided positively by the minister of finance of Ukraine, and appropriate instructions were given concerning the procedure for mutual settlements. [Selivanova] Anatoliy Romanovich, let us consider this question, please, in more detail. What advantages were gained in the formation of the budget? [Franchuk] In the approval of the budget of Ukraine for 1994, Crimea was left with an income in the amount of 43 percent of the sums received on its territory. The remaining 57 percent was subject to withdrawal for the state budget of Ukraine. Simultaneously, the allocation of subsidies from the state budget of Ukraine to Crimea was planned. It would have been very difficult to acquire them. Now, in line with the results of the trip, all taxes, collections, and mandatory payments received on the territory of the Republic of Crimea (except Sevastopol) will be entered into the Republic of Crimea budget. We, in turn, must pay back 4.3 percent from the budget to an account for general state programs of Ukraine (2.7 trillion karbovantsy). Now, above-plan income revenues will remain in Crimea. And additionally found incomes will not be confiscated for the budget of Ukraine. Hence, there is no longer a need to send money to Kiev and back to Crimea. And what I especially want to note is that an opportunity will present itself to balance the rural and settlement soviets more accurately. The conditions are created for ensuring the timely financing of budget expenditures. Thus, it is necessary to form a budget of Crimea on new principles and approve it at a session of the Supreme Soviet. The main task remains the receipt of a maximum sum of income. But for this, everyone has to work well. It should be noted that the issue of allocation of resources to pay off last year's debt to Crimea was also resolved. [Selivanova] How was the debt formed, and what does it amount to? [Franchuk] The debt was formed as a consequence of an insufficient transfer of resources in 1993 to finance programs for the economic stabilization of Crimea and measures associated with the return of Crimean Tatars and other deported people. The sum is 110 billion karbovantsy, taking today's indexation into account. The Ministry of Finance of Ukraine is obligated to establish before 30 March the sources for paying off the debt and also to resolve the question of allocating $1.5 million for the payment of debts for the acquisition of imported equipment in the first half of the year for the Fiolent Plant. I would also like to dwell on this very important question. The State Property Fund of Ukraine was instructed to prepare a draft decree of the Cabinet of Ministers by 1 March concerning the transfer to the property of the Republic of Crimea of facilities located on the territory of Crimea that are subject to privatization according to existing legislation of Ukraine. [Selivanova] It is known that a number of enterprises in the Crimea need currency expenditures. How was this resolved? [Franchuk] The Ministry of the Economy of Ukraine, on a representation of the Council of Ministers of the Crimea and pertinent ministries and departments, was ordered to prepare a proposal on the inclusion of our individual enterprises on the list of those that have a right to acquire hard currency resources. A period up to 30 March was set for an examination of the question on the priority sale of $4 million for the purchase of spare parts for imported trolleybuses, according to a request of the Council of Ministers of Crimea. Questions concerning the allocation of additional capital investments for the completion of construction of the most important water supply and sewage facilities of the cities of our republic, Sevastopol's water supply, and also the allocation of additional quotas on capital investments and grants to finance the reconstruction and operation of land reclamation facilities and water management, and others were discussed. There was discussion of ensuring the uninterrupted work of departmental boiler houses of military health centers and rest homes. [Selivanova] We are on the threshold of spring. What kind of support has been promised for Crimea's agriculture? [Franchuk] Taking into account the difficult conditions of the past year and the volume of spring sowing work, our republic will be allocated 20,000 tonnes of gas and 30,000 tonnes of diesel fuel in February-May. The requirement for spare parts and imported agricultural equipment will be satisfied. Mineral fertilizers and spring crop seeds were provided. Other questions were also resolved. The question of canceling the restrictions for the entry of citizens of Ukraine in Sevastopol was presented for examination. [Selivanova] Is it possible to draw the conclusion that all the points entered in the conference protocol can realistically be implemented? [Franchuk] Everything that is defined by the protocol and signed by Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy is realistic and has specific dates for completion in the first half of the year, starting in March. I had a conversation with President of Ukraine L.M. Kravchuk about the aims of the trip of our working group. And despite the difficult situation in Ukraine's economy, we were given attention and support by everyone we met at the very highest level. The ministries and departments of Ukraine jointly with the National Bank of Ukraine and the Council of Ministers of Crimea will have to continue work on implementation of the instructions of the president of Ukraine in accordance with the results of the meeting of the president of Ukraine and the president of the Republic of Crimea.
