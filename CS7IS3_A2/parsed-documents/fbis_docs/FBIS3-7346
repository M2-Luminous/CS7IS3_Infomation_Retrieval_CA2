According to the U.S. newspaper THE NEW YORK TIMES dated 27 March, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry ordered that modern fighters be dispatched to South Korea and Japan immediately if the UN Security Council imposes sanctions on our country. He has also ordered an increase in the supply of ammunition and parts for the U.S. Air Force in South Korea so that modern fighters, such as the F-117 Stealth fighters and F-15E's, can go into action immediately. The war fanatic also held a so-called news conference on 25 March, in which he raved about the need for thorough measures to cope with possible contingencies on the Korean peninsula and disclosed an operational plan for the additional dispatch of U.S. troops and military equipment to South Korea to augment the combat capability of U.S. imperialist aggression forces in South Korea. He did not forget to rave that the step of dispatching modern fighters to South Korea is aimed at coping with someone's southward invasion. However, the U.S. military leaders' order on the additional dispatch of armed forces, which is timed with the recent frenzied commotions of military threats against us by the U.S. bellicose circles, show that the U.S. imperialists are the ones who are aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula and that they are the main culprit in leading the situation to the brink of war. The fact that the U.S. imperialists have recently moved the U.S. Navy task force, including aircraft carriers, to the waters near our country, prepared their aggression forces in the U.S. mainland and in the area surrounding the Korean peninsula for a state of swift dispatch, and transported war material and U.S. troops to be mobilized in the Team Spirit joint military exercise to U.S. bases in Japan by air, clearly proves once again that they are intentionally maneuvering to further aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula. If the U.S. imperialists think that they can frighten someone with these military threats and blackmail, they are miscalculating. The U.S. imperialists should clearly see that this road of dashing to confrontation and war leads to their own grave and act with discretion.
