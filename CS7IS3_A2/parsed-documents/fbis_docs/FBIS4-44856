New concept: Significantly higher efficiency. "With this concept the ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) AG [ASEA -- Swedish General Electric Co] becomes undoubtedly the global leader in gas turbine technology," hopes Dr Manfred Simon, member of the ABB board of directors in Mannheim: "The innovation can, without exaggeration, be described as a sensational one." The new generation of gas turbines has remarkable characteristics: their thermal efficiency (ratio of engine output power to fuel input power) is almost 38 percent in the solo operation mode and the overall thermal efficiency of gas turbine + steam turbine set reaches 58 percent. When moreover heat is extracted for heating purposes, then the fuel utilization may be even 90-percent higher. With such a performance, then the two first engines of the new GT 26 series (for the 50 Hz market Europe and Asia) and GT 24 series (for American 60 Hz networks) are setting standards. The new gas turbine concept has been developed by an international group of scientists and engineers from various ABB companies. Both new gas turbines, 240 kW and 165 kW respectively, convert energy with not only less fuel and at a lower but also with lower NO[.sub]x[/] emission (below 25 ppm) and an excellent light-load performance. This technological leap was based on skillful selection of the process parameters for two-stage combustion. The result is a high specific power and a compact construction. The key component of each gas turbine is the staged combustion chamber. The concept is both simple and efficient: such a combustion chamber utilizes the compressed air from the turbine not once but twice. Intermediate superheating is ensured by two premixer burners includes, one behind the other. The annular first combustion chamber works with an unusually lean fuel-air mixture, the oxygen content being very high. About 60 percent of the incoming fuel is burnt here. Prior to combustion the air is compressed to a 30:1 ratio in a compressor consisting of 22 optimally streamlined stages. In the burner, prior to ignition, the thus compressed air mixes with an exact fuel dose in an intense vortex stream. The whirling of the fuel-air mixture through staggered conical burner half-shells is particularly intense. After ignition has taken place, the gaseous combustion products flow through a single-stage high-pressure turbine into the low-pressure combustion compartment. There, in the premixer burner, these still oxygen-rich gases mix thoroughly with the remaining 40 percent of the incoming fuel. Owing to the simple construction of the annular combustion chamber, only a few of its parts are exposed to high temperatures. The uniform flame distribution prevents buildup of thermal stresses. A new heating power plant in Berlin-Center is to prove this. Staged combustion chamber: high performance, low fuel consumption, low emission levels
