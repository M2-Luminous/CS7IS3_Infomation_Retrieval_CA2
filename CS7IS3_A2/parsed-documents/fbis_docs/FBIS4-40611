During the four-day visit Rybkin met with the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and German President Richard von Weizacker, Bundestag Chairman Rita Suessmuth, government officials, leaders of parliamentary factions and different political parties. Russian parliamentarians reached an agreement with their German colleagues to develop close cooperation, primarily at the level of the Duma committees and commissions of the German Bundestag dealing with economic issues. On the final day of the visit Russian lawmakers visited Russian servicemen from the Berlin Brigade of Western Troops. Addressing soldiers and officers of the Russian military contingent who will be the last to abandon the German territory in August, 1994, Rybkin declared that "their motherland would welcome them with a generous heart." Rybkin pointed out that looking into the state budget, lawmakers found "inner reserves" for the Army's needs worth 3.5 trillion roubles. Apart from that, funds are expected to be raised during the second stage of privatisation beginning in July, which, according to experts' estimates, will amount to 15-20 trillion roubles. The State Duma has decided to use these funds, in particular, for the construction of housing for servicemen and conversion projects, Rybkin said. Late on Sunday the delegation of the Russian parliament left Berlin for Moscow.
