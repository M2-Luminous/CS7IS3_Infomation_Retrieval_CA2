American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under Gulf War ceasefire resolutions, spent five days here preparing next week's visit by his boss Rolf Ekeus. "The discussions have been very productive" on implementing Security Council Resolution 715, which orders long term monitoring of Iraq's weapons programme, Duelfer said as he left for New York via Cyprus. The surveillance programme is the next UN step following the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf war of January-February 1991. Ekeus arrives next Wednesday to discuss long-term monitoring, but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting of sanctions before the end of the year. Iraq has been lobbying hard for an end to the embargo imposed after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Duelfer had talks with General 'Amr Rashid, head of the military industrialisation organisation, and visited several military sites. Setting up the monitoring "is a complicated procedure which will require the sustained efforts of both the government of Iraq and UNSCOM" he said. "Iraq has provided additional detailed information on facilities which we are evaluating." His talks here covered details of the monitoring, including inspections, sensors and cameras. Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting it for three years. "Significant progress has beenb made and much remains to be done" Duelfer added. A team of 16 inspectors led by Russian Nikita Smidovitch arrived with Duelfer on Friday for a 10 day inspection mission.
