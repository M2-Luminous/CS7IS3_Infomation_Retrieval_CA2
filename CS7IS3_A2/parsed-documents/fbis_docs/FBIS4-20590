Recent X-ray and magnetic susceptibility studies[.sup]1,2[/]) show that the system is more complex. From powder X-ray diffraction the lattice constants of ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] were determined to be a = 5,3547(3) Angstrom; b = 9,2824(5) Angstrom; c = 3,1017(2) Angstrom and _b_ = 90,893(5) Angstrom.[.sup]2[/] X-ray oscillation film technique observations on a single crystal of ErRh[.sub]3[/]B[.sub]2[/] show a superstructure with a six doubling of the c-axis.[.sup]1[/] Magnetization measurements show considerable anisotropy. At T[.sub]N[/] = 27 K, the data indicates ferromagnetic order with the spins directed parallel to the c-axis. However, the magnetization curve shows a maximum at 27 K. The magnetization decreases on further cooling and ends up at a value of 75% of it's maximum value. In order to investigate both the crystal and the magnetic structure, initial investigations of ErRh[.sub]3[/][.sup]11[/]B[.sub]2[/] has been performed on a four-circle neutron diffractometer using neutrons of wavelength 1,013 Angstrom. Scans parallel to the c[.sup]*[/]-axis indicated clearly a doubling of the c-axis, but no six doubling was seen. However, the resolution was too low to eliminate the presence of additional satellite reflections. At 15 K we observed strong ferromagnetic scattering. In addition we observed some scattering at (010), (030) and (100), all three of them systematically extinct above T[.sub]N[/]. There also seemed to be weak scattering at (0[.sub]3[/][.sup]4[/]0) and (0[.sub]3[/][.sup]8[/]0). This indicates that the magnetic ordering is not a simple ferromagnet. Experiments on a triple axis spectrometer, using cold neutrons(_l_ = 4 Angstrom) are planned. In this experiment we expect to be able to resolve the crystalline superstructure and follow the magnetic scattering as a function of temperature. References 1.
