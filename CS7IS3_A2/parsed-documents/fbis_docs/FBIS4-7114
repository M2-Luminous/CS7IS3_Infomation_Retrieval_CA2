In fact, if not in theory, not only in Russia -- the core of the former union -- but in the newly independent republics into which the union had broken up, the old Soviet apparatchiks were still effectively in power. The only difference was that, for the purpose of public relations, they had conveniently transformed themselves from communists into "nationalists". Free-market experts from the West solemnly enjoined on them the necessity of privatising State property. They were preaching to the converted. The apparatchiks "privatised" large chunks of Soviet property -- by stealing them! They "bought" them at knock-down prices, put the ownership into their own names, and often sold them to western interests. Well aware of what runaway inflation at home would do to the proceeds, they generally insisted on being paid in dollars, which they proceeded to invest in banks that protected their anonymity -- mainly in Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Even the Italian Mafia was brought into the picture. Now, however, the honeymoon is over. In order to reinforce their personal positions the new leaders -- still, in general, old-time communists -- are playing the nationalist card even more strongly attempting to steal the political clothes of Vladimir Zhirinovsky by reassembling the former Soviet States into a new Russian dominated federation. States like Belarus, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Moldavia, and the three Central Asian republics are already "in the bag", with the future of Ukraine still to be determined. Even Poland and Lithuania, while clearly outside the bag, have re-elected old-time communists to office. It is no longer the ghosts of Lenin and Stalin that hover uneasily on the political horizon. It is the more traditional Russian figures of Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great. To believe that the United States -- the only remaining genuine superpower -- is on top of the problems which, with the effluxion of time, will inevitably result from these developments, would be an illusion. President Clinton himself clearly has little time to devote to anything other than his own -- and his wife's -- personal problems, as his Republican opponents gradually tighten the noose, seek to revenge themselves for Nixon and Watergate, and to lay the foundations for a future Republican victory. In appointing Strobe Talbott as Assistant Secretary of State (for Russian affairs) Clinton has handed the control of the US's Russian policy to one who believes that the US's exertions in the Cold War were profoundly mistaken, and that the Soviet Union was more sinned against than sinning. The military power of the US -- which, whether or not it is guided by any consistent political vision, is overwhelming -- is concentrated on three regions: northeastern Asia; Latin America; and the Middle East. In relation to Latin America, the US has successfully reasserted the Monroe Doctrine. In relation to north-eastern Asia, the developing conflict between North and South Korea is finally directed to the safety of Japan. In the Middle East, the issue is American control of Saudi Arabia's oil supplies. The purpose of the Gulf War was to provide a formula to enable the US to base its military forces and equipment in Saudi Arabia. What other objectives remain within the framework of US foreign policy today? One is tempted to say "not many". There is, however, more to it than that. The US will have won few friends with what is little short of outright bullying in the cases of China and Japan. These ancient societies do not respond to public humiliation. In relation to China, the pretence that the US is seriously concerned about the "human rights" of Chinese citizens deceives no one. China has had at least 500,000 political prisoners for decades. There are reportedly about 20 million ordinary prisoners in labour camps, whose unpaid slave labour supplies one of the main foundations of China's allegedly booming economy. The US has observed these permanent factors of Chinese society with equanimity for many years. Why the sudden outbreak of moral concern? With the Japanese, it is the familiar indignation with Japan's "inaccessible" markets, dimmed only temporarily by the deal with Motorola and with the foreign rice-growers. Despite Japanese trade barriers, Germany has succeeded in exporting more cars to Japan than Japan exports to Germany. Japanese trade barriers cannot be as tight as all that. Why then the constant beating of the nationalist drum against Japan? Last Wednesday [30 March] week, the US Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, delivered an under-reported address in New York. He stated that the key objective of US policy over the next two years would be to enforce full access by American banks and other financial institutions into all leading countries. The US would be prepared, he said, to retaliate against countries which refused full access to its financial institutions. The presence of American banks, he said, was necessary to allow the US to share in the prosperity of Asia's markets. Bentsen visited Beijing at the end of January. A joint statement was signed by him and China's finance minister Liu Zhongli which announced that this year US banks would be permitted to establish themselves in China's main cities to trade in Chinese currency. The South China Morning Post reported in January this was "only on a limited experimental basis". Is the hypothetical agitation about "human rights" anything more than a cover for the real issue, the accelerated entry of American banks to the Chinese mainland? The links between the Clinton Democratic administration and the controlling groups of the US investment banks are extremely close. As chairman of the National Economic Council, Clinton chose Robert E. Rubin, who is also co-chairman of Goldman Sachs Ltd, one of the most powerful of them all, and not noted for representing any interest other than those of its investors. If there is more to the foreign policy of the Clinton administration than the exclusively financial interest, it remains to be explained.
