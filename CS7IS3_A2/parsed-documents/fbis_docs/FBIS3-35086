Steve Linde reports: [Begin recording] [Linde] Foreign Minister Peres said the talks that would lead to a free trade zone between Israel and the European Commission will begin on the 21st of February. Peres said the new trade agreement would represent a new chapter in relations between Israel and the European Union, and he spelled out the implications of the agreement: [Peres] In addition to be raised in the rank so we shall become an associated member of the European Economic Space, specifically what we want are the following: to be a full member of the research and development community. The second point, economically speaking, is that we would like to be able to produce in Israel products that will be considered as products of the Common Market. Thirdly, we would like to extend and enlarge our participation and the participation on a mutual basis of the Common Market in public tenders and governmental tenders. Fourth, we would like to have a slight improvement in the quota of our agricultural exports, particularly when we are opening our markets -- as the minister of agriculture has mentioned already -- to the products of the people of the territories. [Linde] The vice president of the European Commission, Manuel Marin, said the agreement being offered to Israel was unique and could not apply to any other country. [Marin] At the end of the negotiation we are going to have with Israel a free trade zone. Well, this specific situation concerning trade, industry, research, and technology, etc., etc., is only possible to have with Israel, not with another neighbor, because of the different economic development. [Linde] The new agreement will replace the more limited cooperation accord concluded in 1975 between the EC and Israel. Marin said it was made possible by the Declaration of Principles signed between Israel and the PLO and reflects the Union's backing for the Middle East peace process. [end recording]
