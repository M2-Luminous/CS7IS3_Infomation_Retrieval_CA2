Euro issues also have become popular and an amount of $1 billion has already been raised and another $1.5 billions can be secured in the coming months if all the contemplated issues fructify. Preferential offers have lately been more popular as it is easy to conclude arrangements for private placements after getting the approval of the shareholders. On the basis of existing guidelines, the highest quotation for the related equity shares in a period of six months prior to the date of decision to make the preferential offer will be the price for the equity shares involved. Vast resources are thus being mobilised in a manner which could not have been visualised even in the middle of last year. As already stated, one can have a stake up to 24 per cent in the enlarged equity capital through preferential offers and holdings already secured through purchases from the open market or otherwise will have to be taken into account for this purpose. Since the allocations to different institutions give rise to problems, efforts are being made to sort out them. However, it is being examined by the monetary authorities whether it is desirable to have a big increase in the stake of foreign interests in equity capital of Indian enterprises when there is no need for incurring heavy capital expenditure on ongoing and new schemes. Also, the allotment of equity shares against preferential offers in Indian currency will create an obligation for the country to find the required forex [foreign exchange] resources if at a later date the proceeds from sale of equity shares now being allotted have to be repatriated by Flls [NRIs--nonresident Indians]. There will, of course, be a drain of forex resources only if sales exceeded fresh purchases. RBI [Reserve Bank of India] Examining Impact of Recent Developments In the case of Euro issues, however, there will be an initial inflow of forex resources directly. (Even in respect of preferential offers to Flls there would have been an earlier inflow of foreign exchange though recycling may not result in an immediate inflow of forex resources). Here again considerably larger amounts on foreign exchange will have to be found if equity shares so allotted appreciated substantially over a period and sales by foreign investors or Flls exceed current purchases. Various aspects will, therefore, have to be carefully examined for determining the balance of advantage accruing to the economy. However, the enterprises gathering additional resources in this way stand to gain considerably and it is now being discussed in market circles to what extent there will be an increase in the net profit, before depreciation and taxation, as a result of a lower burden of interest charges even without any change in the gross profit, before depreciation and interest charges. SPIC to Issue Euro Convertible Bonds Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation (SPIC) is again seeking to raise $80 millions this time through Euro convertible bonds for taking advantage of the opportunity for repaying loans in foreign currencies on costlier terms taken for acquiring ships for handling liquid chemicals. It is also intended to utilise a portion for investment in an urea plant in West Asia and on new projects that may be promoted for producing polyester filament yarn and purified teraphthalic acid within the country. The financing of the ongoing schemes can be easily attempted as it is now expected that the drug project in Cuddalore will be commencing production of G. Penncillin towards the close of this year. The modernisation of the ammonia plant and related assets is also making satisfactory progress. Novel Features and Options The Euro convertible bonds that may be issued can be on attractive terms for the management if it is eventually decided to allot equity shares against these bonds at a high premium later at the option of the management. The lenders also can elect to get allotted equity shares within a stipulated period. In that event, the equity capital will get again enlarged and foreign ownership may rise to 48 per cent eventually if all the holders of Euro convertible bonds exercise their option to secure equity shares. The rise in percentage may be less pronounced if a much higher premium is realised. It has been explained by Mr. A.C. Muthiah, Vice Chairman and President, that the total resources for nearly $155 millions will be improving considerably the financial position of the company and bringing about a considerable reduction in the burden of interest charges. The issue of GDRs [expansion not given] for $74.75 millions equivalent to Rs. 235 crores was made at a time when the quotations for equity shares were much lower than they are now. There was thus an increase in the equity capital by Rs. 33.52 crores to Rs. 88.04 crores from Rs. 54.52 crores. The premium realised on "allotment" of equity shares was Rs. 200.97 crores. Earlier, the paid up capital had increased to Rs. 54.52 crores from Rs. 34 crores as a result of allotment of equity shares against zero bonds. The premium realised was Rs. 27.04 crores. Total reserves, including share premium and excluding revaluation reserve, are now Rs. 360.04 crores. Euro-convertible bonds will result in a further increase in equity capital and the stake of the promoters in enlarged equity capital will tend to decline. New Projects on Anvil In order to retain the existing percentage in the enlarged equity capital, it is proposed to issue warrants to the promoters for enabling them to get 23 million equity shares at a premium, which may be determined on the basis of SEBI [Securities and Exchange Board of India] guidelines. These warrants may be encashed by the promoter group in the light of holders of Euro convertible bonds exercising their option to get allotted equity shares or the directors taking advantage of the opportunity for minimising addition to equity capital in the event of conversion with the realisation of a higher premium. The details relating to terms of the issue will be known after the negotiations are completed.
