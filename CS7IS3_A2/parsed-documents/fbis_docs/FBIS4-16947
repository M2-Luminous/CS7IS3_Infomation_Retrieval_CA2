Evidently, the mutually exclusive nature of the proposals drawn up by the deputies can block any decision on privatization they might decide to make. This situation will enable the president to assume the key role in the drafting and implementation of denationalization policy. The final day of the expanded hearings at the State Duma (KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported their beginning 13 April) enabled various political associations to present their views on privatization and its further prospects. As expected, privatization (as was the case with the Supreme Soviet) remains an apple of discord between the executive and representative branches. Unlike the government, which now knows for sure that further privatization should be carried out in favor of investment and "an effective owner," the deputies lacked a joint approach. Whereas Sergey Glazyev of the Democratic Party of Russia faction demanded a change in the policy of check privatization, which "has led us into a deadlock and a morass," Vladimir Martemyanov, representative of the Communist Party, opposed "the unprecedented sale of Russian enterprises to foreign capitalists." As an alternative, he proposes that denationalization be replaced with destatization, as a result of which the bulk of enterprises will be transferred into "collective ownership," and privatization will be limited "only to small enterprises." Vladimir Lisichkin and Vyacheslav Marychev, representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], attempted in their addresses and statements from the audience to expose "the criminal nature" of privatization "according to Chubays." The main pathos of their pronouncements and recommendations was designed to give reasons for the State Property Committee chairman's removal, particularly because "he has been tripping up the president." Driven by concern over the president, Mr. Marychev said that "the LDPR will not let Chubays out of Norilsk once he has left for it" (the deputy prime minister is going to Norilsk on a business trip). Meanwhile, representatives of "Russia's Choice" backed the post- voucher privatization concept drawn up by the State Property Committee and proposed that the state intensify control over the management of state property and the state's share in denationalized enterprises. Although this stance did not draw support from representatives of other political organizations, Chubays (a "Russia's Choice" member) said that he was "content with the results of the hearings." The deputies' political ambitions make it impossible for them to control denationalization. This situation has strengthened Viktor Chernomyrdin, who, according to Chubays, "will not allow privatization to halt" (among other things, yesterday the prime minister signed the decree "On the Practice of Agricultural Changes in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast," approving the experience of land denationalization). Since the head of the cabinet has approved in general the post-voucher privatization concept aimed at involving "an effective owner" in economic development, the State Property Committee drafters see their chances to implement these plans increasing.
