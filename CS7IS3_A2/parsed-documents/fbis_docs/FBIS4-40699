He met with Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, in the city. Milani said that his visit to Sevastopol had nothing to do with the tense situation there and that his party would not meet with the Crimean leadership. He emphasized that Ukraine was a sovereign state which had to tackle its domestic problems on its own. Following his meeting with Milani, Bezkorovaynyy told INTERFAX-Ukraine that his country badly needed cooperation with NATO in the framework of the Partnership for Peace program which, he thought, marked the start of reorienting military and political blocks to the maintenance of peace. Bezkorovaynyy said that cooperation between the Ukrainian armed forces and NATO and planning of joint activities at the initial stage had been discussed in the framework of the program. He added that exchange of experts who would concentrate on specific issues in interaction between the Ukrainian Navy and NATO had been discussed at the meeting.
