Born 1938 in the village Lepena, Knjazevac Opstina. By nationality Serb. Graduate of the School of Agriculture. Employed after graduation in the Vucje Agricultural Cooperative as production superintendent, and in 1964 became the cooperative's director. It was then that he ended his agricultural career and began his political career. He was decorated for his effort with the Order of Labor with silver garland. Zoran Sokolovic was the principal operative at the Eighth Meeting, then the one who took the silk cord to Novi Sad when the advocates of autonomy were overthrown, and, finally, president of the Assembly in the year when the constitution was adopted giving great powers to the president of the republic. On 8 June 1990, when the first meeting was held between the government and opposition representatives in the offices of the Serbian Republic Executive Council, the government representatives were Zoran Sokolovic, Dusan Mihajlovic, and Ratko Markovic, while the opposition was represented by Vuk Draskovic, Veljko Guberina, Milenko Radic (NRS [People's Radical Party]), Djordje Ninkovic (Democratic Party [DS]), Velimir Cvetic, Ranka Cicak (SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Yugoslavia]), and Aleksandar Stefanovic (Liberal Party [LS]). It was agreed at the time that in future a "roundtable discussion" would be held regularly, every Tuesday, but nothing came of that agreement. He has been a deputy in all three convocations of the Assembly. In the first convocation of the multiparty Assembly, he was the liaison between SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] deputies and Milosevic. He was elected minister of internal affairs on 30 May 1991, following the resignation of Radmilo Bogdanovic (by a majority of the votes, nine abstaining). During the debate of the Law on Internal Affairs, he responded to the criticism of the deputies: "I have a soul and a heart and it pains me to hear these charges and insinuations." At a time when countless uniformed members of various paramilitary formations were roaming over Serbia, Zoran Sokolovic refused to debate this in the Assembly, because "neither have there been, nor are there now, any paramilitary armed formations whatsoever on the territory of the Republic of Serbia." In connection with the June demonstrations and the arrest of Vuk Draskovic, Ferenc Cubela (DZVM [Democratic Conference of Vojvodina Hungarians]) reminded the deputies of the SPS of the television pictures from 5-6 October 1988 and of Mr. Zoran Sokolovic with the megaphone, and also of the role he had in Novi Sad. Zoran Sokolovic said in response to that: "There is no need to explain to anyone what happened in 1988 and what has happened now on 1 June, it was witnessed by the entire people not only of this Republic of Serbia of ours, but indeed the entire world. Accordingly, one cannot be exchanged or compared with the other, and I have no further comment." In the debate on the state of security and safety of the population, he assured the public that "there are no reasons for people to feel hysteria based on fear and insecurity and a feeling of being threatened." At almost the same time, the republic police occupied the buildings of the federal police. In his time as minister, two ministers of the government of Serbia have been arrested (Vlajkovic and Mihajlovic), but proceedings against them have not been terminated to this day. Finally, a lexical tidbit. The root of the police minister's surname is "sokol [falcon]," defined as "a bird of prey which aristocrats train and use to hunt with." Perhaps the surname has no relation to the character, and it is probably a pure accident that at one time the Serbian government included not only Prime Minister Sainovic (whose surname comes from the Persian word sain, which means "falcon"), but also the police minister had etymologically the same surname--a surname connoting that its owners have, so to speak, a natural instinct which drives them to be obedient to their supreme master and the ability to provide him a good catch, which is a topic made to order for Milja Vujanovic. Slobodan Radulovic, Deputy Prime Minister Born 10 January 1943 in prison. His mother Petrana, who was in the Partizans, was pregnant when she was imprisoned in the casemate on Mamula Island, where she had the baby and gave him the symbolic name Slobodan; he spent the first nine months of his life in prison. Radulovic came to Belgrade in 1963 and enrolled in the School of Economics, where he received his degree in 1968. He got his first job in the Belgrade Packinghouse. He has been the director of several firms in the past and the city minister for the economy. Four years ago, he became the head of C Market. Married (his wife Vukica is employed in Elektrodistribucija); they have two daughters (Jelena and Natasa), and they are both studying economics. Owner of a Toyota. Favors the idea that before taking office the property of all ministers should be inventoried, "because the main benefit of this would be for the government. It is time that people left the government without a blemish." He was a deputy in the Serbian Assembly in the second convocation (1993). In the last election, he was elected on the slate of the DS in the Belgrade electoral unit, he was expelled from the DS because he entered the government, and, according to Djindjic, he will be asked to give up his office. As the director of C Market, during the years of inflation he managed to preserve the capital of his firm, among other things by leasing the stores and vehicles to employees of C Market. These days, he represents himself as "one of the fiercer critics of all governments," which is why he "has often experienced unpleasantness." He sees the state as a large business firm which must make a profit. He says he would have "no dilemma about resigning because of things which are irregular." Radovan Pankov, Minister for Liaison With the Serbs Outside Serbia A teacher from the village Tovarisevo, one of the beneficiaries of the Eighth Meeting. On the wings of the "yogurt revolution" in September 1988, he soared to high posts in the party and government. His ascent began on 20 October 1990; at the First Conference of the SPS for Vojvodina, he was elected to the Main Committee, and then he was Sipovac's rival for the post of president. In the 1990 election, he was elected in the first round (with 55.72 percent of the vote) in the Backa Palanka II and Bac electoral unit, and he obtained the post of vice president of the Assembly. He even used that post to help his son graduate from high school. That was in late June 1992. Escorted by security, in an official car with police plates, Radovan Pankov visited Podujevo. His son Misa was with him. According to Deputy Zoran Paunovic, Radovan Pankov "came for a working visit to the Podujevo region and the economic giant--the Fagar Construction Fittings Factory, at the invitation of the opstina leadership." During the visit to the business school, Milena Vukotic, a teacher, and principal Grujic hastily questioned young Misa and found that he was a chip off the old block and issued him a diploma from the business school. For the favor which the school's principal did for Pankov, Gvozden Grujic received from the vice president of the Assembly a promise that he would be appointed chief of the Podujevo MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Presumably so that he could deport from Podujevo the teachers who objected to this fast-service graduation of young Misa. But in addition to his personal worries, Comrade Pankov also worries about affairs of state. Informed sources say that during this war he has been operating from the background, mainly through the so-called National Council for Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srem, whose headquarters were on territory under Pankov's control--in Backa Palanka. It is from there, it is said, that the "spontaneous uprising" of the people was directed, and many people, among them even Vojislav Seselj, talk about Pankov's role in supplying weapons to Serbs on the other side of the river. Following the election in May, Radovan Pankov was elected to the Chamber of the Republics, on the candidates' slate of representatives of the Assembly elected by the Assembly of Serbia from among the ranks of its deputies. Aside from these facts, Pankov's qualifications for the post of minister were probably also helped by his assurance that "there would have been no Serbia if it had accepted the ultimatums of the CSCE and the EC. The advocacy of an independent and self-sufficient Serbia by certain opposition parties in Serbia is tantamount to capitulation and the courting of an expanded Germany." Ratomir Vico, Information Minister A returnee to the post of minister. Vico was elected minister the first time on 31 July 1991 during the "reconstruction" of the Bozovic government. After 9 March, he headed Television Belgrade. Vico became the truth minister of Serbia after he "differentiated" the editorial staffs as the commissar of numerous working groups following the triumph of the Milosevic faction. At that time, the main curse among Belgrade editors was "May God send Vico's working group to visit you." Following a short period as minister, Vico returned to Television, which is now headed by Milorad Vucelic, and he has been receiving a salary as his adviser, and working on the distribution of fuel within the firm. The appointment of Vico to be information minister was one of the principal stumbling blocks within the leadership of the SPS. Those who attended say that he was one of the reasons why the discussion about the makeup of the cabinet lasted all night. Only just before dawn did a directive arrive from on high that Vico should be the candidate, and that ended the story about Milivoje Pavlevic's successor. Radoje Djukic, Minister for Business Enterprise Born 24 July 1949 in the village Cecuni, Ivangrad Opstina, Montenegro. He is the second member of the Democratic Party detached to work in the Marjanovic government. Radoje Djukic owns the Djukic Knitwear Mill. Last year, he was elected small business manager of the year. A man who has known Marjanovic for many years ("it was my good fortune that we exported together"). The owner of the knitwear factory worked on exports and imports of petroleum and gas from Russia through Italy. He is a member of the Executive Committee of New Belgrade Opstina (he represents the DS in the opstina Assembly), in the opstina government he is chairman of the Committee for Aid to the Krajinas, and, from what he himself says, New Belgrade Opstina is the only one in the FRY which has solved the problem of aid to the krajinas in an institutional way. According to BORBA, he made a custom of working lunches with every prime minister, and he uses the familiar form of address with Milosevic." Ratko Markovic, Deputy Prime Minister Born 8 December 1944 in Pozarevac. Author of both constitutions in effect today. He began his career as university professor in Kragujevac. He got his post as professor at the University of Belgrade with the help of his friends in the SK-PJ [League of Communists-- Movement for Yugoslavia] (Draskovic), in that the authors of a textbook made the gentlemanly gesture of consenting to sign him on as an author so that he would fulfill the condition for becoming a professor. As an expert on federalism (position of the provinces), he took part in debates about a "unified Serbia" and then sided politically with Milosevic. He has been a judge on the Constitutional Court, and now he is a deputy in the Citizens Chamber of the Yugoslav Assembly. Svetozar Krstic, Deputy Prime Minister Law school graduate. Owner of the Krstic Holding Company. He began his working career in the small provincial town of Odzaci as director of an internal bank, and he entered Serbia's political life as a young official among Milosevic's Communists, for a time he was on the Politburo of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia, but at the time when the Communists were renamed Socialists, Krstic changed teams and went over to the ND-PS [New Democracy--Movement for Serbia]. He maintained good business relations with those who had been his comrades up to that time, as indicated by the fact that he was given the post of assistant general director on the team of Dragan Tomic (the one from Simpo). During the transformation of the Yugoslav economy, he became a private businessman and set up his own firm, always in tune with the fashion. When it was profitable to open up exchange offices and savings banks, Krstic also had one of his own.
