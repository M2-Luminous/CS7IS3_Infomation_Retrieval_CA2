FR940317-2-00025 FR940317-2-00016 PEIS for Waste Management DOE has published a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare a Programmatic EIS on Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM PEIS) (55 FR 42633, October 22, 1990). An Implementation Plan for this PEIS was published in February 1994. A draft PEIS is currently expected to be issued by September 1994. EIS for Programmatic Spent Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) Environmental Restoration and Waste Management This EIS is currently in preparation and will include, among other issues, a programmatic analysis for the transportation, receipt, processing and storage of spent nuclear fuel, including consideration of sites other than INEL. SRS is one of the alternative sites being evaluated. Environmental Assessment (EA) for HB-Line Operation HB-Line is currently operating to provide plutonium-238 for future space missions. In July 1991, DOE issued an Environmental Assessment for Radioisotope Heat Source Fuel Processing and Fabrication, DOE/EA&hyph;0534. Based on the analysis in the EA, DOE determined that the proposed action, which included operation of HB-Line Phases I and III, does not significantly affect the quality of the human environment. DOE issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) on July 21, 1991; the FONSI was published in the Federal Register on July 25, 1991 (56 FR 34057). As part of a negotiated court settlement, DOE is preparing an additional EA that will examine impacts of operating HB-Line Phases I and III beyond those activities currently underway. The cumulative impacts of operation of HB-Line Phases I and III in conjunction with the proposed action and alternatives will be addressed in this nuclear materials interim management EIS. EA and EIS for Foreign Research Reactor Spent Fuel DOE is preparing an EIS on the proposed adoption and implementation of a policy for the acceptance of up to 15,000 spent nuclear fuel elements from foreign research reactors. This EIS is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 1995. In the interim, to meet the needs of certain foreign research reactor operators and to avoid failure of a key United States nuclear nonproliferation objective, DOE proposes to accept a small number of foreign research reactor spent fuel elements for storage at an existing SRS wet storage facility. DOE has prepared and has issued for public comment, a draft EA (February 1994) to evaluate the environmental impact of this proposed interim action. Canyon Ventilation Upgrade EIS On March 20, 1992, DOE published an NOI to prepare an EIS for the upgrade of canyon exhaust systems at SRS (57 FR 9693). An Implementation Plan was issued in January 1993. The scope of the upgrade is being substantially reduced and DOE is presently evaluating what level of analysis is required under NEPA, as a result of the change in scope. EA for Plutonium Storage in Building 247&hyph;F Vault DOE is preparing an environmental assessment to evaluate the impacts of consolidating certain stable plutonium materials for interim storage into an existing vault located in Building 247&hyph;F at the SRS. The EA will evaluate the consolidated storage of plutonium materials currently stored at several locations on the SRS. EISs for Reactor Operation DOE has published two Final EISs on nuclear reactor operation at SRS: L-Reactor Operation, DOE/EIS&hyph;0108, 1984, and Continued Operation of K-, L-, and P-Reactors (ROEIS), DOE/EIS&hyph;0147, 1990. DOE stated in the Final ROEIS that it will prepare an EIS ``that includes more detail on the environmental impacts of support facilities.'' The EIS addressed by this NOI partially fulfills that commitment. Reconfiguration PEIS On July 23, 1993, DOE published a revised Notice of Intent to prepare a PEIS for reconfiguration of its nuclear weapons complex (56 FR 39528) due to nuclear weapons stockpile reductions. The Department is reviewing the reconfiguration alternatives based on scoping comments resulting from public review of the revised Notice of Intent and budget projections. The results of this review will be presented in a revised Implementation Plan that will replace the earlier (February 1992) Implementation Plan. The SRS will be analyzed as a candidate site.
