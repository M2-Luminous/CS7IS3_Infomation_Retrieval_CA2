This is the chief result of talks between General of the Army Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of defence, and his French counterpart, Francois Leotard, who is currently in Russia on an official visit. The defence cooperation agreement provides for exchanges of military delegations and consultations on defence matters. The military-technical cooperation accord envisages joint tackling of defence industry conversion matters, the development of some types of armaments and military hardware, those for the Air Force, in particular, and the coordination of matters concerning arms trade with third countries. The agreements signed bring Russia and France to a qualitatively new level of relations, the two ministers emphasised during their meeting. M. Leotard together with Grachev visited the Taman Guards Motorised Rifle Division, took in specimens of arms and combat hardware, and familiarised himself with the living conditions of personnel. The French guest's trip to the Tula Airborne Division, scheduled for Friday, has been cancelled.
