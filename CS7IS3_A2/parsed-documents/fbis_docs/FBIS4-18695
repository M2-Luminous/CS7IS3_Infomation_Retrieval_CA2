First, the decision could be considered extreme, given that it is the first time the EU Commission has taken such a measure against one of its members, which also happens to hold the EU presidency. The EU Commission ignored the political aspect of the Greek-Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] dispute, taking into consideration only the legal and trade aspects of the "embargo"--which we should note has also questioned in our country. This development came as an unpleasant surprise, but it also raises other questions, because both the Security Council and Matthew Nimetz, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the Balkans, have recently stressed the political dimension of the Skopje issue. In fact, they stressed that a prolongation of the uncertainty would threaten the stability of the whole region. Therefore, we ask: What are criteria of the EU Commission, which is the executive body, for completely ignoring the above aspect and making yesterday's decision without any prior decision by the EU Council of Ministers, which has the basic authority on issues related with the EU solidarity? Aside from all this, the EU Commission's decision to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice constitutes strong, almost one-sided pressure against our country, especially in view of the talks in New York scheduled for 11 April on the Skopje issue and also coming on the eve of the Greek prime minister's visit to the United States. All the above points and questions should be examined very seriously by the Greek Government. Because first of all, they indicate significant differences between our foreign policy in the Balkans and EU ambitions and goals in the region, to the extent that the EU's policies show any homogeneity or consistency at all. Secondly, yesterday's decision highlights the worrisome drop in our country's influence in the EU's central bodies. This certainly is not due solely to the discontent arising from the Greek countermeasures against Skopje.... In other words, yesterday's reaction by the Government and opposition to the "unfair" decision of our "partners," who were under emotional pressure, is worthless and useless. What is important is to correctly evaluate the developments that gave rise to this decision and react calmly, based on our national interests.
