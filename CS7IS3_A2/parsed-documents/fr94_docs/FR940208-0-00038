FR940208-0-00038 FR940208-0-00019 At IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1), Iowa also proposes to add a sentence to the end of the State's substitute paragraph (b) for 30 CFR 774.13(b) that requires ``[a] change which does not constitute a significant departure from the original permit will be processed as an amendment to the permit[.]'' Iowa proposes to add a new paragraph (6) at IAC 27&hyph;40.32 that modifies its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 774.13(a) by adding the following at the end of the incorporated Federal regulation: The ``revision'' is a significant departure in mining and reclamation operations defined at subrule 40.32(1)(b)(2)(i), and it requires a public notice. The division uses the term ``amendment'' for an insignificant revision, and it does not require a public notice. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 774.13 do not address permit ``revisions'' versus ``amendments'' specifically, however, 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) requires the regulatory authority to create guidelines establishing the scale or extent of revisions for which all the permit application information requirements and procedures of 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter G, including the public notice, public participation, and notice of decision requirements of 30 CFR §§773.13, 773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21, shall apply. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) also specify that such requirements and procedures shall apply ``at a minimum to all significant permit revisions.'' There are four concerns regarding Iowa's proposed changes to its program. First, Iowa has language in its program, at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(2), that provides, in part: Any application for a revision which proposes significant alterations in the operations described in the materials submitted in the application for the original permit under Part 3 of these rules or in the conditions of the original permit, shall, at a minimum, be subject to the requirements of Part 9 of these rules and must provide replacement documentation fully describing changes to be made in the same detail as required in the original permit (emphasis added). By comparison, the proposed language at 27&hyph;40.32 (1) and (6) described above refers to significant departures and significant departures appear to only be required to provide public participation and public notice. Therefore, it appears that Iowa is proposing a two-tiered system for revisions: an all-inclusive revision, referred to as a significant alteration, which requires full replacement documentation and adherence to the requirements of Part 9, and a subset to the significant alteration, referred to as a significant departure, which only requires public participation and notice. Second, the preamble to the Federal rules at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) dated September 28, 1983, (48 FR 44344, 44377) makes it clear that all revisions to the permit, whether they be significant or insignificant, or in Iowa's case a revision or an amendment, must be approved by the regulatory authority and incorporated into the permit. Under the final rule, the regulatory authority will establish the guidelines for revisions. However, all revisions must be approved and incorporated into the permit since they are changes to that document. The permit and all public copies of it should reflect all revisions approved by the regulatory authority so that all interested persons, including inspectors, the operator, and the public, will have an accurate copy of the permit. The permit is the document which authorizes the operator to mine and must be accurate. The first paragraph of proposed IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1) seems to require that any change to a permit be approved by the regulatory authority, either by amendment or revision. At a later section of proposed IAC 27&hyph;40.32(1), however, Iowa states that: [(b)](2) A revision or amendment to a permit shall be obtained: (i) For changes in the surface coal mining or reclamation operations described in the original application and approved under the original permit, when such changes constitute a departure from the method or conduct of mining and reclamation operations contemplated in the original permit (emphasis added).
