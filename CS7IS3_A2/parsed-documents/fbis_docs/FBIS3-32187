The legislator has asked the people in charge of the civilian mission in Haiti for clarification of the article in the weekly magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, which quotes the United Nations [UN] regarding this case: [Begin recording] [Dupiton] Everytime there is a question of change in the Senate of the Republic, these kinds of attacks arise against Sen. Dupiton. However, this case arises at the right time. This is going to show you on what level these people who are acting can benefit from the complicity of the international community. Since it was published about a month ago, the UN must have known that something was published in JEUNE AFRIQUE mentioning a UN report. It was only yesterday that I saw this article. That is perhaps why reactions came from the Senate. But the UN was aware of this. It has even been said that articles were commissioned and that these gentlemen distributed those articles. I am speaking of those who have an interest in disseminating this message. [Unidentified reporter] Do you think it is a plot against you? [Dupiton] It is a huge plot, not only against me, but against the country, since the police have been put into action. If the police do their work, they must, based on this UN report, investigate the matter, if the UN sources are verified. It is therefore a huge plot against the institutions in charge of this country. [end recording] [Announcer] That was Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton. It should be pointed out that according to the article in the weekly magazine, JEUNE AFRIQUE, Sen. Dupiton had taken in the murderers of Antoine Izmery on the eve of the 18 September crime.
