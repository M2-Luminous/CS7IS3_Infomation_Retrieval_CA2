He described the bombing as a "despicable and barbaric act," adding that while the authorities were unable to positively establish responsibility, it was internationally assumed Bosnian Serb artillery was to blame. "Certainly the case for air strikes is becoming more compelling, more irresistible," he told parliament. He said the international community was hesitant to use air strikes because it was unclear if they would be successful in removing threats and could hurt humanitarian operations in Bosnia. "It is a matter for very fine judgment for those who have their own citizens at risk," he said. "It is a matter for very fine judgment by everyone who has the best interests of the Bosnian people deeply at heart. "We in Australia will support any decision that is made as a result of these proper processes working themselves out."
