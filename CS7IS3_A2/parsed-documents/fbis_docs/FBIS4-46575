He has worked at "Oboroneksport" since 1976 and has been deputy chairman of this organization since 1992. Yuriy Georgiyevich Sizov completed the Military Academy of Communications, is a specialist on air defense weapons, and is editor of VPK magazine. At the end of his political career, U.S President D. Eisenhower introduced the term "MIC" -- military industrial complex. Since that time, this term has become acclimated in many countries. The president thought that the U.S. military industrial complex was a monster that was increasingly subordinating the country's political and economic life to itself. With the initiation of perestroyka and M.S. Gorbachev's energetic steps that were directed at arms reduction, in our country the term military industrial complex became an expletive in the mouths of a number of deputies and certain irresponsible politicians. They presented the matter in such a manner that we only had to reduce appropriations for the needs of the military industrial complex and, if prosperity did not come, then in any case, great material and financial possibilities would appear in the country to resolve various internal problems. In the process, conversion was understood simply as the appearance of a large quantity of consumer goods which would be manufactured by military plants instead of weapons. For some reason they were silent about the fact that conversion initially requires large capital investments and only later will it provide a yield. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Commission on Military-Industrial Issues under the USSR Council of Ministers Presidium, which coordinated the work of the country's defense sectors, was eliminated. In the Russian Federation, appropriations for the defense industry were drastically reduced and total uncertainty has arisen with state orders for arms: in 1992, expenditures for the purchase of arms and military equipment were reduced by 68% and were practically reduced to zero in a whole series of directions. The level of production of certain types of arms fell so much that it became unprofitable for enterprises which "began to refuse defense orders", said First Deputy Minister of Defense A.A. Kokoshin (IZVESTIYA, No 23, 23 January 1993). The majority of defense enterprises were left to their own devices. How was that reflected in the lives of the people? Did the people's material welfare improve as the politicians had previously assumed? It turned out that nearly half of the country's population was linked with the domestic military industrial complex and the most qualified portion of the workers worked in the defense complex. The collapse of the military industrial complex painfully struck these people and resulted in a drastic reduction of their standard of living. For the state, this signified a substantial reduction of hard currency earnings because, prior to 1991, for each ruble spent in defense production the country received $2 in arms sales on the world market (IZVESTIYA, No 137, 12 June 1992). The Russian Federation is sustaining large losses from the reduction of arms sales. There were at least two causes for the reduction. The first is associated with the lessening of the attention of state organs to military issues in 1990-1991. Some politicians turned out to be uncomfortable that the country was earning money on arms sales. Furthermore, the collapse in the administration of the state resulted in a collapse in this sphere. Some time passed before the government arrived at an understanding of the importance of the international arms market for Russia. By the middle of 1992, it became clear that the country would be able to obtain more hard currency through arms sales than through Western credits which our children and grandchildren will have to pay back. Right now in Russia the Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation is involved with the fundamental issues of arms sales. The six first directors of the main departments are members of the Commission: the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roskomoboronprom [Russian Committee on the Defense Industry], the Ministry of Economics, MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] and the Foreign Intelligence Service. A Russian Federation Supreme Soviet special deputies group carries out oversight functions. The second cause of the reduction of arms sales was the intensification of competition on the world arms market which crowded Russia out. Our competitors skillfully took advantage of the defeat of Iraq in the 1991 war. It was presented like this: Iraq had primarily Soviet-made arms which turned out to be uncompetitive with the arms of the Multi-National Forces, that is, Western arms defeated Soviet arms. Hence it followed that all purchasing countries need to acquire only Western arms. Unfortunately, the idea of the backwardness of Soviet weapons was energetically spread in our country and was used for attacks against the Soviet Armed Forces. What is the real state of affairs? Aircraft make up the main part of Russian arms exports. Air defense weapons are part of the second group, then come Ground Troops weapons (tanks, combat infantry vehicles, and artillery). The fourth group is naval weapons (IZVESTIYA, No 137, 12 June 1992). Right now it has become clear that many models of Russian aircraft do not lag behind Western aircraft but often surpass them. The MiG-29 fighter aircraft has been recognized as the best in its class in the world. In 1991, after a thorough examination by experts, the Bundeswehr accepted 24 MiG-29 aircraft into the inventory that had belonged to the GDR [German Democratic Republic] (IZVESTIYA, No 178, 27 July 1991). The S-300V Air Defense Missile System does not have any equivalents and, in the opinion of foreign experts, will exceed Western complexes until the end of the century. The BMP-3 combat infantry vehicle became the winner in comparative tests of similar vehicles. We can cite other cases but the superiority of our weapons is best discussed in the articles of the chief designers of weapons that are being presented to readers of VPK magazine. Recently, we can note substantial changes of the views of the country's leadership on arms sales. The doctrine that predominated in the USSR that we could only sell obsolete weapons promoted the discrediting of Soviet arms. Right now, many unnecessary procedural restrictions have been removed. The leadership finally realized that the arms that are in the troops should not be secret with the exception of certain technological issues. Therefore, the latest arms must go to market and yield the needed money, including for the development of even more improved weapons. However, arms sales are not only an effective source of hard currency receipts, they are also an effective foreign policy tool. Previously, the USSR sold many weapons at reduced prices. This primarily pertained to countries that were Warsaw Treaty allies. Arms were sold to a number of countries on credit and the loans were not always repaid and no-cost transfers were carried out to some countries. Right now arms sales to Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Yugoslavia and Ethiopia have been completely terminated. Russia is attempting to step up its involvement on the international arms market. In 1992, the "Mosaeroshow-92" International Exhibition, at which the latest aircraft and air defense systems were displayed, was conducted in our country for the first time. Approximately 200 CIS firms and 82 firms from the far abroad displayed products. At the last moment, the Americans refused to participate in demonstration flights in F-15, F-16, and F-18 aircraft. For the first time, Russia demonstrated that it is a great air power (IZVESTIYA, No 183, 13 August 1993). In 1993, Russia made a serious attempt to conquer new arms markets by actively participating in the "IDEX-93" Exhibition at Abu Dhabi. More than 550 firms from 34 countries displayed modern artillery systems and ammunition for them, close combat weapons, PVO [air defense] complexes, armored vehicles and aircraft, optical devices and navigation systems, various classes of missiles, shipborne weapons, and servicemen's full gear at this exhibition. The Russian exposition was quite impressive: more than 370 models of modern weapons were displayed, nearly half were displayed abroad for the first time and, many types of weapons -- in operation. Our country had never previously displayed such a vast arms exposition. The Russian delegation received prizes for best firing and the largest demonstration of modern military equipment. From missile weapons, Russia displayed the "Tochka-U" tactical complex which, although developed more than 10 years ago, is distinguished by its high tactical-technical specifications, first and foremost, for firing accuracy and mobility. The "Msta-S" 152-mm Self-Propelled Howitzer did not have any competitors. It is capable of firing 10 50-kg projectiles per minute. It can destroy a point target at a distance of 12 kilometers using the "Krasnopol" projectile with a laser-guided seeker. The howitzer does not have any equals in maneuverability and off-road capability. The comfort conditions developed for its crew also merit attention (IZVESTIYA, No 65, 8 April 1993). Tank weapons -- the T-80 tank and the BMP-3 combat infantry vehicle -- made a big impression at the exhibition at Abu Dhabi. The T-80 was named the "flying tank" for its high maneuvering capabilities. The BMP-3 is distinguished not only by its high off-road capability but by its high fire power (a 100-mm gun and a weapons guidance system have been installed on the vehicle). The T-80 and BMP-3 are distinguished by good habitability and they beat American, French and German vehicles in tests on the Arabian sands. The Russian air defense weapons that had already been displayed at the "Mosaeroshow-92" exhibition and at the "Oborona-92" exercises reaffirmed their high qualities. Models of the S-300 PMU, "Tor", "Strela-10M3", and "Igla" air defense missile complexes and also posters and mock-ups of other types of complexes were displayed at Abu Dhabi. The "Smerch" and "Uragan" multiple rocket systems and the "Shturm-S" and "Metis" antitank complexes demonstrated outstanding specifications. These complexes and small arms confirmed their high live firing effectiveness on the range. Of the naval weapons, the "Piranya" submarine and the APS 5.66-mm underwater assault rifle attracted interest. The significance which was attached to the exhibition was emphasized by the presence of the ministers of defense of France, Great Britain, Iran, Russia and Italy at its opening. Observers could see the leading countries' latest arms in action for the first time and compare their effectiveness. This was largely explained by the fact that the Arab countries have begun to modernize their armed forces based on the experience of the Persian Gulf War. During the last two years, they have spent approximately $40 billion on arms purchases. Naturally arms exporters counted on concluding major new contracts. What are the results in this sense for Russia? On the eve of the opening of the exhibition, we learned that the UAE [United Arab Emirates] had decided to purchase 390 Leclerc Tanks and tank escorts from the French State Corporation "GIAT Industries" for a total sum of more than $3 billion. This occurred despite the fact that the Russian T-80 tank showed itself to be better than the others. Critical analysis of the issue of purchasing French tanks lasted for several years. Naturally, a certain amount of time will be required to prepare and sign contract documents with potential customers under conditions of recently made decisions on the possibility of exporting the domestically-produced T-80 tank. Despite substantial expenditures on the organization of the exhibition at Abu Dhabi, the great success of Russian arms permits us to hope for their sales on the external market. Russia's participation was more modest at the 1993 Le Bourget Airshow, however, the Aviation Complex imeni Ilyushin managed to conclude a contract. The MiG Scientific-Production Complex reached an agreement on the sale of new trainer-transport aircraft with French Snecma engines. Moscow Airshow-93 was conducted from 31 August through 5 September. Foreign firms were involved in the preparations for this exhibition. So, one could say that Russia is learning arms sales under contemporary conditions. However, as Russian Presidential Advisor M.D. Maley says, the world arms market is a subtle thing, it is an elite market. Previously, an ideological demarcation shut us out of many arms purchasing countries and this largely suited our competitors which first and foremost is the United States. At the present time, the United States has announced the establishment of most favored nation trading status with Russia. However, the opening of U.S. markets for Russian missile, nuclear and space technologies does not cause ecstasy among American firms. The firms can obtain support in the U.S. Congress which has the right to unilaterally terminate this status or to introduce restrictions. Already right now 20 anti-dumping procedures are in force or are in the stage of adoption with regard to Russian goods. So, the United States has banned the import of our uranium until its price reaches $13 per pound (Russia has sold uranium for $9.50 per pound). A complex situation has emerged with Russia's attempt to sell MiG-29 fighter aircraft to Malaysia. Having learned about the negotiations that were being conducted with Russia, the U.S. embassy exerted pressure on McDonnell-Douglas and General Dynamics which reduced the prices for F-16 and F-18 aircraft by approximately 40%. It has turned out that the Americans are getting in the Russians way. However, considering the high tactical-technical specifications of MiG-29 fighter aircraft, the Government of Malaysia announced its decision to purchase 18 aircraft from Russia and eight American F-18 fighter aircraft. This is a serious success on the arms market and for the first time Russia will enter a market with its arms that was previously closed to it (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, No 35, 1993). Up to now, the Americans are seeking to cancel the $400 million contract on Russia's delivery of cryogenic missile engines to India. The United States asserts that these engines can be utilized for the Indian "Agni" Ballistic Missile and sales of missile technologies are banned by international agreements. The Americans have agreed to compensate Russia for losses, however, they are demanding that the contract with India be canceled first. The absence of an agreement on this issue was one of the causes of the cancellation of the Russian Federation Prime Minister's visit to the United States in June 1993. Russia's refusal to carry out the U.S.'s demand on the extension of the monitoring regime for the utilization of missile technologies to Russia's mutual relations with the other CIS countries was another cause. We cannot agree to that demand because the Russian Federation space industry is closely tied to Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The United States is also utilizing the European Community (EC) and COCOM in the competitive struggle. Although COCOM should allegedly cease to exist, for now it continues to impede Russia's penetration into the international arms market. So, for example, this organization bans the purchase from Russia of ecologically clean fuel for space system missile engines. Therefore, 200 tonnes of hydrogen chloride are released into the atmosphere during each launch in the United States that cause a great deal of ecological damage (IZVESTIYA, No 17, 29 January 1993). The EC, treating Russia as a country with a state trade system, is establishing reduced quotas for Russian goods. In order to have success in a fierce competitive struggle, we need not only to have good quality weapons but we also need to know how to sell. Right now, reliable partners, who are not restricted only to sales but who can provide maintenance to the weapons sold, are highly valued on the arms market. According to American experts, today Russia has those capabilities but is incapable of competing with American high technology weapons. Therefore, they think that Russia can successfully sell lower quality weapons on the market by offering MiG-29 aircraft, air defense missiles, and small arms there (SEGODNYA, No 17, 18 May 1993). Russia needs to resolve a number of organizational issues to carry out successful arms sales. The Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry has specifically proposed a new concept for Russia's military-technical cooperation with other countries. The concept provides the capability to the arms manufacturer itself to seek customers in countries with which military-technical cooperation has not been prohibited. It can also demonstrate its "goods" to the customer and tell the customer the tactical-technical specifications that are authorized for arms exports and a preliminary price. They propose stimulating commercial arms deliveries through the use of state credits, beneficial taxation, and exemption from payment of export duties. For example, in the United States, the government extends credit for up to 50% of these deliveries. Furthermore, Committee Head V. Glukhikh thinks that it is necessary to privatize the overwhelming number of defense enterprises. Enterprises and organizations, that have key technologies at their disposal for the development of arms and military equipment without which it is impossible for Russia to maintain its defense capability, need to be retained as state property (SEGODNYA, No 26, 1993). A number of market structures are being created in the Russian military industrial complex system. The semi-governmental organization Biznestsentr [Business Center] has been organized which is carrying out the selection of foreign partners. The second structure -- is the Financial Company, within which the Military-Industrial Bank is being formed with high charter capital. Furthermore, the Russian Military-Industrial Insurance Company and the Information Association are being founded. At the same time, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations' specialized foreign economic organizations, while implementing the concept for reorganizing their own structures that was approved in April 1993 by the Russian Federation Interdepartmental Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation with Foreign Countries (KVTS), began to intensively work on ensuring more active participation of the main Russian arms developers and manufacturers in foreign economic activity. These specialized foreign economic organizations conclude the absolute majority of the actual deals for arms and military equipment deliveries to foreign countries and render technical assistance in the organization of their production and operation. So, the multi-discipline Consultative-Oversight Council was formed under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the working sections of which are specialized along the KVTS' primary functional directions and have adequately broad powers both for the formation of export programs of subdepartmental foreign economic associations ("Oboroneksport", "Spetsvneshtekhnika", and GUSK [not found]) and also for monitoring, strategy, tactics and coordination of the practical work of Russian subjects of military-technical cooperation in foreign arms markets. In the future, vertically integrated financial-industrial groups could be formed that are combined based upon on the common economic interests of the leading exporters, developers and manufacturers of domestically-produced weapons and also bank, insurance and other structures that are comprehensively oriented on stimulating the export of military machine-technical products and special technologies. The future will tell how all of these organizational measures affect the success of the Russian military industrial complex on the international market. In conclusion, let's point out several other problems that are associated with arms sales. One of them is the clearance sale of arms of the USSR Armed Forces that have remained on the territory of the states of the near abroad. So, arms sales from auctions have been stepped up in Kharkov. There the director of the Ukraine-Siberia Goods Exchange, that previously sold petroleum and grain, now sells arms at reduced prices. In the exchange's competitive pricing, Su-27 fighter aircraft are worth $32 million, Su-25's -- $11.9 million, MiG-27's -- $16 million and, diesel submarines -- from $13 to $150 million. Such "wild" sales of Soviet arms not only damage Russia's interests but also introduce a definite imbalance in the world market. The origin of the arms that are appearing on the "wild" market and to whom they are being sold remains unclear. Western diplomats are also concerned about the shady deals in the Central Asian republics of the former USSR. Scotland Yard thinks that in five years the main threat to the cities of Great Britain will emanate from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. Scotland Yard is certain that the influx of arms from there is destabilizing the situation in the country. The appearance of new sellers on the world market is another problem. India, which traditionally purchased armored vehicles and missiles in the USSR, has now developed its own "Arjun" Tank, the "Prithvi" Ballistic Missile with an operating range of 50 km, and the "Akash" Air Defense Missile Complex. India displayed its military products at Abu Dhabi and it already plans to offer the "Arjun" Tank for sale at the international armored vehicle exhibition in Canada in 1994. The international community is concerned about new trends on the arms market. The UN General Assembly Resolution on the creation of the Conventional Arms Register went into force on 1 May 1993. All arms exporters and importers must submit official data to the UN on arms sales and purchases with an indication of the total amount of arms bought or sold. The UN thinks that the absence of such a Register permitted the Husayn Regime to purchase arms throughout the world and to create the fourth most powerful army in the world. By 11 May, 47 countries had submitted data to the UN. Among them were the United States, England, France, Germany, Italy, Brazil, China, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Greece. Cuba acceded to the Register, having announced that it neither bought nor sold any heavy weapons whatsoever in 1992. Russia submitted that information in the middle of the summer of 1993. All of this is occurring in the background of the overall reduction of the amounts of sales on the arms market. According to the assessment of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the largest arms sales on the world market occurred in 1987 when $46 billion worth of deals were concluded and this amount was reduced to $22 billion in 1991 which is by more than half. The table indicates the dynamics of the decline on the world arms market in 1987-1991. This trend was maintained in 1992: the volume of deals was reduced by another nearly one fourth and totaled 18.4 billion rubles. In 1992, the leading countries' shares were: the United States -- 46%, the countries of the European Community (primarily Germany, France, and Great Britain) -- 26% and, Russia -- 11%. According to Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics] data, Russia exported a total of only $546.1 million worth of arms in January-May 1993, at that, only $36.2 million worth to industrially developed countries. The Volume of Arms Sales of the Largest Arms Producing Countries, in Billions of Dollars (in 1990 Prices)/% of the Total Volume Country 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 USSR 17.7/38.8 15.1/38.5 14.9/39.1 9.7/33.5 3.9/17.7 United 13.7/30.0 11.9/33.0 12.0/31.2 11.2/38.6 11.2/50.8 States France 3.2/7.0 2.4/6.1 2.9/8.0 1.9/6.5 0.8/3.6 Great 2.2/4.8 1.7/4.3 2.7/7.1 1.6/5.5 1.0/4.5 Britain China 2.9/6.3 1.9/4.8 0.9/2.4 0.9/3.1 1.1/5.1 FRG 0.8/1.7 1.3/3.3 0.8/2.1 1.2/4.2 2.0/9.1 [Federal Republic of Germany] Total 45.8/100 39.3/100 38.2/100 29.0/100 22.1/100 We need to note that you can encounter somewhat different figures than those cited in the table. So, the 7 August 1993 issue of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS cites the following volumes of export deliveries of arms and military equipment: in 1987, the United States -- $16.8 billion, Russia --$17.8 billion, in 1991 -- $13.3 and $6.0 billion and, in 1992 $33 and $1.9 billion, respectively. In the process, it does not state if the data is cited in prices of one year. Without becoming involved in an analysis of which figures are more correct, it is important to note that the dynamics are preserved in both cases. The reduction of the arms market is resulting in a reduction of arms production in the exporting countries. The Pentagon is reducing arms purchases, is rejecting a number of developments, and is terminating the SDI Program. Financing of defense enterprises has been drastically reduced in Russia. The reduction of defense production is occurring in all of the developed countries. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute data, total military expenditures of all of the world's states were reduced by 15% in 1992, in contrast to 1991. In the next five years, we anticipate a reduction of the number of defense enterprise workers by approximately one fourth. Russia may find itself in an especially difficult situation where the number of workers and employees at military enterprises totals 71% of all personnel of the USSR arms sector (17.5% in Ukraine, 3.2% in Belarus, and 1.7% in Kazakhstan) (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, 23, 1993). Considering that conversion in Russia is proceeding slowly and with problems, defense enterprises are experiencing enormous difficulties that are also affecting the general state of the country. All of these factors will result in even greater intensification of competition on the international arms market. Russia must take into account that, on the one hand, it can only access this market with high quality modern weapons and, on the other hand, cadres and skill are needed to achieve success under conditions of the fierce competition under which the most varied methods and techniques are utilized. We must understand that the United States, being the largest seller on the international arms market, will impede the expansion of Russia's positions in this market. Right now, many defense enterprises in Russia are tying their future with successes on the world arms market. Considering their significance in total industrial production, we can arrive at the conclusion that the successful resolution of the arms sales task plays a large role for Russia's future.
