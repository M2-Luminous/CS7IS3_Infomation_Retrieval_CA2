But if we leave the matter to bureaucrats, there is no question they will drag their feet. Political leadership on it is now being asked. All ministers must make all the efforts possible to have deregulation achieved even if it means risking their political career." He made this remark in comment on the public discontent about deregulation that it is making hardly any progress in the face of bureaucratic resistance. Degulation makes up a major part of the package of measures for opening up Japan's market as the demand of the United States and other nations. The government wants to work out plans for it by the end of June, and Kumagai's comment is intended to assert government's determination to strongly push for deregulation under political leadership. Before this news conference, Kumagai had met with Koshiro Ishida, head of the Management and Coordination Agency, and agreed to call an informal meeting of ministers concerned to discuss the deregulation question soon. Ishida proposed the meeting, saying: "Deregulation is a key point in economic reform. Let us infuse more enthusiasim into the ministers to get this done by all means."
