Speaking here after meeting UN special envoy on ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, Churkin said: "The two very firm assurances I think I got from them (the Bosnian Serbs) is that it is not their intention to take the town. It is not their intention to shell the town." Serb forces were Saturday consolidating their position around the eastern town, which now shelters around 70,000 people, after capturing the last strategic positions in the area Friday.
