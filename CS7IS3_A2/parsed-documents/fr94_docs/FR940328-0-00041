FR940328-0-00041 FR940328-0-00012 Critical habitat is not being proposed for the 11 plant taxa included in this final rule, for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of this rule. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these 11 plant taxa. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,'' the species face numerous anthropogenic threats. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the Federal Register , as required in a proposal for critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to their decline. The listing of these species as endangered publicizes the rarity of the plants and, thus, can make these plants attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified of the location and importance of protecting the habitat of these species. Protection of the habitat of the species will be addressed through the recovery process and through the Section 7 consultation process. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these species is not prudent at this time, because such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities.
