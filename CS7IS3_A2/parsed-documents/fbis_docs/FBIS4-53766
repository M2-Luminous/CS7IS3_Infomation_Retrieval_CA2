Commenting on the decision of Philippine President Fidel Ramos on the conference, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said in a press statement in Jakarta today that he is awaiting a formal report from the Indonesian Embassy in Manila on the matter. He said the conference engineered by Ramos Horta [leader of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor or Fretilin] will in fact not be an academic seminar on human rights but will clearly be part of Ramos Horta's political campaign to discredit the Indonesian Government. Accordingly, Alatas hoped the Philippine Government will cancel the planned conference as well, because this will reflect the common views of the two countries on the matter.
