He said the current inflation rate is 4.8 percent, a level considered not too high and is only a point-in-time measurement and not the annual average figure. He noted that inflation has been caused by agricultural commodities prices, which have risen by 5.8 percent, while the prices of non-agricultural commodities have risen by only 3.8 percent. Savings in the first quarter of 1994 expanded 15.9 percent while credit expanded 22.8 percent. Commercial banks have raised interest rates to entice savings. The country's saving rate is estimated to lag investment by 6 percent, said Mr Wichit. The governor maintained that the widening gap between savings and credit extension, and the higher inflation rate, are not alarming. [passage omitted on comments by commercial bank officials] Meanwhile, huge capital inflows through the Bangkok International Banking Facility of 110.58 billion baht in the first quarter helped Thailand avert a capital shortfall. The inflow through this channel in the first quarter last year amounted to only 15.5 billion baht, Mr Wichit said . Capital inflows in other channels suffered declines: direct investment dropped two billion baht investment in securities dropped 8.3 billion baht and non-resident deposits dropped 16.8 billion baht. Total capital inflow to the private sector in the first quarter amounted to 76.58 billion baht, lower than the 82.34 billion baht in the same quarter last year, according to Mr Wichit. He also noted that net capital inflow to the private sector in 1994 would be around US$10 billion, compared with the US$13 billion in 1993. The shortfall was primarily caused by recent changes in US interest rates.
