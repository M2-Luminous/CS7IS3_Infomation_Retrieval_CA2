The recent visits of Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, to Britain, France, and Italy, with their successful talks with high-level government officials of these countries, and especially his subsequent talk with U.S. President Bill Clinton, have contributed to this. It is worth mentioning here the first steps toward solving the question of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croat-Serb conflict in Croatia, as well as the forecasts by various international mediators that the problem of Kosova will soon be put on the agenda within the framework of solving the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. We Will Not Be Forgiven Recklessness Besides the schedule forecast for solving the crisis in the area of the former Yugoslavia, there have also been statements by various diplomats that the problem of Kosova "must be solved by extensive political autonomy," or that "The autonomy of 1974 must be restored," and that "Serbia's jurisdiction over Kosova is not contested." There have also been statements by different parliamentarians, congressmen, senators, and publicists, who emphasize that "The crisis in the former Yugoslavia cannot be solved if the independent status of Kosova is not accepted. Only an independent and sovereign Kosova is a guarantee of peace and security in this area and even in the entire region." Nevertheless, the first kinds of statement rather than the second make a greater impression in the media darkness of Kosova, in those two or three weeklies and the single daily that are rarely sure of appearing on their appointed days. This is understandable, if for no other reason than the fact that we are sensitive to being offered solutions to the Kosova problem with a "sort of autonomy," when it is well known that the population of Kosova long ago clearly declared their political will for an independent and sovereign Kosova. However, what does not seem reasonable to us are the contrived explanations of the different kinds of autonomy and the many speculations over whether Serbia will be ready to agree to them or not. It seems that they prompted the leader of one recently formed party to announce that "Any solution that averts a conflict must be accepted!" When we consider all these extrapolations devised in cafe corners and especially in the commentaries of the Belgrade press, we realize that these matters call for great care, especially on the part of those who speak on behalf of the parties they belong to, but also those who in one way or another appear on the political stage and create public opinion in Kosova and beyond. In the final analysis, now is least of all a time to forgive mistakes and political recklessness. We must also learn from our turbulent, splendid, and tragic history, when we lost the fruits of liberation struggles on the negotiating tables in London or Paris, and especially in Belgrade and at Brioni. Autonomy Is Not a Solution It follows that it is not out of place, whenever recipes for a Kosova solution involving some kind of autonomy are offered, to demonstrate with facts and evidence to those responsible for such recipes that the problem of Kosova and its Albanians cannot be solved in this way. On the contrary, such a status merely legalizes their further slavery. The Albanians in Kosova have now tried every kind of autonomy, in the time of the Ottoman Empire, and under Yugoslavia and Serbia. It is enough to mention the four kinds of autonomy that Kosova and the Albanians have experienced as part of Serbia and Yugoslavia in the last 50 years. As is well known, the autonomy of 1945, which was produced to suit the police and military regime of the Serbian and Yugoslav UdBA [State Security Administration], turned Kosova into a large concentration camp for the majority of Albanians, who for four years on end had fought alongside the allies against fascism, with the aim of exercising the right to self-determination and deciding their own destiny. However, the right of self-determination was not achieved, and the Serbian regime shot thousands of Albanians as "counterrevolutionaries, Balists, and anti-Yugoslavs," and maltreated, imprisoned, and interned hundreds and thousands of others in all the Yugoslav prisons. They were accused of being kulaks for failing to hand in their grain and meat surpluses (when their children were dying of hunger), for not paying the state levy ("zajm") [Serbo-Croatian word used], or for not unveiling their women, while the acme of violence was reached in the infamous weapons-collection campaign. The archives of the Yugoslav UdBA itself, as published after the Brioni plenum [1966], reveal that during this campaign alone more than 30,000 Albanians in Kosovo were beaten and bestially maltreated, almost 100 were murdered, and hundreds and thousands of others were turned into life-long invalids. Thus, in the first phase of autonomy, Kosova and the Albanians were allotted the status of slaves, which directly paved the way for their forced emigration to the steppes of Anatolia. The second phase of Kosova's autonomy did not prevent this unprecedented exodus. On the contrary, all possible means of state violence encouraged it, until about 250,000 Albanians from Kosova had emigrated to Turkey by 1966. At this time, as is well known, the Rankovic [interior minister in the 1950s and 1960s] line lost the battle for power and domination in the hierarchy of the Yugoslav rulers. The Titoite line claimed to be against the "strong hand" of Yugoslav unitarism and embarked on a kind of reform and decentralization of power. In the course of this reform, Kosova and Vojvodina won a new status of political autonomy, being accepted as constitutive elements and federal units, albeit within the composition of Serbia. This was the autonomy of 1974, under which Kosova and the Albanians indeed achieved important turning points in their educational, cultural, and economic development. However, even with this constitution, the Albanians did not achieve their historic goal of the right to self-determination, or even equality with the other peoples in the Yugoslav federation, although they were numerically the third-largest people in the former Yugoslavia. The fact that Serbia suspended this very same constitution while the federal Yugoslav state was still operating and did so without any opposition from the other federal units best shows what kind of basis it was for "the security and equality of Kosova and the Albanians." Half-Baked Solutions -- Open Conflict In fact, it was precisely under the 1974 Constitution that the Albanians' disgust and discontent expressed in the spring of 1981 were branded as counterrevolutionary, with the most serious labels and epithets being attached to the Albanians. By 1987, the police had maltreated about 650,000 Albanians or one Albanian in three in Kosova, besides imprisoning hundreds and thousands of others. By 1990, about 150 Albanians, mainly young people and including even children, had been killed. The Serbian regime has continued its violence against the Albanians under the autonomy guaranteed to "Kosovo-Methohija" four years ago. Under it, 12,000 Albanians have now been dismissed from their work; all the secondary schools and colleges; and even some elementary schools have been closed to Albanians; all the Albanian-language media, including Prishtina Radio-Television and the sole Albanian-language daily RILINDJA, and all the cultural and academic institutions have been closed, including most recently the Kosova Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Albanological Institute. By the same logic, and on the basis of the autonomy of "Kosova-Metohija," hundreds and thousands of Albanians are daily beaten, plundered, and maltreated, and hundreds are detained in prisons, while the "blessings" of the last four years have forced 300,000 Albanians to emigrate from Kosova and to seek their salvation in various European countries. Because of all this bitter experience with autonomy within Serbia and Yugoslavia, the possibility that they might remain under the jurisdiction of Serbia with "some kind of extensive political autonomy" makes the Albanians' flesh creep. It is precisely for this reason that all the legitimate institutions of Kosova and virtually all the Albanian political parties rightly refuse all bargaining involving such solutions for Kosova. In the final analysis, they are also bound by the political will of the population of Kosova expressed in the referendum of September 1991 and the multiparty and presidential elections of May 1992. The Albanians' restrained behavior so far and their declaration that the question of Kosova must be solved in a democratic way, through dialogue and peaceful means, are also strong arguments for the Albanian side not to accept any half-baked solutions, but only the settlement that the political will of the people demands -- a sovereign and independent Kosova. Any other solution leaves open the door for a conflict even greater than that seen so far, something the Albanians have never wanted.
