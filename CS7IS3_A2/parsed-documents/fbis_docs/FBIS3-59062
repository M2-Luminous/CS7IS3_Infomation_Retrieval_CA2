In 1992, the EC posted a record 14 million registrations of new automobiles and light goods vehicles; the corresponding figures for the United States and Japan were 10 million and 5 million. West Europe is still the largest automobile market in the world. In 1993, however, demand decreased by 16 percent and by as much as 20 percent in Germany. German automakers sales and output have declined accordingly. "In the best event, a stabilization of the situation is conceivable in 1994, but it seems more likely that there will be a slight decline in sales." All the mistakes that were made in company policy in the 1980's have now appeared and all the omissions of the boom period must now be dealt with at "top speed." The necessary reorganization of the automobile industry is, however, encountering obstacles due to excessive production capacity. Excessive hopes regarding a growing market and greater market shares led to the construction of more and more plants. It is estimated that at the present time, at least 15 million automobiles can be built in Europe, but only 11.5 million were manufactured in 1993. Thus, plants are only operating at 75 percent of capacity. Operating at that level of capacity, most enterprises can no longer function profitably. Zwickel: "If this problem of overcapacity is not solved, the European autmobile industry will enter a merciless and hopeless price war," the kind of situation that could recently be observed in the Japanese automobile market. European manufacturers are already trying to outdo each other with price reductions, both directly and through maintaining prices at their present level, but offering better extras. If production capacity continues to grow, from FIAT in southern Italy to Toyota in northern England, programs aimed at reducing costs and the temporary closure of plants will not help at all. In this kind of situation, economic policy in combination with industry will have to end this hopeless situation. Zwickel has called for a round of negotiations involving the government, the automobile industry, and IG Metall to at least find a clear definition of the problems. In addition, a gradual organizational reform of company structures will be necessary, one that will entail "employment policy safeguards," an accelerated approach to product innovation, stronger links between manufacturers and their suppliers in the form of partnership, support for research and cooperation in research, as well as safeguards at the regional policy level for crisis situations.
