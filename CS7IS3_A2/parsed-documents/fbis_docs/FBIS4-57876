Caldera stated that an abnormal situation prevails in the country but added that his government will win the confidence battle. Caldera emphasized the fact that there are currently two crises. One is the institutional crisis resulting from the trials of former Presidents Jaime Lusinchi and Carlos Andres Perez and the transitional government led by Jose Ramon Velasquez, which gave public employees a salary increase without enough available funds. The other is the economic crisis resulting from the intervention involving Banco Latino.
