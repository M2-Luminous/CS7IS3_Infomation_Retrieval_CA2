"We have agreed on the separation of forces as much as possible, maximum restraint from actions and provocations and, finally, the maximum effort in the humanitarian sphere," said Karadzic after talks with Akashi in Pale, the political and military centre of the Bosnian Serb republic. He said U.N. helicopters would evacuate the wounded from Gorazde on Monday morning and added: "If we succeed in implementing the ceasefire and the separation of forces, we can say we are approaching peace in Gorazde." Fighting in the Gorazde area escalated in late March, when about 10,000 Moslems from Gorazde -- a U.N.-designated "safe haven" which should have been demilitarized last spring -- mounted a powerful offensive on the surrounding Serb territories. The Serbs responded by launching a counteroffensive. When the Moslems were all but defeated, the U.N. stepped in and ordered NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde, after which the Serbs suspended all relations with the U.N. Protection Force.
