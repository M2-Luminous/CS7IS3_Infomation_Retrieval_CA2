Nor will it continue to consider itself bound by its obligations to the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA]. In a statement to a SANA correspondent, the ambassador said this follows the distortion by the United States and the IAEA of the results of the recent inspection of its nuclear facilities. This was used as a pretext to pressure the DPRK. He said his government took this measure based on the principles contained in the Korean-U.S. agreement reached in New York on 25 February 1994 which stipulate a simultaneous move on both sides to secure the full implementation of this agreement. He said it is his government's firm and continuous position not to abide by its pledges to the United States as long as the latter is breaking its pledges. The Korean ambassador noted that the United States resorted to distorting and fabricating the issue dealing with the IAEA's inspection. It used it as an excuse to resume joint military maneuvers with South Korea and to threaten the use of force to exert pressure against the Korean Government. Moreover, it reveals a U.S. intention to have the UN Security Council impose sanctions on his country. He said the United States should make an accurate and responsible assessment of the current situation. The ambassador expressed his deep appreciation of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for supporting his government's just and reasonable stand toward the nuclear issue.
