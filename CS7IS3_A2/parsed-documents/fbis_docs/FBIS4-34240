Addressing the plenum at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, the Cuban president broached a sensitive point when he called on the United States to enact a law that would automatically legalize the status of Latin American and Caribbean peoples who have entered the northern country, as it is doing with Cuban citizens today. The double standard in the U.S. policy regarding immigrants of the hemisphere can be seen most notably in the last three and a half decades, as Washington has given special treatment to Cubans who reach that country while it has repressed the citizens of other nationalities. As a result of the Cuban Readjustment Act, enacted in the United States in 1966, any Cuban, regardless of motive or means of transportation, may be granted political refugee status merely by reaching U.S. territory and remaining there for a year. The laws favoring Cuban immigration and the slowness in granting permanent residence through legal means have encouraged illegal departures from Cuban territory. The exceptional, privileged treatment the United States grants to Cuban immigration is contingent upon a political premise that is not given to citizens of other regional countries. There are instances in which fragile boats full of Cubans and Haitians have reached the coast of the Florida peninsula: Cubans searching for better economic opportunities and Haitians escaping military repression. The U.S. authorities returned the Haitians, but the Cubans received every possible assistance and were quickly able to legalize their status and subsequently turned over to their relatives. More than 7 million immigrants entered the United States between 1981 to 1990, according to official figures, but Cuba ranks 16th among the countries that contribute the most immigrants. There is no other reason, other than political, to treat Cubans with privilege to the detriment of the remaining Latin American and Caribbean immigrants, especially Mexicans. No wonder the Cuban president just stated the following in Cartagena de Indias: At a time when the Berlin Wall no longer exists, the wall being built at the Mexican-U.S. border should be torn down.
