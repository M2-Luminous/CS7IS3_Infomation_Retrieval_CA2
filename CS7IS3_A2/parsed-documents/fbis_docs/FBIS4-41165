This was announced by Andrey Kozyrev and Warren Christopher, the heads of the foreign policy departments of the two countries at a news conference in the Russian Embassy in Brussels after the talks, which were held here. This joint initiative was discussed on the instructions of the presidents of Russia and the United States, Kozyrev said. As a result: There has occurred a drawing-together and coincidence of approaches on all the fundamental questions, and only the drafting work remains for the representatives of the two countries in New York. The main aim of this initiative, in the words of the Russian minister, is to get the DPRK to observe the regime of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The draft resolution will clearly indicate that sanctions against Pyongyang are inevitable in about 30 days if the DPRK does not take positive steps. To help it take such steps and open the doors to positive movement, Kozyrev said, it is proposed to use the opportunity of the conference and already in the very near future, send the relevant invitations. In this way, these 30 days should be used, including by means of convening the conference, in order to avoid sanctions which, of course, are an extreme means.
