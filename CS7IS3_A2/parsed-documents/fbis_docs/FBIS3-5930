[Azuma] The recent parliamentary elections were the first of their kind carried out in a democratic fashion for a newborn Russia, and I understand that this was an important milestone for Russia to become a true democracy. With this realization, and to support Russia's democratization, Japan decided to send monitoring teams there. To put it concretely, President Boris Yeltsin, when he visited Japan last October, personally requested that a monitoring team be dispatched, and Prime Minister Hosokawa expressed a willingness to actively cooperate on the matter. Thus, it was decided that Japan would send a government monitoring team, and I was appointed an ambassador extraordinary to head the team. Members of the team included the Home Affairs Ministry, local public and private organizations, as well as the central government and an advisory team of Diet members. My team monitored Moscow, and another detachment was sent to Khabarovsk. In addition to sending monitoring teams, Japan provided supplementary assistance by making grants of communications equipment and the like. [GAIKO FORUM] I consider the Russians to be a proud people, but despite this they asked for monitoring teams to be sent. How do you interpret this request? Did they intend to improve Russia's image, or did this reflect an apprehension about the election behavior of the Russian people? [Azuma] They might have considered that order would be maintained by having international election monitoring teams. The important things, however, were to let the world as well as their own people know that the recent elections were conducted in a free and fair atmosphere and that the international election monitoring teams served their purpose in very effective way. Elections in a Peaceful, Harmonious Atmosphere [GAIKO FORUM] Compared to Japan's elections, what impression did you get of Russia's election campaigns and the response of its voters? [Azuma] Because it was Russia's first democratic election and because the campaigning period was short, they were entirely different from Japan's. Unlike in Japan, there were no campaign loudspeaker vehicles on the streets. Door-to-door campaigns were permitted, but little such campaigning was done because the campaigning period was so short. Few wayside speeches were noticed. We saw only Mr. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of the Liberal Democratic Party doing this. In the election campaigns, television played an especially vital role, in my opinion. In Japanese polling stations, we find a solemn atmosphere, in the sense that secret balloting has to be guaranteed, but it was peaceful and harmonious in Russia. Husbands and wives were seen entering the same voting booth together, or voters were seen filling out ballots while talking with other voters without bothering to enter the booths. If you witnessed only such scenes, you would conclude that secret voting was not attained, but they insisted that they were discussing only how to fill out the ballots. Certainly, it did not come to our attention, within the scope of our monitoring, that somebody induced others to vote for specific candidates or parties. To strictly safeguard secret balloting, however, it might be necessary to increase the number of voting booths so that filling out ballots in booths can be thoroughly enforced. Although it was not actually observed to have happened, there were problems of preventing one voter from voting many times. According to the system, anybody who was not in their voting district on election day because they were on official trips could cast their ballots where they presented themselves by only showing their passports or identification cards. So, logically, it was possible for a voter to vote multiple times by going to other voting districts and showing their identification cards. To eliminate such a danger of multiple voting, I think that the current absentee ballot system must be amended. Somewhere in Africa, they put a mark which is indelible for a certain length of time on the voter's hand, to make the absentee voting system foolproof. That sort of method might become necessary. Also, there was room for improvement in the system of placing inspectors. Whether People Can Follow Reforms or Not [GAIKO FORUM] The outcome of the elections shocked the world with the emergence of such an extreme nationalist as Mr. Zhirinovskiy. What is your thought on this? [Azuma] Although the elections were conducted smoothly, they did not turn out as the reformist camp anticipated. [GAIKO FORUM] Was it that the people were perplexed by the abrupt reforms? [Azuma] As for the trend in the direction of democratization and a market economy, the multitude of the Russian people are presumed to understand this. A lady who came to vote said, "I cannot see what they are actually going to offer to better our lives, although they keep bragging about reforms." This kind of discontent drifted toward the ultrarightists, I suppose. I heard many people say that they did not bother to vote because the reformers were absolutely destined for victory. [GAIKO FORUM] China is, in a manner different from that of Russia, proceeding with an open economic system while maintaining its dictatorial system. On the contrary, Russia gave priority to political reform before economic reform. However, the market economy is not functioning well, and crime seems to be on the increase. What do you think about these things? [Azuma] If measures had been taken to permit the people to understand the contents of the reforms while carrying out radical changes, confusion and discontent could have been mitigated. It could well be an issue of the end of the 20th century that rationality and human pride are lost because greed overcomes them, while human nature is neglected by pursuing rationality. Now the wisdom is needed to harmonize them. In the case of China, it is proceeding with gradualism, and it is thought that if the test cases along the coastal areas prove to be successful, they may be applied to the nation as a whole. In Russia, there are, in a sense, many people with a West European way of thinking. So, it can be rationally proposed that there is a concept first and that it is followed by methods to achieve the objectives based on that concept. But the question is whether the people can follow it, whether to proceed after the people are fully informed about it, and whether to proceed with their full consent or rather with the full authority entrusted to the elites. I believe that social confusion was brought about by the people who want to take part in a good idea without their having come to grips with that idea. Future Japanese-Russian Relations in a Turbulent World Community [GAIKO FORUM] What should the future assistance to Russia from Japan and the West be like? [Azuma] Russia is going ahead with democratization and economic reforms, and it wants assistance from the international community because it cannot help itself. A new parliament came into being as a result of the recent elections. Within it are unexpected political parties embracing factors of instability concerning the course of reforms, in a sense. But, as a general direction of the course being followed, President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are steadfastly continuing in the direction of reforms. At this stage, it should not be considered that the basis for assistance has ended. If Russia is thrown into confusion as the result of a lack of assistance, it will pose an unstable factor for the whole world, as well as the Russian region. A Russia which evolves into a democracy and which follows the way to economic reforms is directly connected with the stability and prosperity of the world. And that is the precondition for assistance. [GAIKO FORUM] A sense of menace from Russia/the Soviet Union remains in the heart of Japanese. Now that the Soviet Union is gone, what do you see as the future of Japanese-Russian relations? [Azuma] Military power was an important nucleus of the post-World War II Cold War structure. But, after that structure has collapsed, it should not be attempted to maintain that order by possessing military power. The key to becoming a great power rests on economic power, and I think that understanding between the leaders who guide the economy and the people is what is being sought after the collapse of the Cold War structure. It may take a considerable amount of time before that becomes tangible. An extremely important factor in pursuing the post-Cold War new international order is to deepen Japanese-Russian relations in a broad sense rather than the up-to-the-present Japanese-Russian relations in a narrow sense. In the case of Japan, the collapse of the 1955 order was a domestic affair, without the international trend having been part of the recipe. Meantime, what is happening in the world is the decisionmaking of a nation which directly feels the turbulence of the international community and which is compelled to respond to the changes in the world. If not viewed from such a perspective, the movement of Russia will become incomprehensible. I do not deny the importance of Japan's dealing with what it should do concerning Japanese-Russian relations, but I think we have come to the point where Japanese-Russian relations must be considered once again in the post-Cold War framework in which these relations are managed with the turbulence of the international community being kept in mind. However, nobody seems to have the answer yet, I think. [GAIKO FORUM] Quite a bit of assistance is being provided to Siberia by nongovernmental organizations, and in that sense the recent sending of election-monitoring teams can be categorized as one such step for Russia. [Azuma] That is right. [GAIKO FORUM] After your return, what is your main point in discussing your experiences there? [Azuma] Russia's election system is a single-member constituency within the proportional-representation system. Two hundred and twenty-five members each are elected by both systems to fill the 450-seat parliament. If the reformist camps do not cooperate between themselves and wage independent election campaigns, they will suffer defeats in unexpected areas. I said this to the prime minister, and he said that it is quite enlightening. (laughter) [GAIKO FORUM] Japan is not only teaching but also has something to learn. [Azuma] I have not quite comprehended why Russia chose such a system. However, Japan is going to adopt the same type because of the recent passage of the political reform bills. It gives quite a hint. [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.
