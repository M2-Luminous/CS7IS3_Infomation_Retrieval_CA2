Vice-chairman of the committee Taha Ahmad al-Dawud was quoted by a local daily as saying that the plan aims at urging the world politicians and parliamentarians, and those of Britain and the U.S. in particular to work for lifting the anti-Iraq sanctions and holding the U.S. and Britain responsible for the death of tens of thousands of Iraqis and the destruction of Iraq's infrastructure. The plan, moreover, will make it clear that the continuation of the economic blockade runs counter to human rights and Washington's and London's claims and boasts of being the ardent advocates of human rights, said Mr. al-Dawud. He went on to say that invitation will be sent to a number of world MPs to visit Iraq for dialoge and to get acquainted with the negative consequences of the U.S.-allied aggression and the continuation of the UN-imposed economic sanctions. The committee's plan also aims at urging the world MPs to exercise pressure on their governments towards lifting the embargo. Moreover, the National Assembly, through its Arab and International Relations Committee will work for holding talks with MPs of the Security Council member-states in addition to exchanging letters with heads of the world parliaments on their stands and Iraq's stand vis-a-vis UN Security Council resolutions and allegations and claims aired by iraq's enemies to divert the world's attention from the recent positive development in the stands of a number of the UN Security Council member-states and in a bid to manipulate the world public opinion, Mr. al-Dawud concluded.
