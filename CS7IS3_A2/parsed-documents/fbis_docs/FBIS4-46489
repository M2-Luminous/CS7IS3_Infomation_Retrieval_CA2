This week the State Duma -- if it does not again, for some reason, have to change the agenda -- is to complete discussion of the draft Law "On the Federal Budget for 1994." As readers will be aware, military expenditure has been the focus of discussion. The government draft law specifies a figure of 37 trillion for it. Precisely this number of rubles [R] is, in the opinion of the drafters of the law, quite sufficient to cover actual defense expenditure. The Defense Ministry regards R55 trillion as the minimum sum. Since the State Duma passed the first reading of the government version 11 May, the Russian president, the head of the Russian Government, and the Federation Council have come out in favor of allocating the missing R18 trillion. A number of parliamentary factions and committees have also deemed it necessary to stress publicly their agreement with the military. These include the Committee on Economic Policy. I would remind readers that this committee, in the person of its chairman, Sergey Glazyev, did try to "bump up" the defense budget to R55 trillion during the first reading. Many deputies voted in favor at the time, but the requisite number of votes failed to be mustered. Recommendations on the draft Law "On the Federal Budget for 1994" have now been prepared in the bowels of the Committee on Economic Policy. The amendments proposed by the committee affect a number of items in the draft law, including those coming under the "National Defense" heading. The proposed breakdown of military expenditure reads as follows: upkeep of the Armed Forces -- R28 trillion; arms and military hardware purchases -- R11.1 trillion; research and development -- R5.1 trillion; capital construction -- R7.1 trillion; Ministry of Atomic Energy expenditure -- R1.2 trillion; servicemen's pensions -- R2.5 trillion. A total of R55 trillion. The following question will thus be put point-blank during the second reading: CAN DEFENSE EXPENDITURE BE INCREASED WITHOUT IN SO DOING INCREASING THE BUDGET DEFICIT? Sergey Glazyev believes it can. The committee's recommendations name two main sources of extra revenue: revenue derived from the privatization of federally owned facilities, and revenue derived from the abolition of concessions on export-import duties. The first accounts for an increase of R13.7 trillion, the second -- R6.6 trillion. In Glazyev's opinion, the sum to be derived from privatization indicated in the government draft is unjustifiably low. "Judge for yourself," the deputy says. "The nominal value of the state property undergoing privatization for money is R120 trillion. The market assessment, from the standpoint of the profitability of the property, is R15 trillion. The export side of Gazprom alone, which it has been resolved to privatize this year, is R100 trillion, while the government is planning to obtain a little more than R1 trillion in revenue from privatization." Moreover, Glazyev is convinced that a number of other opportunities to obtain revenue from the privatization of property are still not being taken into account. For example, the privatization of plots of land on which enterprises undergoing privatization are sited, which is contained in the draft program, will yield quite a lot of revenue, particularly as the bulk of the enterprises is located within the boundaries of the big cities, where the price of land is climbing rapidly. As people will know, many enterprises were privatized with the state retaining a block of 20 to 51 percent of the shares, but, according to the parliamentarian, "The State Committee for the Management of State Property has not given to date any intelligible figures on the placement of these shares or the dividends obtained on them." Sergey Glazyev regards the sum of R15 trillion as a low estimate of the revenue from privatization and the commercial use of state property provided, of course, that, in accordance with the officially announced intentions, we end the stage of free "voucher" privatization and instill order in the milieu of state property management. It must be stressed that Glazyev and his colleagues are talking not so much about lost privatization opportunities as fundamental changes in its implementation. They insist that the privatization program be implemented by decisions of the owner (the state). As far as export-import duties are concerned, the potential here, in the opinion of the Committee on Economic Policy, lies not just in abolishing the illegally awarded concessions but in "boosting budgetary revenue by reducing the smuggling in of goods worth several billion dollars per annum." Establishing currency control and preventing the export of capital could also provide extra budget revenue by reducing shady transactions. I think that when Glazyev, a former minister of foreign economic relations, cites the $20 billion to $30 billion which Russian entrepreneurs keep in foreign bank accounts, he knows what he is talking about. The injection of even half that money into Russia's economy would substantially boost economic activity and augment the revenue side of the budget. It should be noted that the recommendations of the Committee on Economic Policy are designed not just to boost the defense budget but also expenditure on state support for sectors of the national economy, sociocultural measures, science, medicine, and the implementation of international treaties to scrap, reduce, and limit arms. And all this through additional revenue in the light of the priorities declared in the president's message to the Federal Assembly. Through, as Sergey Glazyev put it, a "more assiduous" attitude toward state property. It is clear that Sergey Glazyev expresses the views of a particular economic school, and his political allegiances are also entirely specific -- he is a member of the Democratic Party of Russia faction -- but another thing is clear too: The interests of national security should not be alien to any political force. And the question then arises: WHY HAS IT BEEN DECIDED TO COMBAT THE BUDGET DEFICIT AT THE ARMY'S EXPENSE? There is no shortage of public assurances by statesmen that they understand the problems of the Armed Forces and share the concern over the future of the defense sector and its scientific and technical potential. But when the time comes to allocate the money, it becomes clear that the idea of "shock savings" on defense needs is close to the heart of quite a number of government members and parliamentarians. And it is the defense budget which is the focus of attention of government and Duma debates. In our search for an answer as to why the army is so blithely made the scapegoat for everything, including economic blunders, we have already given a platform to people of the most diverse political persuasion. Here is Sergey Glazyev's opinion. The government is deliberately pursuing an expenditure-cutting policy. Not just the Armed Forces, but higher education, health care, science, and so forth are being underfinanced. The shadow sector continues to submerge the economy, and tax revenues are declining even more quickly than output. But even in this situation the government pursues the goal of lowering inflation by reducing the budget deficit and the amount of credit issued. This policy is based on the naive belief that, in accordance with monetarist ideas on the economy, all the remaining problems will sort themselves out automatically. If we maintain a small budget deficit, inflation will fall, investment and output will pick up, budget revenue will increase, and there will also be money for expenditure. In reality, everything in our country is heading in the opposite direction: output is in decline, budget revenue is falling, budget expenditure is also falling, nonpayment is on the increase, and inflation is intensifying; to overcome inflation they lower the budget deficit -- and expenditure shrinks even further, output falls, and so forth. As the well-known proverb has it, an idiot can't do anything right. Moreover, such a policy proves to be both convenient (you can do nothing -- keep the budget deficit down and wait until output picks up) and advantageous (you always have the choice of whom to give to and whom not -- and, furthermore, without any responsibility). Hence the desire to reduce expenditure. In Glazyev's opinion, those whose interests are poorly represented in the government leadership are the first to come under attack. That is to say, we are talking about a relatively new phenomeneon in our life, namely, lobbying. It transpires that the economic advisability and significance for the state of a particular program are sidelined -- the main thing is to get busy with your elbows. The army -- like, say, scientists, doctors, and teachers -- has not learned this yet. But again a question comes to mind: IF THE PRESIDENT, THE PRIME MINISTER, AND THE FEDERATION COUNCIL HAVE COME OUT IN FAVOR OF A R55-TRILLION DEFENSE BUDGET, WHO THEN IS AGAINST? So far the State Duma has been against. But Sergey Glazyev cannot entirely accept this, if only because the Duma passed without discussion, on trust, as it were, the budget presented by the government for the second quarter of the current year. And all the holdups in financing the ratified articles [of the budget] during the first six months of the year in no way stem from the Duma. I asked Sergey Yuryevich how actively the government cooperated with the parliamentary committees in the runup to the second reading. After all, the press had reported the stance of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the intentions of Russian Head of Government Viktor Chernomyrdin "to tinker with the defense budget." It is logical to suppose that, after that, joint work with government representatives was in full swing in the Duma committees. It turns out there was nothing of the kind. No fundamental modifications of the defense budget were proposed by the government. "The paradox of today's situation," according to Sergey Glazyev, "is that it is the Finance Ministry's decisions rather than presidential edicts or government decrees that are actually being carried out today. The Finance Ministry plays the same role in the state today as the CPSU Central Committee once did." All the budget-financed sectors are now dependent on the whim of Finance Ministry functionaries. The budget, however, is an instrument of statewide policy. The government answers -- must answer -- for its preparation and execution. For the time being, however, according to Glazyev, "the real money is received by those who know how decisions are made in the Finance Ministry and are consequently able to influence them." Clearly, it has to be understood that the future of the defense sector and indeed of the entire Armed Forces is decided by financiers today. And they alone. And even if the Duma does ratify defense expenditure of R55 trillion, it could well be that no more than R37 trillion actually ends up in the defense coffers. SO, WILL THE STATE DUMA RATIFY A "SUBSISTENCE MINIMUM" FOR THE ARMED FORCES OR NOT? Sergey Glazyev hopes that it will, although there are more than enough grounds for pessimism: We are, after all, talking about altering the correlation of the revenue and expenditure sides. And this correlation was already ratified during the first reading. Consequently, either the budget adoption procedures will have to be violated or new, extrabudgetary funds acquired. And, of course, departmental interests (interests encumbered, moreover, by political considerations) will tell here. Admittedly, the Budget Committee -- an opponent of the Defense and Economic Policy Committees -- has already agreed to add another R4 trillion to the defense budget. A half-measure, to be sure, but movement for all that. The main thing, Sergey Glazyev told me as we parted, is not to build up illusions -- if the State Duma doesn't give the army and the defense sector the R18 trillion, no one else will provide them. Neither the president nor the government has any "hidden reserves." Consequently, the sole hope is that the interests of national security, and no others, will now prevail in the State Duma.
