Zelinskiy, Moscow; UDC530.145:32] [Abstract] Conjugation in allyl and vinyl compounds of heavy elements has been analyzed by quantum chemical methods for a rather broad range of hetero-atoms, particularly compounds of Groups IV and VII elements. The present work focuses on analogous derivatives of Group V elements using semi-empirical quantum chemical MNDO methods for computations with parameters for nitrogen and phosphorus. Long wave electron transition and oscillator energies were calculated for various allyl- and vinylamine and allyl- and vinylphosphine conformers. The electron structures of these molecules were examined in detail and both the spectral and conformational manifestations of n,�- and �,�-conjugation were analyzed. Several hypotheses are advanced on possible manifestations of conjugation in allyl compounds of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Figures 2; references 14: 5 Russian, 9 Western.
