On 19 April, a U.S.-Japan cartel which Mobil of the United States formed with Japanese firms such as Japan Petroleum Exploration formally signed a contract acquiring rights to the Blue Dragon (05-1b mining area) off the south. Moreover, the Arabian Oil and Teikoku Oil group, which has drilled two test wells so far and failed with both, has obtained a "firm-in" from Mobil of the United States and BP of Great Britain, and has started study on a third test well. Mitsubishi Oil also has begun drilling a test well for the first time. Moreover, Idemitsu Kosan is making test wells off the north. However, the situation is that if "results" do not appear with these test projects, it is predicted that the Vietnam "oil development boom" will cool rapidly. The project which is being conducted centering on Arabian Oil and Teikoku Oil symbolizes the oil development work off of Vietnam. They have dug two test wells so far, but both entered a high-pressure gas layer before reaching the target depth, they stopped the operation and abandoned both. Idemitsu Kosan also is conducting test drilling in a mining area off the north, but the first was "empty," they now are drilling the second, and are at the stage of watching for "results" that will appear in May. Mitsubishi Oil also began drilling their first test well in April, and the results will appear in early summer. Except for Blue Dragon by the Mobil-Japan Petroleum Exploration-Indonesian Oil-Nissho Iwai group, all physical prospecting has ended and they have begun drilling test wells, but the expected "results" have not appeared so far. Since oil development off of Vietnam had appeared to be one of the few promising areas remaining in Southeast Asia, the international trade war has "become overheated" and the so-called sign bonus rate which is paid to Vietnam at the time of the contract is said to have become very highly "irregular" for these kind of business talks. The final conclusion as to whether or not they have made an expensive purchase will come soon.
