Luis Eduardo Paul Bello, Simon Nobile Olivo, Lino Clemente, Eduardo Gomez Sigala, Pedro Carmona Estanga, Phillip Erard, and Lopez Mendoza are the members appointed by the Presidency of the Republic. The other members are Agriculture Minister Ciro Fonseca Anez; Labor Minister Juan Nepomuceno Garrido Mendoza; Alberto Poletto of the Foreign Trade Institute; Abdon Vivas Teran of the Investments Fund; Policarpo Rodriguez, vice president of Finexpo [expansion unknown]; Ignacio Avalos Gutierrez, president of Conicit [expansion unknown]; Francisco Layrisse, of the Venezuelan Guayana Corporation; Luis Giusti, president of Venezuelan Petroleum; Angel Gutierrez, president of the Federation of Industries; Jorge Redmond of the Venezuelan Council of Industry; Berend Roosen of the National Council of Commerce and Services; and Hans Neumann. President Caldera said: The opening of trade, as well as the nation's commitments to international organizations, conditions established by the Andean Pact, and other circumstances, constitute a challenge Venezuela must overcome with basis on competitiveness and ability. With the creation of this commission we want to make evident the commitment the government has made to the country with regard to the future of the Venezuelan economy and also to open roads for intense and effective cooperation between the public and private sectors. We have invited representatives from the private sector to share with us this great responsibility. Its representation in this commission will be a permanent driving force and provide encouragement so that the goals that have led us to the creation of this important commission may be satisfactorily reached. At this time I would like to express my special thanks to the representatives of the private sector who have accepted this task. This is a commitment with Venezuela, and the government understands it as such. Therefore, it feels obliged to publicly express its recognition of those who have decided to take part in the efforts we have undertaken to benefit our people. After addressing several issues that had previously been discussed on numerous occasions during the government's first three months in office, Minister Ciro Anez Fonseca listed several basic points of his agricultural policy: - Legal security in all of its forms regarding the agricultural sector; - Heightened production and productivity; - Incentives for farmers, livestock breeders, fishing, and lumber workers, using all resources available to the ministry; - Guarantees that the local market will be reserved for local production only, while respecting agreements such as GATT, the Andean Pact, and other entities with whom we have signed similar multilateral agreements; - Radical changes in domestic agricultural marketing policies to bring producers and consumers closer for their mutual benefit; - Broad support for agricultural exports; - Defining priority agricultural items and crop zoning strategies directed at diversification and increased productivity; - And the inclusion of new technology, such as biotechnology, minimal labor techniques, and organic farming. A compulsory agricultural insurance system will be established. Education and training programs will be mainly based on new productive structures. The transfer and application of technology, particularly crop extension methods, will be based on scientific and practical results provided by Fonalap [expansion unknown]. Fonalap will also be the subject of a complete revision. Some small-scale farmers are complaining about the agreements reached with the banks. I want to point out something, however, with regard to the small producers who receive special treatment from the Institute of Agriculture Credit. They are not being hurt by the problem because they continue to receive the benefits of financial facilities; there are no problems there. The problem lies with the medium-sized farmers -- the medium-sized producers -- and not with the large producers who have guaranteed finances. There is a large number of farmers who are not adversely affected by the financial and refinancing problem. I would say that only about 20 percent are severely affected. Economic Turbulence Development Minister Luis Carlos Palacios referred to the commitment to social unity. He said: Today, we are experiencing economic turbulence caused by special circumstances in which there are imbalances in the monetary and foreign exchange sectors. It is obvious that these imbalances and higher currency prices have a bearing on imports required by the the nation's producers. Overall, the nation's producers import about 30 percent of their production-related supplies. This is a cost that in some way is reflected in the prices. In this regard, I would say this does not go against the national agreement, and even though we have this problem, the national agreement must be advanced. That national agreement outlines what can be done when there is instability, which is different from what can be done when there is more stability and balance. At the same time, significant efforts are being made in the productive sectors to prevent prices from rising above levels that can reasonably result from increased costs of imports at a higher rate of exchange. In response to a reporter's question, Labor Minister Juan Nepomuceno Garrido said judicial branch workers had agreed to work toward reconciliation. Yesterday, he noted, the Labor Ministry had accepted the controversial list of petitions while the Board of Conciliation is being organized. The minister added: The 120-hour deadline will be over at the beginning of next week, and we have agreed to continue providing essential justice services. This is something that should be highlighted, because strikes should not be designed to do harm; instead, they are to pressure employers to take certain measures. The labor minister recalled that the workers are not demanding better salaries as such; rather, they want what they were granted by a court decision late last year to be upgraded. When reporters told the minister that the CTV [Confederation of Venezuelan Workers] had appealed to the court for salary increases to be taken into account in the benefits, he replied smiling: "This has about as much chance as a snowball in hell." President Caldera will travel to Margarita on Saturday to attend the closing of the Venezuelan Press Association's conference in the province. This will be at 1900.
