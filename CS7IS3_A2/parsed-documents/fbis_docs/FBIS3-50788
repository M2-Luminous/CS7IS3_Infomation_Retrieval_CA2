Following the preliminary investigations, the Attorney General's Office said the eight people under arrest are allegedly responsible for the crimes of murder and association with criminal intent and are charged with the possession of firearms that are meant only for the exclusive use of the Mexican Army, Navy, and Air Force. The eight individuals were turned over to the First Criminal Court judge in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State. They are: Juan Jimenez Santis, Juan Carlos Ruiz Garcia, Juan Guzman Velasco, Miguel Giron Lopez, Javier Jimenez Fernandez, Miguel Giron Guzman, Palemon Cabrera Arizon, and Alonso Moreno Hernandez. We must point out that the Mexican Attorney General's Office said Alonso Moreno Hernandez will probably be charged with other crimes. The ninth person is a minor, Jose Lopez Hernandez, who also participated in the attacks on the Army members. According to the Attorney General's Office, the necessary steps are being taken to turn him over to the juvenile court in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas. As for the events that took place on 2 January 1994, the Attorney General's Office said the nine members of the subversive group attacked a Mexican Army patrol near the village of Rancho Nuevo at approximately 0700 and immediately ambushed the Army members, killing 1st Cavalry Captain Vladimir Lara Salgado, Lieutenant Fernando Monroy Tinajero, 2d Infantry Sergeant Gilberto de Jesus Damaso, and Infantry Corporals Encarnacion Mejia Hernandez and Jordan Gonzalez Gonzalez. Those injured were 1st Infantry Capt. Jose Luis Garcia Magana, 1st Infantry Capt. Carlos Echeverria Mendez, Corporal Abimael de Jesus Morales, and Private Rodolfo Lopez Arriola. The Mexican Attorney General's Office indicated that other Army members arrested the nine subversives when they repelled the attack. During the operation the Army confiscated three 410-gauge shotguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun, two AR-15 rifles, a grenade, and approximately 100 cartridges of various calibers. The Attorney General's Office concludes its report by saying that during the investigations carried out by the Federal Judicial Police, the necessary evidence was collected to show that these nine people did in fact participate in the ambush against members of the Mexican Army.
