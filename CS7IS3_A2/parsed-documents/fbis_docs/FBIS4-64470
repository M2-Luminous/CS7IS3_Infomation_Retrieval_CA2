As FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU learned from the FDP leadership in Bonn on Tuesday [3 May], a victory for Herzog should be obvious from the very beginning to prevent the FDP votes from splitting up in the following two ballots. It was said that unless there is a convincing majority for the CDU candidate in the first ballot, there is the danger of parts of the 111 FDP electors supporting Herzog in the second and third ballots while others would cast their vote for the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] candidate, Johannes Rau, and still others for the FDP's own candidate, Hildegard Hamm- Bruecher. The result of the first ballot is of "extraordinarily great importance" for the further behavior in the ballots, one member of the FDP leadership said in Bonn. If Herzog's victory were to become obvious early on, even such FDP electors would vote for the CDU man that would otherwise rather be leaning toward Rau. It was further learned that FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel and Bundestag group leader Hermann Otto Solms want to make sure that Herzog gets elected with the help of the FDP because this could be interpreted as a sign of the ability to act and the solidarity of the Bonn coalition, which consists of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP. The FDP leadership intends to commit the party congress in early June in Rostock to the continuation of this coalition after the 16 October Bundestag election. Solms and Kinkel are the advocates of this coalition statement and both are regarded as supporters of Herzog. The agreement within the party so far was that first the FDP's own candidate, Hamm-Bruecher, should be supported, and that the further voting behavior should then be discussed after each ballot. According to Kinkel there will not be any commitment prior to the ballots. At any rate, by its voting behavior, the FDP will take a considerable share in the decision as to who will become the successor to Richard von Weizsaecker.
