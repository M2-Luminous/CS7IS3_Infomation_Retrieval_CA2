FBIS4-42099 "drweu104_k_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-104 Daily Report 21 May 1994 PORTUGAL Poll: PSP Leads in European Parliament Elections Poll: PSP Leads in European Parliament Elections PM2705153294 Lisbon EXPRESSO in Portuguese 21 May 94 p 1 PM2705153294 Lisbon EXPRESSO Portuguese BFN [Unattributed report: "PSP, 39.4 Percent; PSD, 26.2 Percent; CDU, 9 Percent; CDS, 7.4 Percent"] [Text] The PSP [Portuguese Socialist Party] has a comfortable 13-percent lead over the PSD [Social Democratic Party] three weeks from the holding of the elections to the European Parliament, according to a major EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao opinion poll with 1,051 interviews in mainland Portugal, conducted by the ballot box method between 11 and 18 May. With 39.4 percent of voting intentions for Antonio Vitorino's list, 26.2 percent for Eurico de Melo's list, and just 10.8 percent undecided, it could be said that right now the PSP is virtually assured of victory 12 June, its scale remaining to be seen. It is an election triumph that, if confirmed, will follow the Socialist victory in last December's local elections, placing the PSP in an advantageous starting position for next year's legislative elections. And it should be emphasized that the poll was conducted on the days when the disagreements between Belem Palace and Rato Square [PSP headquarters] over the "Portugal, what future?" congress had their greatest coverage in the news media. On the other hand, the PSD's prospects are not encouraging. Reduced to 26.2 percent (almost the hard core of the PSD vote), Cavaco's party is in danger of a second consecutive election defeat, and this time with a humiliating difference from Guterres' party. Moreover, let it be recalled that the PSD won the European elections in 1989 with 32.8 percent against 28.5 percent for the PSP, 14.4 percent for the CDU [Unitary Democratic Coalition], and 14.2 percent for the CDS [Social Democratic Center Party]. And if the CDU, with 9 percent in this poll, does not diverge from its result in the last legislative elections, the 7.4 percent for Manuel Monteiro's party threatens not to come up to the expectations aroused in the CDS and to leave its leader short of the result achieved by Lucas Pires five years ago. As regards the small parties, the poll gives the following figures: Portuguese Workers Communist Party/Movement for the Reorganization of the Proletariat Party (1.7 percent), Democratic Renewal Party (0.6 percent), MPT [expansion unknown] (0.5 percent), PSN [Socialist Party of Navarre] (0.5 percent), Revolutionary Socialist Party (0.4 percent), Popular Democratic Union (0.4 percent), PDA [expansion unknown] (0.3 percent), Policy XXI (0.2 percent), and Popular Monarchist Party (0.1 percent). The poll was stratified in terms of region and habitat, and the quota method was used with an age/sex/education matrix. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent for a degree of probability of 95 percent.
