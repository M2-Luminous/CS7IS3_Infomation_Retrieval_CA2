On the role of Catholics in Ho Chi Minh City, the prime minister highly valued their patriotic spirit and dynamic participation in the city's social programs. He stressed that participation in activities that help construct the fatherland is the responsibility and right of the Catholic people. There are presently a number of issues remaining to be settled between the Vietnamese Government and the Catholic Church, such as the Vatican's appointment of the supervisor for the Ho Chi Minh City diocese without any consultation with the Vietnamese Government, and the Vatican's prohibition on priests joining people-nominated agencies and the Solidarity Committee of Vietnamese Catholics. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held that more effort was still needed to settle issues caused by each side's lack of proper understanding of the other. People in Ho Chi Minh City have made considerable progress thanks to the implementation of a freedom of religion policy and of the principle of harmonious development between religious and secular activities, whereby the contributions of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, the Catholic Motivation Committee, the Solidarity Committee of Catholics, and the Cong Giao Va Dan Toc Paper should be greatly acknowledged. The prime minister wished that there would be a succeeding archbishop for Ho Chi Minh City who would not contradict the lines of Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh, the Solidarity Committee of Catholics, and the Cong Giao Va Dan Toc Paper, and who would use his role to better the contributions of the Catholics in Ho Chi Minh City to the advancement of the people and prosperity of the country, along with the harmonious development of religious activities.
