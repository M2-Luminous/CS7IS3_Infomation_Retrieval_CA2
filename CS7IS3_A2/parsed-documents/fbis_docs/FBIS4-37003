Political sources in Sanaa revealed yesterday that the Saudi regime has mobilized 150 tanks in the Maydi area bordering Yemen [as received]. The sources added that the Saudi regime, which has intensified its blatant interference in Yemeni domestic affairs by supplying the secessionists with military hardware, which is reaching them over land, by sea, and by air, has recently recruited large groups of mercenaries to support the secessionists besieged in Aden and al-Mukalla. The Saudi regime is practicing repression against the Yemenis hailing from southern and eastern Yemeni governorates to make them join training camps launched to prepare them for fighting on the side of the secessionists in Yemen. Political and diplomatic sources in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, said that Saudi Arabia has earmarked large amounts of money for supporting the secessionists and tearing Yemeni unity apart. Saudi Arabia believes that it can, through arms deals and unlimited support for the secessionists, influence the course of the fighting and settle it in favor of the secessionists. It is to be recalled that the Yemeni people believe that Yemeni unity is a sacred accomplishment, because it was achieved by their own free will. The Constitution of the Republic of Yemen was endorsed by the Yemenis in a public referendum on 16 May 1990. This Constitution deems unity an eternal right for the Yemeni people. The history of the Yemeni-Saudi conflict dates back to 70 years ago, when the ruling Saudi family imposed the current borders on the al-Mutawakkilite kingdom, which ruled Yemen then. The Saudi regime's concern for thwarting Yemeni unity has prompted it to launch an office managed and supervised by Saudi Defense Minister Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. This office was launched to carry out acts of sabotage in Yemen and tear its unity asunder. Several billions of dollars have been earmarked for this office. The Yemeni political sources noted that the Yemeni political crisis was engineered by the Saudis. This took place when 'Ai Salim al-Bid, leader of the secessionists, visited Saudi Arabia months after the realization of unity, and met with [King] Fahd, the leader of the Saudi regime. During that visit, al-Bid secretly promised Fahd to renege on unity in return for financial and economic support. The Saudi regime is using this plan to put pressure on the Yemeni leadership, which has rejected the Saudi conditions for demarcating the common borders. The Saudis want the current borders to be the final borders. Since 1934, Saudi Arabia has occupied three oil-rich Yemeni areas; namely, Jizan, 'Asir, and Najran, the area of which exceeds 300,000 square kilometers. Saudi Arabia has refused to return these Yemeni territories to Yemen.
