FBIS4-48816 "drafr103_c_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-103 Daily Report 25 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Buthelezi Says IFP Committed to Reconstruction Plan Buthelezi Says IFP Committed to Reconstruction Plan MB2505163194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1420 GMT 25 May 94 MB2505163194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP) was committed to the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP], but it should be carried out at provincial and local government level, IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Wednesday. Speaking in the debate on the president's opening speech he congratulated him and those leaders who preceded him "in your struggle to have brought us here today." He lamented the fact that KwaZulu/Natal had to go to the elections in -- and remained in -- a state of emergency. "It is the only fly in the ointment of the overflowing cup of joy which is before us." The government of national unity faced a challenge of titanic proportions, not only to succeed, but to make the Reconstruction and Development Programme actually work for the people. "We in the IFP are committed to do what we can," he said. The IFP accepted the challenge, but gave notice that it would bring into play the wide variety of the country's diverse community. "We must ensure that all political parties will continue to play an active role in supporting the RDP effort through to its final implementation." Hidden political agendas had to be avoided, Mr Buthelezi said. Though he found Mr Mandela's vision for a new South Africa and the RDP proposals commendable, there might be differences of approach on detail between their two parties. "We should not have a top-down programme. The people must be empowered to develop and implement programmes for their own communities, entrusting the execution to grass roots level." All chapters of the RDP falling under the functional areas of the provincial authorities should be developed autonomously by the provinces, while the central government was restricted to receiving and co-ordinating such programmes. "Let us have the true courage of empowering people at local and provincial government levels. It is only with this approach that we will carry into the programme the rich diversity of our people," Mr Buthelezi said.
