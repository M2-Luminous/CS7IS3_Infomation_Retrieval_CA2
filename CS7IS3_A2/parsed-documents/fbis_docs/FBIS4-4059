According to the China Labor Development Bulletin issued here jointly today by the Ministry of Labor and the State Statistics Bureau, arbitration committees for labor disputes at various levels had by the end of last year been seized of 12,300 disputes, up 51.6 percent over the previous year. Liu Guanxue, spokesman for the Labor Ministry, told reporters that Chinese laborers have now become more conscious of the importance of self-protection. The labor departments, on the other hand, are doing their best to step up labor protection by all legal means. The bulletin shows that the arbitration committees examined and handled 11,400 labor disputes last year, some 92.2 percent of the total. At the same time, according to the spokesman, the labor supervisory system has also been greatly strengthened. By now, altogether 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities nationwide have set up labor supervisory institutions. They have established the system of mass-reporting of illegal labor activities and launched various forms of checks on labor recruitment. According to statistics from the provinces of Guangdong, Sichuan and Zhejiang, the most labor-intensive areas in China, the labor supervisory institutions cracked down on more than 100 illegal labor intermediary institutions in 1993, which effectively maintains order in the state's labor markets.
