Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), said the package should give a further impetus to the Japanese economy, which he said is beginning to show signs of recovery. Some executives, however, expressed doubts over the confusion in the coalition government following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's announcement of a "national welfare tax." He proposed last Thursday that the government introduce a fresh 7 percent "national welfare tax" in April 1997 to finance the tax reduction that will be retroactive to January 1. But in the face of stiff opposition from the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the biggest contingent in his seven-party coalition, he was forced to retract the scheme. Yoshiaki Sakakura, chairman of the Japan Department Stores Association, said he was perplexed when Hosokawa retracted the tax cut proposal. Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said the SDPJ should have acted "in a more responsible manner" as the No. 1 coalition partner. Nagano also said the size of the tax cuts could have been larger but added he had no objections to implementing tax cuts without securing funds to finance them. Osamu Uno, chairman of the Kansai Economic Federation (Kankeiren) in western Japan, also said implementing tax cuts without securing funds to make up for them was unavoidable because Japan is in deep recession and Hosokawa faces a summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday in Washington.
