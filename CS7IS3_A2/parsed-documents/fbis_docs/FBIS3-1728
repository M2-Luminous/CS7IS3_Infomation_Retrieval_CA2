On one hand, they preached the 20-character principle of "grasping the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding the open- door policy, and promoting development," which has been proposed by the senior level of the CPC as this year's work, and on the other hand they listened to the opinions of local authorities on reform measures aimed at state-owned enterprises, finance, taxation, revenue, investment, and foreign trade -- measures that are forceful, penetrating, and extensive -- so as to strengthen communications between central and local authorities and to create a good environment for the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] which will open on 10 March. "Central Committee With Jiang As Core" Still Has No Authority Informed sources in Beijing disclosed that Yang Shangkun, Bo Yibo, Wan Li, and other CPC elders stressed during their inspection trips that in the new year, when many reform measures are being announced, whether or not changing from the planned economy to a market economy goes well will depend on five factors: 1) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can voluntarily safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee which has Jiang Zemin as the core. 2) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can establish the view that party spirit is above everything, and voluntarily strengthen party spirit and organization. 3) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can unconditionally submit local and partial interests to central and overall interests. 4) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can strengthen their own clean government building and win the people's trust by the image of doing solid work. 5) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can seriously learn from Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and actively, thoroughly, and correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's theory. The persons of political circles in Beijing pointed out that, regarding the importance of safeguarding the authority of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, not only Deng Xiaoping has talked about it many times, but even Chen Yun stressed it when he talked about the way to solve the current difficulties with Shanghai's party and government leaders who went to convey New Year greetings to him on 9 February. He said: "Without the authority of the Central Committee, big things cannot be done, and society cannot be stable." He also praised the current leading group in the central authorities saying it is strong, capable, and doing quite a good job. Undoubtedly, with the support of Chen Yun, who is viewed as the chief representative of the conservative forces within the CPC, the authority of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core will be strengthened. However, the authority of the "Central Committee with Jiang as the core," which is the third-generation leadership, must still rely on the protection given by the CPC elders, and this shows that the "Central Committee with Jiang as the core" still has no authority. This cannot be denied as a big potential problem after Deng and Chen pass away. Not Carrying Out Political Reform Is "Political Shortsightedness" According to informed sources, Wan Li talked specifically on the issue of self-construction of leading cadres during his inspection trip. He hoped that leading cadres could set high standards for themselves. He mentioned that some leading cadres were content with not engaging in corruption, not taking bribes, not pursuing erosion, and not abusing their power, and he pointed out that these "four not's" are only the criteria for a law-abiding citizen, not the criteria for leading cadres, and that if they are only able to do the "four not's," then they are not qualified to serve as leading cadres. He said: "In the new historical period, and today when we try to establish the system of the socialist market economy, we must stress in particular that leading party and government cadres must put the interests of the party, the state, and the people first, and put individual interests, as well as the interests of their family members, in a lesser position. I am not saying that those interests are not to be considered, and it is not realistic to completely ignore them, but there has to be an order of priorities. Otherwise, one is not qualified to serve as a leading party or government cadre, and the people have no obligation to support him." Bo Yibo, during his inspection trip, criticized some provinces that have owed wages to primary and secondary school teachers for a long time, and issued IOU's to peasants, but spent a large amount of public funds to build halls, buy cars, and travel. He said at the meeting of the standing committee of a certain provincial party committee: "If you, the standing committee members who are sitting here, did not receive your paychecks for three or six months, would you still come to work? Would you not complain? Would you not swear at the Central Committee? Did you feel any sense of guilt when you rode in the imported limousines to the counties and villages for inspection? You must know that the price of an imported limousine could completely change the face of a village!" According to political circles in Beijing, what is noteworthy is why the phenomena criticized by Wan Li and Bo Yibo is continuously spreading within the CPC. In the final analysis, it is because as reform of the economic system is carried out, reform of the political system is not. But regrettably, the CPC elders and the current CPC leaders still bury their heads in the sand regarding this serious mistake. They hardly realize that establishing democratic politics is more helpful in safeguarding the position of the party and government and the security of the country, and at the same time, it has a bigger political rallying force than merely imbuing the masses with a "sense of loyalty." Not carrying out political reform is indeed a kind of "political shortsightedness." The "20-Character Principle" Is the Basic Tone of the NPC The informed sources also said that Bo Yibo, who once said that Deng Xiaoping's biggest contribution is that "he found the way of building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- a way which Mao Zedong wanted to find but failed to find," demanded during his inspection trip that provincial leaders thoroughly learn from and correctly understand Deng Xiaoping's theory. He said: "The true meaning of Comrade Xiaoping's theory is that it proceeds from China's actual conditions. Comrade Xiaoping, using the stance, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, has summed up the positive and negative experiences in the development of China and foreign countries, summed up the positive and negative experiences in the history of the CPC, and created the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The essence of this theory is emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts. Under the guidance of this theory, our country has undergone profound changes over the past 14 years, catching the attention of people all over the world. Therefore, every party member and the leading cadres of various levels must seriously learn from and grasp Comrade Xiaoping's theory." According to political circles in Beijing, Bo Yibo's high appraisal of Deng Xiaoping's theory was helpful in checking the unhealthy tendency of the Mao craze within and without the party arising from the 100th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birthday. But it is difficult to correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's theory. For example, Deng Xiaoping has time and again explained the theory of opportunity in recent years, and stressed the need to grasp the opportunity and expedite reform and development (note: see the 21 February article in this column), as a result, many cadres have rapidly launched projects without considering conditions. In fact, when Deng demanded a speedier development, he did not permit blind enthusiasm. Concerning this point, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is taking charge of China's economic reform and is considered to be most skillful in understanding Deng Xiaoping's theory, has explained it as follows: "To actively, thoroughly, and correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's thinking and theory, one will be condemned by history if one fails to grasp the opportunity. If one charges ahead blindly, and does not seek truth from facts, to the extent of causing big fluctuations, then, one will also be condemned in history." The above-mentioned "20-character principle," which has been proposed by the senior level of the CPC, has replaced "expediting the development" with "promoting the development," and this obviously is to prevent blind adventure. Judged from this, the 20-character principle will be the basic tone of the Second Session of the Eighth NPC and the government work report, whereas before the NPC, it is believed that the CPC authorities will achieve a consensus at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on the relevant issues such as this basic tone and the way to strengthen the authority of the "Central Committee with Jiang as the core."
