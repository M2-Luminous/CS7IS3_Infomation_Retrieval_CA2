Mr. Maxwell Gaylard said that they had managed to get the two 10-man delegations from the rival factions within the Royal Lesotho Defense Force together for a meeting in Maseru. He said he was optimistic that this was the beginning of a significant breakthrough, although the Commonwealth still intended to bring the two sides together for more substantial talks. Troops from the two factions are still in position in the hills around Maseru.
