FBIS4-38530 "drsov105_g_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-105 Daily Report 30 May 1994 WESTERN REGION Belarus Democratic Radio Programs, Papers Suspended Democratic Radio Programs, Papers Suspended WS3105145994 Minsk BELAPAN in Belarusian 1500 GMT 30 May 94 WS3105145994 Minsk BELAPAN Belarusian BFN [Text] The Belarusian radio programs "Belaruskaya Maladzyozhnaya" [Belarusian Youth] and "Krynitsa" [Spring] have been suspended since 28 May. The publishing house "Belarusian Printing House" refuses to print the newspaper SVABODA. Media representatives issued declarations on the issues at a press conference held on 30 May. In particular, the declarations stated that employees of both radio programs were confronted with the fact that, as a result of transforming the National State Television and Radio Company into the Television and Radio Committee of the Belarusian Council of Ministers, "Krynitsa" and "Belaruskaya Maladzyozhnaya" are merged -- or virtually closed -- and will be replaced by the Main Broadcasting Editorial Office to be established of the Second Radio Channel. As a matter of fact, this transformation can be seen as a move to get rid of politically inconvenient journalists who disseminate objective information. As is known, "Belaruskaya Maladzyozhnaya" was planning a feature a live program on 28 May with Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich who is against the populist decision to merge Belarusian and Russian monetary units, a move that has been greeted with mixed opinion. The employees of the two radio programs consider the crackdown politically motivated and an infringement of freedom, which places the possibility of holding democratic elections in Belarus in doubt. The program calls on the international community, law-enforcement agencies, media, and society to do their best to stop the violence against democratic mass media and freedom of speech. A declaration was also issued by the opposition Belarusian Popular Front deputies. It said that the "offensive against democratic journalists and the independent press is not casual -- the Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet, subordinate to it, seek to have the elections held in the atmosphere of misinformation. The radio and television leadership plans to offer inconvenient hours for democratic candidates for president. Meanwhile, all radio and television information programs and all government newspapers are jammed with propaganda about Prime Minister Vyachaslav Kebich." The deputies call on the Belarusian public and the international community to pay attention to the crackdown on the democratic press and other mass media as well as to the restoration of totalitarianism in Belarus. They demand that publication of newspapers VYBAR, NAVINY BNF, and SVABODA as well as the broadcasting of radio programs "Belaruskaya Maladzyozhnaya" and "Krynitsa" be immediately resumed.
