With a Walton-Beckett graticule this range is equivalent to 0.8 to 10 fibers/field. Using NIOSH counting statistics, a count of 0.8 fibers/field would give an approximate coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.13. 2.2. The detection limit for this method is 4.0 fibers per 100 fields or 5.5 fibers/mm2. This was determined using an equation to estimate the maximum CV possible at a specific concentration (95% confidence) and a Lower Control Limit of zero. The CV value was then used to determine a corresponding concentration from historical CV vs fiber relationships. As an example: Lower Control Limit (95% Confidence) = AC ^ 1.645(CV)(AC) Where: AC = Estimate of the airborne fiber concentration (fibers/cc) Setting the Lower Control Limit = 0 and solving for CV: 0 = AC ^ 1.645(CV)(AC) CV = 0.61 This value was compared with CV vs. count curves. The count at which CV = 0.61 for Leidel-Busch counting statistics or for an OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center (OSHA&hyph;SLTC) CV curve (see Appendix A for further information) was 4.4 fibers or 3.9 fibers per 100 fields, respectively. Although a lower detection limit of 4 fibers per 100 fields is supported by the OSHA&hyph;SLTC data, both data sets support the 4.5 fibers per 100 fields value. 3. Method Performance_Precision and Accuracy Precision is dependent upon the total number of fibers counted and the uniformity of the fiber distribution on the filter. A general rule is to count at least 20 and not more than 100 fields. The count is discontinued when 100 fibers are counted, provided that 20 fields have already been counted. Counting more than 100 fibers results in only a small gain in precision. As the total count drops below 10 fibers, an accelerated loss of precision is noted. At this time, there is no known method to determine the absolute accuracy of the asbestos analysis. Results of samples prepared through the Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program and analyzed by the OSHA&hyph;SLTC showed no significant bias when compared to PAT reference values. The PAT samples were analyzed from 1987 to 1989 (N=36) and the concentration range was from 120 to 1,300 fibers/mm2. 4. Interferences Fibrous substances, if present, may interfere with asbestos analysis. Some common fibers are: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ Fiber glass anhydrite plant fibers Perlite veins. Gypsum Some synthetic fibers. Membrane structures Sponge spicules and diatoms. Microorganisms Wollastonite. The use of electron microscopy or optical tests such as polarized light, and dispersion staining may be used to differentiate these materials from asbestos when necessary. 5. Sampling 5.1. Equipment 5.1.1. Sample assembly (The assembly is shown in Figure 3). Conductive filter holder consisting of a 25-mm diameter, 3-piece cassette having a 50-mm long electrically conductive extension cowl. Backup pad, 25-mm, cellulose. Membrane filter, mixed-cellulose ester (MCE), 25-mm, plain, white, 0.8- to 1.2-μm pore size. Notes: (a) Do not re-use cassettes. (b) Fully conductive cassettes are required to reduce fiber loss to the sides of the cassette due to electrostatic attraction. (c) Purchase filters which have been selected by the manufacturer for asbestos counting or analyze representative filters for fiber background before use. Discard the filter lot if more than 4 fibers/100 fields are found. (d) To decrease the possibility of contamination, the sampling system (filter-backup pad-cassette) for asbestos is usually preassembled by the manufacturer. 5.1.2. Gel bands for sealing cassettes. 5.1.3. Sampling pump. Each pump must be a battery operated, self-contained unit small enough to be placed on the monitored employee and not interfere with the work being performed. The pump must be capable of sampling at 2.5 liters per minute (L/min) for the required sampling time. 5.1.4. Flexible tubing, 6-mm bore. 5.1.5. Pump calibration. Stopwatch and bubble tube/burette or electronic meter. 5.2. Sampling Procedure 5.2.1. Seal the point where the base and cowl of each cassette meet (see Figure 3) with a gel band or tape. 5.2.2. Charge the pumps completely before beginning. 5.2.3. Connect each pump to a calibration cassette with an appropriate length of 6-mm bore plastic tubing. Do not use luer connectors_the type of cassette specified above has built-in adapters. 5.2.4. Select an appropriate flow rate for the situation being monitored. The sampling flow rate must be between 0.5 and 5.0 L/min for personal sampling and is commonly set between 1 and 2 L/min. Always choose a flow rate that will not produce overloaded filters.
