As Interfax has learned from the Krasnodar- based organizing committee, the meeting was put off because of the Russian Foreign Ministry's insistence on getting the Georgian leadership's consent for such an assembly first. Meanwhile, as an Interfax correspondent reports, at a conference in Krasnodar on April 16-17, the working groups of experts drafted for the upcoming meeting a political statement on the mechanism for the functioning of peacekeepers in Abkhazia.
