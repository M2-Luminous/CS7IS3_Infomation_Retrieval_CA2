In his statement to AL-QUDS, Dr. al-Zahhar stressed the Islamic Movement's rejection of the agreement that is expected to be signed today in Cairo between 'Arafat and Rabin. He said: History will not stop on this day or on any such event. Muslim history has proved that it has surmounted such days and that the journey of victory might be delayed but it is inevitable and certain. Al-Zahhar added: Those signing the agreement will bear its results, consequences, and repercussions before God, the people, and history. [passage omitted]
