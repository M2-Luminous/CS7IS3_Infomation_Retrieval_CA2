FR941102-2-00061 FR941102-2-00046 Under the old posting rules, smaller institutions seldom incurred significant daylight overdrafts and, thus, were able to make use of the ``exempt from filing'' or ``de minimis'' daylight overdraft caps without incurring a significant number of cap breaches. Under the new posting rules, however, on average over four recent reserve maintenance periods, 600 of the 775 total institutions with daylight overdrafts in excess of their caps were institutions that had ``exempt from filing'' or ``de minimis'' daylight overdraft caps. An additional 159 institutions with a zero net debit cap had cap breaches. The ``exempt from filing'' cap permits an institution to incur daylight overdrafts up to the lesser of $10 million or 20 percent of risk-based capital. The exempt cap does not require any action by the board of directors of the depository institution or the filing of any documentation with its Reserve Bank. As additional flexibility, an exempt-from-filing institution may incur up to two daylight overdrafts in two consecutive two-week reserve maintenance periods before it is in violation of the Board's payments system risk (PSR) policy. 1 In order to incur higher daylight overdrafts, an institution may file a resolution of its board of directors requesting a de minimis cap, which permits daylight overdrafts up to 20 percent of risk-based capital. To be permitted even larger amounts of intraday credit, up to 2.25 times risk-based capital on a single day, the institution must undertake a self-assessment of creditworthiness, intraday funds management and control, and customer credit policies and controls to support a higher daylight overdraft cap. 1 For institutions with other net debit cap categories, any daylight overdraft that exceeds the net debit cap would be subject to administrative counseling by the Reserve Banks. An institution that regularly exceeds its cap is subject to progressively higher levels of administrative counseling by its Reserve Bank. Under current guidelines, a depository institution that continues to exceed its daylight overdraft cap ultimately may be assigned a zero cap and be placed on the real-time monitor. In this situation, a depository institution will be prevented from originating Fedwire funds transfers that would cause, or increase, a daylight overdraft. The Board's policy on daylight overdraft caps is intended to address intraday risk to the Federal Reserve arising from daylight overdrafts. However, most non-Fedwire activity poses primarily interday, rather than intraday, risk. Escalated counseling, including real-time monitoring, for non-Fedwire-caused daylight overdrafts may be of limited usefulness in reducing these overdrafts. In addition, most of the daylight overdrafts caused by implementation of the new posting rules would not result in the assessment of daylight overdraft charges, owing to the deductible permitted in computing such charges. Current alternatives available to a depository institution to address the situation where it routinely exceeds its daylight overdraft cap include: (1) filing for a ``self-assessment'' cap, (2) shifting funding patterns or delaying the origination of funds transfers, (3) selecting the ``fractional'' check posting option in order to begin receiving some check credits earlier than the single, float-weighted posting time, (4) having check debits posted to the account of a correspondent bank, or (5) transferring payment processing business to a private correspondent bank. It should be noted that filing for a self-assessment cap is an alternative available only to financially healthy institutions and presents an increased administrative burden to these institutions. In addition, many of the small institutions adversely affected by the posting rules have a limited amount of Fedwire funds transfer activity. Thus adjustments to such Fedwire activity may have a minimal impact on such institutions' level of daylight overdrafts. Similarly, a correspondent bank may be unable to provide funding to respondents earlier in the day without adversely affecting its own daylight overdraft position. Alternatives The Board considered three alternatives to address cap breaches attributable to the changes in the intraday posting rules for non-Fedwire activity: (1) increasing the size of the multiples associated with daylight overdraft net debit caps, (2) adopting, on a permanent basis, counseling flexibility for daylight overdrafts caused by non-Fedwire activity, or (3) changing the posting rules. Each of these alternatives is discussed below. Caps The Board analyzed various scenarios to determine whether the level of exempt-from-filing or de minimis cap categories could be increased without materially increasing risk to Reserve Banks. An increase in the exempt-from-filing daylight overdraft cap category would require no action on the part of a depository institution, with a potentially substantial percentage increase in intraday credit to be granted to that depository institution by the Federal Reserve. The Board believes that any increase in the size of caps, without a self-assessment, should be made in the de minimis cap, which requires the filing of a board of directors' resolution. This approach will ensure that senior bank management and directors are aware of the potential amount of credit that may be obtained by the depository institution from the Federal Reserve during the day.
