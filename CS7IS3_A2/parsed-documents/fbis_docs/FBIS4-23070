Sapritskiy; UDC 621.383.3] [Abstract] This article describes a method of monitoring the linearity of opto-electronic channels used in superweak electromagnetic field reception systems operating in photon count mode. The method is based on control sources of radiation with known (Poisson) photon statistics and comparison with the photon count statistics at the channel output. This method was used in absolute measurement of the quantum efficiency of photoreceptors using spontaneous parametric scattering. The advantage of this method is the simplicity of the equipment. A simple comparison method is visual comparison of histograms. An algorithm is developed to improve upon the comparison. This method is suitable for the measurement of the limits of linearity of opto-electronic channels and operational monitoring. Figures 2; references 4 (Russian).
