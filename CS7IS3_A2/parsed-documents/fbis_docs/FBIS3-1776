The five-tongue programs take up eight hours a day. They include the languages of the Dai nationality in Dehong Prefecture and Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Jingpo nationality, Lahu nationality and Lisu nationality. Yunnan Province has 25 minority nationalities, with 12.34 million people, accounting for one third of the total population. Since the 1970s, the minority nationalities in Yunnan Province have come to realize the connection between raising the quality of life and carrying out family planning policies. According to the fourth national census in 1990, in the eight years from 1982 to 1990, the growth rate of the minority nationalities in the country was 34.8 percent, but the rate in Yunnan Province was about 19.6 percent. Dong Xiuying, a chief editor at the Department of Minority Nationalities of Yunnan broadcasting station, who is herself from the minority Va nationality, said that many of the ethnic people do not understand the Han language and it was necessary to start broadcasting these programs in their own languages. There are eight autonomous prefectures of minority nationalities in Yunnan. The broadcasting stations in four of the prefectures, including Dehong, Xishuangbanna, Nujiang and Diqing, also started ethnic language programs.
