Provincial party Secretary Li Changchun and Governor Ma Zhongchen made important speeches at the meeting. While analyzing the economic situation in our province, Ma Zhongchen said: At present, economic operations in our province are normal, and the situation is stable as a whole. Various kinds of reforms are progressing smoothly. In particular, although we have encountered enormous difficulties in implementing a new tax system and a reform plan for the purchasing and selling prices of grain, sharp fluctuations have been avoided. The masses have made a good response to this. Judging from our economic operations, our rural economy has been developing in a all-round way. There is a fairly good harvest of summer grain. Our industrial production has been developing in a sustained and rapid manner. From January to May this year, industrial production output value at and above the township level was 21 percent higher than in the same period last year. This margin of increase was 1.97 percentage points higher than the average national level. Sales value increased by 21 percent, and the production and marketing rate was 24 percent. At the end of last May, various kinds of deposit amounts in various financial organs throughout the province were 15.7 billion yuan more than in same period last year. Local financial revenues of the whole province were 25.5 percent higher than in the same period last year. Urban and rural retail markets throughout the province were prosperous and brisk, and supplies of consumer goods were ample. There was brisk buying and selling. From January to May, incomes in foreign exchange through foreign trade reached $80 million, an increase of 28.5 percent over the same period last year. Ma Zhongchen pointed out: In the course of reform and opening up, we also have faced new situations and new problems, which have been reflected mainly in tight finances. Many localities are unable to pay wages to cadres and workers on schedule. The margin of price increases on the markets is too high. The number of liquidated enterprises, and enterprises that suspended production, or are operating below capacity has increased. At the end of last May, the accumulated profits of industrial enterprise covered by budgets were 26.5 percent lower than in the same period last year. Forty key enterprises -- including Angang, Xinfei, Pinglian, Luoguo and others -- have still increased their profits. However, the majority of industrial enterprises have made deficits. Of the six major industries -- including metallurgy, machinery, the chemical and textile industries, building materials, and light industry -- the profits of five industries have dropped, with the exception of metallurgy. Of the 17 cities and prefectures, only the city of Pingdingshan and Zhoukou Prefecture have increased their profits. Ma Zhongchen stressed: The losses of industrial enterprises covered by budgets have increased. The key reason for this is that our enterprises have been slow in transforming their operational mechanisms, that their capability in conforming with the market demand is weak, and that their product mix has not yet been adjusted properly. They have lacked the capability to conform with market demand. Another important reason for this is that leading bodies in enterprises have failed to work in a coordinated way, and their internal management has been chaotic. If we fail to solve these problems, the general situation of reform, development and stability will be directly affected. We must on no account treat them lightly. Ma Zhongchen added: The present focus of our work should be on further deepening enterprise reform, transforming enterprise operational mechanisms, and firmly grasping deficit-ridden enterprises' work to turn from deficits to profits. We must vigorously promote preproduction structural reform. In the future, we must take the shareholding system and the shareholding cooperative system as an emphasis of preproduction structural reform. We must take active measures to conduct experimental work and speed up development. In the meantime, in the course of development, we must not forget standardization and improvement. We must fully vest our enterprises with decisionmaking powers. Various cities, prefectures, and departments must delegate their power on hand as early as possible. [words indistinct] Various enterprises must vigorously carry out the activities of grasping the changes in their operational mechanisms, improving management, and enhancing their capability and efficiency. They must devote their main efforts to improving their product quality and upgrading their products. Relevant departments must actively guide deficit-making enterprises to adjust their product mix according to market demand so as to actively manufacture new products, products in short supply, and marketable products. They also must manufacture products that require high technology, as well as new, profit-making products that require low investment. We must support them in terms of funds, techniques, and management. [passage omitted including indistinct portion] In conclusion, Ma Zhongchen emphasized: Various departments and units must further change their administrative functions, energetically encourage the practice of conducting investigations and studies, and help enterprises and grass-roots levels truly solve practical difficulties and problems through investigation and study. He hoped that they would unite as one to struggle hard to fight the battle of turning from deficits to profits. At the meeting, (Cui Chenggong), deputy secretary general of the provincial party committee and director of the policy study institute, read several opinions of the provincial party committee and government on turning enterprises' deficits to profits. Leading comrades who attended the meeting included Ren Keli, Zheng Zengmao, Zhang Deguang, (Ma Jianzhang), Zhong Lisheng, Zhang Shiying, Zhang Honghua, Yu Jiahua, Zhu Shuquan, and others.
