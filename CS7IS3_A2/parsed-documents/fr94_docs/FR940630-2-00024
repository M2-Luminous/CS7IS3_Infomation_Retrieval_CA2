FR940630-2-00024 FR940630-2-00023 [Docket No. RP91&hyph;41&hyph;025] Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation; Refund Report June 24, 1994. Take notice that on June 17, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) filed a refund report advising the Commission that on April 21, 1994, Columbia made lump sum refunds in the amount of $138,521,816 to disburse refunds received after Columbia filed for bankruptcy. Columbia states that it made refunds in the amount of $135,526,272 pursuant to an April 14, 1994 order in Docket No. RP91&hyph;41&hyph;021. The April 14 order accepted Columbia's March 18, 1994 filing to reinstate its implementation of Order No. 528 and make certain refunds in accordance with an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated March 15, 1994. Columbia reports that it also refunded (1) $476,956 to its customers for amounts owed for transportation refunds received from upstream suppliers after Columbia filed for bankruptcy, related to the period April 1, 1987 through March 31, 1990, and (2) $2,535,954 for refunds paid by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation to Columbia after Columbia filed for bankruptcy, which as a result of the merger of Commonwealth Gas Pipeline Corporation and Columbia, Columbia refunded to the former customers of Commonwealth. After it paid the refunds on April 21, Columbia states it discovered that the transportation refunds of $476,956 included $457,460 that Columbia had received from Texas Eastern and Texas Gas that related to Columbia's capacity allocation program. These refunds were for a time period when Columbia had released its capacity on these two pipelines to other shippers. Therefore, Columbia believes it should have refunded the $457,460 only to shippers to whom the capacity was assigned. On May 6, 1994, Columbia refunded $458,512.87 ($457,460 plus $1,052.87 for interest from April 21 through May 5) to the shippers to whom the capacity was assigned. Columbia states that it will bill other customers $457,460 in its May invoices to recover the amounts refunded in error. Because Columbia's refunds to customers were being disputed in Columbia's bankruptcy, Columbia had deposited all prebankruptcy petition period refunds in a restricted investment arrangement (RIA), as authorized by the Bankruptcy Court and the Commission. Columbia states that it calculated the interest to be refunded based on the interest it actually earned in the RIA. It notes that it has petitioned the Commission in Docket No. GP94&hyph;2&hyph;000, seeking to pay customers the interest actually earned in RIA rather than the interest otherwise required by the Commission's regulations. Columbia recognizes that its flowthrough of refunds here is subject to the Commission's final decision on the petition. Columbia states that it has mailed a copy of its refund report to interested state Commissions and, to each jurisdictional customer, a copy of the refund schedule showing the refund amount by issue. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules and Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July 1, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
