Almaty ratified the START-I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol back in July last year, but delayed its joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty for a long time, he said. "Now this problem has been resolved, which laid the foundations for stepping up the talks between Russia and Kazakhstan, including negotiations on cooperation in the military area," the diplomat said. Another senior Foreign Ministry official, who is also responsible for Russia's relations with Kazakhstan, told INTERFAX that Kazakhstan's joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the U.S. Vice President Albert Gore's visit to Almaty were not coincidental. "The fact that the U.S.A. allocates money for nuclear disarmament in Kazakhstan evidently influenced the step taken by the Kazakh leadership," he said. He also said that the success scored at the parliamentary elections in Russia by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party "may somewhat complicate relations between Russia and Kazakhstan." "Zhirinovsky's territorial and other claims on Almaty are known well enough," he concluded.
