A. Bakunin, chairman of the Oblast Committee on Ecology and Rational Use of Nature, by M. Fonotov; place and date not given: ``Ecology of Decline''] [Text] Fonotov: Vasiliy Aleksandrovich, in line with established tradition we must make our fourth summary of the ecological year, this time for 1993. In order to start a fire it is necessary to toss in some statistical firewood. Please give us some figures for last year. Let us start with the atmosphere. Is the air we breathe cleaner? Are discharges into the air basin of industrial enterprises decreasing? Please. Bakunin: I will cite some figures not just for last year, but for the five-year period--our committee was created five years ago. Thus, in 1993 discharges from stationary sources went down 13.9 percent, or by 256,000 tonnes. That is the highest index in recent years. Here are more details: Some 2,624,000 tonnes of harmful substances were discharged into the atmosphere in 1988, whereas in 1993 it was 1,883,000 tonnes. Over five years the decrease amounted to 741,000 tonnes. Fonotov: That is almost as much as was discharged five years ago by Magnitogorsk. This is impressive! But let us return to 1993. Interpret the discharges in that year. Bakunin: The following picture appears. Out of 256,000 tonnes--that was the decrease in discharges last year, only 40 percent was accounted for by implementation of measures for the protection of nature. Fonotov: What about the rest? Bakunin: The other 60 percent was accounted for by curtailment of production. Fonotov: For example? Bakunin: For example, Magnitogorsk, which was mentioned. Last year enterprises in the city discharged 434,000 tonnes into the atmosphere. If one recalls, it used to be 856,000 tonnes. The Sintering Plant No 1, Open-Hearth Shop No 3, and open-hearth furnaces No. 3, 5, 30, and 31, as well as blast furnace No. 3 along with the coke furnace batteries, and other facilities were closed down. Fonotov: What about Chelyabinsk? Bakunin: The decrease in discharges in Chelyabinsk last year was limited. Just 49,000 tonnes. Only 4,600 tonnes of which was accounted for by measures for the protection of the air. The rest also resulted from a cutback in production Fonotov: The notorious ESPTs-1 [Electronic Steel Smelting Shop-1] at the metallurgical combine has finally been stopped. Bakunin: Yes. It was mothballed as of 15 February of this year. Fonotov: What does mothballing mean? Bakunin: It means that operation was halted but the equipment was not removed. What happens with the shop in the future is up to the combine. Fonotov: How about the workers? Bakunin: The workers were transferred to other sectors, but apparently even the ChMK [Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Combine] will not be able to avoid manpower cuts. Fonotov: Something else has closed in Chelyabinsk? Bakunin: Of course. Some of the equipment at the ChEMK [Chelyabinsk Electrometallurgical Combine], the tube rolling-plant, the Stankomash, the abrasives combine, the Kolyushchenko Plant, and elsewhere has been taken out of operation. At the same time emissions increased at the TETs-1 [Heat and Power Plant] and TETs-2 as natural gas is replaced with coal. The consumption of gas also went down in the city as a whole because of production cuts. That is why the city and oblast administration appealed to the government with a request to increase the delivery of gas to the power engineers, but Moscow is yet to respond. Fonotov: Can you also name some other cities? Bakunin: I can. The Troitsk GRES [State Regional Electric Power Station] diminished discharges by 63,000 tonnes, but unfortunately, also through a decline in the generation of electric power. The volume of emissions decreased in Satka and a number of other cities. Fonotov: What about Karabash? Bakunin: Karabash decreased its discharge tenfold last year and even more now. In essence that combine has been stopped. The city was left with no work to do. Fonotov: About the ecology of 1993 it will probably be possible to say that this was the ecology of production cutbacks. The closing down of furnaces, shops, and entire plants, of course, promoted a healthier environment. At one time, however, we were not counting on that kind of ``success.'' You must remember, of course, how strongly Chelyabinsk workers demanded the closing of the ESPTs-1 at ChMK. So many angry words were spoken, so many accusatory petitions were compiled! The ESPTs-1 is now closed but no rejoicing because of that is heard. The decrease in production blunted the problem of ecology but did not eliminate it, merely postponing it. The best solution probably lies in the replacement of old manufacturing methods with new ones. Vasiliy Alkesandrovich, how do you and your committee view the idea supporting a revival of Karabash as proposed by the Klyuch Joint-Stock Company? Bakunin: It is a good idea. We reviewed the proposed manufacturing methods and approved them. They are suitable not only for Karabash but for all of the other metallurgical centers which have accumulated mountains of waste products. But there are no funds. It would seem that only limited funds are needed to start but even that is not available. The oblast administration and the oblast ecological fund appropriated some money but without government help such a project is apparently impossible. Fonotov: I want to ask you about another ``famous'' facility--the ESPTs-6 at the ChMK. As we all know the construction of that shop was received by city residents in a rather ambiguous manner. Then interest in it vanished. What is its fate? Is it being built or was it ``frozen?'' Bakunin: The working committee accepted ESPTs-6. In the immediate future the facility should be accepted by the state commission. In other words, the shop is ready. However it is difficult to predict its fate under the new conditions. It is apparently a complex situation. Fonotov: Last year only a few scrubbers, filters, and other installations for the protection of the environment were built. That is understandable. The economy is concerned with other matters. Does this mean that ecology will be of secondary concern this year as well? Bakunin: In the course of the year it was necessary to carry out 41 measures. We are speaking about such cities as Plast, Verkhnii Ufaley, Vishnevogorsk, Satka, and Bakval. Fonotov: And in Chelyabinsk? Bakunin: In Chelyabinsk practically nothing was completed. It is sufficient to say that a gas scrubber for ESPTs-3 furnaces has been under construction for many years at the ChMK. The reason for that is a lack of funds. Fonotov: But it is said that enterprises are paying a lot for polluting the environment? Bakunin: That depends on the viewpoint. What does ``a lot'' mean? The standards were introduced in 1991, before August 1993 they were merely doubled. This year it is expected that they will be increased tenfold. During that period, however, the cost of production went up by a factor of over a thousand. Last year enterprises paid around two billion rubles into the oblast ecological fund. A fourth of that was transferred by us into the federal fund. About another three billion rubles went into city and rayon funds. Judge for yourself whether that is a lot or not. We spent over a billion rubles on the financing of facilities for the protection of the environment. The rest was spent on scientific research work and ecological propaganda. We helped the agricultural engineering and state universities establish departments of ecology. Fonotov: The enterprises, however, are idle and it is awkward to pressure them. Bakunin: It is, nevertheless, necessary to apply pressure, of course, when there is a real possibility of decreasing harmful emissions. If we did not pressure and fine managers the results would be different. Fonotov: Now another traditional question about monitoring. I am talking about an automatic air quality monitoring system in Chelyabinsk and other cities. Is there any progress? Bakunin: There is. The first monitoring station is located on our committee building--the sensor is on the roof of the building. Hourly monitoring of radiation is carried out. We also receive data on radiation conditions at Chelyabinsk-65 and in Kyshtym. Kaslinsk, Kunashaksk, and Argayashsk rayons are next. Furthermore, the administration of Chelyabinsk established three chemical air-quality monitoring stations at the expense of its ecological fund. They are now being adjusted and calibrated. As commonly known this work is being done by the KBM [Miass Design Bureau] of the city of Miass. Fonotov: We have said something about the air. It is necessary to mention the water as well. Bakunin: Work on purification of wastewater has not stopped but is being carried out with a lag in the fulfillment of the program. A circulating system was created at the Ashinskiy Wood-Chemical Plant. The intake of water from the Sim River was decreased. A circulating water supply system is under construction at the Kyshtym Machinery Plant. Reconstruction of purification structures at Kartaly has been delayed. Afterpurification structures on the right bank at Magnitogorsk have not been completed. It is time to place into operation purification facilities at the settlement of Fershamlenhuaz, at the Kragayskiy Bor rest home. There is only one reason which is a lack of money. Nevertheless we shall strive for the introduction of those facilities in 1994. Fonotov: How did we protect the forests last year? Bakunin: We are devoting every effort in order to preserve forest resources because the forest in the Ural is not only raw material but first of all, pure air and clean water. Five years ago 2,200,000 cubic meters of timber were felled, while last year it was 1,500,000 cubic meters. We achieved such a decrease in felling through the creation of water reservoir and river forest shelter belts for water conservation. Two national parks, the Taganay and Zyuratkul parks, were opened with our cooperation. In addition to that, on the basis of our order the Yekaterinburg Forestry Institute studied the question concerning optimal age for coniferous forest clearing. It turned out that pine trees in the Ural should be felled starting with their 121st year, and not 20 years earlier. All that made it possible to substantially decrease felling and preserve the most valuable forests in the mountainous portion of our oblast. Fonotov: You mentioned new national parks. How is their development progressing? Bakunin: The directorate of the Taganay Park has started functioning. The decision regarding opening of the Zyuratkul Park was adopted at the end of last year but no funds have been allocated thus far. Initially our ecological fund allocated eight million rubles. One must hope that this year the forestry committee will initiate the financing of Zyuratkul Park. Fonotov: Contradictory reports have appeared in the newspapers that the Ilmensk Preserve and the institute of mineralogy are being merged. What is the position of the committee with respect to that matter? Bakunin: This is a sore subject. The thing is that the Ilmensk Preserve has always been a preserve and was never renamed while the Ural Branch of the Academy of Sciences decided to create the Ilmensk Preserve Scientific Association. In doing so it committed a number of legal blunders. By registering the association the administration of the city of Miass deprived the Ilmensk Preserve of its status as a preserve. Now it is an association governed by its own laws. The danger is that we might lose the Ilmensk Preserve. Fonotov: So the dispute boils down to some finer points of the law? Bakunin: Yes, but these are very important points. The issue was discussed at various levels a number of times but no final solution has been found. As far as I know the legal service of the oblast administration plans to appeal for arbitration requesting repeal of the decision of the Miass administration. On its part our committee has appealed to the Ministry for Environmental Protection with a request to ``accept'' the Ilmensk Preserve into its agency. We proceeded from the fact that out of the 47 preserves in Russia, 41 are under the jurisdiction of our ministry. In other words the Academy of Sciences had no right to reorganize the preserve. That can be done only by the government. Fonotov: As I understand it neither side wishes to harm the preserve and, quite on the contrary, all are concerned for its well-being--why the conflict? Bakunin: It is necessary to be very cautious with respect to this issue in order to avoid a mistake. The bylaws of the scientific association states that taxes on entrepreneurial activity will go into the budget of Miass. But what sort of entrepreneurial activity is that if preserves are not permitted to engage in it? At the same time there is some information that there is already trade in stones. Plans are being made for the building of ski runs and for construction of some kind of a laboratory with 25 residents, without our knowledge, on Miassovo Lake. Fonotov: If the government refuses to maintain the preserve perhaps it should make some effort on its own in order to survive? Bakunin: That is what we are telling the scientists--if you do not have the money to maintain the preserve, transfer it to our ministry. Fonotov: It appears that the preserve might be lost because of the word ``association.'' Bakunin: Exactly. The preserve belongs to the government and cannot be privatized. At the same time an association can be privatized and it could be, for instance, a joint-stock company. At any rate, the question concerning the preserve must be resolved by the government. Fonotov: Our conversation is coming to an end. It is possible to think that the public has lost interest in ecology. Is that good or bad? Bakunin: Of course that is bad. In former years the public raised and helped to resolve many questions dealing with protection of the environment. That is not the case any longer. Everyone is concerned with day-to-day worries and does not look too far ahead. Our committee, however, will continue to work on improving the environment. Particularly since in the difficult time of reforms the tendency toward its improvement is preserved. Revival of the economy, in turn, will create conditions for renovation of equipment and assimilation of modern ecologically clean manufacturing methods.
