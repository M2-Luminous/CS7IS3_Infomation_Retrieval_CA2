Could such a thing be acceptable to Israel? [Beilin] Look, I cannot get into detail. Someone has taken something out of context or made something up. There will be many such reports. I think that what is important is that U.S. shuttle diplomacy is working and I very much hope that it will continue at an accelerated pace. If it does not continue I see no possibility of reaching an agreement because the Syrians refuse to hold Oslo or Camp David style talks with us. If things continue at the present pace, then I believe agreement is possible and then all these details will be explained in the course of negotiations. [Ben-Menahem] But there are five Syrian conditions. What is Israel's reaction to these conditions? [Beilin] Look, I do not want to discuss the actual negotiations. Although everything is very public, it is very important to keep the details secret because negotiations become impossible once everything becomes public. The five conditions published in AL-HAYAH apparently are not really Syria's conditions, and I would not like to juxtapose Israel's stands against some newspaper leak -- whether accurate or not -- of the Syrian position. [Ben-Menahem] Why hold these shuttle trips? Why not establish a secret negotiating track as we did in Oslo? [Beilin] Because the Syrians refuse to do so. That is the only reason. I think that if one wants to hold serious negotiations it is very important to keep things secret. Then you do not have media or psychological pressures on either side. Nor must one point to a breakthrough in every single round of talks. To my great regret, the Syrians refuse to make such a move. If I had to choose between not holding negotiations at all or having these shuttle missions by U.S. officials in parallel with the bilateral negotiations in Washington, then I think we have to accept the continuation of U.S. diplomacy. [Ganor] You keep stressing the U.S. role, especially that of the secretary of state in these shuttle missions. What should Warren Christopher do now in order to put the Syrian-Israeli negotiations on a more practical track? [Beilin] This decision is a matter of great importance. Out of more than 70 international conflicts, this is one with a better chance for resolution. He should be here more often, he should travel between Damascus and Jerusalem. If this is done, I am sure that we shall reach a solution because, in my opinion, the major problems have already been resolved now that the Syrians have finally expressed their readiness to talk about peace with Israel and Israel is finally prepared after quite a few years to speak of withdrawal with regard to the Golan Heights. [Ganor] Do you expect the secretary of state to visit the region more frequently? [Beilin] I would very much hope that these visits not always come at the tail end of other visits. In other words, as some kind of way to cap other visits to Europe or Turkey. I think it is important that the Americans consider this a central foreign policy issue. Something they can start work on and resolve. [Ben-Menahem] There were reports this week that Christopher applied some sort of pressure on Syrian President al-Asad. Do you really think the Americans can pressure Syria in a way that can accelerate the process? [Beilin] Look, the question is how you define pressure. According to the reports and I have received no confirmation of them -- he simply told the Syrians that if they could not answer his questions he would wash his hands of the matter. The only U.S. pressure I can discern here is a lack of involvement in the process. They did not threaten to stop helping some party or to harm someone else. I do not particularly believe in this theory of U.S. pressure. In Oslo, we proved that we could reach a very interesting and far-reaching agreement without any U.S. involvement, and I also think there is no need for any U.S. pressure either on Syria or on Israel. I think that what is needed is for the United States to devote time to this issue, because without the Americans there will be no peace with Syria. [passage omitted] [Ben-Menahem] Mr. Beilin, you have voiced great expectations from Christopher's shuttle missions. Do you still believe that peace with Syria is attainable in 1994? [Beilin] It all depends on the rate of progress. If things are accelerated, many rounds of talks will be held, and we will be able to exchange views with the Syrians. Then I think that peace will be achievable in 1994. If, on the other hand, the meetings and visits by U.S. officials come every two months then we can simply forget about it. [Ganor] What must first happen in order to realize your more optimistic assessment? [Beilin] What I am saying is quite simple and based on my own personal experience from the talks with the Jordanians and Palestinians six, seven, and eight years ago. When the negotiations were not direct but rather conducted through the Americans we were totally dependent on their tempo. When the Americans could afford to devote a lot of time to the politics of the region, things made very rapid progress. If you recall, there were the 10 points with Jordan in 1986 and other things that the Americans -- at the time Richard Murphy was especially involved in the political process -- pushed very quickly. Whenever they were forced to devote their attention to other matters, the peace process ground to a halt. I must admit that there is an unpleasant dependency on the United States. We must fight for an important place on the U.S. agenda. The more time Washington devotes to the Middle East, the greater the chances of peace. [Ganor] Nevertheless, Mr. Beilin, if Jerusalem declares that it is prepared to withdraw from the Golan Heights, then progress can be made, at least from the Syrian point of view. [Beilin] First of all, I am not sure. I do not know. Do you believe we will rapidly establish peace if we make such a declaration tomorrow? I would not bet on it. So far, I have found some elements of Syria's policy quite baffling. The fact is that up to this very moment, Syria has not fully detailed its concept of the nature of peace and whether it includes diplomatic and economic relations, open borders, and so forth. I, however, do not believe we shall issue such a declaration. Our declaration that the depth of withdrawal on the Golan Heights will correspond to the depth of peace with Syria is the most far-reaching and comprehensive statement that Israel can make before launching negotiations. I am not proposing that Syria and Israel accept the other party's position before the negotiations start. [Ganor] But you are not ruling out the possibility that Jerusalem may declare its readiness to relinquish the Golan Heights in the course of the negotiations? [Beilin] I hope this will not be the case. I hope we can reach an arrangement with Syria while giving up as little as possible of the Golan Heights. At any rate, whatever agreement is eventually reached will have to be brought before the people in a national referendum and the people will decide whether they are willing to pay the price for peace with Syria, which by definition will not be an easy one, or actually to pay the price for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East because currently the Syrians are the most problematic element in the Arab world vis a vis Israel. An agreement with them means diplomatic relations with Lebanon, Jordan, the Gulf states and most of the Maghreb countries. [passage omitted]
