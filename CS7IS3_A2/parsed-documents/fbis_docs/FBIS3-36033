This would provide a basis for surmounting the present economic crisis in Moldova, Snegur told U.S. Congress expert Sergio Verona in Chisinau on Monday. But Moldova would join no political or military CIS treaties, for it wanted to remain "genuinely neutral," he said. Going over to the problem of Transdniestria, Snegur said the leaders of the mainly Russian-speaking enclave refused to start a dialogue with the Moldovan government, since the latter rejected their idea of confederative structure for Moldova. Commenting on Moldova's relations with Romania, Snegur said those advocating unification between Moldova and Romania "thereby put up obstacles to the economic and cultural mutual integration of the two states."
