The meeting, which was also attended by Consul Generals and Consuls designate, ended on 26 March. We feel that the working meeting is an important event because it was held at the time when the Indonesian people and nation are about to enter into the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, which marks the beginning of the Second 25-Year Long Term Development Master Plan (PJP II) effective 1 April 1994. The event is also relevant to our national development and the fast-changing global political map now or in the future. Over the past several weeks, Indonesia's political policy had been viewed and criticized by several local observers of international politics. They consider Indonesia's international relations to be rather passive in determining an approriate course of action to keep pace with the fast-changing global political climate, which is becoming more complex. The current trend of international relations has expanded to include various concerns and activities that cover all divisions in the Foreign Department and which can transform it into an executive branch. The time has come for the Indonesia's Foreign Department and its diplomatic representatives abroad to change their image to suit new global needs and changes that give priority to economic interests [preceding two words in English] and all issues related to it. As a consequence of this meeting, our diplomats abroad will now realize that they have to be knowledgeable in national politics and be a "spokesmen" on issues relating to the economy, development, trade, privatization, capital investment, and other matters to tactfully "sell" Indonesia to countries they are accredited to. Indonesian diplomats should be able to act as traders who can "sell" Indonesian products abroad and act as guides who can show their way around Indonesia to boost tourism and promote investment, or they can act as "shields" to smash negative reports on Indonesia. In line with the current level of national development, the government's effort to eradicate poverty, and improvement to the people's welfare, our diplomats abroad are no longer required to merely attend formal functions and receptions for diplomats. It has been mandated in the 1993 Broad Outline of State Policies that the ability to anticipate and comply with the unpredictable changes of a new world order should be stepped up through an appropriate diplomatic approach for the sake of national interest. We hope that the meeting between senior officials of the Foreign Department and the heads of Indonesian missions abroad will not be a routine session or just an activity held once every five years. It should be a meeting that will really bring about plans in anticipation of current and future global changes. We also hope that the meeting would adopt relevant and practical decisions to cater to national development in the wake of the take-off period for the implementation of the PJP II. In his keynote address at a similar meeting several years ago, President Suharto called on all Indonesian envoys to carry out the nation's "diplomatic struggle" when executing their duties abroad. In this context, the term " diplomatic struggle" has a wide-ranging interpretation. It is aimed at protecting national interest, as well finding ways to create a new world order based on sovereignty, peace, and justice. In view of this, Indonesia's efforts to achieve the goal would make its position as the current chairman of the Nonaligned Movement, NAM, more significant. The NAM chairmanship is not merely an honorary post or a symbol of confidence given to Indonesia. It is more a challenge that requires strong backing, especially from the NAM-member countries. Thus, the Republic of Indonesia is not isolated. It is supported by hundreds of countries that need to benefit from the "diplomatic struggle" carried out by its diplomats wherever they are accredited to.
