FR940919-1-00018 FR940919-1-00008 40 CFR Part 52 [IN 12&hyph;3&hyph;5958B; FRL&hyph;5071&hyph;8] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Indiana AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve an April 18, 1994 State request for a site-specific revision to the Indiana sulfur dioxide State Implementation Plan (SO 2 SIP). This revision sets forth a schedule of SO 2 emission limitations applicable to Public Service Indiana's Gibson Generating Station (PSI Gibson) if the facility installs SO2 emission controls. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested in commenting on this notice should do so at this time. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be mailed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Copies of the State submittal and USEPA's analysis of it are available for inspection at: Air and Radiation Division, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Onischak, Environmental Engineer, Regulation Development Branch, (AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 353&hyph;5954. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: For additional information see the direct final rule published in the rules section of this Federal Register . Dated: September 2, 1994. David A.
