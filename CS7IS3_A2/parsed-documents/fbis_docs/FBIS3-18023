The EU would then assume full responsibility for foreign policy, Common Foreign and Security Policy [CFSP], and relations with NATO. In his report, Mr. Karel De Gucht, (Belgian EP member [MEP] representing the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] -- BELGA editor's note) advocates the gradual establishment of a single, coherent institutional framework for the EU's CFSP. According to the rapporteur, the establishment of such a framework implies the increased use of a majority vote regarding CFSP, the exercising of democratic control by the EP, and an enhanced role for the European Commission. To this end, the report suggested that the institutions of the EU and the WEU should gradually define their relations in specific terms, and merge at the practical level, notably by organizing simultaneous meetings between the Council of the EU and the Assembly of the WEU, as well as between the European Commission and the General Secretariat of the WEU. In the final phase, the EU should completely absorb the WEU and assume full responsibility for foreign policy, security, and defense, as well as for relations with NATO, indicated the report. After having completed the final phase, in the event of "serious difficulties," Mr. De Gucht foresees the possibility of member states not participating in certain decisions made by the Council or in their implementation. This final phase could be completed as of 1996, the year of the next intergovernmental conference of the EU which could decide purely and simply to "incorporate" the WEU on the basis of the future CFSP. Furthermore, the treaty founding the WEU, signed in 1948, will expire in 1998. Regarding relations between the European Union and NATO, Mr. De Gucht believes that the WEU must continue to strengthen its operational capabilities so as to be able to act independently of NATO "in the long term," even if he recommends that the Allies and the Atlantic Alliance should "consult" each other first. He also advocates the "sharing of tasks" by the WEU and NATO, as well as the definition of various kinds of action. Moreover, he envisions a future "adaptation" of the North Atlantic Treaty, or the signature of a new treaty between the United States and the EU "which better reflects the new egalitarian relations established on both sides of the Atlantic."
