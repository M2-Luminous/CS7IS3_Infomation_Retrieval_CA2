While the fuselage is being developed under the cooperation of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy Industries, Kawasaki's plays the biggest role as the prime controller. It is in charge of developing about 70% of the fuselage including the front fuselage and the rotor. The total sale of Kawasaki's Aerospace Division in FY92 was about ¥230 billion. The total sale in FY93 is expected to reduce to about ¥190 billion, because, among other things, the number of P3C antisubmarine patrol planes they produce as the prime contractor has been reduced. Furthermore, it looks like their business will be affected in the future by the budget cut of the Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program introduced at the end of last year. That being the case, their expectation for OHX is flying high. If we assume that OHX will be deployed in a similar scale as OH6, it means a project of about 180 helicopters, amounting to a figure over ¥100 billion. It is certain that it will be a stable source of income for Kawasaki, while the defense spending is declining across the board. An informed source at the Defense Agency points out that, "it is the Defense Agency's intention to seek an effective use of the limited budget in accordance with the sharing of responsibilities such that fighters are to be built by Mitsubishi, and helicopters by Kawasaki." A main pillar of the commercial business to compensate for the reduction of orders from the Defense Agency is the production sharing plan of the new commercial jet, Boeing 777. Unfortunately, due to the poor business conditions the airlines are experiencing, the production is still at the pace of one a month. It is expected to take at least two more years to reach the production pace of three to four planes a month. The helicopter business is an ace of the commercial market as well. The attention-getter here is BK117, a commercial helicopter, which was developed by Kawasaki in cooperation with Deutsche Aerospace of Germany and Aerospatiale of France. Although the incoming order level has dropped since the bubble bursting of the economy, "there is yet a strong demand potential at various central government branches and local governments," says Nobuhiko Tatebe, Director and Assistant General Manager of Aerospace Division. One such potential is the use of helicopters for the Emergency Medical Service (EMS). It is the transport service for rescuing patients from remote islands and mountain areas. Although they have not sold any helicopters for this application due to the pending legal issues and the lack of infrastructures, they will appeal to the public and authorities through demonstrations using actual helicopters. The company's effort on R&D is also strong. They developed for the first time in Japan the fly-by-wire (FBW) technology for the helicopter to replace the hydraulic system hitherto used. In this system, in place of a regular stick, a small stick is used and the delicate movement of the fuselage is detected by sensors. The computer will understand the pilot's intention, and sends signal to the control device of the rotor. The system is currently tested on an actual helicopter. Some of these cutting-edge technologies have already been applied to practical uses. One example is the OPS navigation system which determines the location of the helicopter based on the data received from satellites. "It automatically displays the altitude and the height of an obstructing object on the ground to enhance flight safety," says Mr. Tatebe with a pride. Some of the executives of the heavy industry here have voiced an opinion that, "there is no base for the aircraft industry to grow in Japan." On the other hand, Ryozo Tsutsui, Executive Director of Kawasaki (formerly Director General of the Technical Research and Development Institute of the Defense Agency), predicts that, "the currency of the 21st century is technology." What he means is that the technology of a nation or a company will be the key factor that determines the negotiation power of said nation or company. It is safe to say that the helicopter is the lifeline for Kawasaki for maintaining its basic aircraft manufacturing technology.
