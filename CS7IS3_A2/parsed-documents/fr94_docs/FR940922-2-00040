FR940922-2-00040 FR940922-2-00017 Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center; Unsolicited Financial Assistance Award ACTION: Acceptance of an Unsolicited Proposal Application of a Grant Award with Lovelace Institution. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE) announces that pursuant to 10 CFR600.14, it intends to award financial assistance (grant) through the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center to The Lovelace Institute for a research effort entitled ``Velocity and Concentration Studies of Flowing Suspensions by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging.'' ADDRESSES: Department of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Division, P.O. Box 10940, MS 921&hyph;118, Pittsburgh, PA 15236. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Cynthia Y. Mitchell, Contract Specialist (412) 892&hyph;4862. Comments or inquiries should be submitted within 14 days of the date of this announcement. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Grant Number: DE&hyph;FG22&hyph;94PC94248. Title of Research Effort: ``Velocity and Concentration Studies of Flowing Suspensions by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging.'' Awardee: Lovelace Institute. Term of Assistance Effort: Thirty-six (36) months. Grant Estimated Total Value: $356,664. Objective: Based upon the authority of 10 CFR 600.14, the objective of this grant is for The Lovelace Institute to develop Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (NRMI) as a non-invasive technique to measure flow parameters for all components of multiphase flow. The Institute will also develop a method to measure velocity of the solid phase, in addition to the liquid phase, in concentrated suspension flow regardless of the sample opacity. Such studies will contribute to the understanding of solids transport via flows of suspensions. Ultimately, Lovelace institute will measure the velocity in nonsteady flows. The Institute has pioneered the application of NMRI to flows of concentrated suspensions. The Lovelace Institute will also apply the proposed concepts to more complex flow geometries. This project will provide non-intrusive data which will be relevant and useful in the scale-up and design of solids handling equipment, thereby providing cost savings. Since solids handling is part of almost all industrial energy production processes the public will benefit by cost savings from greater efficiencies derived from improved knowledge of solids handling processes. The project represents a unique and innovative idea which would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation, nor would a competitive solicitation be appropriate.
