He said: "Privately, I can accept any (compromise). The most important thing is to change the election system." In this way, he explained his view that the ruling coalition parties should try to have the political reform bills approved even at the risk of having to accept all the demands of the Liberal Democratic Party for revision of the bills. Moreover, regarding how the government should deal with the situation if the bills are scrapped, Hata said: "We should not create a (political) void because we have a pile of work to do. However, since the political reform bills are worth making an appeal to the confidence of the whole nation, I will not rule out any possibilities." In this way, he referred to the possibility of dissolving the lower house and holding a general election.
