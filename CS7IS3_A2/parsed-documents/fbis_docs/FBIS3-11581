In an "electoral communique" signed by CNTP Secretary General Luis Cobos R., the organization said it hopes that with this decision "we will achieve the return of the Torrijist forces to power to stimulate the process of national liberation." The workers' organization also voiced its support for Andres Vega Cedeno, also known as "Domplin," a radio commentator who is running for mayor of Panama City; and recommended that "the workers also vote for Felipe Cano, who is running for mayor of San Miguelito." As for the "candidates for 1994-1999 legislators," the CNTP recommends that "workers and popular movements support the candidates committed to our efforts and suggests the names of two candidates from the Papa Egoro Movement: Norma Cano in electoral circuit 8.6, and Rolando Miller in circuit 8.9, whom the workers describe as "great fighters." [quotation marks as published] The CNTP feels that Norma Cano is a "labor leader with vast experience," and that Rolando Miller is a union champion "who showed ability and honesty in the struggle against the neoliberal and persecution policies of the current regime."
