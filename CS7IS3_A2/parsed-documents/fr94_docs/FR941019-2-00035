On October 3, 1994, the Commission staff mailed the Ayers Island DEIS to the Environmental Protection Agency, resource and land management agencies, and interested organizations and individuals. This document evaluates the environmental consequences of continuing the operation and maintenance of the existing Ayers Island Hydroelectric Project, located on the Pemigewasset River in Belknap and Grafton Counties, New Hampshire. The applicant is not proposing any new development. However, it is proposing to modify the peaking operation between May 15th to August 31st and to implement new ramping rate schedules. The applicant estimates the average annual generation for this project would be 44.228 gigawatthours. The dam and existing project facilities are owned by the applicant. Project power would be utilized by the applicant for sale to its customers. The subject DEIS also evaluates the environmental effects of: implementing applicant's proposal supplemented with staff's recommended mitigative measures; and the no-action alternative (license denial). The public meeting, which will be recorded by an official stenographer, is scheduled on Wednesday, October 26, 1994, from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the Bristol Town Office Building, P.O.
