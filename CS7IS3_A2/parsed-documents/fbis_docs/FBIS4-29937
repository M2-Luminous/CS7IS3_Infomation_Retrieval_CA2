And he is planting the seeds to retake the reins of power. In an exclusive interview with the REVIEW, the king unveiled a detailed plan for a national unity government firmly under his control. He said he would give high positions to the Khmer Rouge so the faction would halt its guerilla war. But Sihanouk stressed that he would only assume power with the approval of parliament and the two leaders of the coalition government, especially Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose Cambodian People's Party (CPP) controls the bulk of the army, security forces and apparatus of state. Since it came to power through United Nations-sponsored elections in May 1993, "the current government has shown that it is not capable of stopping the process of deterioration of the situation," Sihanouk said during the three-hour interview on June 11 at his residence in Beijing, where he is being treated for cancer. "How can I avoid intervening in a few months' time or one year's time if the situation continues to deteriorate?" Sihanouk, 72, was elected king and head of state last year by parliament, but the role carries little real authority. "If I am not too weak physically, I will certainly say yes" to a request from parliament to assume real power, he said. "I have no plan to take power now," as the situation "is not desperate enough," Sihanouk said. "In case the situation becomes anarchic and desperate, I would have to take power for one or two years. I did it in 1952 and 1953 to put an end to the anarchy of the kingdom . . . so why not now before I die, the last mission?" Sihanouk's statements may tap a well-spring of popular discontent shared by a number of influential figures within Cambodia's government, military and parliament who are frustrated by their leaders' inability to achieve peace and stability following last year's elections. These figures, according to political sources, have been quietly campaigning for Sihanouk to assume more power to break the deadlock in peace talks with the Khmer Rouge. Both Hun Sen and First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the royalist Funcinpec party, refuse any political deal that would give the radical faction a role in government. The king recognised that neither Ranariddh nor Hun Sen would be eager to be replaced as premier. "I know that Mr. Hur Sen will be red in the face...when he will read your article," Sihanouk said. "He wil] say that 'we were absolutely wrong to elect Sihanouk as king, it is extremely bad, extremely dangerous, and now he wants to retake power and to take the Khmer Rouge again in his government. It will be a catastrophe.' Mr. Hun Sen will attack me very, very violently. I know that." Sihanouk acknowledged that his bid for power would be doomed without the acquiescence of Hun Sen and the CPP. "If he does not support me, it is useless for me to go back to Cambodia, because I do not want to shed blood to fight a secession led by Hun Sen," he said. "I cannot return to power to go back to Cambodia unless I have the assurance that Hun Sen and his party will join me in my government." "As far as Ranariddh is concerned, I am sure that my son will not betray me," the king continued. "He will accept certainly. Not with joy. With sadness, certainly. With anger, certainly. But he will, I am sure, not rebel." Ranariddh has argued for more time in power, saying results will be visible next year, Sihanouk said. "But there is another opinion among the people and the politicians. The other opinion is that if they allow this government to go on for one year, Cambodia will completely collapse -- not just the government but the country itself." Sihanouk said his plan for a new government was "very simple. I will be the head of the government. Not just the head of state, but the head of government. This means my own prime minister." The regime would have four vice-presidents: Ranariddh, Hun Sen, current Finance Minister Sam Rainsy and Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan. "My government can only be one of national unity with all parties," he said. "I will give important portfolios to the Khmer Rouge." Anticipating the objections of the two elected premiers, the king qualified his remarks. "I stress to Ranariddh and Hun Sen, I want them to know I have no plan to replace them. If one day there is a necessity for Sihanouk to intervene, I wait for a signal from the parliament, a request from the parliament, not from demonstrations .... Even with a request from parliament, I will not accept to take power unless Ranariddh and Hun Sen say, 'okay, we join you, we accept to be in your government of national unity'." Cambodia's constitution allows the parliament, by a two-thirds vote, to give extraordinary powers to the king during a time of crisis. This is what supporters of the burgeoning movement to install Sihanouk in power are aiming for -- essentially a constitutional coup led by members of the two major governing parties behind the backs of their own leaders. In fact, Sihanouk noted in the interview that a number of senior "politicians, figures in the military and in the administration" had appealed to him to seize power in recent months. Sihanouk said his programme would be much the same as that of the current government: "the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the country." Parliament would also be maintained. "The only difference is...no war with the Khmer Rouge and the Khmer Rouge in my government. It is the only change! The only change! But it is the very, very basis of my process of saving Cambodia." Aides say that Sihanouk will try to come back to Cambodia in July, depending on the outcome of medical tests to assess the state of his cancer. He appears strong and lively to his many visitors. "I still have cancer cells in my bone marrow, but I feel quite normal," the king said. Sihanouk said his wife and confidante, Queen Monique, strongly opposed the idea of his resuming power. "So, you know I will lose even my wife. But to lose my wife, to lose Mr. Hun Sen is nothing compared to Cambodia. For me, Cambodia is my life. If Cambodia sinks I have no reason to survive. I have no reason to live. I prefer dying."
