Arafat told journalists that the cabinet decisions were "empty gestures and do not represent an adequate response" to Friday's slaughter. The Israeli cabinet on Sunday gave the army the power to disarm hardline Jewish settlers, restrict their movements and place them in administrative detention. It also agreed to form a committee of enquiry into the massacre, and to release up to 1,000 of some 10,000 jailed Palestinians as a gesture. Arafat is to chair an emergency meeting of the PLO leadership here late Sunday to decide whether to resume peace talks with Israel. President Bill Clinton wants Israel and the PLO to hold non-stop talks in Washington in a bid to seal agreement on the overdue launch of Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Israeli settlers denounced the government's response as going too far. The Council of Jewish Communities in Judaea, Samaria and Gaza "rejected out of hand the proposals by irresponsible politicians ... to confiscate the weapons of Jews living (in the territories) and to punish Israeli citizens without a trial. "Making people more vulnerable is no way to calm the situation," it said.
