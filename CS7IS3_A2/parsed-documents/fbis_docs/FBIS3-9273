"We have received such an assurance from the coalition," said Aleksander Kwasniewski, following the Tuesday [22 March] session of the coalition's leadership. As he was leaving the headquarters of the Polish Peasant Party, Prime Minister Pawlak merely stated that a press conference would be held on Wednesday. It can be expected, therefore, that he will officially announce the decision he reached yesterday. Apart from the prime minister and the leader of the Democratic Left Alliance, also participating in the coalition meeting were Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, Senate Speaker Adam Struzik, Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Michal Strak, head of the Office of the Council of Ministers, and Jerzy Szmajdzinski, general secretary of Social Democracy of the Polish Republic. One of the issues discussed was, among other topics, the report from the National Council of Radio and Television. The coalition has not yet agreed on a joint position on this issue because not all of the deputies have had time to familiarize themselves with the council's report. "Evaluation of the report calls for a serious discussion, which will be held at the end of April or the beginning of May," said Kwasniewski.
