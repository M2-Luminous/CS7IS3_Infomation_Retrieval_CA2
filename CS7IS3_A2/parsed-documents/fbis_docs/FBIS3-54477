It was finally decided to make normalization conditional on a commitment to the UN Security Council resolutions on the war for the liberation of Kuwait. This was considered an alternative to a public appology that necessarily meant an admission of being a real participant in the Iraqi crime of occupation. This was not the exact truth because these countries only adopted passive roles which the Iraqi regime utilized in order to serve its claims. Some may say these countries' roles went beyond being just passive to taking the form of politcial and media support for the occupation crime. However, this was only the result of their being surprised and deceived when they all made a legend of Saddam Husayn. We all participated in portraying him as such, and perhaps we were the first to glorify the guardian of the Arab homeland's Eastern Gate who, in reality, was a monster in our midst. Now that talk about normalization has stopped, the government has failed to take a tangible step toward those countries that responded to the Kuwaiti condition and unequivocally announced they support international resolutions, Kuwait's right to sovereignty, the return of prisoners, and the payment of compensations. Here, we mean Yemen and Tunisia, who have repeatedly recited the prayer of repentance after they started to see clearly and became aware of the Iraqi monster and the tragic effects the crime of occupation has had on the Arab world. What else is needed to overcome estrangement and restore normal relations? We believe Kuwait is dutybound to extend its hand toward Tunisia and Yemen and for us to clear our hearts of feelings of blame in order to build, on the ruins of the past, a firm foundation for strong ties that end estrangement and provide an opportunity for interaction among Arab efforts to tighten the siege on the rabid monster who is gritting his teeth in hatred. We ought to admit that we were the first to be decieved and the first to acclaim the "Arabs' knight". It is now time for us to wake up from our daze and seek the right way to rebuild what the wicked invasion had destroyed of the wall of our Arab relations. The thicker the wall the less the danger of the monster lurking behind the borders will be.
