The statement recalls the Bulgarian viewpoint stated on 12 April 1994, which expressed alarm regarding the possible development of a chain reaction of military actions and an escalation of the conflict. Unfortunately, this chain reaction is now a fact. The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry once again appeals to the warring parties to halt their military actions and show greater flexibility and realism in the search for solutions. A compromise on Bosnia-Herzegovina's present and future can be found only at the negotiating table, only within a broader European framework, with active cooperation and coordination between the United States, the European Union, and Russia, and with the assistance of the United Nations. Bulgaria is ready to play an active part in the discussion of any international plan leading to the attainment of these goals; it is also ready to make its diplomatic and political contribution toward halting the bloodshed. The Foreign Ministry is glad to welcome the initiative for a summit meeting of representatives of the Russia, the United States, and the European Union on the situation in Bosnia, and hopes that a solution to this conflict may be found within the framework of this meeting. The holding of such a meeting in a country in the region in the immediate vicinity of the conflict will constitute a clear signal that the participants in the meeting are ready to commit themselves to an even greater extent to restoring stability, security, and cooperation in the Balkans, the Foreign Ministry statement says in conclusion.
