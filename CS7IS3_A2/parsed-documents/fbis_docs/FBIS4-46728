Was Not Enough To Resolve the Issue of Limiting KBR Residence Permits"] [Text] As already reported by the press, the joint session of the houses of the KBR Parliament will continue on 20 April 1994. On the deputies' agenda is consideration, among other matter, of the issue of a temporary suspension of residence permit issuance in the KBR. As you are aware, this matter was previously discussed by the KBR Supreme Soviet, which by a decree issued on 30 August 1990 temporarily suspended the issuance of permanent residence permits in the KBR. It was in connection that this that the KBR Parliament is now taking up the issue again. This was the subject of our interview with Zamir Shibzukhov, a member of the KBR Parliament Soviet of the Republic's Commission on Legislation, Law and Order, Security and Human Rights. [Shibzukhov] Yes, the Supreme Soviet did in fact issue its decree, and that decree has not yet expired, no one has repealed it, and it remains in effect. Furthermore, the KBR Council of Ministers, and later the Cabinet of Ministers, have issued a number of directives and decrees in compliance with that decree. A number of orders in connection with this also exist within the Ministry of Internal Affairs system, which issues residence permits to citizens. The Supreme Soviet was forced to make the decision in question due to our republic's overpopulation and acute problems with housing, food and other social issues. The primary purpose of the decree was to restrict unregulated migration into the republic. [Press Center] And have we succeeded in eliminating the problem? [Shibzukhov] Unfortunately not. Plus new problems have emerged that are equally difficult. Our republic has become a border area of the Russian Federation, an area located in immediate proximity to regions of interethnic conflict. There has been a sharp upsurge in the crime rate, and interethnic problems are on the rise. [Press Center] Insofar as I am aware, the influx of migrants is not decreasing, is it? [Shibzukhov] Despite the measures taken, the influx of residents into our republic has only been restricted insignificantly. Population density in this republic is eight times higher than the average for Russia as a whole. According to statistics from the State Committee for Statistics and the KBR Ministry of Internal Affairs, 7,519 people took up residence in the republic in 1993, or 2,028 more than in 1992. Recently, and particularly within the past year, various individuals have resided here without registering by evading current statutes. Those individuals now number several thousand. They generally accomplish this by acquiring houses or apartments by various means. [Press Center] A decree by our highest legislative body did not help. Why not? [Shibzukhov] The main purpose of that Supreme Soviet decree was not accomplished. Furthermore, the lack of a clear-cut, well-planned and well-organized mechanism for implementation of the decree resulted in various abuses by local bureaucrats and allowed many officials to feed at the trough. As proof allow me to cite just one fact. According to Ministry of Internal Affairs information, a total of 2,194 people were illegally issued residence permits in our republic in 1993 alone. I think that what I have said makes it quite clear why the Parliament has taken up this issue once again. [Press Center] What is going to be done now? [Shibzukhov] The commission on legislation, law and order, security and human rights in both houses of Parliament have been instructed to prepare specific proposals in regard to this matter. We have prepared those proposals in the form of a draft decree. The deputies will have the final say. The proposals pertain, once again, to restrictions on residence permits and expropriation of houses and apartments. The Parliament should establish clear-cut control over the mechanisms by which this decree is implemented. I can already see your next question coming: how legal are these restrictions? Yes, it should be noted that some deputies have pointed out that the new Constitution of the Russian Federation, and along with it the KBR Constitution, proclaim the freedom to relocate and choose one's place of residence. On that point I would like to comment that no specific legal act forbidding the issuance of residence permits has ever been adopted. On the contrary, residence permits and restrictions on them exist throughout the Russian Federation. Furthermore, the measures we are proposing are purely temporary in nature. [Press Center] Well, we can only hope that this time the decision made by our highest legislative body will be more effective.
