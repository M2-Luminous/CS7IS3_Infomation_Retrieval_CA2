FBIS4-17413 "drsov079_v_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-079 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 Lithuania President Speaks at International Conference President Speaks at International Conference WS2204181794 Tallinn BNS in English 1546 GMT 22 Apr 94 WS2204181794 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 22, BNS -- More than 53 percent of Lithuania's people work in the private sector, but the contribution of private enterprises to economic growth and efficiency is still hardly felt, Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas said in his speech at an international conference in Bucharest Friday [22 April]. The four-day Crans-Montana conference, devoted to all-European and regional problems, is attended by representatives of 86 countries and 19 international organizations. In his speech, Brazauskas said the Lithuanian gross domestic product constantly decreases: by 3 percent in 1990, by 13 percent in 1991, by 38 percent in 1992 and by around 35 percent in 1993. He said a major problem is that the part of the GDP consumed inside the country is growing: 75 percent in 1991, 80 percent in 1992 and around 85 percent in 1993. The president said attempts to liven up the investment process in Lithuania have been unsuccessful so far. Brazauskas noted that profit taxes were reduced three times in order to stimulate investments from internal sources. In his words, the part of profit or income used for investments may be completely exempted from taxes for 2 or 3 years. Brazauskas also noted that Lithuania intends to adopt a new law on foreign investments. Discussing the initial stage of state property privatization, the Lithuanian leader said it will have to extended until the end of this year, even though it was supposed to be completed by July. Brazauskas said the process of privatization should be controlled more strictly. But "assertions by some political forces in Lithuania that privatization is hindered, state property is plundered and so on, are unfounded." The president said "the mass of economically poorly educated shareholders" that formed in the process of privatization for investment checks "does not have any major influence on improving the management of enterprises." Brazauskas said the standards of living began to improve, although slowly, after inflation and the rise in prices were slowed down last year.
