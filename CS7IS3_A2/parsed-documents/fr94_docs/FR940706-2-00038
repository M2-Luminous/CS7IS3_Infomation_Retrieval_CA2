FR940706-2-00038 FR940706-2-00022 5. Contract Terms for the Purpose of NDA Act Power (i) Long-Term Contracts: Western proposes that Long-Term Contracts entered into under the final NDA Act Procedures shall provide for electric service for a period ending by December 31, 2004, and be subject to the reallocation procedures set forth in the final NDA Act Procedures. The effective date of the Long-Term Contract shall be determined by Western at the time of the contract offer. To abide by the requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall have the right to recall all or any part of the NDA Act Power CROD. (ii) Short-Term Contracts: Western proposes that Short-Term Contracts entered into under the final NDA Act Procedures shall provide for electric service during a temporary period ending by December 31, 2004, subject to the reallocation procedures set forth in the final NDA Act Procedures. The effective date of the Short-Term Contract shall be determined by Western at the time of the contract offer. To abide by the requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall have the right to recall all or any part of the NDA Act Power CROD. (iii) For any applicant requesting NDA Act Power to be used for an economic development project, the point of delivery for the NDA Act Power must be at the Closed Military Installation where the NDA Act Power will be used, unless otherwise agreed to by Western. (iv) The minimum Long-Term Firm NDA Act Power CROD shall be 500 kW. (v) Transmission Service: All transmission arrangements beyond Western's CVP system are the full responsibility of the Allottee. Western will assist the Allottee in obtaining third-party transmission arrangements with PG&E for delivery of Power allocated under the final NDA Act Procedures. Nonetheless, each Allottee is ultimately responsible for obtaining its own delivery arrangements. Western reserves the right to terminate a contract if the Allottee is unable to arrange for the transmission necessary to receive the CROD within 6 months of the execution of the contract. (vi) For those Allottees that receive NDA Act Power to be used at a Closed Military Installation, the following provisions must be complied with: (A) Western reserves the right to terminate a contract if the Allottee cannot demonstrate that it is using the NDA Act Power for an economic development project within 1 year of the execution of the contract, unless otherwise agreed. (B) The Allottee must provide a report to Western each January 15, which describes the benefits of the NDA Act Power CROD being passed on to the organization operating the economic development project. This report must be provided to Western in such a way that Western can separately identify the composite energy and capacity costs stated in mills per kWh of NDA Act Power and non-NDA Act Power. The report must also show that the economic development project is still in operation. (C) Western, at its sole discretion, shall have the right to either withdraw NDA Act Power or terminate its contract with the Allottee upon 30 days' written notice if the Allottee does not comply with G.5.(vi)(B) above for each year of the contract. (vii) Standard Provisions: The contracts entered into as a result of the final NDA Act Procedures will incorporate Western's standard provisions for power sales contracts, resale of electric energy, and conservation and renewable energy in addition to the General Power Contract Provisions. Western is in the process of developing procedures to require that all long-term firm customers develop an integrated resource plan consistent with the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It is anticipated that these procedures will be effective in late 1994.
