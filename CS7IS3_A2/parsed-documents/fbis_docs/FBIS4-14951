FBIS4-14951 "drsov066bb_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Official Denies Violations of CFE Agreement Official Denies Violations of CFE Agreement LD0504160194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1316 GMT 5 Apr 94 LD0504160194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] A Russian military official has denied Western media allegations saying Moscow was violating the CFE [Conventional Forces in Europe] agreement. "Though the CFE deal became valid from July 17, 1992 its clause on flank restrictions, which is of NATO's specific concern, comes into force in 40 months' time, i.e. after November 16, 1995," head of the international department of the Russian Armed Forces' General Chief of Staff Georgiy Pavlodyuk told INTERFAX on Tuesday. He said Russia's current strength in conventional weapons was slightly in excess of what is envisaged by the treaty and that "we have a further 18 months" in which to comply with CFE terms. Pavolodyuk said international inspections carried out in Russia had confirmed that Moscow was meeting its schedule of conventional weapons cuts. He thinks the flank restrictions were damaging to Russia's interests. Under the treaty, Moscow is entitled to deploy on its Leningrad and North Caucasian flanks only 700 tanks, 580 APCs and 1,280 artillery pieces. Pavlodyuk said the Russian president had called on other signatory states for a review of the flank restrictions clause in respect to Russia. The move follows Moscow's concern about national security as well as economic and social problems arising from troop withrawals from Eastern Europe and the Baltic states. "We want those restrictions to be lifted at least for some time before those problems have been resolved. However, there has been no positive response from our partners yet," Pavlodyuk said. He made it clear that the Russian government was not wanting to act unilaterally. The CFE agreement was signed by 28 European states as well as the United States and Canada.
