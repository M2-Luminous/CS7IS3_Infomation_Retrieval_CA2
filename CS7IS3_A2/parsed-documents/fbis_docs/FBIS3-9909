For eight days since the opening of the talks Camacho has been unable to leave the area. There have been reports to the effect that the situation inside the capital [as heard] is difficult. Meanwhile, the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee General Command issued a text asserting that to achieve free and democratic elections, the head of the federal Executive Branch must resign and a transition government be formed. It also calls for truly free and democratic elections with equal rights and duties for the political organizations that are struggling for power. Strangely, however, the communique signed by Subcommander Marcos is written in biblical language; it is as if they extracted their words and phrases from the Bible. It is a very, very strange communique.
