Touching on the defeat of the democratic forces in the parliamentary elections on December 12 Kostikov says, "one of the root causes of the failure of the democrats in the elections is that neither their parties nor their leaders have a taste or skills for conducting routine work for the sake of true values for the state and the people." The aim of the electoral campaign was not to promote ideas capable of normalising Russia but "winning a deputy mandate and reaping the interest on the success. The programme of none of the electoral coalitions contained even a hint at the ways in which national and not inner party or group problems will be tackled". Explaining why the country needs a trial of the August 1991 coup plotters and of the totalitarian ideology as a whole Kostikov writes: "Millions of people who suffered enough from the omnipotence of the communist party of the Soviet Union will only believe that the suppressed rebellion (in October 1993) liberated us from the threat of communist restoration if the admirers of the red-and-brown sauce, sickles, hammers and swastikas have a firm and clear indication of their place in society". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI lead with a report about the opening of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on Tuesday. "This day will open a new political year. Because everything that happened between the elections and this day is no more than an anticipation, a presentiment and guesswork". Explaining why the bulk of the voters cast their ballots in favour of the opposition electoral coalitions, the newspaper notes that most people "voted for those who was active. There is nothing can be done because we still believe in the strength of speeches, convincingly sounding pronouncements and propaganda push." Along with this, the newspaper writes, it would be erroneous to think that the considerable number of voters who favoured the communists, the agrarians close to the former and especially the liberal democrats personifies radical left or right wing public sentiments, although such sentiments undoubtedly exist. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI see as a good sign the fact that even the oppositional coalition leaders seek to convince the public that they "are going to the parliament not to make war but to work constructively". The confrontational political style, or at least its rhetoric, is no longer in fashion, the newspaper concludes. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) writes that there are more questions than answers on the eve of the opening of the Federal Assembly. The newspaper adds that only one parliament group -- that of the deputies from the communist party of the Russian Federation -- gathered in the parliamentary centre on January 9. The same newspaper comments on the presidential decree (dated December 22, 1993), which endorsed the regulation for the federal civil service. It says this system of state power has existed in Russia for centuries but was forgotten in recent years. Civil servants of all ranks are known to present-day Russians from historical tales and fiction.
