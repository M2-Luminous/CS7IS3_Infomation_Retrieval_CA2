A statement sent to AFP from the group's armed wing said that Friday's two attacks were "part of a series planned to revenge the murder" on April 25 of Tal'at Yasin, the organisation's military leader. It added they were also a warning to those who "killed the martyr 'Abd-al-Harith Madani" who died in detention at the end of April. On Thursday the public prosecutor's office said initial autopsies showed Madani had been tortured to death.
