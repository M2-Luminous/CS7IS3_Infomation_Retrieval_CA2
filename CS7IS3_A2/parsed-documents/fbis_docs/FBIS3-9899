Just a moment please. The minister is on his way. Here he comes. [Nule] This is Guido Nule speaking. [Alonso] Mr. Minister, we are contacting you from Havana. This is Radio Rebelde from Havana. Minister, please, we have here a press report that includes some remarks you made, that Colombia will sell petroleum to Cuba, that this will be one of the first trade agreements between the governments of Bogota and Havana following the reestablishment of diplomatic relations in October 1993. We would like to have a confirmation from you about these remarks. [Nule] Look, I can confirm the following for you: [words indistinct] and I were in Cuba over the past weekend to talk about the subject. We talked about that possibility and need only to brush up the final details. But there is interest (?both in Colombia and in Cuba) to conclude these negotiations. [Alonso] And how will Cuba pay for it, Minister? What are the terms? [Nule] Well, the idea is that Cuba will purchase the Colombian petroleum under normal commercial conditions; that is, at international prices; and Cuba will pay for it in hard currency. But there is the possibility of giving [word indistinct] for the payment. [Alonso] When will these exports begin? [Nule] Well, the idea is to begin exports as of July this year. [Alonso] How much petroleum will be sold to Cuba, Minister? [Nule] Between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. [Alonso] Between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. Very well. We have thus confirmed this report. In conclusion, Minister, we would also like to know whether it is in the interest of Colombia to sell this petroleum to our country? [Nule] Yes, of course. And this is what Cuba needs there. [Alonso] Very well, thank you very much, Minister. [Nule] Well, so long. [Alonso] So long.
