These gentlemen have now loyally joined the national community and been inducted as KRAF officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers under the leadership of our venerated king father. For this reason, those of you who are officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers still suffering under the command of the Khmer Rouge recalcitrants, who continue to use you as a shield to die and become disabled in their place, should stop following the dark road of the Khmer Rouge leaders and rebel against and attack these stubborn leaders and return to the national community. The General Staff appeals to you to hurry in order to avoid the upcoming confrontations. Return to the national community and you will be rewarded with positions, duties, and ranks commensurate with your individual capabilities and achievements. All KRAF units positioned throughout the country and nearby competent authorities are waiting to welcome you with cordiality and sincerity. They will consider you faithful and loyal to the country, religion, and the king. [Signed] General Ke Kimyan, chief of the General Staff of the KRAF
