The chetnik advance was nevertheless halted by a successful counteroffensive by our fighters. The usual chetnik provocations also continued on the free territory of Zvornik. However, demonstrating their courage, our defenders have again been very successful. Today, the enemy also pounded the city center of Olovo and the positions of our defenders. Like all other attempts by the aggressor to breach the lines of our defense, this one was also unsuccessful. This morning, the chetniks opened sniper fire on Kasindol street from the Bosut Barracks. The aggressor attacked Dobrinja with infantry weapons from Nedjarici. Stup was attacked with bombs fired from portable mortars. This was reported by the Information Service of the 1st Army Corps. The ferocity of the chetnik attacks in the zone of operations of the 3d Army Corps was offset by the defenders-members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, inflicting great losses on them in manpower and equipment. They are also liberating parts of occupied territories. Since it cannot do anything else, the aggressor is shelling villages, towns, and the civilian population. There have been no violations of the cease-fire agreement reached by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] in this region. The truce is generally holding at other lines of separation. In line with the agreement reached the day before yesterday by the negotiating teams of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the aggressor side, and the representatives of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], three prisoners held by the aggressor soldiers in Silos prison in (?Tarcin) were exchanged for three civilians from Kula prison. The process of exchanging prisoners is the first and the most controversial point in the Silajdzic-Krajisnik negotiations. The realization of other points from this agreement did not take place because of the lack of cooperation by the aggressor side. So, the issue of Silos and the 189 missing Bosniaks, who, according to their families, were taken by the terrorist chetnik forces to an unknown destination, remains unresolved.
