Kovacik: Slovak Arms Factories To Not Be Included in Coupon Privatization"] [Text] Bratislava -- Slovak arms factories will not be included in the second wave of coupon privatization, Ivan Kovacik, director of the engineering section at the Slovak Ministry of Economy, said. Proposals for the privatization of arms factories are to be submitted to the government only by the end of July, whereas the list of companies for coupon privatization is to be ready in the second half of May, he added. According to Kovacik, the volume of weapons production has dropped to one-tenth of the 1989 level. Arms factories' production worth 2 billion Slovak korunas, consisting entirely of spare parts, was exported last year. Although more than 20 companies in Slovakia trade in weapons, their activity is not being coordinated in any way, he noted.
