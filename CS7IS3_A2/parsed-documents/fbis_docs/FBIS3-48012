Negotiations on the continuity of safeguards are now going on between an official of the DPRK Embassy in Austria and an official of the Secretariat of the IAEA. The negotiations were arranged according to an agreement between the DPRK and the United States. As already reported, at the DPRK-U.S. contact held in New York toward the end of last year, the U.S. side officially manifested its will to suspend the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers, a test nuclear war, as part of the measures for removing nuclear threat to the DPRK, and we decided to accept inspection for the continuity of safeguards in conformity with our special position after the temporary suspension of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. What we decided to allow is not routine or ad hoc inspection pursuant to the obligation under the NPT, but inspection merely for the continuity of safeguards conforming to our special position. We proposed a scope of inspection enough to guarantee the continuity of safeguards at the current negotiations with the IAEA. The IAEA should show an affirmative response to defining the scope of inspection commensurate with the guarantee of the continuity of safeguards at the negotiations, as agreed between the DPRK and the USA. As we have already declared, the issue of routine and ad hoc inspection under the safeguards agreement shall be resolved smoothly, if the third round of the DPRK-USA talks are held and an agreement is reached on the package solution. Therefore, there will be no ground for the IAEA Secretariat to refuse to respond to our reasonable proposal, if it is interested in the solution of the nuclear issue and the guarantee of the continuity of safeguards on the Korean peninsula. We make it clear that, if the continuity of the safeguards fails to be guaranteed due to the absurd assertion of the IAEA Secretariat, we cannot be held responsible for it and the responsibility lies with the opposite side which complicated the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.
