Governor of Kronshtadt Viktor Surikov gave two reasons to explain the move. On the one hand, part of the warships appear to find themselves in a trap after the construction of a dam in the Bay of Finland left them with only one outlet to the Baltic Sea. On the other, there are plans to promote tourist business following a decision to set up a Free Economic Zone [FEZ] in Kronshtadt whose status of a closed city hampers the project. The FEZ project provides for the construction of a sea port at Kronshtadt with an annual capacity of 8.5 Mn tons to be increased to 12-13 Mn tons later which can bring about $15 Mn in annual revenues. The local authorities are also keen to re-commission a facility for cleaning oil-containing waste dumped secretly by Russian and foreign ships in the Baltic Sea. The withdrawal of Russian warships from Kronshtadt will be taken in stages. In the meantime, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is expected to visit the base in mid-February to discuss all problems in detail. It is not ruled out that the Russian Navy may deploy its own training center and ships at Kronshtadt to train navy personnel for Russia and other countries. Russian units deployed at the Leningrad navy base are expected to be redeployed at the town of Primorsk and elsewhere. A special working group including officials of the Defence Ministry, Navy, Leningrad navy base and the administration of St. Petersburg and Kronshtadt will meet to discuss the schedule of the Navy's withdrawal from the Kotlin Island.
