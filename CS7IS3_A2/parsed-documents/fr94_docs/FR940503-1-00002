SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The OTS recently has undertaken a comprehensive review of its conversion regulations. By Order No. 94&hyph;48, dated April 7, 1994, the OTS adopted significant amendments to its mutual to stock conversion regulations, 12 CFR part 563b, and mutual holding company regulations, 12 CFR part 575, to revise, update and clarify the regulations in a number of areas. In connection with its review of the conversion regulations, one of the issues the OTS considered was whether the convenience and needs of the local communities should be a factor in determining whether to approve these conversions. The reasons for mutual associations' conversion to stock form have changed over the years. During the 1980s, most mutual savings associations were marginally capitalized and many were insolvent. During this period, conversion transactions were a primary method for undercapitalized savings associations to raise capital and avoid being closed by the regulators. The conversion enabled an association to stay in business and continue to serve the community's credit needs.
