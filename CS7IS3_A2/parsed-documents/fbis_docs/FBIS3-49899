The members of UNPROFOR [UN Peacekeeping Forces] from Sweden, Denmark and Norway were deployed in the Tuzla area. One part of this unit spent several months in the Pancevo barracks, waiting for permission from the authorities of the republic of Srpska to transport the 11 peace force tanks to Tuzla. The republic of Srpska, however, regarded this intention as an attempt at irregularly applying the existing Blue Helmets mandate. Representatives of the republic of Srpska army pointed out that UNPROFOR was tasked with keeping peace and providing humanitarian aid to civilian population, in the course of which they were authorized to carry personal and defensive weapons. A tank of the Leopard kind is neither a personal nor a defensive weapon. Since no agreement on the passage of the tanks was reached, the Nordic soldiers have left Pancevo. In addition to the tanks and soldiers, 23 armored personnel carriers have also left Stevica Jovanovic barracks aboard three trains, the federal government committee says. [passage omitted]
