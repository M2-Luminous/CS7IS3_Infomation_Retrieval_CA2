During his stay in Washington for four to five days, Kim is scheduled to meet with U.S. Government officials including Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci to evaluate the present state of the North Korean nuclear issue. They will focus on joint Korea-U.S countermeasures in view of the inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). South Korea and the United States will reportedly agree on opening a third round of talks between Washington and Pyongyang next month if Pyongyang accepts the IAEA's proposal to stop refueling the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon and if the spent fuel rods that have already been removed are stored in good shape. In addition, Seoul and Washington will determine their position on subjects to be discussed at the Washington-Pyongyang meeting.
