He introduced it with two modifications that had been negotiated with Congress: First, the guarantee of covering, beginning 1 July, any possible loss in purchasing power of salaries converted into URV's. This will be done if there is really any loss compared to the previous salary policy. Second, to ensure that the rules for issuance of the real comply with all legal demands and that the real will be implemented through a presidential decree. Provisional Measure No. 482, which was published in the official gazette today, does not establish a date for the new currency's implementation. Congress will have one month to vote on this provisional measure. Although the economic team defended the idea of reissuing Provisional Measure No. 457 without modifying it, the opinion of the government's political area prevailed. In the afternoon of 28 April, Finance Ministry executive secretary Clovis Carvalho stated: "Everyone believed the original text should be preserved." He pointed out, however, that it was up to Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero and the president of the Republic to make the final decision on the issue. Ricupero's chief of staff, Sergio Amaral, said the finance minister offered President Itamar Franco the two alternatives. [passage omitted]
