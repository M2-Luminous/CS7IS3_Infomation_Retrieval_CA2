The statement was made on Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Interfax by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov who is the senior official at the ministry now that Andrey Kozyrev is in Spain accompanying President Yeltsin. Lavrov said that in the military sense the NATO air strikes did not give anything, and in the political sense they sharply worsened the situation. Besides, it should be found out whether the NATO action caused human losses. Lavrov spoke of the unproductiveness of regarding Russia as an inferior partner of NATO. "This was proved by the situation in Sarajevo and now though somewhat differently by Gorazde", he said. According to the deputy minister, the situation must be saved after the NATO air attacks. This can be done only through concerted efforts, he said. Lavrov stressed that last Monday the UN Security Council held a session called for by Russia to discuss the situation. "The first report of the Security Council secretariat about the developments in Gorazde was submitted. It was clearly fragmentary and incomplete. We were not satisfied with it and we expect exhaustive information", the diplomat said. According to him, the Security Council met again on Tuesday. "At the initiative of Russia it adopted a call to Bosnian Muslims to stop the shelling. Russia again demanded information from the secretariat about the way the procedure required by Security Council resolutions was applied and what concrete targets were attacked", Lavrov said. Besides, Russia suggested that the Security Council take steps to implement the April 6 declaration concerning a safe zone in Gorazde which implies the demilitarization of the area, the sending of a UN force, the withdrawal of Serbian artillery and the disarmament of Muslim armed groups. He recalled that last June the Security Council passed a number of resolutions permitting the use of force in ex-Yugoslavia to prevent attacks on peace-keepers and the UN personnel and violations of the no-flight zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. In such cases the UN secretary general can request interested countries and regional organizations to support the UN force and resist the violations. The procedure of using force proposed by the secretary general in his report on July 14, 1993 was approved. Lavrov stressed that under the resolution the secretary general can made a decision on the use of force after consulting Security Council members. The report was discussed by the Security Council and approved in the first clause of resolution No. 844. According to Lavrov, the procedure providing for compulsory consultations with Security Council members was the main condition of Russia's approval of the resolution. "The resolution must be observed. This equally applies to countries that are targets of tough sanctions and Security Council members, the secretary general, the secretariat. We are bringing the idea home to our partners in the Security Council and the secretary general", the diplomat said. The deputy minister said that a high-ranking official from the Russian mission in Geneva Valeriy Loshchinin met there with Butrus- Ghali and "told him everything". "We did not get exhaustive answers to our concerns", he said. Asked whether Russia is going to submit the draft of a more binding Security Council resolution Lavrov said that the whole gamut of sentiments at the council should be taken into account. Many Security Council members, in particular non-aligned countries, view the Serbs as the only aggressors and constantly call for one-sided actions against them. Lately only Russia with the feeble support of two or three countries has been resisting resolutions that would declare a Security Council ultimatum to Serbs throughout Bosnia, lift the Security Council embargo on arms supplies to the Muslims and expel Serbs from all international organizations. According to Lavrov, Russia is not turning a blind eye on the fact that before the air attacks the Serbs violated Security Council resolutions. "According to some reports, 30 people were killed and 100 wounded in the Serbian shelling. This must be double-checked. We demand that the Serbs stop such actions. But they should not be attacked alone. It is clear that the current situation around Gorazde was provoked by the Muslims while the Serbs reacted inadequately. If the world community chooses one side as the scapegoat, this will lead to what President Yeltsin has described as an eternal war", Lavrov said. Asked whether Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev would go to ex- Yugoslavia -- a fact not ruled out by President Yeltsin in his speech in Madrid -- Lavrov said that Moscow would want to get detailed reports from the Russian presidential envoy in the conflict zone Vitaliy Churkin first. "Churkin is engaged in virtually round- the-clock negotiations with the conflicting sides and the United Nations. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to be in touch with him as he constantly moves from one place to another", the diplomat said. Moscow is alarmed by the fact that the support of many Western leaders for the use of force in Gorazde might lead to reliance on force in Bosnian and international affairs in general. The feeling is expressed in a statement of a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman circulated in Moscow on Wednesday. He said the NATO headquarters is reportedly discussing new ultimatums to the Serbs in circumvention of the United Nations. "This road is unacceptable for us, instead we pursue a policy of true partnership and practical cooperation for the sake of stability and security", the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
