If yes, what will be its "color"? [Gherman] Prime Minister Vacaroiu is the most authorized person to answer this question. We voted confidence in Prime Minister Vacaroiu and suggested that he should make certain changes to the current government formula. Therefore, we will not have a new government, but it is very likely that we will have a government reshuffle by 1 March 1994. [Fabian] It is said that this government will be a coalition between the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and PUNR [Romanian National Unity Party]. [Gherman] We would be slightly anticipating things if we were to make such an affirmation. Even from the protocol concluded with PUNR, it has resulted that it is not strictly necessary to have a government that includes members of political formations but members recommended by certain political formations. Nevertheless, we agreed that among the recommended persons, there should be a competition of professionalism. Therefore, if PUNR recommends a person who exceptionally fulfills all the conditions in those areas that we believe the government's activity was less than efficient, then we will accept that person. If you carefully read the protocol with PUNR, you will see that the fundamental criteria is professionalism. Therefore, it is not excluded that modifications might be made to the current structure of the government and it is not excluded that people recommended by PUNR might be included in the government. Regarding the respective person's affiliation to a party, the problem is a little more complex because this issue is not a clause specifically stipulated neither in the protocol nor in our understandings. [Fabian] Thus, people recommended by PUNR might become government members. Could it happen that none of the new members would belong to PUNR? [Gherman] This has not been requested in the protocol. [Fabian] Has PUNR not insisted on this issue? [Gherman] I cannot disclose any more information in this discussion. Certainly, we thought about the variation that the recommended people should be PUNR members, but, precisely in order to give a broader scope to proposals, we agreed that the respective people should be recommended by PUNR. [Fabian] Were there ministries about which more heated discussions were held, in the sense that the PDSR would have liked to maintain control over those sectors that are believed to be key sectors? Does PUNR in turn wish to obtain certain ministries? [Gherman] The biggest mistake that a politician could make would be to publicly reveal intentions referring to certain proposed moves. Everyone is curious. Everyone would like to know whether the changes we are going to make will affect education, culture, or finance. However, such a thing is announced the moment the change has been carried out. There is no country in the world where various aspects of a business, banking operations, or issues connected with the government are announced to the public before the changes have been made. Thus, no matter how much sympathy I would feel toward your newspaper and you personally, and even if I knew exactly what changes are going to be made, it would be a real mistake to disclose them before the change itself has been carried out. [Fabian] A new formula for a government reshuffle has been negotiated. Has the durability of the new government formula been discussed, or has it been viewed as a team that should ensure the process of transition until appropriate conditions are created for more fundamental, ample, and even more open discussions with the opposition? [Gherman] We have not negotiated a stage, while keeping the next one in mind. We discussed these aspects with the parties that are included in the government in order to resolve the problem of governing. If the respective solutions prove to be very efficient, it means that we have no reason to think about them as short-term solutions. Thus, we have not established a certain trial period or a limited period of time for this solution. On the contrary, we wanted it to be a long-term solution. Thus, this is not a transition government, a government that should ensure that we cross the bridge. It is a government that we envisaged as a long-term one. [Fabian] When the new government is established, it has to do its job. It needs parliamentary support. In the light of the latest stand taken by the PRM [Greater Romania Party] and the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor], it is difficult to believe that the PDSR will continue to enjoy the necessary parliamentary support. Some percents are missing. Have you thought about getting them from somewhere else? [Gherman] Your hypothesis is erroneous. Namely, I do not believe in nor do I foresee any modifications in the option of the PRM and the PSM. I do not believe they will join the opposition to form a parliamentary opposition -- at least that is how I see things, even if in both cases negotiations on a new government formula have been suspended. [Fabian] The conditions under which the government continues its activity are unusual. There is talk about accepting an austerity program. What are the measures that the PDSR is proposing to take in order to attenuate as much as possible the deterioration of its prestige? [Gherman] In our government program, we propose to reduce the effects of this austerity program to a minimum. We are certain that by the end of 1994, the country's economic situation will have improved considerably, which will implicitly lead to an improvement of people's living standard. [Fabian] During your discussions, have you thought of the possibility that the new government team might be able to settle the conflict with the trade unions and ensure credibility abroad? [Gherman] We have constantly maintained cooperative relations with all the trade union confederations. First of all, we have taken note of all viewpoints regarding the credibility of a government reshuffled in accordance with the views expressed by those trade union confederations. There has been a constant, substantial exchange of information, opinions, suggestions, and even certain variations that were presented by both partners. As far as credibility abroad is concerned, I have learned a very tough lesson -- namely that credibility abroad can only be achieved through credibility at home. If we work better and more efficiently, we will achieve better economic results and, thus, eliminate embarrassing elements from our relations with other countries. Our credibility will be ensured. Here is an example: If we eliminate all acts of chauvinism and anti-Semitism, and condemn such attitudes, if we try to maintain a temperate and democratic atmosphere in our country, and, at the same time, prove the efficiency of our government, then our credibility is ensured. We will have to overcome a superficial aspect of identifying certain parties with certain people. If you study the documents that have been signed by us, including the protocol with PUNR, you will realize that these are in complete and total agreement with the requirements of the Council of Europe, as well as the European Community. Therefore, one can take substantial steps forward and they will certainly be noticed by our foreign partners.
