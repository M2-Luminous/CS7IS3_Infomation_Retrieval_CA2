FBIS4-7930 "dreeu068__a94017" FBIS-EEU-94-068-A Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic License Refused for Iranian Tank Modernization License Refused for Iranian Tank Modernization AU0704191994 Prague CTK in English 1501 GMT 7 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0704191994 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, April 7 (CTK) -- After consultation with the Foreign, Defense and Interior Ministries, the Ministry of Industry and Trade's Licensing Authority has turned down a request by the RDP Group, a company uniting weapons industries, for a license to enter the Iranian market. Industry and Trade Ministry spokesman Kamil Cermak said the RDP Group's general director had asked the ministry to consider the possibility of its exporting technology to Iran for the repair of T-72 tanks. Not one of the ministries which the law says have to declare their feelings on the issuing of a license were positive about it. Ilja Mazanek, deputy director of the Foreign Ministry's section for the Middle East and Northern Africa, told CTK on Wednesday that the Czech Republic did not export any arms to Iran at present. The authorities would only issue licenses for the export of weapons to Iran in the future if it was in the Czech Republic's interest, he added. In the export of weapons the Czech Republic will adhere to international agreements and subject each individual order to severe scrutiny. Mazanek stressed that no United Nations Security Council sanctions had been imposed on Iran as was the case with Libya or Iraq. However, he admitted that Iran was one of the "sensitive" areas, and that this would be taken into account when potentially "problematic" supplies were being considered. These were above all weapons, but also components for nuclear power stations.
