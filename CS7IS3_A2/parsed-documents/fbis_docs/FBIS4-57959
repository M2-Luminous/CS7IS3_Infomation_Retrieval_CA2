The interior minister visited Metropolitan Police Headquarters, where he was welcomed by Police Commander General Orlando Hernandez Villegas. The objective of the visit was to exchange views on the failures and successes in the struggle against increasing criminal activity in Caracas. Escovar Salom explained that although he opposes the way in which the Vagrancy Law is being implemented, it is necessary to continue enforcing the law as long as a civil security law is not approved. [Begin Escovar recording] As interior minister, I would like to express my complete support for the Caracas police, as well as my support for the governor and mayor of Caracas in their handling of urban security issues. As you all know, up to several weeks ago, the level of gun-related violent crimes was down. But then these kinds of crimes soared, continued to rise, and then began to drop off again. Most of all, I want to know what will be done this weekend, and how it will be done, in order to understand the shortcomings and to determine what adjustments should be made. I have invited the Federal District governor to a meeting to reach an understanding on this issue. I am aware that you are all interested in asking me about the use of firearms. I imagine this is one of the main issues of concern, the other being related to what is going to be done with the neighborhood scourges -- those individuals involved in violent crimes in Caracas and who represent a danger to the people. As long as a new law is not approved, the Vagrancy Law will remain in effect. Personally, I do not like the Vagrancy Law. Nevertheless, there is no other option but to depend on this law as long as Congress does not approve a civil security law. Meanwhile, there will be a need to enforce the Vagrancy Law. [end recording] The interior minister also expressed his opposition to the use of firearms to quell demonstrations. Escovar Salom indicated that any officer of the Metropolitan Police or any other police division that takes part in controlling demonstrations must abstain from using his weapon to control student activities. [Begin Escovar recording, in progress] ...if there are shortcomings in the actions of the Metropolitan Police or any other police officers. Another issue I would like to explain is related to the use of firearms. I cannot endorse the indiscriminate use of firearms by police. This cannot be tolerated in any country. In other words, the police can use their weapons only in accordance with standard regulations. This is why these weapons are described as service weapons. In no way does this sanction police to use their firearms indiscriminately against protesters. In other words, we need to implement guidelines similar to those used in other countries governing police actions. On the other hand, we cannot have a police force that is restricted, unprotected, and without room to maneuver. It is impossible for police to conduct themselves like timid rabbits. They must have mechanisms that allow them to exercise their duties whenever necessary. This entails specialized training for them in the area of respecting individual rights. We want neither a police force that intimidates, nor one that is weak. [end recording] Escovar also indicated that he had information related to the likelihood of a food blockade in the metropolitan area, which could result from the current strike by Coche Market workers. He said he recently met with Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz to discuss measures necessary to prevent difficulties or inconveniences from affecting the population. In addition, the interior minister indicated that measures were also being taken to transfer those individuals suspected of criminal activities to the El Dorado and (Igorro) Prisons in Valencia. Both prisons are now undergoing renovations.
