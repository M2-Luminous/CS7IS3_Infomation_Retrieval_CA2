Some regions in recent years did try to carry out partial reforms of the public-funded and labor insurance medical systems, with the aim of controlling rising medical expenses within a reasonable limit and of better and effectively utilizing the limited public health resources under the premise of ensuring basic medical care for staff members and workers. Reform has already begun, and its direction has been determined. Only by accelerating the pace to reform the current medical care system, by establishing diverse forms and different levels of the medical care system which is adapted to China's actual conditions, and by gradually increasing the percentage of people covered under the medical insurance, will it be possible to allow all members of society to receive basic medical guarantees and raise the health level of the entire nation. An authority from public health circles pointed out that the purpose of reforming the current medical system is to fundamentally safeguard the citizens' basic rights for medical treatment and to ensure against the lowering of their level and quality of medical treatment. China's public-funded medical system was established in 1952, initially covering personnel in all levels of government organs; political parties; people's organizations; educational, scientific, cultural, and public health institutions; and some disabled military servicemen. That system was later expanded to cover students at higher institutes of learning. Presently there are some 29 million people throughout the nation enjoying the benefits of public-funded medical care. Government budgets finance the costs of medical care. China's labor medical insurance began in 1951. Staff members and workers, as well as their dependents at collective-owned enterprises, enjoy the benefits of the labor medical insurance system. Both the publicly-funded medical system and the labor medical insurance system provide the same kind of medical services. Enterprises pay for the costs of medical treatment incurred by their employees. Presently some 144 million people throughout the nation are under labor insurance medical coverage. Undoubtedly, public-funded and labor insurance medical care systems have played important roles in safeguarding the health of staff members and workers, have promoted economic development, and have helped maintain social stability in their 40 years of implementation in China. However, the defects of those systems are also apparent. As state and enterprises pay for medical expenses, and as individuals do not have to pay for medical expenses, there is a lack of an effective system to stop abuse. Some of the abuses include: a person who is covered under the public-funded medical system receives medical treatment for the rest of his family; some pass themselves off as eligible for free public medical service; patients make unreasonable demands for certain medicines; doctors prescribe medicines to show personal favors; doctors prescribe expensive medicines; and doctors conduct unnecessary medical examinations. These abuses have caused a serious waste of public health resources With the increase costs of medicine and medical equipment, the renewal and replacement of medical equipment, the graying of the population, and the changes in the nature of illness in recent years, annual expenditures in public-funded and labor insurance medical costs have increased rapidly, far exceeding state revenue growth and forcing the state and enterprises to shoulder a heavier financial burden. An expert pointed out that the level of China's social and economic development at this stage cannot support the current medical care systems. The economic development and constant deepening of the reform of the economic system in the 1990s presented public-funded and labor insurance medical care systems with new problems. As there is a lack of rational mechanisms to pool funds for medical care and to stabilize the financial sources for medical expenses, staff members and workers will be unable to enjoy their rightful and basic medical treatment when the operation of their enterprises become difficult. The present medical care system does not provide medical guarantees for staff members and workers employed at some small enterprises; at privately-run enterprises; and at Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises. In addition, some eight million people in urban and rural areas who are employed in the private industrial and commercial sectors are also excluded from the current medical coverage. The current system, with a small percentage of people under its medical insurance coverage, and with its poor management and service and low degree of socialization, is not only unable to adapt to the requirements for building a socialist market economy in China, but is also finding it increasingly difficult to continue operating. Is there a way out? Reform is the only way out. In March 1989 the State Council formally approved four cities--Siping in Jilin, Dandong in Liaoning, Huangshhi in Hubei, and Zhuzhou in Hunan--to conduct a pilot program to reform the medical insurance system. A pilot program to reform the social medical insurance system was also conducted in Shenzhen and Hainan. Many regions have begun practicing a medical-cost-sharing system. According to this system, staff members and workers are required to pay a small amount of their medical costs when receiving treatment. About 90 percent of the people who receive public-funded medical care have now joined the medical-cost-sharing system. About 80 percent of small and medium enterprises under the labor insurance medical care system also practice the cost-sharing method. When seeking medical treatment, an individual is generally required to pay for 10 to 15 percent of the cost. The highest amount which a staff member or worker pays for their medical costs during a year does not exceed the average level of their monthly wages. The same expert cited above claims this cost-sharing system will have some effect in helping staff members and workers become cost-conscientious and in helping control excessive medical costs. Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang stressed: "The purpose of reforming the social medical safeguard system is to increase efficiency in using the limited public health resources, and to raise the awareness of the individual and the family to invest in health." It has been learned that relevant departments of the State Council have drafted opinions on carrying out a pilot program on the establishment of a medical insurance system for staff members and workers. As the reform of the medical safeguard system for staff members and workers is a major reform involving the personal interests of staff members and workers, and as there is no sufficient and good experience as yet for such reform, the State Council has decided to select two cities to carry out the experiment in order to ensure a stable transition. This reporter has learned the basic thinking for reform is to divide into two portions the medical costs of the public-funded and labor insurance medical care systems, which is now being jointly financed by state budgets and enterprises. Some of the funds will go to the establishment of a social insurance fund, which will be used to cover expenditures for treatment of major illnesses of staff members and workers; other portions will be used to establish a medical account for individuals. Staff members and workers shall regularly contribute appropriate funds from their wages to replenish individual medical accounts for general medical treatment expenses. Localities must work out measures to suit local conditions and avoid uniformity. All in all, reforming the medical insurance system has become imperative.
