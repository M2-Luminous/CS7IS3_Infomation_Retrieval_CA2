A high-ranking Cambodian official said that Vo Van Kiet will also discuss how to solve border and immigration issues with the Cambodian leaders. The Cambodian national radio reported today that the Vietnamese side will make an emergency demand to the Cambodian side that some 30,000 Vietnamese emigrants should be repatriated to Cambodia. The Vietnamese emigrants fled to Vietnam from Cambodia in March, 1993 and are currently gathering in two countries' border areas. As to the Cambodian-Vietnamese border issue, the Cambodian Constitution provides that any solution should be based on the Cambodian domain before the year of 1969. Vo Van Kiet is visiting at the invitation of Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, co-prime ministers of the Royal Cambodian Government which was formed in November last year.
