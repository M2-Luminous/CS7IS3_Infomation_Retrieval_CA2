The shutdown, which had initially been threatened during a press conference Tuesday, was sparked by a November 25 government decision that would cause a sixfold rise in newspaper production costs. The newspapers consider this as the latest move to strangle Russia's emerging independent media, and blame the government for fighting to control the mass media rather than to guarantee freedom of the press. The six politically diverse newspapers -- IZVESTIYA, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA and VECHERNAYA MOCKVA -- will be shut down for at least one week from January 10, according to a decision by their editors. Russian journalists' union president Vsevolod Bogdanov said that a majority of local and regional newspapers would also join the movement. The editors said, however, that they would be willing to renounce the suspension if an immediate solution to their problem was found.
