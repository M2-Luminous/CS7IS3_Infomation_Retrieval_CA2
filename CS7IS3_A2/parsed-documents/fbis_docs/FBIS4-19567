Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] broke its exclusive report of the incident yesterday and the government officially confirmed it today. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis confirmed that police had interrogated British military officers about an incident in which a U.S. national, who was using a car with diplomatic license plates, became involved. Asked about the excuse of the arrested, Kasoulidhis said: [Begin Kasoulidhis recording] Their version was that it is their hobby to watch the planes land and take off. [end recording] Kasoulidhis added that the arrested were not in a prohibited area and at first glance it does not seem that they have committed a crime. The issue is being investigated further. A U.S. source revealed to CyBC that the U.S. national is Major Scott David Dorney, the assistant military attache. The same source said he was at the airport to meet a colleague. The source mentioned that other Americans, including U.S. Embassy personnel, were also at the airport to welcome U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher, who was returning from abroad. An official spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia told CyBC that no American has been arrested, detained, officially interrogated, or been in a prohibited area at Larnaca Airport. Answering our question on the purpose of the major's presence at the airport, the spokesman said he was there for personal reasons. Of course he did not reveal them. A British bases spokesman confirmed that a British officer was interrogated by police and was later released. The spokesman added: The British officer cooperated with police, but we do not understand what the issue is. Asked about the incident this morning, President Glavkos Kliridhis said: [Begin recording] [Kliridhis] I do not believe we can say that this is an espionage case, because it is well-known that we are bringing in arms. [Unidentified correspondent] What did they want, then? [Kliridhis] I do not know. We will find this out when we investigate the case. [end recording]
