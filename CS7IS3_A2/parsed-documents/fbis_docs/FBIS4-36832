Comrade Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' presented a review of the recent political developments on the Arab and international levels. He said: The landslides and repercussions resulting from the breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are still continuing in one form or another on the regional and international levels. Al-Shar' added: The world is still going through a transitional phase full of great challenges after the old international system has collapsed without being replaced by a new international order of sound and balanced international relations. The situation in the Arab homeland has also been further fragmented as a result of the Gulf War. Inter-Arab relations are weak and loose, Arab obligations have receded, and Arab solidarity has deteriorated to a lower level. Having reviewed the current situation in Iraq, the blockade imposed on Libya, the events that took place in Somalia, the regrettable developments in Algeria, and the recent tragic conflagration in Yemen, Al-Shar' said: These grave developments and challenges could not have been confronted so wisely and courageously were it not for the Corrective Movement and the unique leadership of struggler President Hafiz al-Asad. Al-Shar' added: The Corrective Movement and its historic leader are the strongest guarantee and fortification for Arab Syria in facing the different challenges on the Arab and international levels. He said: Syria has remained sincere to its course, loyal to its principles, and its leader President Hafiz al-Asad has always made the correct and courageous decisions which express the nation's concerns and legitimate aspirations and continuously adhere to Arab solidarity and the common interests and destiny of the Arab nation. The comrade foreign minister affirmed that Syria's pan-Arab role in Lebanon and its concern for its unity and national reconciliation have prevented that country from becoming another Bosnia or Afghanistan. Al-Shar' said: The wise decision which was made by the president at the Cairo summit following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had spared the Arabs from an even more disastrous and dangerous situation. He added: This Syrian Arab stand greatly reduced the losses and damages and preserved a minimum level of mutual Arab obligations, at least among the eight Arab states which signed the Damascus Declaration. The comrade foreign minister affirmed that during the occupation of Kuwait, Israel had planned to have a say in Arab decisions and resources and to normalize its relations with the Arab Gulf states and other Arab states without withdrawing from the occupied Arab territories or committing itself to implementing the UN resolutions relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine question. The comrade foreign minister added: The U.S. initiative, which is based on UN resolutions and international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace, would not have materialized in its present form were it not for Syria and the well-known resolve and wisdom of its leader, as well as the support of the sincere ones among his Arab brothers who adhered to the achievement of just and comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy and the UN resolutions. The comrade foreign minister reviewed the stages of the peace process and its recent developments in light of the continued U.S. efforts, despite Israel's attempts to place obstacles from to time on the path of this process. In this regard, comrade al-Shar' referred to the deportation of more than 400 Palestinians, the Hebron massacre and the acts of murder and suppression which followed it, the siege on the occupied territories and Holy Jerusalem, and Israel's continuous aggressions on Lebanon. He also referred to Israel's desperate efforts to play down the impact and results of the Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. The comrade foreign minister affirmed that Syria's adherence to its national and pan-Arab principles is neither stubbornness nor extremism but a sincere expression of its firm desire to achieve the option which Syria has chosen out of its own free will in order to achieve just and comprehensive peace which ends Israeli occupation, guarantees Arab rights, and ensures security and stability for everyone in the region. After the comrade foreign minister had replied to all questions and queries from the comrade participants, the conferees continued to make their comments on organizational, educational, and other public issues concerning the citizens.
