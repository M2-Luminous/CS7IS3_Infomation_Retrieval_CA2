The U.S. Justice Department suspects the company of supplying Libya with computer software. This would be an infringement of the U.S. [as published] trade embargo imposed on Libya. Eurabic is well-known to Western intelligence services as a front for the Libyan Government. Netherlands Intelligence believes that the firm is controlled directly from Tripoli and attempts to acquire a variety of goods which are no longer available through normal channels due to the trade embargo. Eurabic was founded by B. Rhuma, former head of the Netherlands office of Libyan Arab Airlines, the Libyan state airline. The U.S. Justice Department has long been interested in the affairs of Eurabic. In the past, Libya has purchased items including aircraft components and chemicals from the firm. [passage omitted]
