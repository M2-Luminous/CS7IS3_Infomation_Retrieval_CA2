In my address to the Supreme Council, to you, I outlined my arguments regarding the June elections. Today, as well as yesterday, while analyzing the debate held here, I had the impression that the emphasis was only on the first argument, namely, the one concerning the need to postpone the elections. However, another important argument, that if the Supreme Council adopts appropriate laws, clarifications, the elections will have to be held, was not analyzed. I am not calling from this rostrum not to hold the elections. I have said, and I am still saying, and my viewpoint is that the elections should be held. They should be held, however, only if the legislative basis is adjusted to them. This is my position, and it is based on my conviction that otherwise we will completely lose control over the authorities. If the elections are held without changing and amending the Constitution and laws, if the powers of local authorities are not precisely defined, we will have an uncontrolled situation, a total disarray of the Executive Branch. This is not simply a threat, but based on the experience of happened in 1990. Regarding the presidential office, it was introduced not simply because someone wanted it, but because the situation demanded it. This is first. Second, if you carefully read the law on reforming local authorities and self-government, adopted by the previous Supreme Council, you will find a definition of the presidential office. I recall how your predecessors were cleansing this law, and how they did not want that such an office exist. Suddenly, later, there was talk that the president must be elected. Thus, I am asking you one simple and clear question: If this law entrusts the government with everything, what role is assigned to the president? If the president is elected universally with these powers, and I see that there will be no other case, we will have in Kiev the president, the head of the state and the head of the executive authority, and we will lack of any presidential influence in the regions. I am saying this to coordinate these issues. If the Supreme Council really wants Ukraine to remain an independent, manageable, sovereign, and democratic state, as has been stated here, then, while adopting the resolution regarding the 26 June elections, or confirming it, the parliament must assume responsibility for preparation and adoption of the appropriate documents by 26 June. This should be written down in a resolution, the draft of which envisions that documents defining, in particular, the powers of the Ukrainian president, will be submitted by 12 June. The powers of the Ukrainian president are defined by the Constitution, and you will not change them by any law, whether you want this or not. The Constitution must be changed. Is this realistically possible? If such a possibility do exist, let us do that. I support this. Moreover, I was the first to support a clear division of powers. The draft constitution, at my proposal, was amended with this very provision concerning the division of powers of the head of state and the head of Executive Branch. Yet, this must now be added to the current Constitution. I would therefore like to refute any insinuations that someone wants to preserve himself in office, that the president signed the electoral law alone. But after that, the president submitted to the Supreme Council draft legislation concerning reorganization of governmental power. You, speaking from this rostrum, insisted that it was not expedient to adopt them. Everything was written down clearly: Who is the president, what is the government, what is the judicial authority, and what is the Supreme Council. Nobody would have played a game of war anymore. You did not want it! A very interesting thesis recently appeared: Apparently, there is only one thing to be done, the law has to be changed that an oblast head be elected by deputies, and seemingly, everything will be fine. But I am asking you, if an oblast head is elected by deputies, will the government be able to dismiss him? No. Will the president be able to do that? No. I have currently three times as much power vis-a-vis the Crimean president, as the newly elected president will have regarding an oblast or rayon head. I am asking these questions, being led by my current feelings. Someone does not like the president standing here. I would like the president to be elected without ruining the state and the executive authority, that he be elected legitimately, consistently, and without insinuations that, apparently, we are currently resorting to legal cases because, apparently, people want this. Tomorrow, when everything collapses, the same people will come here, to the Supreme Council, and they will say that there are no pensions and other things, because there will be no money for the budget. Who will answer these questions and how? I am saying, if we are to establish authorities, if are to establish new authorities, then let us establish it in a manner enabling it to work. I repeat, the authority we are to elect will not work, and if it does work, it will have no control, given these laws. I do not want to be a prophet, as the saying goes, "in my own fatherland," but you will see a situation within a certain period. You will see and then speak out. Thus, I want us to approach this issue in a responsible manner. If the Supreme Council drafts the appropriate laws, if it places all emphasis on the law adopted by your predecessors, there will be no doubt: I will support the elections, I will support holding such elections. Thus, my position on the local elections is clear. Here is my second position, on the presidential election. The current status of the president is defined in the Constitution. If the president is elected according to this, then, believe me, no Supreme Council will be able to strip him of any power after he goes through all that torment. There is talk that these issues can be resolved in a referendum. This is interesting logic. We will first elect the president with powers in June, and in September we will hold a referendum on the question of which powers should we take away from him. So, what do we finally want? We only want to voice slogans. This is unrealistic. Once again, I am calling on you, for you will bear the greatest responsibility. I want everyone to know that, because the presidential campaign has already begun. I am a presidential candidate, you were elected by the people. There is a legitimate, constitutional Supreme Council, though incomplete, since a third of deputies are not here, 9 million voters are not represented in the Supreme Council. Nevertheless, you are the legitimate, constitutional Supreme Council, and you bear the greatest responsibility for a way we will form the government. History must know of this. What sort of government we will form is the exclusive provenance of the Supreme Council. Any political passions, any insinuations -- who wants what and how -- must be rejected if we really love Ukraine. I want us to establish strong executive authorities, legitimate legislative authorities, and the president with precise and clear powers. If we do that, there will be a need to go to the polls on 26 June. It does not matter who will win. I have never objected to that.
