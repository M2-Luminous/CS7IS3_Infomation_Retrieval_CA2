Klimek: "Dangerous Union; Marian Krzaklewski Says: I Know People Take Part in Strikes...."] [Text] "Really, you do not need to persuade people too hard to get them to strike," Piotr Zak, Solidarity National Commission spokesman, insists. "The authorities refuse to recognize the truth that social discontent does exist in real life and is not something our union has conjured up." For two weeks now, strike action organized by the NSZZ [Independent and Self-Financing Trade Union] Solidarity has been carried out on a nationwide scale. To date, no other major central union (except for Kontra, which, as its very name suggests, can probably be expected to endorse all protest actions) has come out in support. "Society Will Pay" "We are definitely against strikes because their political objectives are hard to conceal. Solidarity leadership has launched yet another attempt to impose its political will on enterprise work forces on the pretext of defending their interests, but, in fact, it is society that will pay for the present strikes--and not for the first time, either," the Mining Industry's Trade Unions Confederation, which groups all of the major miners' unions outside Solidarity, declares in an official announcement. "I know that people are taking part in strikes," Solidarity chairman Marian Krzaklewski attempts to explain. "It must be that there is not sufficient control between the central union administration and union members here." Solidarity, led by Krzaklewski, has put all of its money on one horse in organizing the nationwide strike action. Chairman Krzaklewski has been touring the country attempting to incite people to strike or to fan the flames of those strikes that have already been started. It seems, however, that his efforts are not particularly effective. Whereas on the first day the strike organizers were successful in stopping the work of more than 1,000 enterprises, the second day brought only half that number, and, during the following days, only a dozen or so work places were still going on with the protest action. The number of striking coal mines has also remained constant. They are for the most part quite weak enterprises, some of which are even destined to be liquidated. Despite vigorous attempts by the Solidarity Silesia-Dabrowa Regional Board, coal mines belonging to the most powerful Katowice Coal Holding concern have resisted invitations to join the strike and stop production. Yesterday's attempts to start a railroad strike proved that people nowadays are beginning to think of the consequences before stopping work. In many enterprises, the strike is carried out in a purely symbolic manner. For example, at the Defuma plant in Dabrowa Gornicza, which is the only enterprise in Silesia apart from the coal mines to have joined the strike, the protest action lasted all of two hours, while the organizers cheerfully declared that they would soon make up for the stoppage. At the Czeczott coal mine, all 22 strikers--that is, less than 1 percent of the crew working the first shift--gathered at the mine's Solidarity headquarters and, after assessing the situation, returned promptly to work. At the Piast coal mine, the strike was limited to the mechanical coal-processing plant, which nevertheless stopped the work of the whole mine because the coal extracted underground was not taken up to the surface. Will We Have Another Panama? The demands announced by Solidarity cannot be met quickly, and some of them are even impossible to implement in practical terms. For example, Chairman Krzaklewski interprets the demand to "enfranchise all society" as follows: "The government oligarchy intends to share the privatized enterprises among themselves. We will have a similar situation to the one they had in Panama, where 20,000 people took over 70 percent of the national assets. But, if you hang on to your privatization bonds and pool them, you will be able to outbid any red capitalist!" That was a fragment of Krzaklewski's rousing address to the striking miners at the Jastrzebie coal mine, who greeted it with tumultuous applause. "Now we can appreciate the importance of studying psychology and sociology in relation to the sphere of ownership transformations, and the significance of cooperation between specialists in these fields and experts in economic restructuring," Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol remarked after signing the agreement that led to the miners' ending their 10-day strike. "The government has been familiar with the union's demands for a long time," Piotr Zak insists, "at the very least since the end of the experts' talks on 26 March, when eight demands were officially recorded at the Council of Ministers Office [URM] and entered, neatly and perfectly legibly, into the URM computer. I personally checked it as it was being done. I believe that ministers have had more than enough time to acquaint themselves with the document." Zak's own declarations can dispel anyone's illusions about Solidarity's long-term aims. "I was amused to hear Minister Miller claim that parliament is working on a pact. A similar situation in the recent past led, among other things, to the collapse of Hanna Suchocka's government, and now another government, which has been in office for seven months already, claims that it needs still more time." To Regain Lost Positions The union's decisionmakers, who still remember the old left-wing government's traditional inclination to be severe and tough in its treatment of strikes and strikers, are trying to recapture the remains of the ethos of the great strike wave of the 1980's and thereby regain their positions as public leaders. After all, on the other side of the barricades, they no longer have a poor but honest government hailing from the "polystyrene" era [reference to striking shipyard workers sleeping on blocks of polystyrene during the Gdansk shipyard occupation in 1980], but the much-hated postcommunists, who batten on the working men's misery. It is true that they were elected in a democratic process, but they still represent the last chance for Solidarity as the latter continues to lose its membership and its influence because, if Solidarity fails to successfully "galvanize" the country against the present government team, the ones that follow it will easily withstand every future protest action.
