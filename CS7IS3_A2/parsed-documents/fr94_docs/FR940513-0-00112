FR940513-0-00112 FR940513-0-00029 51. In implementing this program, we will borrow from our existing tax certificate program and grant tax certificates, upon request, that will enable the licensees and investors meeting the criteria outlined here to defer the gain realized upon a sale either by: (1) Treating it as an involuntary conversion under 26 U.S.C. 1033, with the recognition of gain avoided by the acquisition of qualified replacement property; or (2) electing to reduce the basis of certain depreciable property; or both. Tax certificates will be available to initial investors in minority and women-owned businesses who provide ``start-up'' financing, which allows these businesses to acquire licenses at auction or in the aftermarket, and those investors who purchase interests within the first year after license issuance, which allows for the stabilization of the designated entities' capital base. Also, in accordance with our existing policy, to be eligible for a tax certificate, such investor transactions must not reduce minority or female ownership or control in the entity below 50.1 percent. The definition of a minority or female-owned entity is set forth in the Second Report and Order and, with regard to our investor tax certificate policy, the entity in which the investment is made must satisfy that definition at the time of the original investment as well as after the investor's shares are sold. For after-market sales, tax certificates will only be issued to licensees who sell to entities that meet that definition. Tax certificates will be granted only upon completion of the sale, although parties can request a declaratory ruling from the Commission regarding the tax consequences of prospective transactions. 52. As with our other tax certificate policies, we wish to deter ``sham'' arrangements to obtain tax certificates and, pursuant to Section 309(j)(4)(E), therefore adopt measures to prevent unjust enrichment. First, we intend to enforce strictly the definitions adopted in the Second Report and Order and will carefully review investment and purchase arrangements to ensure that 50.1 percent control and equity by minorities and women was, and will be maintained. Second, like our existing tax certificate program, 86 we will impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer or assignment of IVDS licenses obtained through the benefit of tax certificates. We believe that the rapid resale of such licenses to non-minorities or women at a profit would subvert our goal of ensuring the opportunity to participate by minority and women-owned businesses. The well-established one-year holding period would prevent this type of unjust enrichment. While this restriction will not be applied to assignments or transfers to qualified minority and female-owned businesses, assignees and transferees obtaining licenses pursuant to this exception will be subject to the one-year holding requirement. 86 See Amendment of Section 73.3597 of the Commission's Rules, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 99 FCC 2d 971, 974 (1985). D. Installment Payments 53. In this Fourth Report and Order, we adopt the preference of installment payments and limit its use to small businesses. Permitting a winning bidder to pay by installment payments is the equivalent of having the government extend credit to the bidder. Using this option, a prospective licensee may not need to rely as heavily on private financing either before or after an auction. As a result, this method is an effective way to promote the participation of designated entities in the provision of spectrum-based services, and is an effective means to distribute licenses and services among geographics areas. 87 In the Second Report and Order, we decided that the option of installment payments should be extended only to small businesses (including those held by minorities and women), and then only in instances where smaller spectrum blocks are being auctioned and the use of the blocks is very likely to match the business objectives of bona fide small businesses. 88 With the IVDS, the spectrum blocks are relatively small and the potential difficulties associated with permitting this option in the context of larger spectrum blocks (e.g., undercapitalization) are not present. We also find that, because of the expected relatively low capital entry requirements for the IVDS and the potential variety of offerings 89 that might result from the service, the IVDS will offer a bona fide business opportunity to small businesses. 87 Second Report and Order at ¶¶231&hyph;233. 88 Id. at ¶¶234&hyph;237. We noted that the legislative history of the Budget Act indicates that large entities with established revenue streams are not intended beneficiaries of the installment payments preference. Id. at ¶236. 89 See note 3, supra . 54. Therefore, we will permit the use of installment plans for all IVDS auctions, and follow the general procedures given in the Second Report and Order for the use of this preference. 90 . The installment payment option will enable all small businesses to pay the full amount of their winning bid in installments (less the upfront payment, which must be paid in full, and the down payment, half of which is due five days after the auction closes and the other half five days after the application is granted). Timely payments of all installments will be a condition of the license grant, and failure to make such timely payments on or before the date due may be grounds for revocation. 91. 90 Under these general procedures, for example, only interest payments will be due for the first two years, with principal and interest both being amortized over the remaining years of the license. Also, interest charges will be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to that of five-year U.S. Treasury notes, to track the IVDS license term of five years. See Second Report and Order at ¶239. If a small business making installment payments seeks to transfer a license to a non-small business entity during the term of the license, we will require payment of the remaining principal balance as a condition of the license transfer. Id. at ¶263. 91 Limited grace periods for defaulting licensees may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Id. at ¶240.
