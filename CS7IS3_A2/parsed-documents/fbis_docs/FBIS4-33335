Argentina's plans to acquire a new nuclear plant are expressed in a document signed with Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. (AECL), which will be in charge of conducting a feasibility study for installing a Candu-3 reactor, similar to the one installed at the Embalse nuclear plant in Cordoba. The new nuclear plant would cost about $600 million. There are at least two curious things about this report. One is that AECL Chairman Bruce Howe himself admitted before the Canadian Congress that the economic viability of the kind of reactor Argentina is interested in buying is "doubtful". The second is that in response to CLARIN, the CNEA press office admitted only yesterday that "negotiations have been under way, although nothing has been signed." This contradicts a report on the signing of the agreement, which was published in the 17 March issue of NUCLEONICS WEEK, the most prestigious publication on international nuclear industry matters. Even more curious is the title of this article: "Despite the Unclear Economics of Candu-3, Argentina Will Try." The article states that "despite AECL's doubts about the economic viability of Candu-3, the company is trying to sell it abroad (...).'' It also announces the signing of a memorandum of understanding with CNEA to conduct a feasibility study to interconnect a 450 megawatt reactor to the Argentine energy generator system. According to biologist Raul Montenegro, chairman of the Foundation for the Defense of the Environment [Fundacion para la Defensa del Ambiente] (FUNAM), the idea of installing in Argentina a reactor that "the Canadians themselves believe is not economical shows that Argentina continues to be the test tube for developed countries." Although CNEA has officially denied the signing of this agreement, an important CNEA researcher has confirmed the report to CLARIN. He asserted that "no reactor of this kind is yet operating in the entire world." This means that if this reactor is installed in Argentina, it will be the first ever, the same as happened with Atucha-1, which -- according to experts -- resulted in so many problems precisely because it was a prototype whose manufacture was later discontinued, and which had not been previously tested. The report not only contradicts the international trend to reduce the use of nuclear energy in the production of electricity. It also seems to contradict the theory upheld by some government areas: In the last issue of ECONOMIC NEWS magazine -- issued by the Mediterranean Foundation, connected, naturally, to Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo -- Economist Juan Novara states that "contrary to what is publicized, nuclear energy is not clean, cheap, or price competitive." The "fourth nuclear plant," is, however, not as contradictory within the framework of the program to privatize all nuclear plants. This idea is promoted by Cavallo himself, on the basis of the deficit in this area: Because about $900 million per year are invested in nuclear energy, and only $300 million obtained from energy sales, this deficit could be decreased by allowing private business to be in charge of selling electricity and the government in charge of its control. A country that offers four nuclear plants, instead of the two that are currently operating, would be more attractive. Perhaps all these doubts (economic efficiency, privatization, which is still resisted within the CNEA, and naturally, the risks that nuclear energy entails) may have caused an apparently simple commercial transaction to become a state secret. The memorandum signed between Argentina and Canada does not specify the work to be done, or where the future nuclear plant would be installed. This will be the fourth nuclear plant, if Atucha-2 is ever completed. It can be ascertained, however, that this information is being studied, as according to what AECL reported in March, the agreement estimates that "the first results will be provided by mid-year." Half of the year has passed already, and CNEA has not even reported the existence of this memorandum of understanding. Raul Montenegro, former Cordoba Province energy under secretary, has informed CLARIN, however, that "logical economics on the output of this type of reactor state that it would be viable only if it were situated next to the Embalse Rio Tercero nuclear plant." This is not an outlandish idea if we consider that the site next to the Embalse Rio Tercero nuclear plant was preselected about eight years ago, when the idea of installing a fourth nuclear plant was still prevalent. CNEA experts consulted by CLARIN agreed with this theory. They said: "There are very few sites in the country where this reactor would be economically viable. Embalse Rio Tercero is one of those."
