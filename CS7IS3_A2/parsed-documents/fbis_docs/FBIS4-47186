The agreement was signed by L. Bochyn, head of the Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support of New Economic Structures and V. Yermakov, head of the State Committee for the Protection of Consumer Rights in Ukraine. There was a press conference after the signing of the agreement. --How will the agreement benefit the rank and file consumers? the journalists asked L. Bochyn. --The signing of the agreement will untie our hands, so to speak, and will help to control our Russian, and your Ukrainian unscrupulous producers, to resolve problems of technical servicing of comples domestic technology such as radio sets, constructed in both countries, and guarantee spare parts, etc. In other words, normal, civilized forms of cooperation between countries will be in effect. --But many feel that the law of Ukraine concerning consumers rights protection, let us say, is more oriented towards the interests of consumers, than the corresponding law of the Russian Federation. Won't these discrepancies become a stumbling block in consumer rights protection in Ukraine? --In order for consumers of Ukraine and Russia to be an equal level, says L. Bochyn, we must first make the laws equal. But in the final analysis, it is not a matter of the constitutionality of the law but its realization; the specific protection of consumer rights. If we go through 16.5 thousand cases and they all turn out to the advantage of the consumer - this says something. Normally, any type of law requires a definite compromise between enterprises-manufacturers and structures called on to protect consumers. --What do you expect from this agreement?, V. Yermakov was asked. --Ukraine's main foreign economic partner is the Russian Federation. Therefore the absence of an agreement as to the regulation of processes that take place at consumer markets, problems connected with mutual supply of goods, and the guarantee of their quality and other issues, did not allow consumers of both countries to fully realize their rights with respect to legislation in force in Ukraine and Russia. There are such agreements now. The time has come to work out the mechanics, so that the agreement would work for the people. We think that the acceptance of the agreement will help to improve the situation in the consumer market of Ukraine and Russia, answered V. Yermakov. Well, we expect that now we will not be denied, let us say, service, repair or return of highly complex domestic technology on the grounds that it is made in Russia, and they will not ignore us when we complain about the poor quality of goods made in a neighboring country. To the point, in agreements for active trade cooperation between member countries of CIS, the problem of protection of consumer rights against poor quality products, which the partner countries are supplying, takes on a particular concreteness. Russia has made similar agreements with the Kirghiz Republic and preparatory work is being carried out with the Kazakhstan Republic. Of course, Ukraine also will not be limited by its agreement with Russia. Because it is necessary to protect the consumer in the whole economic expanse of the member countries of the commonwealth. For now there is an agreement only with Russia. But the main thing is that it work. If, of course the sides which reached an agreement, are not bounded by declarations, but develop positive mechanisms for our protection and in their compromises between producers and consumers do not forget the basic rule: the consumer is always right.
