FR940816-1-00088 FR940816-1-00011 (8) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated within the first 5 years after the first year of releases of wolves to determine future management needs. This review will take into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the individuals released in the area, as well as the overall health of the experimental wolves. Once recovery goals are met for downlisting or delisting the species, a rule will be proposed to address downlisting or delisting. (9) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential experimental'' designation. The Service does not foresee any likely situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental status until the gray wolf is recovered and delisted in the Northern Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act.
