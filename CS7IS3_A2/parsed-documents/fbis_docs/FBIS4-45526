With the case still under investigation, EL NUEVO HERALD added things that have not been alleged here in Colombia. In turn, President-elect Ernesto Samper sent the following letter to the editors of EL NUEVO HERALD--Messrs. (David Lorenz), (Bob Scribford), and (Sandra Keys)--and Roberto Suarez, a reporter for THE MIAMI HERALD and EL NUEVO HERALD: Dear Gentlemen: With suprise and indignation I read today the report that appeared in EL NUEVO HERALD, according to which the U.S. Government has confirmed I received money from the Cali Cartel for my electoral campaign. In addition, the report presents a totally false story that contains slanderous remarks I am not willing to let go unchallenged, not only for the sake of my own dignity but for that of all of Colombia. I have never received money from any criminal organization to fund my political activities, as demonstrated by my campaign ledgers. These ledgers show that we carefully monitored the origin of campaign funds. As president-elect of all citizens of Colombia, I renounce the article published today, and I demand that you correct the false information in this report, which damages my honor and the honor of my country. [Signed] Yours Truly, Ernesto Samper Pizano
