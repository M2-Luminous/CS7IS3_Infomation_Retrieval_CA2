FBIS4-48715 "drafr101_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-101 Daily Report 22 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA KwaZulu Units Said To Receive Terrorism Training KwaZulu Units Said To Receive Terrorism Training MB2205115294 Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English 22 May 94 p 4 MB2205115294 Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES English BFN [Report by Ray Hartley] [Text] KwaZulu self-protection unit recruits were allegedly given gruesome training in terrorism -- including how to set fire to a bus so passengers could not escape -- at a camp under the command of Inkatha senator Phillip Powell. Details of the training at Mlaba camp, about 40km from Ulundi, and a dramatic election day raid by TEC [Transition Executive Council] officials, are contained in a confidential report which has been handed to President Nelson Mandela. The report, compiled by TEC investigator Howard Varney and dated May 19, said information had alleged the trainees "were preparing for disruptive action over the election period." Demonstrations of the bus-burning technique were carried out at a grenade training site on the Umfolozi river bed, a former camp trainee told the TEC investigator. He said trainees were also taught how to construct homemade bombs. Instruction was provided on how to sabotage a vehicle by tampering with the battery so that "when the vehicle is started, the battery will explode". Training, which took place using illegal weapons allegedly supplied by officials in the KwaZulu government and police, also covered the use of "AK-47s, Makarovs, Uzis, pump action shotguns, limpet mines, pistols (and) R1 rifles", the report said. The investigation prompted TEC officials Mac Maharaj and Fanie van der Merwe to accompany the Maritzburg SAP's [South African Police] Major-General Wynand van der Merwe on an unsuccessful raid of the camp, which raised questions about police partiality. On arrival near the camp site on April 26, the group agreed that General van der Merwe would land his helicopter in the camp first and persuade Mr Powell to allow a search of the facility, but this plan had to be aborted. "Persons in the crowd picked up stones and the helicopter made a hasty retreat." The helicopter flew to a nearby 121 Battalion Base, where TEC, police and SANDF [South African National Defence Force] officials decided that "firm action would be taken against the camp". The local Internal Stability Division, under a Major Pelser, was instructed to set up a roadblock to prevent trainees and equipment from leaving the camp, and a mechanised SADF [South African Defence Force] back-up made its way to the camp. The SADF contingent was scheduled to arrive on the morning of April 27, in time for a full search. "It was decided and agreed that it was of vital importance that all personnel in the camp be properly processed and that they be held until this had happened," the report said. But, once the TEC officials had left the scene to return to Maritzburg, the trainees were allowed through the police road-block. Major Pelser claimed he had no orders to prevent the trainees from leaving the base and that buses were searched at the roadblock. But General van der Merwe said most of the buses had departed before the roadblock was set up. "The departure of most of the trainees from the base without any processing by the police constitutes a major setback to the investigation," Mr Varney said in the report. Police entered the camp with the permission of Mr Powell shortly before midnight to find it had been abandoned in haste. A rondavel "allegedly under the control of Phillip Powell" was searched and G3 rifles, handgrenades, rifle grenades, shotguns and ammunition were seized. Mr Powell's vehicle was searched and a homemade weapon was seized. "This homemade shotgun is apparently the same type that was manufactured by the former C10 (Vlakplaas) persons named in the Goldstone report," the report said. The KwaZulu government intended deploying as many as 1,000 of the trainees in the KwaZulu Police as special or assistant constables, but this had not been done. A thousand rifles that Mr Powell tried to purchase from Eskom could have been destined for the trainees, the report said. Mr Varney called for a thorough inquiry into training at the Mlaba camp and the procurement of weapons used in the training. Mr Powell could not be reached for comment.
