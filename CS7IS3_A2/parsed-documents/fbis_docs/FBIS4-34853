Morales said this is very healthy for the hemisphere because it opens the way to a degree of economic unity that will put the hemisphere in a more advantageous position to negotiate with other regional groups in the world. The ACS will include three regional blocs: the Caribbean Common Market, CARICOM; the Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration, SIECA; and the G-3, which includes Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia. Morales also said that heads of state of the member countries will meet in the Barbadian capital on 4 July to establish the ACS, an intergovernmental organization for regional teamwork, consultation, and cooperation.
