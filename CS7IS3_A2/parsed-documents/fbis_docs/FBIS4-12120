His testimony lasted five hours and was given on camera. The prime minister came out from a side door and refused to answer journalists' questions. Our legal affairs correspondent Hadar Vismonsky reports: Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister and defense minister whose face we did not see today at all because he walked in and came out through a side door to evade the cameras, gave a long testimony. For five long hours, Rabin was questioned on camera by the five members of the commission of inquiry. He was accompanied by the legal adviser of the Prime Minister's Office and by Cabinet Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein. The prime minister's testimony actually concluded the commission's 15th day of work and the first stage of the hearings. Within the next few weeks, the commission members will meet in order to formulate their initial conclusions and to decide whether any people are liable to be affected by these conclusions. If there are such people, they will be sent warning letters and be summoned for another hearing, this time accompanied by their lawyers. As said, the first stage of the Shamgar commission's work is over. Over the next few weeks, the commission will proceed with consultations.
