Zoran Vaskovic reports from the Assembly building. [Begin Vaskovic recording] Mirko Marjanovic, prime minister-elect, is first expected to present his program and propose the ministers for the new government. A debate is expected to follow. The vote will be in a package, as the saying goes, and secret, unless the deputies decide that the vote should be public. The government will be elected if over half the deputies in the Assembly, that is, at least 126 deputies, decide to give it a vote of confidence. [passage omitted] Radio Belgrade will broadcast in full the presentation of Prime Minister-elect Marjanovic. At the moment there are still some empty seats in the hall, but the deputies are arriving. This is all for now from the Serbian Assembly building.
