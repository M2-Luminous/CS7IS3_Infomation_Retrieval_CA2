To be sure, sales and production in international markets are part of the everyday picture for most medium-sized companies as well. But this is by no means participating in the global competition. For that reason, Europe's businesses could deprive themselves of their future if they don't change their way of thinking. The organization of enterprises is much more oriented toward local conditions. But if global competition is misunderstood in this manner, even the most renowned producers could lose their position in the market. It is therefore important for the management to organize the company globally, which is far removed from "Develop and produce here, sell there." This global know-how does not involve merely the geography of the business activity but involves thinking past the edge of the national dinner plate. And in so doing, the question "Is our company even prepared for global competition?" unavoidably emerges. In order to create certainty, the company management should specify the way into the future and clearly define the goals. Pure financial planning would be no substitute for strategy here. Of course, status quo is also not a guarantee for the future in global competition. A good position in Europe, for example in telecommunications, by no means results in a leading position in the international markets. European companies should quickly accept this fact, or else their domestic position will also be in jeopardy in the future. It is evident even today that, for example in the field of high technology, no European enterprise is any longer participating in shaping the future. "Sure, Siemens or Olivetti are very strong in Europe and help determine the markets. But the longer the distance from which one looks at the companies, the smaller their importance appears," says Hewitt. Truly global enterprises, on the other hand, are present everywhere. And if you take that as the standard, you must also be concerned about the European automobile industry. A glance at the streets of Asia or America should correct Europe's judgement of itself. Not even the bastion of high-priced cars has held. The stylish European manufacturers have now clearly felt the quality-offensive from the Far East. Even so, the impression remains that many Europeans still have not grasped the situation in earnest. Hewitt thinks that the only chance is repeatedly to make it clear to those responsible that not only have the economic rules of the game changed, but that an entirely new game is now being played. This can be compared to England's situation in the postwar era; there, too, attempts were made to keep or further develop the old virtues and capabilities. This was the reason that the connection was missed. What remains is only nostalgia--such as for the auto names of Triumph or Aston Martin. Reversing this process is an urgent task for the management. There are enough examples of this as well, such as British Airways. This airline has a past as a totally insufficiently managed state-owned enterprise and is today one of the leading airlines in the world. The inertia in industry also led to new, innovative products no longer being created in the old companies, as the "garage manufacturers" at Sachsen Computer have repeatedly proved. "Part of the way the rules of the game have changed is also that strangers to the industry suddenly take up a production and do it very successfully," says Hewitt and refers to the conflicts between Nintendo and Atari in computer games, Toshiba and IBM in laptop computers and Canon with ex-champion Xerox in copying.
