The June polls gave three percent to the NDS (5 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak parliament) and six percent to Premier Jozef Moravcik's DU (14 deputies). Two weeks ago Moravcik offered the NDS to run on the DU slate and to get three seats in parliament provided the parties succeed in the elections, Cernak said. On Saturday [18 June] the NDS central council approved a decision of its executive committee to join the DU list of candidates. This is the best way for the party how to "appeal to non-left-orientated and non-Meciarite" voters, Cernak said. The decision is subject to approval by the DU national council which will take place on Saturday. Although it had opted for a separate candidature in the elections, it is likely to change the tack. Two weeks ago Cernak said that the "NDS is almost certain to run the elections on the KDH (Christian Democratic Movement) list." At present, the offers from the DU and KDH are "of about the same quality," Cernak stated.
