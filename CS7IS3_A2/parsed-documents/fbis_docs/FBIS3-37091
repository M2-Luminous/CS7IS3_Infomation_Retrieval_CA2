Why? [Nazarbayev] I am afraid that this infamous dual citizenship would split our society. With a recently issued ukase I have fundamentally changed some not particularly fortunate passages of the Kazakh Law on Citizenship. I passed on to Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin the draft treaty on principles associated with the acquisition of citizenship in Kazakhstan and in Russia. We should adopt laws that facilitate this. [Quiring] On the eve of elections in Russia statements by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev that Russia wants to protect the interests of its fellow citizens in the former Union republics caused excitement. How do you see this today, after Zhirinovskiy's election success? [Nazarbayev] The key phrase is "on the eve of elections." An election campaign has its own laws. However, I am also quite sure that such statements have not at all reassured the Russians who live in national republics -- in particular not those who never had these problems. [Quiring] In Kazakhstan almost 50 percent of the population are Russian. What is your point of view about this fact? [Nazarbayev] I am completely calm when I think of the act that in Kazakhstan there are 8 million Kazakhs and 5 million Russians. Some media want to see a problem where there is none. Often there is talk of migration. However, this process is unavoidable also under normal circumstances, all the more so when an empire collapses. Kazakhstan, like Russia, is a multinational state. For many centuries Kazakhs here have lived together not only with Russians, but also with Ukrainians, Belarusians, Germans, Poles, Uigurs, Dunganes, and -- since the fateful time of the Stalinist deportations -- also with Koreans, Chechens, Ingushes, and Turko- Mezhets. I am convinced that there will be no ethnic conflict in Kazakhstan. [Quiring] But emigration continues to increase? [Nazarbayev] I am seriously worried about that. Many Germans, for instance, are leaving us. As regards the Russians, I can give you the following figures: Last year more than 200,000 left the country, not only for Russia. By 1990 80,000 to 100,000 people left our republic every year. An approximately equal number came to us. However, when listing the current migration figures, one forgets -- for whatever reason -- to note that last year about 160,000 Russians came to Kazakhstan. [Quiring] Among the political personalities who brought about the end of the USSR, you are considered to be one of the most far-sighted. Most recently, you have distanced yourself from Moscow. How do you see the development of relations with Russia? [Nazarbayev] Thank you for the compliment, but I was not invited to "seal the end." In fact, I have always advocated integration in all spheres of our life. Now, also, I am of the view that only together can we can find a way out of the crisis. I cannot agree with the second part of your question. We are not distancing ourselves from Moscow. On the contrary, we are striving for closer contacts within the framework of the CIS. For this purpose, however, we must bring our laws closer together; we must form a common parliament and a common government, for which one could take the Consultative Coordination Committee of the CIS as a basis. We must immediately establish customs, banking, payment, and other unions, as they are envisaged in our treaty on the economic union. [Quiring] For a long time you were one of the most active advocates of the CIS. After the collapse of the ruble zone, do you still believe that the CIS has a future? [Nazarbayev] The introduction of an independent currency -- and I have said so often -- was a forced step. Right to the end we hoped to find a joint solution with Russia for the ruble problem. However, the conditions proved to be unacceptable. However, nothing bad happened for anybody. The difficulties, which are linked with the introduction of national currencies, are unavoidable in view of the temporary delineation. However, it cannot be ruled out that we can come to a common circulation of money in the future, perhaps even to the creation of a common currency, following the model of the European Union. [Quiring] In contrast to Russia, the parliament and the local soviets in Kazakhstan have dissolved peacefully. Still, is this a rejection of parliamentary democracy? [Nazarbayev] Not at all! Now more than ever the republic needs a professional, constantly working parliament, which is able to adopt laws of a high quality and thus to establish a reliable basis for the reforms, which we are implementing. The special powers given to the president are valid only until a new parliament is convened and apply only to issues, which are linked with the economic reform. The elections for the new parliament will be held on 7 March 1994.
