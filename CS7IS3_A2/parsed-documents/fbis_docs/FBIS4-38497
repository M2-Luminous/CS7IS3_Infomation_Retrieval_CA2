"It is not the matter of conflict between the chairman of the State Committee for Property and me, but essential differences in the vitally important issue of the implementation of the state privatization program". Commenting on the recent appeal of Anatoliy Chubays to the Russian procurator general's office in connection with the Moscow mayor's privatization resolutions, Luzhkov said "I accept this proposal of Mr Chubays with readiness, but I want him to visit the procurator general's office together with me. I am convinced that it is not my privatization resolutions that run counter to the law but resolutions of the State Property Committee". In the opinion of Luzhkov, "the state institution has usurped the right to solve all problems in privatization and sometimes makes serious mistakes" . "We think that property should be sold and not squandered or given away dirt cheap to anyone. That is why, I believe that voucher privatization is a swindle to be investigated by the procurator general due to the inadmissibility to squander state property," he stressed. Asked about major drawbacks in privatization, Luzhkov said "I am sure that privatization a la Chubays has brought almost no positive results. It brought us no additional property. It only ruins the state. Russia gained no new owners and proprietors, as Chubays has promised. Privatization resulted in an enormous number of speculators who are looking for an opportunity to sell at high prices what they have bought dirt cheap".
