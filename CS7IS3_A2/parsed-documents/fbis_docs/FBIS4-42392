When demonstrators tried to break through the cordon around the speaker's rostrum, the police used clubs. Several demonstrators were arrested. A few policemen and demonstrators were slightly injured. Even though Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria, who was the speaker at the rally, and "League of Free Citizens" Chairman Manfred Brunner could barely be heard because of the ear-splitting noise, the rally was not interrupted. Haider and Brunner thanked the Hamburg police for "protecting us against the leftist mob." The demonstrators repeatedly chanted "German policemen protect fascists" or "Everyone wants the same thing -- throw Haider into the Elbe River." The "League of Free Citizens" considers itself to be conservative-liberal. It primarily opposes the Maastricht Treaty, which would turn Germany into a European province, "but we want a Europe of the fatherlands, of nations."
