In an interview with EL UNIVERSO, this official emphasized that the goals set for the government do not mean that a period of stagnation lies ahead for the economy. On the contrary, the reactivation of the productive apparatus will basically be supported by the dynamism of the private sector, and in part by the improvement in the levels of public investment. Armijos explained that despite the fact that production growth came to about 2 percent in 1993, as compared with 3.5 percent in 1992, the rate of growth in the gross formation of fixed capital exceeded 50 percent. This represents growth that is greater than the increase in the population. "Greater growth in productive activity, in both the public and private sectors, is expected in 1994," she said. Inflation Below 20 Percent She stated that the government will seek to provide the economy with responsible fiscal management in 1994, making it possible to consolidate the reduction in inflation at a rate of less than 20 percent by the end of 1994. Armijos did not mention the goal of 15-percent annual inflation for 1994, to which reference has been made over the past several months, in what might be interpreted as one of the principal effects of the most recent fiscal crisis. Armijos said that as of the end of 1993, the greatest social benefit provided to the people of Ecuador by the government of Sixto Duran-Ballen has been the reduction in inflation. This official refuted the criticisms voiced by businessmen who maintain that on balance 1993 was a year of recession. She went on to say that intermediary credit for the financial sector increased by 30 percent, in real terms, so that it can be said that the formal sector had adequate resources for the financing of its activities. Armijos said that the monetary and foreign-exchange boards will continue to be used in 1994. This will make strict control of liquidity possible. She further said that it is expected that the amendments to the Law on the Monetary System will be "taken up and approved by the Congress" within the first two months of the year. Our interview with the head of the body that directs the economy follows. [Cardenas] How do you assess the economic activity in 1993, as 1994 begins? What is the legacy left for the new year? [Armijos] In the year just ended, it was possible to reduce inflation to 31 percent--a goal that for more than five years, the preceding governments were unable to achieve. The goal for the reduction of inflation was reached thanks to the responsible, consistent, and concerted effort made in the monetary and fiscal sectors. Other important achievements include the stabilization of the rate of exchange, the stabilization of the financial market, and a substantial reduction in the fiscal deficit. In addition, the foreign sector was strengthened, enabling the country to accumulate reserves of more than $1 billion since the program was adopted. In 1993, the country made progress toward the more flexible use of the tools of economic policy. Better management of the utilization of the tools of monetary policy based on the market was achieved. A new system was designed for interest rates, allowing greater flexibility for the middlemen and greater efficiency in the allocation of financial resources. And the foreign-exchange policy was made fully flexible, with a view to rendering the establishment of the most important price in the economy--the rate of exchange--a much clearer process. [Cardenas] What is the lesson taught by the achievement of the inflationary goal in the year just ended? Are there some who maintain that it is a relative success? [Armijos] There is no sense in speaking of a relative success when we have succeeded in reducing the rate of inflation from 60 percent in December of 1992 to 31 percent in December of 1993. This is the greatest social benefit the government of architect Sixto Duran-Ballen has given the people of Ecuador. The reduction of the rate of inflation to 31 percent and the maintenance of macroeconomic stability have additionally allowed investors to plan their activities with greater confidence. And what is more, they have expanded their investment horizons into the medium time range. [Cardenas] What the productive sectors have suffered has without a doubt been a recession, rather than a slowdown. How can this situation be improved in the new year if recession does reoccur in 1994? [Armijos] The major increase in intermediate credit for the financial sector, which was 30 percent in real terms in 1993, allows us to say that the formal sector had adequate resources for the financing of its activities. The initial estimates indicate that an increase of approximately two percent in production growth was planned for 1993, as compared with the growth of 3.5 percent seen in 1992. It should be noted, however, that the rate of growth in the gross formation of fixed capital for this year exceeds 50 percent. In real terms, this represents growth greater than the increase in the population. Still greater growth in productive activity is expected in 1994, with the impetus being provided by the greater gross formation of fixed capital in both the public and private sectors. In fact, the state budget provides for projects of vital importance that will promote growth in various sectors. [Cardenas] In your opinion what are the economic prospects for 1994? [Armijos] In 1994, the government will seek to provide the economy with responsible fiscal management, making it possible to consolidate the reduction in inflation and to lower the inflation rate to less than 20 percent by the end of 1994. This responsible fiscal management will involve a major reduction in current expenditures and a substantial improvement in tax and customs management, which will serve to generate additional budget resources. This does not mean that a phase of stagnation will begin for the economy. On the contrary, the reactivation of the productive apparatus will be due basically to the dynamism in the public sector, and in part, to the improvement in the levels of public investment. This dynamism will be based on the maintenance of foreign-exchange stability, a level of interest rates consistent with inflationary expectations, and a considerable increase in productivity. It must be pointed out that the growth seen in 1993 was achieved despite the implementation of a strict adjustment program, which reduced inflation. This is a result that has been achieved in very few countries in Latin America. [Cardenas] How much will the progress that may be achieved in the modernization of the state influence the economic prospects for the coming year? [Armijos] The approval, in 1994, of the Law on the Modernization of the State and its application will enable us to consolidate the efforts to ensure stability with growth and will provide the international community with a favorable picture of the scope and duration of the reforms in Ecuador. Modernization and monetary stability do not constitute just a situational phenomenon, but rather a permanent one. It will continue in our country and will sink deep roots in our society. [Cardenas] If it is not possible to realize the government's aspirations with regard to increased taxes and total income collected, might new measures be contemplated? [Armijos] As the vice president of the Republic has said, the results of the tax reform would justify a revision of the economic program for 1994. In addition, as was noted by the minister of finance, the first measure must be the restriction of the expenditures of the public sector, including both current expenditures and the investments initially planned for 1994. [Cardenas] What does the government hope to see in 1994 where the foreign debt is concerned? Might there be a definitive renegotiation, and along what lines are the negotiations progressing? Might the Monetary Board approve the foreign-debt conversion operations within the framework of the Securities Market Law? [Armijos] The renegotiation of the foreign debt is a slow process that is advancing as macroeconomic stabilization is achieved and as the country consolidates its foreign solvency. The intention of the government is to obtain an agreement on the renegotiation of the debt, because this will not only enable us to establish a better payments profile for the future, but will basically allow the consolidation of the credibility, for the international financial community, of our efforts in the realm of stabilization and modernization. Renegotiation will enable the country to obtain credit again and will expand the opportunities for domestic and foreign investment. However, despite all of the benefits we will derive from the renegotiation of the debt, the current government is not prepared to agree to conditions that will be burdensome for future generations. In this connection, progress is being made, with firmness and determination but without haste, taking the national interests into account. As to the debt-conversion operations, they will be governed by the overall renegotiation agreement achieved. [Cardenas] Several months have passed and we are still waiting for the amendments to the Law on the Monetary System. When will something concrete be known? Might some major alteration at the last moment be expected, as happened with the amendments to the Tax Law? [Armijos] The amendments to the Law on the Monetary System, duly approved by the Monetary Board, have been submitted to the president of the Republic for his approval and sent to the Congress. It is to be expected that they will be discussed and approved by the Congress in the course of the first two months of this year. The Law on the Monetary System is an eminently technical text designed to perfect that which was approved in 1992--that is to say, to introduce basic changes in the way shown to be necessary by the application of the law in effect, so that the Central Bank can fully carry out the proper functions of a currency-issuing institute. Auctions Have Not Threatened the State [Cardenas] Will the criticisms voiced by the securities-exchange sector because of the fact that the government has used auctions rather than the securities market be refuted? [Armijos] The negotiation of state bonds by the minister of finance through the Central Bank of Ecuador has its legal basis in Article 63 of the Regulations Governing the Securities Market Law. That article clearly provides for the possibility of placing the bonds issued by the state and bodies in the public sector by means of the auction mechanisms supported or used by the Central Bank of Ecuador. Such mechanisms are not just used by Ecuador, but are in place in the majority of other countries, such as the United States of America, Mexico, Chile, etc. The auction mechanism has not worked to the detriment of the interests of the state, because in the adjudication of the bonds in question, the reserve price was not relevant. This was because the bonds sold out at a higher price (90.01 percent), and the average weighted price at which they were adjudicated was also obviously higher (91.3333 percent) than this value. [Cardenas] Will the monetary policy for 1994 be linked with the continuity of open-market operations of the monetary and foreign-exchange board type? Will the issuance of monetary stabilization bonds perhaps entail a cost for the Central Bank? [Armijos] In fact, open-market operations are an effective tool that has made it possible to maintain strict control of the liquidity of the economy. And consequently, this has created the capacity for more efficient management of the variable monetary factors. Therefore, the use of this tool will be continued in 1994. Since the stabilization bonds are the securities being placed on this market, this does involve a cost for the Central Bank. However, it is a cost that has been carefully calculated and duly provided for in the budget of the issuing establishment.
