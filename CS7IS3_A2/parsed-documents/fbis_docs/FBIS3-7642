According to these sources, China understands that Kim Il-song has virtually refused to visit China. In the opinion of the Beijing sources, Kim Il-song is wary of the possibility that China might claim credit if the nuclear issue were resolved after he visited China because it would seem to have been resolved due to China's persuasion.
