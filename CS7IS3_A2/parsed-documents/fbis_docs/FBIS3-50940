The inspection, which began in December, began today with a visit to the San Antonio de los Banos Air Base. Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura; Division General Leopoldo Cintras Frias, chief of the Western Army; and Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Havana, as well as other secretaries, ministers, and PCC officials, accompanied Castro. The briefing on the combat readiness of the base was presented by Colonel Marrero Hernandez, chief of this historical air base which opened fire against the mercenary planes on the eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion and from which our scarce planes and intrepid pilots departed to confront the enemy in the Bay of Pigs. This base's revolutionary fire also frightened the U.S. from its overflights during the October Crisis. Despite special period difficulties, this large air and anti-air unit maintains its combat readiness and the spirit of struggle from those glorious days. It is also known for its pilots' participation in internationalist missions in Ethiopia and Angola. Castro showed interest in learning of the personnel's living conditions, food, housing, and other aspects of life on the base. He was told of a recent presentation of homes, and the progress made in several dozen more, which are to be completed this year. The food situation is improving to the extent that the unit's farming program develops, thanks to the unit's self-sufficiency efforts. They presently have over 700 hectares of arable land within the base's perimeter. Castro stated: "Let there not be a single corner left unplanted." Raul and his companions expressed interest in the characteristics of several planes. Lieutenant Col. Perez Perez, who had been a Camilito student, and later an internationalist-mission ace pilot, explained the capabilities of the antisubmarine helicopter [Mi-14] and Mig-29 [Fulcrum] fighters. An intense emulation program exists among the diverse Western Army maintenance units and those that contribute to the construction of extensive fortification projects such as the Sugar Industry Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry, and the Blas Roca Contingent. Raul presented emulation awards to a brigade of the Blas Roca that is working on project No. 70, and to the company working on project No. 26 in the depths of the earth of the fatherland. Both units surpassed their 1993 plans, as well as the required quality parameters. Raul extended warm words of experience to the dedicated soldiers and civilian workers, and toured the underground facility that will be completed this year. At the well-known Sonrisa de la Victoria Camp of Farm No. 2 of the Guira de Melena Miscellaneous Crops Enterprise, Raul and his companions conducted a thorough analysis of the work of the Youth Labor Army [EJT], which took over the management of this enterprise two months ago. The positive changes effected during this brief period were emphasized. The EJT has implemented a new annual plan structured according to week, type of farm, and crop; production and consumption norms, and a workday never shorter than eight hours. The plan will be adjusted to changing conditions resulting from increases in productivity, weather, shortages, and other factors. This farm has approximately 39 caballerias of fertile soil, and is 95-percent irrigated. The annual plan foresees producing 11,500 tons of tubers, grains, plantains, and garden vegetables. The work force consists of 221 EJT soldiers and 62 farmers. Over 91 percent of the workers are directly involved with the land. Seventy percent of the fuel will be used for irrigation, only 20 percent for agrarian machinery, since 31 ox teams will reduce the need for tractors. The remaining 10 percent will be used mainly for transportation, plus a minimal amount for administration work. According to Division General Rigoberto Garcia Fernandez, chief of the EJT, this situation is repeated in another 19 farms under EJT management, which is 40 percent of the state lands used for miscellaneous crops in Havana. The EJT has about 5,000 soldiers and regular workers in the province. The plan for 1994 is to surpass 4.5 million quintals. Another aspect analyzed in the meeting was the fight against crime and the operation of the Unified Vigilance and Protection System, based on the experiences of Guira de Melena municipality, and on the premises of the report presented by PCC provincial leader Pedro Zaez. The presence and contributions of Division General Carlos Fernandez Condin, Interior Ministry first vice minister; Justice Minister Carlos Amat; Supreme Court President Jose Raul Amaro; and Attorney General Juan Escalona enriched the discussion of this important issue which is more critical in a large food production area so close to the capital. A resolute effort against crime was noticed. It was stressed that the understanding of the mode of operation of cattle rustlers and agrarian product thieves should result in more specific measures within the framework of Cuban law. Raul spoke briefly to the farmworkers, told them of the ideas discussed at the meeting, and expressed his hope for them to achieve new and better work results, productivity, resource conservation, cost reductions, and high agrarian yields to benefit our people's food needs. Raul also briefly visited the Western Army intelligence unit where he was briefed on how this unit satisfactorily fulfills its mission. Raul showed great interest in the diverse facilities of the unit, and its outstanding and sophisticated equipment for the mission of discovering the enemies' plans for aggression against Cuba. Raul also observed a dexterous demonstration of martial exercises by the troops. The final stop in the tour was a visit to an antiair regiment where a brief demonstration of the operation of a modern SAM [surface to air missile] unit was observed. Central Committee members Eusebio Leal and Felipe Perez were invited to attend this final leg of the itinerary. The minister's final words, closing the extensive tour, were brief and eloquent: "The Western Army is in outstanding shape and is successfully fulfilling the five strategic goals of the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The western part of Cuba, as well as the entire island is an undefeatable bulwark."
