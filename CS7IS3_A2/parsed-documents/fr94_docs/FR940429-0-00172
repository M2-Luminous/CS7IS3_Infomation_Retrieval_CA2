FR940429-0-00172 FR940429-0-00015 Further, in response to comment, the reference to an application fee as an excludable fee has been deleted as it is not necessary to specifically allow for such an exclusion. The Secretary agrees with the commenters that asserted that an application fee should not be a factor in the calculation of an institutional refund for Title IV, HEA program purposes, because it is not an educational cost. The provision allowing for the exclusion of expended board credits in excess of the attributable prorated portion (proposed ยง668.22(c)(1)(iv)), based on the period attended by the student prior to withdrawal, has been removed. After further examination, the Secretary has found this provision to be excessively complicated and not entirely effective in the purpose intended. No support for this provision was received from commenters and the Secretary plans to revisit this issue in the future, after seeking further input from the financial aid community. Except for treatment under the provision in ยง668.22(c)(6)(i), all room and board charges must be included in the pro rata refund calculation and refunded at the applicable percentage, as required by the Amendments of 1992. The language of ยง668.22(c)(5) (and corresponding language in Appendix A) has been changed to clarify the specific requirements related to ``other charges assessed the student by the institution'' under the pro rata refund calculation. ``Other charges'' includes, but is not limited to, charges for any equipment, books, or supplies issued by an institution to the student, provided that the enrollment agreement signed by the student specifies a separate charge for such equipment or provided that the institution refers the student to an affiliated vendor for purchase of the equipment. An institution may exclude the documented cost of such equipment from the pro rata refund calculation in the following instances: For unreturnable equipment, if the student actually receives and keeps the equipment; or for returnable equipment, the student does not return the equipment in good condition allowing for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days after withdrawal. For example, an item is not considered to be in good condition and, hence, is unreturnable, if it cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and sanitary reasons. Institutions must clearly disclose in the enrollment agreement any restrictions on the return of equipment, including identifying equipment that is unreturnable. The regulatory language has been changed to reflect that an institution must notify the student in writing, prior to enrollment, that return of such equipment will be required within 20 days of withdrawal. It is the responsibility of the institution to determine whether specific equipment is returnable or not, in accordance with State and accrediting agency guidelines. This change conforms with a similar provision from the FFEL programs regulations. The Secretary believes that it would be unreasonable to expect a student to return equipment within a certain time period without ensuring that the student has been informed of the conditions of acceptable return of equipment. The February 28, 1994 NPRM proposed that institutions be exempted from making refunds of $25 or less, because the burden and cost of making such a refund would exceed the amount refunded. However, that proposed change will not be made. Section 668.22(f)(3)(iii) has been amended to remove the proposed minimum dollar amount below which a refund would not have to be made. After further consideration, the Secretary believes that this proposed provision is inconsistent with the amendment made to section 490 of the HEA that established criminal penalties for failure to pay refunds, specifically including refunds of less than two hundred dollars. Further, the Secretary believes that by the time the institution has determined the amount of the refund, most of the administrative effort and cost has been expended. The Secretary believes that neither the institution nor the student would benefit from the proposal to allow institutions to forego making refunds of $25 or less. Also, the Secretary believes that part of the institution's administrative costs are recouped through the administrative fee that is allowed to be excluded from the pro rata refund calculation. In response to public comment, language has been added to ยง668.22(i)(1)(ii) to limit an institution's determination of a student's unofficial withdrawal to no later than 30 days after the expiration of the enrollment period, the academic year, or the program, whichever is earlier. Section 668.22(i)(2) has been amended to clarify that the refund deadline in that paragraph is applicable only to refunds made to students, and does not alter or affect the FFEL regulatory deadlines for returning a refund to a lender or the regulatory deadline for returning a refund to a Title IV, HEA program account. In response to public comment, the Secretary has provided the following examples to aid in the implementation of the refund requirements: Example # 1 Fair and Equitable Refund: Term Institution Institutional Profile. Term Community College (TCC) offers two- and four-year programs, measured in credit hours, and its academic year is divided into two semesters, each 15 weeks long. TCC participates in the Federal Pell Grant program, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs, and the Federal campus-based programs. TCC charges by the semester: $1800 for tuition, $2500 for on-campus housing and meals, $25 for application, and $75 for administrative costs. Noninstitutional charges include: books and supply costs (because these items are purchased separately by the student, from the campus bookstore or an unaffiliated vendor), living expenses and meals (if the student lives in off-campus housing), transportation, and personal miscellaneous expenses. (Noninstitutional costs vary by student budget, depending in part upon the educational program in which the student enrolls.)
