[Koljevic] Good day. [Colovic] We here think that the atmosphere is somewhat calmer, that diplomatic-political activities are being stepped up, and that the situation is better than it was yesterday or the day before yesterday. Do you agree? [Koljevic] Yes, I also think that the situation is somewhat calmer, although it is still very difficult to calm the justified anger of the entire Serbian nation that was caused by the air strikes. I think this will not be easy to do without recognizing, acknowledging the very vital interests of the Serbs in the Serbian republic and the Serbian people as a whole. However, [words indistinct] is easier today than yesterday because there are new initiatives. [Colovic] Vitaliy Churkin, envoy of Russian President Yeltsin, stated yesterday that this was the moment when a decision has to be made on which path to take, whether to aim for peace or war. One can conclude from the context of his fairly long statement that the Serbs will not do anything -- if, of course, not provoked -- that would endanger peace and even his personal efforts. In this context he made some proposals, initiatives to the leadership in Pale regarding the continuation of the peace negotiations. Mr. Koljevic, when can we expect a response to these initiatives. [Koljevic] I think that the response to these initiatives could be expected tomorrow, because a decision on possible future contacts with the United Nations will be made at the meeting of the supreme command of the army of the Serbian republic tomorrow. Contacts with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] are out of the question for the time being. However, we will very seriously consider a possibility of contacts with the civilian sector, those who are not directly involved in military matters, and thus in the bombing. If the decision is positive, then a meeting with the representatives of the civil authorities or civil sector, above all, Mr. Akashi, could take place very soon. [Colovic] There is one encouraging fact, and I hope you will agree with this, namely that Owen and Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the Geneva Conference, who have been out of the game for some time, have now rejoined the diplomatic-political action. They are now back in the game and it is interesting that they returned to the game after your meeting with them in Paris. [Koljevic] Yes. We followed a basic criterion after these aggressive attacks on the Serbian people and the Serbian republic. Our criterion was simple. Those people and those forces who were not directly involved in these attacks are possible partners for talks. Considering that Russia was not informed [about the air strikes], as has been publicly announced, we held a series of consultative meetings with Mr. Churkin. Since Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg were not involved in this action either, in fact they were left aside, they were considered as possible partners for talks. They even offered their good services. If it is possible to overcome this critical moment, we would find it a lot more acceptable to negotiate via them and via Mr. Churkin rather than anyone else. [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, you said if this critical moment is possible to overcome at all. New threats are coming from the United States. How should they be interpreted? [Koljevic] I can interpret them as yet another mistake, a big mistake of causing anger among the Serbian people. I have already said several times that the unity and anger of the Serbian people can only be caused by such unjustified threats. I hope that this will remain at the verbal level and that the mistakes made so far will not be fatal. After all, we will see whether the international community, above all the United States, cares more about establishing peace and separation, but above all peace, than about threatening the Serbs and menacing the Serbian people as a whole. [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, can we expect meetings between the military commanders of the Serbian and Muslim forces to take place soon, at which they could reach an agreement that would prevent further incidents, new provocations, by above all the Muslim side. [Koljevic] I do not believe that such meetings are possible at present. However, agreements or contacts will be possible indirectly, via the civil authorities. Direct ones are out of the question at present. [Colovic] You are continuing your activities today. Can you tell us a little more about your intentions for the next few hours? [Koljevic] There will be a number of consultations on, above all, our principled stand in this situation, then on our military situation. Muslim forces are launching fresh offensive attacks in different parts of the Serbian republic. Therefore, we will hold diplomatic and military consultations today, and tomorrow, we will decide on our conduct in the days ahead. [Colovic] You are talking about the meeting of the supreme command of the Serbian republic. [Koljevic] Yes. [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, thank you very much. [Koljevic] Thank you and thanks to the listeners.
