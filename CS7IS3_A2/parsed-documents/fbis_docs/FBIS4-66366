Liupanshui City will become a transportation node forming the Gui-Kun [Guiyang-Kunming] Railroad, Nan-Kun Railroad, Nei-Kun [Neijiang-Kunming] Railroad, Zhu-Liu [Zhuzhou-Liupanshui] Multiple Railroad, Shui-Xiao [Shuicheng-Panxian] Railroad, and Pan-Bai [Panxian-Baise] high-grade highway, running north to Chengdu, west to Kunming, south to Beihai and Fangcheng, and east to Guiyang and Zhuzhou, making it a key communication hub for southwest China. Liupanshui City is south China's biggest coal base area, but because of communication limitations, it has had overstocks of millions of tons of raw coal, coking coal, and refined coal every year for many years. At the same time, demand for coal has been constantly growing in nearby Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces and autonomous regions and some enterprises have had to shut down because of coal shortages. The 10 million tons-plus of coal produced each year in the Liupanshui Mining Region have only been able to rely on the Gui-Kun Railroad and Panxi Railroad branchline which have been overloaded for many years, so the important role of Jiangnan's Coal Capital has been hard to foster due to communication restrictions. During the past several years, because of the extremely acute energy resource shortages in the south China and southwest China economic regions, the state has been reconsidering the role and status of the new energy resource city Liupanshui City. It has included Liupanshui in the state's Panxi-Liupanshui resource development zone, and it has decided to invest in the short term 10 billion yuan to develop Liupanshui's energy resource and raw materials industries and has started with a large-scale investment in communication construction for Liupanshui to turn it into a railroad crossroads within five years. The Panxian section of the Nan-Kun Railroad which is already under construction is now being speeded up. Preparations for the initial engineering for the Shui-Xiao Railroad from Shuicheng to Panxian are now ready, and it is possible that construction may begin soon. A decision has already been made for a short-term return of construction on the Nei-Kun Railroad from Neijiang in Sichuan to Kunming in Yunnan and to connect it at Dawan in Shuicheng. The additional line for the Liupanshui to Zhuzhou, Hunan Railroad is now being surveyed and plans call for it to be opened to traffic in five years. The site for southwest China's biggest railroad marshalling yard has now been chosen at Shilong Village in Fenghuang Township, Zhongshan Prefecture. Construction of the Pan-Bai high-grade highway from Baise in Guangxi to Panxian in Guizhou is now underway. A preliminary discussion has already been conducted for the project to extend the Gui-Huang high-grade highway to Shuicheng. It has been projected that within five years Liupanshui's railroad transportation capacity can be increased almost 10-fold compared to now, and the density of its railway network will be the greatest in southwest China. Since large-scale development in the 1960s at Liupanshui, the 1990s have welcomed a second golden era. The economic development program recently approved by the State Council fully confirms the strategic status and important role of Liupanshui in south and southwest China's economy and has included development of Liupanshui in the state's important orders of the day to turn Liupanshui in the short term into one of south China's biggest heavy industrial cities and a communication hub.
