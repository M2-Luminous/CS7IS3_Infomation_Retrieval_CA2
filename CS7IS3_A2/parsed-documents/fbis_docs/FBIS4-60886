He stressed that any refusal to sign the document would have led to the RP's political isolation and fall into the camp of the hardline opposition. Lysenko said that only two out of RP's eight-member council voted against signing the Pact. They are Vyacheslav Shostokovskiy and Igor Yakovenko of the Yavlinskiy-led alliance. Asked if the RP decision was likely to split the Yavlinsky alliance, which refused to sign the document, Lysenko warned against dramatizing the situation adding that he himself would stay put as its member. The decision not to sign the Civic Accord Pact was made by alliance leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy while other members including Vladimir Lukin and Viktor Sheynis had warned against rejecting it, Lysenko said. One other RP leader Stepan Sulakshin who recently defected from the Russia's Choice Party said he had had differences with its leader Yegor Gaydar because of his dogmatic reform policy "which inevitably leads to violence." On his immediate plans, Sulakshin said he did not contemplate joining any faction or group for the time being and that "time will alone tell what happens next." In the meantime, one other member of the RP council and Yavlinskiy-led faction Igor Yakovenko has accused Lysenko of reneging on the alliance's position. In an interview with Interfax, he said Lysenko should have given up the mandate he won running on the alliance's ticket before signing the Pact. "Lysenko who was defeated as an independent owes his mandate to the Yavlinskiy-led alliance. By reneging on the faction's platform, he has in fact cheated the electorate," Yakovenko said. He said the question of party infighting and its stand on the Civic Accord Pact would be discussed at a party congress in June.
