FR941103-0-00020 FR941103-0-00004 Conversion From Federal to State License As suggested by the commenters, the Board has determined not to require an application under the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act in connection with the conversion of: (1) a federally-licensed branch to a state licensed-branch; or (2) a federally licensed-agency to a state-licensed agency. Applications are not considered necessary in light of the fact that state-licensed branches and agencies must restrict their activities to those permissible for a federal branch or receive the Board's approval to engage in the activity. Section 24 of Regulation K will be amended accordingly. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), it is certified that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
