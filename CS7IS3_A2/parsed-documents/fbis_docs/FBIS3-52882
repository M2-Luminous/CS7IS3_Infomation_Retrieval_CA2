These demonstrations are also designed to protest the continued siege of the Hazratbal Shrine, which the people visit to pay respect to the sacred relic -- a hair from the beard of the holy Prophet Muhammad, may the blessing and mercy of God be upon him. This year, the people will not be able to visit the Hazratbal Shrine because of the siege laid by Indian forces. Meanwhile, 20 people have been killed and several others arrested in the fresh operations carried out by occupation forces in the occupied valley. An Indian military vehicle was destroyed and two soldiers were killed in a land mine explosion in the Nawanshahr area. In another operation, the freedom fighters damaged the water supply system of Punch Cantonment. According to another report, the freedom fighters attacked a military position with a hand grenade in the Charasa area of Srinagar, wounding a number of soldiers. There are also reports of clashes between the freedom fighters and the Indian forces at (Zomaran Top) of Doda District, in which several soldiers were either killed or wounded. Syed Ali Jilani, a leader of the freedom movement, in a press statment has appreciated the sentiments expressed by President Clinton in his letter to Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, the director of the Kashmir-American Council. Jilani said it is the result of the unprecedented sacrifice of the Kashmiris that the United States and Western countries have begun to take note of the Kashmir situation. Mohammad Farooq Rahmani, the Jammu and Kashmir People's League, has appealed to the Kashmiri people to observe Indian Republic Day on 26 January as a black day. He said on this day, normal life activities should be suspended and all lights kept switched off in the evening, to prove that the future of India and Kashmir is different from each other. Rahmani has also appealed to the people of Azad Kashmir to express solidarity with their brethren living on the other side of the cease-fire line.
