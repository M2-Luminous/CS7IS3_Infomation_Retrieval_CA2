TK-143 cells infected with the derived recombinant plasmids in the presence of infections TK[.sup]+[/] vaccinia virus (Tiantan strain) yielded recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed both large surface protein and HBcAg/HBeAg. The large surface protein was not secreted but two polypeptides between 36-45 kilo-daltons were revealed in SDS-PAGE following immunoprecipitation by anti-HBs. HBcAg was not secreted either, it remained in the cells. But HBeAg could be secreted into the medium, and was present in much higher amount that HBcAg. Rabbits vaccinated with the recombinant viruses made antibodies that recognized HBsAg and HBcAg epitopes. The additional immunogenicity provided by expression of large protein HBcAg/HBeAg may be advantageous for the development of an HBV vaccine.
