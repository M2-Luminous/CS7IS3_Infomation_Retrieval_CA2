FR940721-1-00023 FR940721-1-00009 (B2.) Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Provisions. Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required the USEPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted on year after the date for promulgation of the final USEPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's General Preamble for the implementation of title I informed States that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date [see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)]. The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of Michigan is required to submit a SIP revisions containing transportation and general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25 and 30, 1994, respectively. Because the deadline for such submittals has not yet come due, it is not an applicable requirement, under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v), for approval of this redesignation request. (B3.) Subpart 2 Requirements. Detroit-Ann Arbor is a moderate ozone nonattainment area. Under subpart 2, as of the date the State submitted a complete redesignation request, it is required to have met the requirements of section 182(a)(1), (2), and (3), section 182(b)(2), and (4), and section 182(f). The State has submitted SIP revisions which have not yet been approved by the USEPA but must be in order to find that the State has met all the applicable requirements of the following sections of the Act: Section 182(a)(1) 1990 base year emission inventory, section 182(a)(2)(A) VOC RACT ``fix-ups,'' section 182(a)(2)(B) I/M fix-ups, section 182(b)(2) (``catch-ups'') VOC RACT for each VOC source covered by a CTG issued between enactment of the Act and the attainment date (since the due date for these rules is November 15, 1994 which has not come due yet, it is not a requirement for approval of this redesignation request), all VOC sources covered by any CTG issued before the date of enactment of the Act, and all other major stationary sources of VOC located in the area, section 182(b)(4) basic I/M, and section 182(f) NO X requirements. Section 182(b)(3) Stage II vapor recovery was also an applicable requirement. However, the ``onboard rule'' 10 was published on April 6, 1994 and section 202(a)(6) of the Act provides that once onboard rules are promulgated, Stage II vapor recovery will no longer be a requirement. In addition, Michigan's emission statement program SIP submitted to satisfy the section 182(a)(3)(B) requirement was fully approved in a final USEPA rulemaking on March 8, 1994 (59 FR 10752). The USEPA is proposing to approve this redesignation request notwithstanding the lack of fully-approved provisions submitted in compliance with the NSR requirements of part D, section 182(b)(5) of the CAA. The USEPA believes, as suggested by the General Preamble at 57 FR 13564 (April 16, 1992), that the applicability of the part C PSD program to maintenance areas makes it unnecessary to require that an area have obtained full approval of NSR revisions required by part D in order to be redesignated. The USEPA believes that this interpretation of the Act is appropriate notwithstanding section 175A(d)'s requirements that the contingency provisions of a maintenance plan include a commitment on the part of the State to implement all measures, to control the relevant air pollutant, that were contained in the SIP prior to redesignation. The term ``measure'' is not defined in section 175A(d) and it appears that Congress utilized the terms ``measure'' or ``control measure'' differently in different provisions of the CAA that concern the PSD and NSR permitting programs. 10 The rule which was published by the USEPA on April 6, 1994 requires a vehicle based (onboard) system for the control of vehicle refueling emissions. Gasoline vapors which are normally vented to the atmosphere, are captured in a carbon canister and stored for later use by the vehicle's engine.
