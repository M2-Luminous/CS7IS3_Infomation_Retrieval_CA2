According to latest statistics from the China National Automotive Industry Corporation (CNAIC), the total sales last year were 1.17 million units. Of the total output, 225,000 were sedan cars, with sales of 223,000. A CNAIC official estimated that China's actual auto output last year must have exceeded 1.25 million, if the products of small auto factories are counted. China's auto industry developed at a fairly high speed for 32 successive months until last June, when it was hit by a slump market, with both output and sales falling abruptly. Yet it still fulfilled the target of producing 1.1 million vehicles set at the beginning of the year. To reinforce the development of the industry, the government decided last year to set up an auto department in the Ministry of Machinery Industry, and put the administration of the auto industry under the ministry. Formerly the CNAIC was responsible for administering the country's auto production. A few weeks ago the Ministry of Machinery Industry publicized its 1994 plan for the auto industry, saying 1.3 million automobiles will be produced, of which 350,000 will be sedan cars, and the growth rate of the industry will be maintained at about 10 percent.
