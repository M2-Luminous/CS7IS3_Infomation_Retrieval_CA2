About 40 of them are of a priority importance. The legislators will adopt a ratification law on each treaty. Speaking about the ratification of the treaty between Russia and Georgia on friendship, cooperation and good neighbourly relations, Pastukhov called attention to article 33, which says that "the treaty shall be subject to ratification and shall become effective after the exchange of ratification instruments of the two countries." He pointed out that President Yeltsin had stressed before signing the treaty that "its ratification is possible only after obvious headway is made in the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict." According to Pastukhov, now the Russian Foreign Ministry and Defence Ministry are unanimous in their opinion that "not a single cartridge should be turned over to the Georgian side, not even for the needs of the Georgian Interior Ministry." He stressed the need for a closer cooperation between members of the Federation Council and the Foreign Ministry. The Federation Council adopted today draft regulations on the parliamentary group of the Federal Assembly. According to Speaker of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, the parliamentary group of the Federal Assembly will be made up of members of the State Duma and the Federation Council in order to represent the Russian parliament in international organisations. Aside from it, the Federation Council adopted a resolution on the creation of a hospitality fund. The legislators adopted a resolution on the amount of monthly remuneration for members of the Federation Council holding elective posts. According to the resolution, 299,000 roubles will be added to their monthly salaries, equal to those of ministers, and to other privileges. According to Shumeyko, "the rise in wages is intended for members of Federation Council committees working on a full-time basis, as well as for deputies to the Federation Council to cover travelling expenses."
