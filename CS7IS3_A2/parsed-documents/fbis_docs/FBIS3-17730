In his exclusive interview with INTERFAX on Saturday Tatarstan's Vice Premier Vasily Likhachev declared that Kazan positively appreciates the start of the negotiations between Moscow and Groznyy. In his words, "We are happy with another aspects of the negotiations as well; the question concerns the fact that one of the factors which positively affect this process is the treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan, as both Moscow and Groznyy recognized." "Given this factor and Tatarstan's growing political authority, I'd like to declare about our readiness, as well as about my private readiness, to take an active part in the development of bilateral agreements under the mutual approval of the delegations of the Russian Federation and Chechenya. Without substituting the efforts of the direct participants of the negotiations, we could render assistance in creation of an atmosphere of confidence, strengthening of the dialogue, and creation of a mechanism for permanent consultations of these parties," declared Likhachev. In his words, Tatarstan's peacemaking efforts are grounded on a sound sense and the need to strengthen historic, cultural, and economic ties of the peoples and the strive to create democratic Russia. "Tatarstan is ready for a mediation mission to solve other disputable issues on the territory of Russia and the CIS as well, -- declared Likhachev. -- We are ready to discuss the issue on opening of an Euro-Asian Center for International Cooperation in Kazan with all interested states and international organizations." In his opinion, the nature of relations between Russia and Chechenya slightly differs from the relations between Tatarstan and Russia primarily "by a tougher position on the part of Groznyy and maximization of its demands." "The political and economic situation in Chechenya also differs from ours. But there are several factors which coincide," he noted. Likhachev believes that the negotiations between Moscow and Groznyy must discuss a special status for Chechenya.
