The boycott call has met with some success in the Yoruba parts of western Nigeria. Today, Yoruba traditional chieftains and leaders who backed the boycott tried to hold a meeting, but they ran into problems. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports: [Begin Odunfa recording] Fully armed policemen were brought out this morning to prevent a meeting of traditional rulers and political leaders of the Yoruba-speaking people in western Nigeria from being held. The meeting was to be held at the palace of the Awujale of Ijebuland, to take a final decision on whether the Yoruba people should participate in the forthcoming national constitutional conference. The Yoruba are one of the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria. Armed policemen, led by an area commander, were at the (Djebodi Palace) gate several hours before the guests started arriving, at about 11 o'clock. They turned each guest back politely at the gate, saying that they had instructions from above to abort the meeting. Those refused entry into the palace included the former civilian governor of the state, Chief Segun Oshoba, and his deputy, and senators in the last democratic regime. The traditional ruler of Ondo, Oba Festus Adesunye, was stopped at the police checkpoint on the highway leading into the town and was told politely not to go to the palace -- he complied. Other traditional rulers who had had wind of the police action stayed away. Journalists who had converged at the palace gate were also refused entry. After being turned back, Chief Segun Oshoba told journalists that, whether the meeting was held or not, the boycott of the constitutional conference election in Ogun State would be total. At their meeting in Owo yesterday, the major Yoruba political leaders declared their total support for the boycott of the constitutional conference, as demanded by the National Democratic Coalition. The politicians said that the conference, not being of sovereign status, could not achieve any success in resolving the national political crisis. The government is countering the boycott campaign by using all radio and television stations to persuade Nigerians to turn out en masse for the election. [end recording]
