Bophuthatswana defence force soldiers and police cordoned off townships around the capital Mmabatho on Tuesday in an attempt to prevent disgruntled government workers from attending a rally at the Mangope Stadium in Mmabatho. Police were also moving into the nearby Rooigrond area, also believed to be beset by unrest. Teachers in the independent homeland were out on strike on Tuesday and there was a sit-in by workers at the Health Department in Mmabatho. The sit-in and occupation of the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation [BBC] offices was continuing to a lesser extent early on Tuesday afternoon after police had entered the building at about 11.30AM under a heavy screen of teargas. A number of the workers committee members were arrested and led outside. BBC Chairman Eddie Mangope, said to have been held hostage by the strikers, was in the boardroom at the BBC insisting it was business as usual and denying the hostage taking. A work stoppage at the Mmabatho Sun Hotel has been planned for Tuesday afternoon, workers said.
