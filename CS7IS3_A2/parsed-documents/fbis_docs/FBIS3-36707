However, he added that if the first president of the Crimea violates the Ukrainian Constitution or any other laws, the Ukrainian president will have the right to annul his resolutions. The position of the Supreme Council of Ukraine was not so clear at that time. As everyone knows, many deputies stated that the Crimean elections were unconstitutional. I asked Supreme Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch to give his opinion on the results of the elections in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. [Plyushch] Elections in the Crimea have been held. I accepted the results of the first round, and likewise those of the second. According to the results of the second round, Yuriy Meshkov was elected the Crimean president. I always want to see more bright, white things than dark and dangerous ones. Therefore, as you know, we drafted constitutional resolutions that were discussed by the Supreme Council Constitutional Commission with the participation of committee chairmen and presidential representatives. Later, they were submitted to the Supreme Council for consideration. True, the drafts have not been approved, but they do contain a provision for the entire population of an oblast to elect an official to head the local council and executive authorities. The Crimea is one of our territories that has the status of an autonomous republic. Following the example of the Crimea, we develop relations between the center and regions. The first thing we did was therefore to adopt legislation on the division of economic powers between Kiev and the Crimea. I supported this at the time, and I continue to do so, since it does not make any sense to govern everything from the center, as was previously done from Moscow. Replacing Moscow with Kiev does not make any sense. By doing so, we would have 25 cabinets of ministers all over Ukraine. Everything that is provided for by basic constitutional resolutions has taken place in the Crimea -- they have elected a president who will head the executive branch. The fate of the legislative branch is, as yet, unknown. Yet, according to Crimean legislation, their president has no right to dissolve the Crimean Supreme Council or ordain a referendum on confidence or nonconfidence in the Crimean parliament. This means that there is no problem. The legislative body elected by the Crimean people is still functioning. Although Mykola Bahrov tendered his resignation following consultations with members of the Supreme Council Presidium, or maybe with somebody else, it was decided to send him off on leave, to let him relax after his disappointment. Meanwhile, the Crimean Supreme Council will continue to operate under Maslov, who has to perform the duties of its chairman. A plenary session is to be held today, at which Crimean President Meshkov will deliver a speech and take the oath of office. I am glad that Yuriy Meshkov, neither during the first round of elections nor the second one, nor at press conferences, has said that he would pursue a course of separating the Crimea from Ukraine. Regarding his statements on broad and close integration with Russia and an economic zone, may God grant that this happens. If regions integrate economically, it will be easier for Ukraine to integrate with foreign countries. I would not like to make a problem out of this. One should try to gain some experience from this issue. Although Meshkov says that he does not see any forms of cooperation with Russia and Ukraine at the moment, I believe that our legislation provides for such forms. Still, there are certain acts adopted by the Crimean legislature which do not conform to Ukrainian ones. Our Committee for Legal and Legislative Issues has therefore listed discrepancies between the two sets of legislation. The Crimea has also obtained this list. We have asked our Crimean colleagues to adjust their legislation to meet that of Ukraine. I believe that, after a meeting between the Ukrainian and Crimean presidents, and following an official statement by Leonid Kravchuk, this issue will again be addressed. Although there are various ways of achieving this, I am for consolidation rather than confrontation. I categorically disagree with those who compare Zhirinovskiy with Meshkov and what is taking place in Russia with developments in the Crimea. I do not see the elections as Bahrov's defeat and Meshkov's victory. More than 70 percent of the people voted for an improvement of life on the peninsula. They want everything to remain as it was in the past -- they want all nationalists, from the near and far abroad, to continue visiting the Crimea, the economic zone to continue functioning, and mutually beneficial ties to continue developing. If Meshkov manages to achieve this, of course without leaving Ukraine, I will praise him and be envious of his successes. If he fails to do so, well, not everyone can succeed. [Mostovaya] Ivan Stepanovych, what do you think about the tripartite declaration signed in Moscow? [Plyushch] My opinion about the declaration is unequivocally positive. I think that it was the only possible decision in terms of sense, although its form is not perfect. However, we are only a subject of the tripartite declaration. Could we dictate the form? Of course not. I would have surely preferred, as a citizen and an official, that Clinton had met with Kravchuk not at the airport but at his official residence, as with any other state leader.... I believe that this declaration was yet another step toward satisfying the Supreme Council's reservations about the 18 November resolution on ratifying the START I treaty. Although the declaration includes a chapter concerning other types of nonnuclear strategic weapons, we should not make a problem out of this. Let us liquidate the nuclear weapons first, and then we will talk about other types of strategic offensive arms. I believe that this declaration not only gives us guarantees, but also prevents territorial claims and interference in Ukraine's internal affairs. This agreement came in the very nick of time, since it included security guarantees for us. Even if they were not formulated as we wished, they are still better than none. [Mostovaya] Will the current parliament examine the tripartite declaration? [Plyushch] Although it is very hard for me to speak about this, I do not think that the declaration is an agreement. Therefore, it is not subject to ratification by parliament. Moreover, the document was signed on behalf of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. Only agreements, not declarations, are signed this way. Although there are some flaws, this is not the most important aspect. The most important thing is that the declaration answers the reservations put forward by the legislature on 18 November. Therefore, I believe that the current Supreme Council should decide whether or not the tripartite declaration signed by our president conforms to the resolution concerning the START I treaty. [Mostovaya] Yet the president has requested that the issue of acceding to the treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons also be examined.... [Plyushch] This will be the responsibility of the next Supreme Council. It will depend on how the provisions of the tripartite declaration are fulfilled. Such issues should not be rushed.
