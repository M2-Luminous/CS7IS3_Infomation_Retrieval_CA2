"We regard this action as an attempt to find a new model for military and political cooperation on a limited space in Europe," he noted. In the opinion of the Russian diplomat, this is at variance with the need for building a truly pan-European system of security and stability. It is a mistake to bank on cooperation in which there is no place for such a country as Russia. Such a trend, if it picks up steam, is fraught with raising artificial barriers and creating a threat for a new split in Europe, Demurin underlined. "We support another way based on the principles of really broad cooperation between all European states. We stand out for the WEU to become, in future, part of a pan-European structure under the aegis of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe," the spokesman continued. He pointed to Russia's serious interest in developing a constructive dialogue and practical cooperation with the WEU as well as its member countries.
