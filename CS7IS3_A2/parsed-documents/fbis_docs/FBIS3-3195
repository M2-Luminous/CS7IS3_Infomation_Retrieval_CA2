The daming palaces were the imperial quarters and political offices for 230 years in China's Tang Dynasty (618-907). These large-scale palace complexes built in the middle period of Chinese history were of an incomparable splendor. Local sources said that the Japanese will provide about a million U.S. dollars for the project, and Chinese and Japanese archeologists will together hammer out a protective restoration program. The sources also revealed that a formal agreement on the project will be signed when Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa pays an official visit to China shortly. Preparations will be made this year, and the program is to be carried out fully next year. Cheng Andong, secretary of the city Communist Party Committee, said while meeting UN and Japanese representatives early this month that the city has been putting special emphasis on the palaces restoration plan. Cheng said that the government has designated specific people to be in charge of the work and the city has spent more than one million yuan (about 114,900 U.S. dollars) in recent years on the greening of land around the palaces and removing unrelated buildings.
