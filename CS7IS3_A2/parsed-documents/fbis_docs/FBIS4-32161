"The request was conveyed last week to the Czech delegation to the UN and visiting representatives of the parliamentary Defense and Security Committee by UN Undersecretary General Kofi Anan," the paper writes. "According to diplomatic sources, the Czech UN mission said that the Czech Republic would not most likely grant the request because it had already exhausted all its possibilities to reinforce the peace-keeping forces. "The director of the Defense Ministry Foreign Relations Section, Jaromir Novotny, had said earlier that the Army did not have any more reserves for UN operations. But according to Czech Army representatives it would be much more difficult to find volunteers ready to go to Rwanda than to provide the hospital," the paper says. It recalls that the Czech Republic has already sent one field surgical team of 20 doctors to the former Yugoslavia. Czech soldiers and civilian policemen of the Czech Armed Forces are currently active within five UN peace-keeping operations, the paper points out.
