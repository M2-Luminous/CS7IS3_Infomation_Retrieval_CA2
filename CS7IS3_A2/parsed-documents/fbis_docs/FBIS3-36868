Beside him two other generals and a captain of the Russian Army have received notices from district authorities to vacate the apartments they are occupying. In this connection the commander of the North-West Group of Troops has sent a letter to the prime minister of Latvia. The letter stresses that the ultimatum demand to vacate apartments containing a threat to use force, is especially characteristic of two Riga districts. All these apartments belong to the Russian Defence Ministry Residential Foundation and their further use is a topic to be discussed at talks between the two countries. One of the notices has been signed by head of the Vidzem District of Riga Andreis Ruchs, who had organized a scandalous action against two generals a month ago. The Latvian Government had relieved him of his post. But he has been once again nominated to this post by deputies of the district. That is why the republican prosecutor's office has asked parliament to permit a criminal case to be lodged against him. But it turned out that Sejm (parliament) does not have the judicial right to do so. That is why, while discussing the prosecutor's request, Sejm would rather send a letter to the commission and recommend it to prepare amendments to the law on the deputy status. Until then Ruchs and his followers will remain free to add other Russian generals to their list, who in their view, are liable to be deported from Latvia.
