[passage omitted] At his meetings today, the Iranian foreign minister was assured of Bulgaria's willingness to widen its economic relations with Iran. Iran used to be Bulgaria's principal trading partner in the Third World. Bulgaria hopes to regain these positions. "We expect Bulgaria to reestablish its traditional position in the Iranian market with a number of goods: Cigarettes, cheese, meat, chemical fertilizers, machine tools and materials handling equipment," the Bulgarian president's foreign policy adviser told journalists after the meeting. A bilateral trade agreement is expected to be signed tomorrow. A banking agreement and an agreement on payments are also being prepared. The Bulgarian-Iranian Commission on Economic Cooperation will meet in April. [passage omitted] The problem of the Bulgarian debt to Iran was raised at the meeting with Prof. Berov. This country has already repaid $6 million of the $20 million owed. The remaining $14 million will be gradually repaid in the future. Prof. Berov expressed the hope Bulgaria would become a regular consumer of Iranian gas. Dr. Velayati said there was no problem bartering goods other than petroleum products. So far, however, Iran has preferred to trade petroleum for hard currency rather than on a clearing basis. Dr. Velayati sees prospects in promoting transport cooperation not only on roads across Turkey, but also across the Caucasus. According to a government Press Office source, the Bulgarian prime minister is also warming to the idea of a trans-Caucasian route. Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati suggested the promotion of free trade areas. According to him, Bulgaria and Iran should pursue their relations not only on a bilateral, but also on a multilateral basis. One possible area for this are the Central Asian Republics. The prospects for cooperation between the private sectors were also a discussed at the Berov- Velayati talks. In the words of the president's adviser, issues concerning the Islamic Conference Organization and Bulgarian Muslims were high on the agenda. "The Islamic Conference countries must reconsider the issue, acknowledging the recognition and respect for their (the Bulgarian Muslims') rights," the president's adviser said, adding that ample evidence could be produced to corroborate this fact. Conferring with Dr. Velayati, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov pointed out that the moment is ripe for the Islamic Conference Organization to take the issue of Bulgarian Muslims off its agenda. According to Mr. Yordanov, the Iranian foreign minister has agreed to that. Bulgaria has set forth the same position before representatives of other Islamic countries, such as Egypt and Kuwait. The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry and Parliament will shortly submit all necessary laws and the Constitution to prove, as the head of parliament put it, that the rights of Bulgarian Muslims are genuinely protected by Bulgarian legislation.
