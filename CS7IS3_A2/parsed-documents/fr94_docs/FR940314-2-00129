FR940314-2-00129 FR940314-2-00068 14. A contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'') of up to 7% is imposed on the partial withdrawal or surrender of purchase payments within seven years of such payments having been made. The Sales Charge is deducted from the Contract value remaining after withdrawal so that the reduction in Contract value as a result of a withdrawal will be greater than the withdrawal amount requested. Amounts obtained from imposition of the Sales Charge will be used to cover expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts, including payment of commissions to registered representatives and other promotional expenses. Applicants state that Century Life does not anticipate that the Sales Charge will generate sufficient revenues to pay the cost of distributing the Contracts. If the Sales Charge is insufficient to cover the cost of distribution, the deficiency will be met from the general account assets of Century Life and these assets may include amounts derived from the charge for mortality and expense risks. 15. Century Life will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets of the Account to compensate Century Life for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. Approximately .85% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .40% is attributable to expense risk. Century Life guarantees that this charge will never exceed 1.25%. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks under the Contracts, Century Life will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, the excess will be profit to Century Life. Applicants state that Century Life currently anticipates a profit from this charge. 16. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Century Life arises from its contractual obligation to make annuity payments (as determined in accordance with the Contracts) regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant may live. Applicants state that this undertaking assures that neither annuitant's own longevity nor an improvement in general life expectancy will adversely affect the periodic annuity payments that a payee will receive under the Contract. Applicants state that Century Life also incurs a risk in connection with the death benefit guarantee and that there is no charge for this guarantee. 17. Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Century Life is the risk that administration costs will exceed amounts received by Century Life through imposition of the administration charge, the transfer fee (where imposed) and the annual Contract fee. Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions 1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for mortality and expense risks. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27 (c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services of a character normally performed by the bank itself. 2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by Century Life under the Contracts. Applicants state that the charge is a reasonable charge to compensate Century Life for the risks that: the annuitants under the Contracts will live longer than has been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; the Contract value will be less than the death benefit; and administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the asset-based administration charge, the transfer fee and the Contract fee. 3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Century Life is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon Century Life's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry practices, taking into consideration such factors as: current charge levels; charge level guarantees; and guaranteed annuity rates. Applicants represent that Century Life will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, the comparative survey. 4. Applicants represent that Century Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Century Life and will be made available to the Commission. 5. Century Life also represents that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of such company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. Conclusion Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
