Before issues relating to the 31 March boat fire in which 24 Taiwanese tourists were killed as well as other functional disputes are resolved, Taipei sees no reasons of holding another round of chairman-level talks between it and the Peking semi-official organization, sources quoted an MAC official as saying. The official was apparently referring to a meeting between the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], Ku Chen-fu, and his mainland counterpart Wang Tao-han [Wang Daohan] of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]. The two chairmen met in the ground-breaking Ku-Wang Talks in Singapore last April. At that time, they agreed to meet at least once a year to maintain regular cross-strait contacts. However, the cabinet-level MAC, which formulates Taiwan's policy towards the mainland, asserts there is no point in moving on until the current issues are finally resolved.
