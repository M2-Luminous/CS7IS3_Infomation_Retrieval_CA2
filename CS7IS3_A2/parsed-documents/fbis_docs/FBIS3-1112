Mr. Bekker said in a radio program this morning that one could also ask whether the report would have seen the light if the IFP was going to participate in the election. On the alleged involvement of a prominent Transvaal IFP leader, Mr. Thembo Khoza, Mr. Bekker said the IFP believes in the legal principle that one is innocent until proven otherwise.
