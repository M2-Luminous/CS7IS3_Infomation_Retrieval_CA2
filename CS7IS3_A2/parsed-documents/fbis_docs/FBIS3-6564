He was speaking last week at the unprecedented gathering of the finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) in Honolulu, where macroeconomic strategies, capital inflow and capital market development were the dominant theme for informal consultations. Tharin indicated that stable macroeconomic environment, coupled with proper planning, implementation of infrastructure projects and resources development projects, is the most important factor attracting foreign capital, aside from making it easier to obtain external financing and assuring efficient uses of the fund. "Encouragement of long-term over short-term funds will yield a more stable pattern of capital flow. Sound development of domestic capital market will help prevent destabilizing portfolio investment," he said. But Tharin warned that large capital inflows could affect economic stability and lead to financial volatility. "In our case, these issues have not hitherto been a serious problem due to satisfactory macro-economic performance and appropriate monitoring. "Our fiscal surplus has helped to reduce the impact of large capital inflows on monetary expansions," he noted. "Meanwhile, we maintain our policy options to uphold stability. The authorities can choose among combinations of foreign exchange policy, interest rate policy, sterilization measures. "The choice and timing depend on the prevailing circumstances. The ultimate goal, however, is to induce capital inflows." Tharin also drew up Thailand's growth strategy, which has been based on a reliance on private sector initiatives, an outward looking policy and a strong emphasis on macroeconomic stability. "Throughout our modern history, Thailand has always encouraged private sector investment based on market mechanism. Broad incentives were granted through the Board of Investment," he said. "Although these incentives were selective in nature, they did not represent a real sectoral emphasis. "Foreign direct investments have always been welcomed and indeed have played an important role in the industrialization process. "Price control was a rare incident, reflecting the government's belief in the function of market forces," he added.
