FR941205-2-00133 FR941205-2-00073 Current CHAS regulations were published in the Federal Register on September 1, 1992, at 57 FR 40038, as amended, in part, on March 12, 1993 at 58 FR 13686. These regulations are codified in 24 CFR part 91. Applicants under this NOFA are permitted to use an abbreviated housing strategy, as set forth in ยง91.25 of the CHAS regulations. Applicants are advised to begin preparation of the abbreviated strategy at the earliest possible time in order to have sufficient time to fulfill the applicable citizen participation requirements, which provide that the strategy must be available to the public for at least thirty days before its submission to HUD. Additional information about abbreviated strategy requirements is provided in the application kit. If possible, applicants should endeavor to submit the abbreviated strategy in advance of the Small Cities application due date. The latest time at which the abbreviated strategy will be accepted by HUD for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program in New York will be the application due date for the Small Cities application. Failure to submit the abbreviated strategy by the due date is not a curable technical deficiency. As noted in Section II.C.2. of this NOFA, certain applicants may satisfy this submission requirement by submitting amendments which update the CHAS or abbreviated strategy submitted in conjunction with their Fiscal Year 1994 application. Questions regarding the housing strategies should be directed to the appropriate HUD field office. Complete Small Cities applications for which the abbreviated strategy has been submitted but not yet approved will still be rated and ranked with the other applications; if determined to be fundable, those applications will receive a conditional approval subject to approval of the abbreviated strategy. However, such an approval will be rescinded if the abbreviated strategy has not been approved by HUD within 60 days from the date that the conditional approval has been announced. In such event the funding will be awarded to the highest rated fundable applicant that did not receive funding under this competition. g. Section 3. Assistance provided under this NOFA is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 135, as amended by an interim rule published on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33866). One of the purposes of this NOFA, which is consistent with section 3, is to give, to the greatest extent feasible and consistent with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, job training, employment and other contracting opportunities generated from certain HUD financial assistance to low- and very low-income persons. Public entities awarded funds under this NOFA, and that intend to use the funds for housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction must comply with the applicable requirements set forth in the regulations published on June 30, 1994. 4. Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance: Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient Disclosures HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance administered by HUD. (See also Section II.D. of this NOFA.) On January 16, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional information that gave the public (including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation of section 102. The documentation, public access, and applicant and recipient disclosure requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: a. HUD Responsibilities. (1) Documentation and Public Access. HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) (2) Disclosures. HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) b. Units of General Local Government Responsibilities. Units of general local government awarded assistance under this NOFA are subject to the provisions of either paragraph b(1), or paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3). For units of local government awarded assistance under this NOFA which in turn make the assistance available on a NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS for a specific project or activity to a subrecipient, paragraph b(1) applies. For units of local government awarded assistance under this NOFA, which in turn make the assistance available on a COMPETITIVE BASIS for a specific project or activity to a subrecipient, paragraphs b(2) and (3) apply.
