Soldiers and policemen, including special riot police forces, were posted at key points of the capital, especially in the neighborhoods where protests and violent demonstrations generally start. It was reported that the military occupation of the capital was ordered to prevent disorder and possible acts of violence. The tension continues to increase in the Dominican capital, while reports on the election results are slowly being disclosed and charges of fraud by the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) increase. Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate for the PRD, announced today he will ask for the annulment of the election results in the provinces where fraud is proven and reiterated his charges that the voter lists were altered to prevent members of his party and other opposition organizations from voting. This afternoon another PRD leader accused the Central Electoral Board (JCE) of providing the country with incorrect information on election results. Manuel Esquea Guerrero, PRD delegate before the JCE, said the figures provided in official bulletins do not correspond to the figures provided to the parties on "diskettes," which should be the same figures provided to the public. The country was partially paralyzed today. Government offices were not open, and many businesses remained closed. The schools that were used as voting centers yesterday did not open today either, and the flow of vehicles, both private and mass transit, was minimal. The latest results provided by the JCE show an increase in Joaquin Balaguer's lead. With 61 percent of the voting tables counted, Balaguer has 786,559 votes or 43.53 percent. Opposition candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez has 730,775 votes or 40.44 percent of the votes.
