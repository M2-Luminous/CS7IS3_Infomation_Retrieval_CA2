This proposal satisfied both sides at the Ukrainian-Russian negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet on 8 June. Experts on both sides also agreed on the division of warships. The list now has to be approved by members of Ukraine's and Russia's state delegations. The talks on 9 June will concern the thorniest issue of dividing the coastal infrastructure. Russia proposes that the main base of the Russian part of the fleet should be Sevastopol. But the Ukrainian side proposes that the final document puts it in a different way: not "the main base of the Black Sea Fleet is the city of Sevastopol" but "the main base of the Black Sea Fleet is in the city of Sevastopol." Commenting on the course of negotiations, Russia's ambassador to Ukraine Leonid Smolyakov said: "There are breakthroughs, and the talks are held in a balanced manner." Asked by UNIAN whether an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet could be signed before the presidential election in Ukraine, Leonid Smolyakov said no. In his opinion, "the problem of coexistence and interaction between two large military structures cannot be solved in a short space of time." According to the ambassador, "the problem of the Black Sea Fleet will continue to exist after 26 June."
