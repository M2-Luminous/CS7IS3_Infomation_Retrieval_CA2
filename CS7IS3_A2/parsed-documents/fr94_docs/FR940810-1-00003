FR940810-1-00003 FR940810-1-00001 In addition, airlines claim that code-sharing can help them operate more efficiently, because they can spread costs by providing a joint service with one aircraft rather than operating separate services with two aircraft. Particularly in thin markets, this efficiency can increase consumers' price and service options or enable the use of equipment sized appropriately for the market. Thus, overall, the Department believes that code-sharing can offer significant economic benefits. Code-sharing services have expanded significantly since USAir (then Allegheny Airlines) set up the first code-sharing arrangements in the 1960s. A 1986 DOT study of the regional airline industry found that code-sharing agreements were a prominent feature of the nationwide air service network. A Study of the Regional Airline Industry at 80 (May 1986). The study also found that 16 of the 20 largest regional airlines operating in the continental U.S. participated in a code-sharing agreement with a major airline. Id. at 27. The Regional Airline Association's 1993 Annual Report reported that by 1992, the largest 29 regional carriers were code-sharing, 36 of the largest 50 regional airlines had code-sharing agreements, and 96% of regional airline passengers flew on code-sharing carriers. Similarly, international code-shares, which have existed at least since the early 1980s, have expanded recently. Early international code-shares tended to involve individual routes; the more recent trend has been towards code-sharing agreements that involve total route systems, such as the one between Northwest and KLM. Today, most major U.S. airlines have code-sharing agreements with foreign airlines. Benefits of Wet Leases Some airlines perform some or all of their scheduled passenger air transportation services by contracting for the equipment and crew of another carrier (wet lease). Operating by wet lease can permit such carriers to offer services that might otherwise be unavailable. The flexibility to contract with other airlines for equipment and crew to fill operational needs benefits the public by avoiding disruptions and creating service alternatives that could not otherwise be provided. DOT Regulatory Policy and Statutory Bases Section 41712 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code (formerly ยง411 of the Federal Aviation Act) authorizes the Department to decide if a U.S. or foreign air carrier or ticket agent (including travel agents) has engaged in unfair or deceptive practices and to ban such practices. Under that section, the Department has adopted various regulations and policies to prevent unfair or deceptive practices, such as the rules governing computer reservations systems (14 CFR Part 255) and the policy on fare advertising (14 CFR ยง399.84). Although code-sharing and wet-leasing can afford public benefits, they can also confuse and mislead the public unless prospective travelers are aware of the arrangements before they select a flight. Current DOT policy has dealt only with code-sharing, and has been to consider the practice to be unfair and deceptive and in violation of 49 U.S.C. ยง41712 unless consumers are given reasonable and timely notice of the existence of the code-sharing arrangement. 14 C.F.R. 399.88 (Docket No. 42199, 50 FR 38508, September 23, 1985). The policy statement expressly applies only to U.S. air carriers, however. It states that the obligation to give ``reasonable notice'' requires air carriers, at a minimum to: (1) Identify, with an asterisk or other means, each flight in which the airline code is different from the code of the airline actually providing the service, in written or electronic schedule information; (2) Provide information in any direct oral communication with a consumer concerning a code-sharing flight sufficient to alert the consumer that the flight will occur on an airline different from the airline whose code is shown on the ticket and identify the airline(s) actually providing the service; and (3) provide frequent, periodic notice in advertising media of the existence of a code-sharing relationship and the identities of the airline(s) actually providing the service. Thus, the current policy recognizes that, to be timely, notice must be given during all discussions about a code-shared flight. Consumers must be given clear notice before they make reservations or buy transportation both that the service they are considering is on a code-shared flight and of the actual operator's identity, so that they can consider these facts in making travel purchase decisions. When adopted, the policy statement on code-sharing disclosure was not applied directly to ticket agents, since it was believed that ticket agents would communicate important information to travelers to retain them as clients. 49 FR 43709; October 31, 1984. Furthermore, section 41712 of title 49 of the U.S. Code prohibits unfair and deceptive practices by ticket agents, and Department rules also prohibit ticket agents from misrepresenting the kind or quality of service being sold. 14 CFR 399.80(c). In practice, the Department has not expressly required ticket agents to disclose code-sharing arrangements, although it would consider enforcement action against ticket agents who misrepresent code-sharing services as single-carrier services in response to specific inquiries. Moreover, since there were few code-sharing arrangements between U.S. and foreign air carriers at the time of its adoption, the policy did not explicitly cover foreign air carriers. 14 CFR 399.88. To some extent, the Department has since moved to address this matter. Specifically, when the Department approves a code-sharing arrangement involving a foreign air carrier, it now explicitly requires the foreign air carrier to adhere to the requirements of 14 CFR 399.88 as a condition of its approval. See, e.g., Order 94&hyph;5&hyph;35 (May 24, 1994).
