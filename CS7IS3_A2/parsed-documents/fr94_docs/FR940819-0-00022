FR940819-0-00022 FR940819-0-00008 40 CFR Part 52 [WI46&hyph;01&hyph;6590; FRL&hyph;5050&hyph;3] Withdrawal of Approval of Implementation Plan Item; Wisconsin AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency withdraws the conditional approval of the State of Wisconsin's committal State Implementation Plan (SIP) for oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) reasonably available control technology (RACT) issued on February 1, 1994. Approval of this committal allowed the State to delay submitting NO X RACT rules until February 1, 1995. On May 6, 1994, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) rejected EPA's construction of the conditional approval provision to allow for committal SIPs. In light of this decision EPA issued notices of failure to submit NO X RACT SIPs to all States that had merely submitted committal NO X RACT SIPs. Therefore, both to comply with the Court's decision and in the interest of equity with other States, EPA believes it is necessary to make this withdrawal effective upon publication so that EPA may then immediately issue a finding of failure to submit to the State of Wisconsin. DATES: This final rule will be effective August 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Carlton T.

Background On February 1, 1994, EPA issued a final conditional approval of a committal SIP submitted by the State of Wisconsin. By this committal SIP, the State committed to adopt for the Milwaukee, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, and Sheboygan nonattainment areas reasonably available control technology (RACT) for stationary sources of oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) emissions. The committal SIP consisted of a commitment of the State to adopt such rules and a schedule for adoption. The State submitted this committal SIP pursuant to an interpretation of the EPA that such commitments could be considered for conditional approval under section 110(k)(4) of the Act. See Memorandum, dated July 22, 1992, from Michael H. Shapiro, Deputy Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, entitled ``Guidelines for State Implementation Plans Due November 15, 1992'' (hereafter ``Shapiro Memorandum''); Nitrogen Oxide Supplement to the General Preamble, 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992). On October 9, 1992, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) challenged EPA's committal SIP policy as set forth in the Shapiro Memorandum. NRDC v. EPA , No. 92&hyph;1535 (D.C. Cir.). Furthermore, on December 4, 1992, NRDC challenged EPA's committal SIP policy with respect to NO X RACT submittals, as that policy was articulated in the NO X Supplement to the General Preamble. NRDC v. EPA , No. 92&hyph;1630 (D.C. Cir.). NRDC sought to consolidate these cases, along with a third case challenging EPA's committal SIP policy for inspection and maintenance (I/M) SIP submittals. The Court denied NRDC's motions to consolidate the cases, but set all three cases for oral argument on the same date. The three cases were argued before the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on March 3, 1994. On March 8, 1994, the Court issued an Order with respect to the I/M challenge, finding that EPA's committal SIP policy ``is contrary to law.'' The Court issued an Amended Order on April 22, 1994, but did not change this fundamental decision in the Amended Order. On May 6, 1994 the Court issued its full opinion as to all three cases. In that opinion, the Court reiterated its rejection of EPA's construction of the conditional approval provision to allow for committal SIPs. See NRDC v. EPA , No. 1535, slip op. at 16 (D.C. Cir., May 6, 1994).
