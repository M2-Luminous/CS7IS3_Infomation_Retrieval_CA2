The National Police report the explosion inflicted damage at the Guatemala-Norte station, east of Guatemala City, which distributes electricity from the Chixoy hydroelectric plant. The terrorist act caused traffic jams in various parts of the city with traffic lights going out. Meanwhile, authorities from the National Electric Institute are working to restore power. The incident occurred 72 hours prior to the vote on a referendum to approve or reject 37 constitutional reforms. In addition, military sources reported that Guatemalan Army troops sustained five casualties when they clashed with a column of the Revolutionary Organization of the Peoples in Arms (ORPA) at La Igualdad farm in La Reforma. Soldier Julio Lopez Chavez told NOTIMEX that at 1300 the 1st and 3d Companies of the San Marcos Detachment searched La Igualdad farm, 280 km to the west of Guatemala City, where the guerrillas mined the field. The two Army companies detected the presence of the 15 ORPA rebels, who retreated to a very deep and rocky area when they noticed they had been discovered. The soldiers proceeded to comb the area in search of the rebels. Two soldiers, Mauricio Hernandez Chun and Jose Pacual Merlo, died when they activated a claymore mine. Three soldiers were also injured by shrapnel from the mines. The soldiers' bodies and the injured soldiers were transferred to Coatepeque on the San Marcos Department border.
