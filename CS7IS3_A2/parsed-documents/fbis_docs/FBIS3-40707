It is nothing but a gimmick to draw India into a bilateral dialogue between the United States and Pakistan. By choosing to ignore the bait India has done well. Any response or resentment by India would have drawn the country into what is essentially a bilateral issue and equate its own position to that of Pakistan, that being the original bait, thus getting trapped into the dragnet of US strategic policy to work out a nuclear understanding in the South Asian region. India's reluctance to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty due to its discriminatory character has been a bugbear with US defence and strategic analysts. The US approach to the nuclear issue encapsulates two worlds, the have's and have nots--the distinction being made on the grounds of who exploded the nuclear bomb before 1967 and those who did so afterwards. Instead of protecting the weak and the have nots, the US policy discriminates against them and expects all their facilities to be placed under the International Atomic Energy Agency inspection regime; no self-respecting sovereign country could be expected to toe this line willingly. What is most diabolical about the treaty is that though it expects the have nots to sign the treaty, the treaty per se does not contain any clause that extends help and protection to the suffering nation in the event of an attack by a nuclear power nation. Aware of India's growing economic and scientific clout, also aware of India's reluctance to sign the NPT, the United States is now using its cat's paw, Pakistan, to enmesh India in a regime which will satisfy its strategic needs. From being on the brink of being labelled as a terrorist state to the dropping of the Pressler Amendment against it, Pakistan has proved to be a mere pawn in the strategic games that US plays in South Asia. The Pressler law proscribes military sales and economic aid to Pakistan till the US President certified that Pakistan was not making nuclear weapons. What new and objective evidence has the US pounced upon in the last six months that it is willing to drop the Pressler law against Pakistan? If anything, the evidence pointing to state sponsored terrorism by Pakistan is only mounting. More than 20,000 people have died in Punjab and the toll is around 7,000 in Kashmir till now, and the contribution of Pakistan to this death and gore is very critical. The bomb blast in the New York Trade Centre is child's play when compared to the mayhem created in Bombay this year. Again, it was Pakistan which had a lot to explain for such happenings. All these would not have happened but for the funding, safe haven, and logistical support provided to terrorists by Pakistan. While the US recognises the large pool of operatives from Afghanistan working in the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, it turns a Nelson's eye to the most compelling evidence as to Pakistan's nefarious activities in the Indian sub-continent. The US policy has, from time to time, proved to be quite thoughtless having created Frankensteins wherever it operated. This was the case with the World Trade Centre conspiracy, this was the case with respect to Iraq and many more such examples can be given relating to UK, Germany and France. By choosing to play around with countries in the sub-continent, the US is again at its game of pitting one country against other, to garner valuable benefits for itself. The dropping of the Pressler law against Pakistan will lead to a fresh bout of arms purchase by both, Pakistan and India. This can only upset the economic reforms programmes being put in place by them and also put the peace process of the entire South Asian region in jeopardy. Should any such development occur, the responsibility will rest solely on the United States of America.
