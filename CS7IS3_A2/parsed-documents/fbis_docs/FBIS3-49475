The UD Presidium also declared it supported actions of the Polish president serving this goal. "It is of great significance for our region, and in the long run for the entire European situation, to ensure security to the countries which overthrew the communist rule having liquidated in this way the division of the world into political blocs. NATO countries, Western Europe and the U.S. should be conscious of moral obligations in this field towards Poland and our part of Europe and know how to translate them into political decisions," the statement read. "The UD has on many occasions supported the development of good political, economic and cultural relations between Poland and Russia as well as the idea of reconciliation between our two nations. Thus it firmly disapproves of statements by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy which are designed to poison Polish-Russian and Polish-German relations," the statement read and stressed it should be a warning for the democratic world.
