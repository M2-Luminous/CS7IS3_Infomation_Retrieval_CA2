FBIS4-4598 "dreas064_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 North Korea Parliamentary Union Condemns U.S. War Moves Parliamentary Union Condemns U.S. War Moves SK0204102794 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1013 GMT 2 Apr 94 SK0204102794 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Yi Mong-ho, head of the DPRK Parliamentary Union delegation, speaking at the 91st conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) on March 25, warned that the United States should be held entirely responsible for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its war moves. Recalling that although four steps of simultaneous action were agreed upon at the DPRK-USA contact in New York in February, the U.S. side has fulfilled none of its obligations, leaving its promise an empty word, he said: "The United States frustrated the third round of DPRK-USA talks with the far-fetched argument that the inspection of the DPRK by the International Atomic Energy Agency was not satisfactory, and decided to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea, threatening the resumption of 'Team Spirit' joint military exercises. "We will not regard it as our duty any longer to guarantee the continuity of safeguards since the United States and the IAEA intentionally distorted the results of inspection for the continuity of safeguards and are abusing them as an excuse for increasing pressure on our Republic. "The attempt of the United States and some Western countries to put pressure on us through the UN Security Council hampers a complete solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and compels us to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). "We will have no other choice but to carry into practice the measures laid down in the March 12, 1993, statement of the government of our Republic in order to defend the national sovereignty and security of the country. "A grave situation which may lead to confrontation and war has been created on the Korean peninsula again, and it is our stand to answer dialogue with dialogue, war with war under such situation." Speaking at the conference that day, a member of the DPRK Parliamentary Union delegation said the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be solved through DPRK-USA talks because it is the United States that introduced nuclear weapons into South Korea and has threatened the DPRK and invented a fiction of "suspected nuclear development" of the North. "Pressure, threat and sanctions can neither be a solution to the problem, nor will they work with our people," he stressed.
