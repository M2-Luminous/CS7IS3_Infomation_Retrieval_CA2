While the international community witnessed how Gorazde was occupied by the aggressive Serbs as a safe city in Bosnia against the international organization's indifference, the U.S. President's statements are more a reaction to public opinion in the United States and the world. Gorazde was occupied by the invading Serb Army when the international community had called for a decisive measure to put an end to Serbian attacks against Gorazde, with its expression of disgust toward crimes committed by the Serbs. The West not only did not show any reaction to this Serb's invasion of Gorazde but with its silence against these crimes expressed its pleasure, too. In the thick of the collapse of Gorazde and the atrocities by the Serbs in this Muslim inhabited city, political observers predicted that the West's silence would place a new dilemma in front of the western statesmen. The same observers expressly said that the Serb's victory in dominating Gorazde will put this question to the western statesmen as to how they want to prevent Serbs later invasions in the future. In response to this question the U.S. President has proposed to extend NATO air force operation region to the vicinity of safe regions in Bosnia in a way to cover Serb supply and ammunition depots. The U.S. secretary of defense in explaining the failure or success of the plan on the extension of safe regions to the vicinity of these region has said: Even if the U.S. presence plan is confirmed by the NATO military experts it cannot guarantee the security of the safe regions. The U.S. President proposed the said plan while political observers in the United States warned the U.S. statesmen by saying the Serbs victory in occupying Gorazde has explicitly endangered U.S. strategic interests and has brought up this possibility that the Serbs extend their invasion as far as Croatia and Macedonia. The situation in the tragic collapse of the Muslim-inhabited city of Gorazde along with the massacre of human beings in this city, has made the world people realize this fact that the West shows serious reaction to aggressors only when its strategic interests are exposed to threats. In other words, Gorazde collapsed because the collapse of this Muslim-inhabited city was not against the West's strategic interest. Expansion of Serb invasions against Croatia, in view of independence-seeking inclinations among the Serbs in [word indistinct] region, will give this chance to the Serb invaders to threaten the creation of a confederation of Croatia Republic and Muslim-Croat Federation which has been agreed upon. In the meantime, the expansion of Serb aggression against Macedonia will [word indistinct] the creation of the greater Serbia. Expansion of the Serb invasion has placed the UN before the reality that if it had showed serious and decisive reaction against violation of the first UN Security Council resolution by the Serbs, the Bosnian nation would not be the subject of such atrocities today, and the credibility of this world organizations would never be harmed as such.
