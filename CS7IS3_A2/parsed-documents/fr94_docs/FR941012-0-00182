FR941012-0-00182 FR941012-0-00013 One State recommended that reasonable deviation cover highway and law enforcement situations that require a driver to take an alternative route. The FHWA agreed with this recommendation and amended ยง397.67(b)(3) to provide for highway agency detours, such as in work zones, and law enforcement situations. The FHWA also amended the terms ``Class A or Class B explosives'' to ``Explosives, in Class 1, Division 1.1, 1.2, 1.3'' so as to be consistent with the current terminology in the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR 171&hyph;180). Quantities of NRHM Four commenters recommended limiting the placarded quantity and type of NRHM for which the regulation applied, such as to bulk rather than to vehicles transporting small individual cylinders of hazardous materials. The FHWA did not adopt this recommendation because 49 U.S.C. ยง5112(a)(1) requires that the highway routing regulations apply to a vehicle if such vehicle is transporting in commerce a hazardous material for which placarding of the vehicle is required. This section authorized the Secretary of Transportation to extend application of the regulations to other hazardous materials, but did not authorize limiting their application to only ``in bulk'' hazardous materials. Factors Twenty-four commenters discussed the factors which States and Indian tribes must consider in developing NRHM routing designations. These commenters included twelve shippers and carriers, four States, three local governments, three Federal agencies, one citizens' group and one consulting firm. Eleven commenters recommended clarification of the factors and development of specific measures or benchmarks by which the factors could be evaluated. These commenters were concerned that the factors can be applied differently by various jurisdictions, resulting in different routing designations. Sixteen commenters indicated that specific risk criteria should be considered more important than the other factors, while seven commenters recommended the Federal government establish minimum criteria for each of the factors. The FHWA declined to adopt these recommendations because the HMTUSA specifically provided the States and Indian tribes with the flexibility to determine how each standard should be applied. Five commenters mentioned the importance of providing updated Federal guidelines for analyzing the factors; five commenters recommended additional factors, including accident histories, the use of tunnels, and hours of service for drivers; and several commenters recommended clarification of the terms ``unreasonably burden commerce,'' ``climatic conditions,'' and ``congestion factors.'' In response to these comments, the FHWA revised several of the factors. The factor on ``terrain considerations'' was amended to include both accident severity and clean up of spills; ``alternative routes'' was amended to specifically consider safety; ``climatic conditions'' was amended to provide examples, such as snow, high winds, ice, and fog; and ``consideration of accident history'' was added to the congestion factor. Additionally, the FHWA is in the process of updating the guidelines for analyzing routing designations and intends to address each of the factors in the updated publication. Grandfather Provision The notice of proposed rulemaking contained a section incorporating the grandfather clauses included in the HMTA as amended by the HMTUSA. One clause provides that routing designations established before November 16, 1990, are not required to comply with the factors discussed in ยง397.71 of the regulation. Another clause provides that the routing designations established before the date of issuance of these regulations do not have to be in accordance with the routing standards dealing with public participation, consultation with other jurisdictions, and timeliness. The FHWA received numerous comments from the public expressing their concern that incorporation of these grandfather clauses in the regulation resulted in unnecessary confusion. The FHWA agrees. A strict reading of the grandfather clauses would make the factors established in this regulation retroactively applicable to routing designations established after enactment of the HMTUSA on November 16, 1990. It would be impracticable and unduly burdensome on the States and Indian tribes to interpret the statute in such a manner. The FHWA would be applying to these routing designations factors that did not exist in Federal regulations at that time. As a result, the FHWA has decided to apply the factors established in this final rule prospectively from 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register . This action should not be interpreted to mean that the routing designations established prior to the publication of the final rule are not subject to Federal preemption. These routing designations are still subject to Federal preemption under 49 U.S.C. ยง5125(a), if_ (1) Complying with a requirement of the State, political subdivision, or tribe and a requirement of this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter is not possible; or (2) The requirement of the State, political subdivision, or tribe, as applied or enforced, is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out this chapter or a regulation prescribed under this chapter.
