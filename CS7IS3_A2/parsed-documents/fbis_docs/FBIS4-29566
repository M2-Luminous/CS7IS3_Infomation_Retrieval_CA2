Besir Kolobo), general secretary of the National Guidance Committee of the Sudanese Union of Mali-African Democratic Alliance. At the meeting, the ambassador conveyed greetings from the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il to General Secretary (Mamdou L. Besir Kolobo). Expressing deep appreciation for this, the general secretary asked the ambassador to convey his greetings and wish for long life to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The general secretary said that today the U.S. imperialists and imperialists in the West are running amok to crush [apsal haryogo palgwanghago] socialist Korea. He said: The U.S. imperialists, together with Japan and the South Korean puppets, are raving about sanctions against socialist Korea on the pretext of a nonexistent nuclear problem of the DPRK. The incident of Japan's concealment of plutonium and oppression maneuvers against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan are acts that should absolutely not be overlooked. Nevertheless, the United States and the West, while pretending that they are not aware of such acts, are acting arbitrarily by raving only about the nuclear issue of the DPRK. The imperialists are making miscalculation. The U.S. imperialists cannot bring the Korean people, who firmly believe in justness of their cause, to their knees. The Korean people have attained firm single-hearted unity based on the chuche idea which the great His Excellency President Kim Il-song created and which dear His Excellency Kim Chong-il is brilliantly deepening and developing. No strength in the world can make the Korean people surrender.
