This announcement was made today, individually, by the Eighth Naval Zone, the Third Military Region, and the Attorney General's Office (PGR). In this connection, the latter department's representative, Luis Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, reported that, since January, the PJF [Federal Judicial Police] has turned 500 persons over to the competent judicial authorities for implication in crimes against health and illegal carrying of weapons. He indicated that, on highways and roads, and in towns, rural communities, and fishing grounds located on the Sinaloa coast, an extensive security system was established, in a coordinated manner, between federal and state police forces. He added that PGR helicopters are flying over the roadways with the heaviest passenger and freight traffic, while checkpoints have been set up at the main intersections, supervised by agents from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office and representatives of human rights commissions. He specified that, in the head-on effort to combat the drug traffic, 57 long-range and 167 short-range weapons have been seized, as well as 2,858 cartridges of various calibers. He noted that 250 members of the Federal Judicial Police have been mobilized for this purpose, and that during the past four months 308 convictions have been ordered. Furthermore, there has been a 75-percent cut in the existing backlog of preliminary investigations. The commander of the Eighth Naval Zone, stationed in Mazatlan, Zilli Viveros, in turn, declared: "The coastal surveillance operation is intended to support the PGR's action against the drug traffic, and will be maintained as long as is advisable." He said that attention has also been given to reports claiming that shrimp boats are being used to move drugs. Hence, the activities include searches of suspected vessels in the area. The commander of the Third Military Region, Jose Angel Garcia Elizalde, announced that 2,000 troops from the Task Force Mars operation, backed by Mexican Air Force and PGR aircraft, are remaining in the sierra zones and in the valleys, taking action to combat the drug traffic. He commented that, during this time of the year, when the rainy season is about to begin, there is an increase in drug production. Hence, the troops are also intensifying their efforts to detect and destroy plantations, primarily those of poppies and marijuana. Finally, Garcia Elizalde stressed: "The troops have succeeded in destroying a considerable number of drug crops, located on very high levels in the zone comprised of the converging mountain regions of Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Durango."
