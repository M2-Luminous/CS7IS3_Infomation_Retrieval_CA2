From the Proceedings of the Soviet of the Republic--Parliament of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic"] [Text] After discussing very quickly the proposals concerning Temporary Regulations of the Chambers of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic] parliament, on which Kh. Shogenov, deputy chairman of the Commission for Legislation, Legal Order, Security, and Human Rights, made a report, the deputies moved on to the draft KBR Law "On Education." It was presented by V. Tlupov, chairman of the Social Policy Commission. Let us note that an extensive draft was prepared by the relevant commission of the Supreme Soviet in its time, but was never passed. According to the draft, the sphere of education is proclaimed to be a priority. A republic program for the development of education which would be prepared and revised on a competitive basis would be the foundation of the state policy of the KBR in the area of education. All citizens of the KBR would be guaranteed free general education and, on a competitive basis, free vocational education. Conditions would be provided for developmentally impaired children to receive education; those of outstanding ability will be assisted in receiving an elite education. Having passed through the first section without much disagreement, the deputies dwelt for a long time on the second section devoted to education and national culture. Despite clarifications from Z. Nakhushev, the speaker of the chamber, to the effect that the law was being developed for the long term (this is also stated in Point 3, Article 6 of the first section: "State educational standards for new educational programs shall be introduced, as a rule, five years after the beginning of work under the programs in question"), members of the Social Policy Commission who introduced the draft had to answer many questions and stoically defend a number of its provisions and articles. Citizens of the KBR are entitled to receive primary general education in their native languages, as well as to select the language of instruction within the framework of opportunities provided by the educational system (Point 2, Article 7). In this case, queried V. Protasov, why adopt Point 6 of the same article: "The language of one of the indigenous peoples (either Kabardin or Balkar), at the option of the student, as one of the state languages of the KBR shall be introduced as a required course in all educational establishments (general-educational, secondary) in which instruction is offered in the Russian language." It was explained to him that the language of instruction and the subject of study are different things, and that the three languages proclaimed to be the state languages of the republic should have equal opportunity for development. Differences over the language policy were quite substantial and led to many hours of discussion which, however, proceeded quite properly, in parliamentary form and expression. There was no dearth of arguments from both sides, with each side trying to convince the other that its particular arguments were weighty. The polemics were protracted, and the words of KBR Deputy Minister of Public Education V.V. Shibeleva, who attended the proceedings, sounded, in a way, surprisingly conciliatory: "The problem is indeed great, but the children have no doubts. They have this subject (Kabardin or Balkar) on their curriculum, and they study it in peace. Everything will be normal--given that the approach is professional and the methodology is competently developed. Nobody will be harmed by knowing another language." They settled on this, although repeated disputes arose later. Thus, having read in Point 2, Article 8: "...Any politicization of the history of KBR nations shall not be allowed," the members of parliament began to have doubts: Is this possible? After all, history in itself is politics. Nonetheless, they resolved that they should strive for lay, unpoliticized education. In two days the deputies covered only two sections out of seven. Well, the draft law "On Education" is one that applies to all without exception. In essence, the kind of society we will create directly depends on this draft law. Therefore, such painstaking work should be justified.
