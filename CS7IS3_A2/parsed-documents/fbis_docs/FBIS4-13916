In statements carried by Arab and foreign media organizations in Nicosia, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Rafi'i asserted that the Lebanese people cannot but be supportive of Iraq, which has strongly nurtured their struggle in the course of their defense of their national unity and promoted their steadfastness on their national soil to enable them to liberate it from the filth of the Zionist enemy. Al-Rafi'i noted that the Lebanese Government's decision to sever ties with Iraq is part of a conspiratorial scenario targeting both Iraq and Lebanon. Al-Rafi'i urged the nationalist and pan-Arab forces that are opposed to the subjugation of the Lebanese political decisionmaking process to close their ranks and overlook their differences to save Lebanon from the current state of loss and thwart the schemes that aim to eliminate its sovereignty. Al-Rafi'i also condemned the campaign of arrests targeting nationalist and pan-Arab figures in Lebanon, which is coupled with another campaign aimed to muzzle intellectual freedom and heavily censor various Lebanese media organizations.
