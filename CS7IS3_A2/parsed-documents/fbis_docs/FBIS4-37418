Reports received indicate that dozens were martyred or injured. The accident happened when the pilgrims were mourning the anniversary of the demise of the Lord of the Martyrs and the area around the shrine was filled with mourners. The pictures you can see now were taken a few hours after this heart-rending incident, which was perpetrated by the ruthless hypocrites [Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization]. As a result of this unprecedented crime part of the holy shrine was also destroyed. A statement obtained in Mashhad in the wake of this heart-rending tragedy shows that the hypocrites committed this criminal deed. A report prepared by our correspondent, who arrived at the scene of tragedy few minutes after the incident, indicates that the bomb weighed perhaps about five kilos and was planted under a column above the holy shrine, in the south-western sector of the eighth Imam's grave site. It is necessary to mention hat several years ago too, the hypocrites intended to carry out a similar criminal deed in the holy shrine of Imam Reza, but the agents responsible were arrested. Their action today was perpetrated to mark the anniversary of the 20 June 1981 incident. On that day the ruthless hypocrites staged a last-ditch movement against the sacred regime of the Islamic Republic. But they were crushed, thanks to the people's presence and ever-lasting unity.
