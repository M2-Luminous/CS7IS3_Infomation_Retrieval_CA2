Akashi and Cot were escorted to the site of Saturday's massacre, the worst single attack since the siege of the Bosnian capital began 22 months ago, by Sarajevo Mayor Muhamed Kresevljakovic and Bosnian Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic. They were to meet with Bosnian leaders Sunday before heading back to Zagreb later in the afternoon. Akashi said an investigation was underway to determine who had fired the shell that slammed into the crowded market, killing 66 and injuring 197, many of whom are not expected to survive because of the gravity of their wounds. She said although there were assumptions as to who was responsible, no final conclusions could yet be drawn. The UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said in a statement Saturday that it had "confirmed that the explosion was caused by a single, 120 mm mortar bomb fired from northeast of the market." But UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said the investigation was difficult as the shell first hit a tower without fully exploding and then crashed into the market. [passage omitted]
