He said that the process that advocates the establishment of a strong and determined body for the police, which became somewhat uncertain after the change of the regime, has lasted some one and a half to two years now. The reason for the uncertainty was that the rights of policemen had not been laid down in law before. The minister emphasized that the law regulates in detail the conditions of coercion that can be applied by policemen; therefore, policemen performing their duties legally will no longer be liable to suffer political attacks. Naturally, the law also contains adequate guarantees to prevent abuse of violent power. In Konya's view, it is of utmost importance that the law regulates the collection of secret information in accordance with the constitutional state. The police are placed in the state apparatus in accordance with the rules of parliamentary democracy; according to the law, the police are part of the executive power, therefore they are under the government's supervision, the minister said. In reply to our question what was the cause of the impressive majority in accepting the law, Konya said that the drafting of this law that requires a two-thirds majority was the result of a very long coordination. In his view, the successful voting was also helped by the fact that, before the elections, none of the parties wanted to have the responsibility of preventing the acceptance of a law that is fundamentally important for strengthening public security. Konya also pointed out that, in recent months, the parties that had previously had reservations about creating a strong police force have also acknowledged society's need for public security.
