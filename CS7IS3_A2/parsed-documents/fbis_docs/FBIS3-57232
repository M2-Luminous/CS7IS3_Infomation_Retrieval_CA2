Minsk residents, having touched him, were touched too. I have managed to ask U.S. President Clinton about his impressions on his visit to Minsk in the huddle on the Pobyeda square, where, to the Minsk residents' delight, he boldly got into contact with them, thus putting his "security" [precedent word in transliterated English] men into a tight mess. Yet his bodyguards have come out of this mess with credit. However, as the President was approaching his limousine, I managed to elbow my way through the crowd for a mini-interview. To the title phrase of this report, Bill Clinton, while broadly smiling and lifting his hands, added that he was sincerely pleased. One may suppose, he was pleased not only with his visit results but also with the Minsk residents' delight at seeing him. Returning to that touching moment when the U.S. President was shaking hundreds of outstretched hands with particular attention to the children, it should be said that this mutually friendly disposition of Minsk residents and the President seemed to break some invisible wall of grave officialdom, with which this visit was surrounded; further, everything progressed in a more humane fashion. I have in mind his meeting at the Academy of Science, where Bill Clinton delivered a brilliant speech more in an absorbed interlocutor's manner than in a lecturer's tone. I mean also his visit to the Kuropaty burial ground where he was all concentrated, but his accentuated concentration seemed to be for his deep feeling, not for show. Well, it is remarkable when an extremely official event on the political Olympus takes on more human traits. This gives hope that documents are signed not for documents' sake, and that the essence of those documents are the people and people's predicaments. We have seen that the U.S. President is capable of convincing not only American people but also our citizens who by now are lost in heavy doubts as to whether power is for the people or, per chance, against the people. I would like to focus on this aspect of Clinton's visit to Minsk before touching upon the official results. Unquestionably, it was a visit of support. Not only for moderate reformers in the Supreme Soviet, whose efforts to promulgate a new constitution and to launch new elections this year were evidently supported and stimulated by Clinton. Not only for the highest government officials who at last dared to speak about our good interest in the common cause of nuclear disarmament and who heard the U.S. President's positive statements that were very close to guarantees. Not only for industrialists, scientists, and entrepreneurs, for whom the adopted documents -- agreements on the protection of investments, on science and technology, on the creation of a bilateral committee for developing business, on the establishment of an American business center and regional funding -- are of the greatest interest. Not only for oppositionists who were able to impart their opinions on the situation in the Republic to the U.S. President and received moral support in his assertion that American assistance will be rendered depending on the success of democratic processes. I repeat -- not only for them. First of all, it was a visit of support for everyone of us, for ordinary citizens who suffer all the burden of the transition from one system to another. We are confused, we are even shocked; only a few of us know how to get out of this jam. President Clinton does not assume the role of some messiah or commander, but he believes in our strength and our ability to overcome difficulties which he calls "a pay for hope." He believes that we will adopt a worthy constitution, establish an economic basis for a worthy life and the economic protection of the people, as well as elect a new legislative body and create a system which will allow everyone to participate in adopting the most important resolutions in our Republic. He extends best wishes to this country which suffered from ideological conflicts, war, and Chernobyl; he believes in its citizens and wants to help them. Such were some of Clinton's statements voiced in his speech at the Academy of Sciences. It should be noted that his hope for holding new elections in Belarus was rewarded by a special burst of applause. What else can be included in a nonprotocol summary of this visit? One extremely personal, but, it seems, significant observation. The majority of the audience at the Academy of Sciences -- mainly young scientists, young politicians and journalists, and the cultural elite -- listened to the U.S. President "live," whereas state officials clutched earphones with a simultaneous translation. One should only agree with Bill Clinton that this new highly educated and talented generation is our greatest hope.
