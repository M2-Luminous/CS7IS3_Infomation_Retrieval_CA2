The activists of the new organisation stressed that they did not invite the ruling coalition members, since their policy has been disappointing. Another fringe party, the Future Estonia Party, refused to participate because of ideological difference. Negotiations with some other organisations are in progress, but the results have not been disclosed yet. One of the initiators, Juri Estam, stressed that the organisation will not cooperate with right-wing extremists, referring to the Patriotic Central Union. The initiators denied having formed the organisation for improving their chances at the elections; the aim was to actually restore the Estonian nation state, the organisation statement read. A political party or an electoral union may be formed, but there is no firm decision on that issue as yet. The "Better Estonia" intends to use decolonisation and desovietisation in order to achieve its aims. Green Party chairman Juri Liim stressed that they intend to employ "civilised decolonisation" by appealing to the Russian Government to recall its colonists. A thorough investigation of the activities of the Communist Party and the KGB and the GRU [Soviet Army Intelligence] in Estonia was also mentioned as an important part of the programme. Further items include rapid return of land and property to the legal owners and support to private ownership. The organisation denounced the draft law of the Tallinn City Council recommending that all persons registered as permanent residents of Tallinn as of 1 July 1990 be granted permanent residence permits. The council is exceeding its authority, the "Better Estonia" declared.
