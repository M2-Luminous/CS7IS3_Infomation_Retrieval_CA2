FR941006-2-00106 FR941006-2-00082 [Release No. 34&hyph;34761; File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;07] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Reporting of Certain Financial and Other Information by Broker-Dealers September 30, 1994. On May 2, 1994, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rules change adopt new section 2(n) to chapter XXII of the Rules of the Board of Governors of the Exchange. On May 12, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 3 On August 16, 1994, the Exchange submitted Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change. 4 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 See letter from Karen Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE, to Sandy Sciole, Special Counsel, SEC, dated May 5, 1994. Amendment No. 1 corrected a technical mistake in the text of the rule submitted with the original rule filing. 4 See letter from Karen Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE, to Amy Bilbija, SEC, dated August 10, 1994. Amendment No. 2 contained a revised Exhibit 2, which reformulated the proposed rule change. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34556 (August 19, 1994), 59 FR 44201 (August 26, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. Among other matters, the rule being adopted requires each broker-dealer for which the Exchange is the designated examining authority (``DEA'') to provide to the Exchange on a quarterly basis (or more often as deemed appropriate by the Exchange): (a) A report of all assets and liabilities attributable to the broker-dealer or held by another entity for the account of the broker-dealer; (b) A description of any outstanding litigation or contracts that may have a material financial impact on the broker-dealer; and (c) A pro-forma consolidated capital computation of assets and liabilities of any subsidiary or affiliate for which the broker-dealer guarantees, endorses or assumes directly or indirectly the obligations or liabilities. In addition, the rule requires each such broker-dealer immediately to notify the Exchange of any financial matters that may have a material impact on the firm's capital and or its equity requirements. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange including the requirements of section 6(b) of the Act. 5 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public. 5 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). The Commission believes that this rule will protect investors and the public interest by providing the BSE with an early warning of potential financial difficulties at member firms for which it is the DEA and by otherwise enhancing the BSE's ability to monitor the continued financial well being of such firms. Moreover, the proposed rule will help the BSE to ensure its members' compliance with the requirements of the Commission's net capital rule, Rule 15c3&hyph;1 under the Act. 6 6 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1 (1993). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 7 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;07) is approved. 7 15 U.S.C. 78s(b) (2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 8 8 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a) (12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
