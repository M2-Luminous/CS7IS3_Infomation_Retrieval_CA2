We wish you a happy new year, Governor. We want to ask you -- indeed, this is the purpose of our call -- a question: Do you know whether all of the U.S. Marines have arrived at Bahia Malaga, and when will they begin the community projects that the U.S. Embassy says the Marines will carry out? [Holguin] First, allow me to restate my best wishes for 1994 to you and all the Caracol journalists and contributors, and particularly to your large audience. I hope this year is beautiful and good, and I hope the best for everyone this year. Referring to the U.S. troops' presence in Bahia Malaga, Juanchaco and Ladrilleros, I understand only the so-called advance platoon has arrived -- some 13 men. I believe this is the correct number. They will... [pauses] they are currently involved in preparing the camp that will house the remaining 130 men, who, if I am not mistaken, should arrive on 4 or 5 January. [Arizmendi] Do you not receive information on the U.S. troops' mobilization? [Holguin] [Bahia Malaga Naval Base Commander] Rear Admiral [Jose Ignacio] Rozo was kind enough to inform me. He kept me informed about their arrival, but we have had no further contact over the weekend. [Arizmendi] Governor, do you really believe they will engage in community work, or are they coming with ulterior motives -- of a police nature, perhaps? [Holguin] That is what the document signed between the national government and the U.S. Government states. One cannot mistrust... [pauses] if one cannot trust the word, much less can we mistrust an official document signed by the government. [sentence as heard] There is something else: They are restricted to operating exclusively in the zone of Juanchaco and Ladrilleros, which is an isolated and solitary area which cannot be reached except by sea. Access is difficult, and there have never been drug trafficking operations there, nor do we know about the existence of laboratories and crops. Furthermore, the climate is not appropriate for this type of activity. Well, this makes it easy to see that they are coming only and exclusively for what the document or agreement between the two governments states. [Arizmendi] Mr. Governor, does this mean the violent criticism issued by certain Valle del Cauca and national groups concerning the U.S. troops' presence is groundless? [Holguin] I believe this was given too much prominence. I said since the beginning that someone tried to make a mountain out of a molehill. I understand this perfectly well, and I said so. I added that I considered the troops' arrival untimely because it coincided with statements made by the U.S. ambassador following Pablo Escobar's death. He said things would continue against Cali; that a war should be unleashed here, etc., etc. This, well... [pauses] obviously, this not only alerted the people, but it also coincided with the troops' arrival. It was natural and logical for the people to react the way they did. Nevertheless, I reassert what I have already said: The document outlines what they have come to do. We also are remaining alert to make sure they are restricted to the zone, as the document also states; do not carry weapons; and carry out their work. Among other things, they have a very short time to carry out their work, because they are scheduled to leave the country on 28 February. [Arizmendi] Excuse me, Governor. Nevertheless, criticism from all of the political groups has continued because of the presence of these U.S. soldiers and engineers. For example, the M-19 [19 April Movement/Democratic Alliance] filed administrative and procedural charges against President Cesar Gaviria with the Attorney General's Office because, it claims, he violated the Constitution when he failed to consult Congress or the State Council about the troops' presence in our country. [Holguin] Well, I cannot... [pauses] I have no authority to pass judgment on the requisites and precepts that the Constitution and law establish for the national government to abide by in this type of operation. I understand these operations have been carried out based on treaties signed by the country many years ago. Moreover, they have been carried out every so often, on a regular basis, in different parts of national territory. I have personally attended the so-called Unitas Operation on several occasions. This is a joint operation between the U.S. Navy, the Ecuadoran Navy, and the Colombian Navy. I believe it is held every year or every two years in Colombian territorial waters and in the Pacific Ocean. I think they are -- how can I say it? -- operations foreseen in international treaties that have been duly signed, ratified, and approved by Congress. Nevertheless, that does not fall within my purview, and I do not have enough information or data on this. I suppose the national government has obviously abided by all the precepts of the Constitution and the law.
