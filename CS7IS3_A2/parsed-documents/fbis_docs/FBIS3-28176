The information says: At a time when the bellicose quarters of the United States threatened to take "sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after setting a deadline under the pretext of "nuclear arms development" by the DPRK, the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the South Korean puppet Army have staged an unbroken chain of war exercises and military provocations against the DPRK. This is very dangerous moves. The U.S. and South Korean warmaniacs are scheming to introduce Patriot missiles into South Korea as part of their attempt to overpower the DPRK militarily. They have brought into South Korea and set in motion a "U.S. state intelligence-supporting team" for war preparations to "intensify espionage on the North." All these ill-boding military moves indicate that the war preparations of the United States and the South Korean rulers have got into full stride and they are now going to take a practical military action by inventing a pretext. If the U.S. and South Korean hardline conservatives attempt to frighten the DPRK with military threat it is a foolish act. We have already solemnly stated that we are prepared either for dialogue or for war. If the U.S. and South Korean bellicose circles persistently seek military adventures, ignoring the DPRK's patient efforts for peace, they will be held fully responsible for the grave situation created by them.
