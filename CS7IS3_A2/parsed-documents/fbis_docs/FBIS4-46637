NA": "Overall Results--A Lesson, Not a Failure"] [Text] The special tactical drills [TSZ] were a common and, at the same time, serious test for the officers and personnel of the field communications center commanded by Major Petro Alekseyev. Even though the drills are monitored from start to finish by exacting review officers, the supervisory functions belong to the command personnel of the unit that is actually performing the TSZ. The subunit of Major Alekseyev was called up at dawn. The mobile portion of the unit, headed by the commander, soon made a march to the appointed area. Taking the scarcity of fuel into account, the route that was selected was intentionally a difficult one. Some 15 kilometers was enough for the review officers to evaluate the capability of the motor vehicles and drivers to carry out the assigned task. It should be stated that the column reached the planned area in full complement and without any serious incidents. The practical combat work then began--the very work that the communications troops had always considered, and still do consider, to be their professional honor and dignity. The officers and young specialists, regardless of the difficult situation in which they had to increase their specialist proficiency, acted in quite precise and confident fashion. The deadline for the entry into communications with other centers and, through a space communications station, with a radio link of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Carpathian Military District and the radio nets of the division staffs was met with time to spare. There were a few shortcomings, of course, which were recorded by the review officers. They were able to fulfill their mission thanks to the efforts and skill of the experienced officers, warrant officers and young specialists. The deputy commander of the field center for indoctrination work, Major Valeriy Nedavniy, could not even single anyone out. After reflection, he named the chief of the telephone center, Captain Kostyantyn Lotostkyy, the chief of the space communications station, Lieutenant Hryhoriy Hrish, and equipment chiefs Warrant Officers Viktor Lepko and Serhiy Hudzevych. The concertmaster for the entire tactical-special exercise, as always, was the commander of the field communications center, Major Petro Alekseyev. It would not be the whole truth, as they say, if we were to fail to mention one other thing. The review officers, without looking at the confident professional actions of the communications troops, nonetheless gave the center only a satisfactory rating during the TSZ. They noted some regrettable trifles connected with the immediate work in the field. This is entirely understandable. The minimal quantity of field trips the regiment was able to make during the winter, after all, owing to the shortage of motor resources, and the clear shortage of actual work had negative consequences. The proficiency of the subunits is dropping, and practical skills are being lost. The end-of-training-period special tactical drill testifies to this. It would be incorrect, however, to call it a failure. This was a lesson--a lesson for the future.
