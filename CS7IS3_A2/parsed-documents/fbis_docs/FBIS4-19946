And an attack from the sky or the sea is inconceivable; we have a very effective protective shield." Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri played matters down: At the northeastern military command at Padua he thanked the soldiers who have defended our country over the past very difficult year. "Our country is NATO's aircraft carrier in Europe; the war in the former Yugoslavia has granted us a strategic role, and our international esteem has increased considerably," he said. The minister then went on to Vicenza, to the headquarters of the Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force (ATAF). It is from this observation post that commands for military actions are issued. "NATO has shouldered all its responsibilities, but I think that it should have intervened even before the Gorazde massacre. I consider it very important and positive that Russia has issued an indication of its amenability by condemning the Serbs. However, I believe that the NATO forces cannot avoid, in the future too, taking all the measures necessary to end the massacre."
