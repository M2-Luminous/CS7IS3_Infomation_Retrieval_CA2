"The Zionists are too anxious to deal with a Syria without another Hafiz al-Asad, so the incident raises many questions," said the daily KAYHAN. "We cannot exclude a role here for US and Israeli agents." The newspaper said Basil was the most appropriate replacement for his father and Syria's "only hope" to continue the "tough political heritage" of Hafiz al-Asad, who has ruled the country for 24 years. The paper added that Basil was his father's confidant, often chosen to launch secret negotiations on Hafiz al-Asad's behalf, particularly with the Lebanese Shiite Moslem fundamentalist group Hizballah. Basil al-Asad, an Army major who was being groomed to succeed his 63-year-old father, died on Friday aged 31. He was buried on Saturday in the family's home village of al-Qardahah in northern Syria, at a funeral attended by several Arab leaders and some 100,000 mourners. Basil's death came less than a week after Asad and US President Bill Clinton held a summit meeting in Geneva in a bid to revive the Arab-Israeli peace process, which Iran fiercely opposes. In a condolence message to Asad on Saturday Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani described Basil's death as a "tragic event."
