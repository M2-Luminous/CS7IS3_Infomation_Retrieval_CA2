This is the public communique I am sending to the command of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]: The de facto strategy, including messages, has yielded fruits. Written communication, both public and confidential, has been serious and has contributed to maintaining the cease-fire and the gradual return to calm in the region. I have received your confidential communication on holding meetings for peace and reconciliation. I agree with your proposal. In a confidential document I am answering your questions on the final details. The dialogue can begin: 1. The meeting will proceed based on the agenda we have mutually accepted. I will listen to your points of view on other issues of interest, knowing that national issues will not be included in the resolutions. 2. Regarding the International Red Cross, I inform you that the participation of this institution is based on the terms of the formal request the International Red Cross made to the Mexican Government. The position of the Mexican Government and this institution is that the activities of the International Red Cross in Mexico should be restricted to its strictly humanitarian purpose and that they should not represent meddling in the domestic affairs of the Mexican state. 3. The objective is an honorable peace. We have started from the principle that peace must be secured while safeguarding the full sovereignty of the Mexican people. All of us -- Congress, the political parties, society, the government, and the churches -- have spoken in favor of a national solution to a Mexican problem. There is no need for internationalizing this conflict. We will have neutral space and offer the guarantees you demand in your confidential document. 4. My tasks are clear: to propose to the government, based on what you tell me, measures aimed at resolving, without gaps, the situation. This is what I have been doing. I also have the task of keeping the people informed and creating an awareness in society that together with a solution to your demands should contribute to the construction of peace. 5. The purpose of the dialogue is to find solutions. All of us, as Mexicans who enjoy equal rights, can propose solutions. This way we can make progress on the most difficult aspect of all negotiations. We can create a framework of respect that will facilitate the peace process. I realize that needs that have been built-up for decades cannot be resolved overnight, but I also know that progress can be made by making big and honest efforts. We will march forward as fast as you are ready to march. 6. I know that solutions to this conflict are complex, that this is not a matter of simply increasing investments or programs but of generating, with your participation, economic, political, and social solutions that will allow the establishment of a new relationship between the authorities and the communities. I am certain that the Indian communities you represent that form part of the EZLN require a new kind of relationship with the institutions of Chiapas and Mexican society. The Mexican nation has the strength of its intrinsic diversity and cultural wealth. My starting point is: respect for the dignity of the Indian communities. Thank you very much. You are very kind.
