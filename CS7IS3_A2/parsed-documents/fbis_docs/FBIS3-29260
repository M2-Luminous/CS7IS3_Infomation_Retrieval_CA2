Minister Predicts Restoral of N-S Talks SK1602070394 Seoul YONHAP in English 0652 GMT 16 Feb 94 SK1602070394 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Feb. 16 (YONHAP) -- Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin said Wednesday there has been no talk of resuming inter-Korean dialogue, but he expected action by Pyongyang shortly as it is a prerequisite to a third round of high-level North Korea-U.S. talks. Choe cautiously predicted resumption of inter-Korean dialogue, while elaborating on the surprise news that Pyongyang had agreed to full-scale nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in a government-party meeting at the Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) headquarters. An IAEA inspection team may leave for Pyongyang as soon as this weekend, Choe reported to party policy-makers. Under a previous agreement worked out at talks in New York last December, North Korea can begin the third round of high-level talks with the United States only when it makes significant progress in inter-Korean relations such as an exchange of envoys, Choe explained. The third Pyongyang-Washington talks will touch on a wide range of issues including North Korea's complete return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, sincere implementation of the declaration on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, and improvement of bilateral relations in the political, economic and security areas, he said. With its acceptance of IAEA inspections, Pyongyang is expected to open dialogue channels with the United States, South Korea and the UN nuclear watchdog, he added. Choe declined to comment on whether North Korea has agreed to the special inspections repeatedly requested by the IAEA.
