Mr. Delors, during the period when Greece held the European Union [EU] Presidency it was criticized, not only by the press, that it was taking advantage of the presidency to promote a serious, national issue. I am referring to the issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. However, Greece never reached the point of sabotaging a serious EU decision. During the past two days in Corfu we have seen that at least one country was led to the point of sabotaging the election of your successor to the Commission for clearly domestic reasons. How do you comment? I would also like the prime minister to comment on this. [Delors] The only thing we can say about the incidents regarding the election of a new European Commission president is that this is not just an issue about a person. It is also an issue of ruling out people according to intentions about Europe's construction. This is why this crisis is important. [Papandreou] I would like to add that Mr. Leon Brittan resigned from running for the position. Therefore, the British insistence not to accept the proposal of the others was possibly due to a completely different perception of the meaning of a United Europe and of the obligations of being a member. Is this a satisfactory answer, Mr. Karelias? [Correspondent] (Kimgeton) Sky News, London. A question for President Delors and Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. Could you answer in English for the national television? What do you think is the message stemming from failing to elect a European Commission president? What is the message regarding democratic procedures, the message that we sent to the rest of the world? Will new candidates emerge before 15 July? [Delors] From my point of view it is better not to add any comment right now because the German presidency will take over the weight of finding a solution, an agreement. If we enter a battle on this issue we will redefine the achievement of the German Presidency. Excuse me, but I think that right now it is in the European Union's interest not to add any comment on the current answer. [Papandreou] I would like to answer the question myself. We proposed that we follow--and we did follow--a very democratic procedure. Every member state proposed a ranking of the three candidates. The numerical superiority of Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene came out democratically. Following that, everybody but Britain supported Dehaene. So, we followed a democratic procedure but Great Britain literally vetoed this procedure and did not accept this decision. I have to say that I do not know what Great Britain will know in two or three weeks, when the next meeting is held, that it does not know now. This is a problem because I believe the rest of us will continue to support Dehaene's candidacy. [passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] For Mr. Delors first. During the news conference held in Zappion Palace in January 1994, you stressed the need to maintain a family-spirit climate, as you said, regarding relations among the partners. Do you believe that Greece's reference to the European Court is a gesture within this framework? The question for the Greek Prime Minister concerns Cyprus' application for EU membership. What is the difference between the reference in the conclusions of today's summit and the respective reference in the conclusions of the Copenhagen summit? [Delors] Madame, I believe there is a political dimension in your question on which I have never expressed any view. There is also a legal dimension. The foreign ministers reminded us that the European Commission is a trustee of conditions. This means that the issue should have been referred to the European Court where Greece presented its arguments. Not implementing the treaty would have been a political decision. We have specific jurisdiction and duties that are attributed to us by the treaties. We have the authority and the monopoly, I would say, of submitting proposals. We must implement the decisions of the European Council, and we are trustees of the conditions within the framework of our jurisdiction. This is the job we are doing. It was unpleasant but we did it. [Papandreou] Mr. Pangalos will reply to the question on Cyprus. [Pangalos] I do not suppose you have in your hands the text of the conclusions, because if you did you would have seen the difference. First of all, Cyprus is now included in the candidate states chapter. It is not a separate Cyprus issue with all of its extensions, but it is contained in the candidate states chapter, that is the expansion. There are two important references to the development of relations with Cyprus. It is noted that both sides of these relations, the trade-technical aspect and the financial aspect, fall within the prospect of accession. Finally, there is an explicit commitment that Cyprus and Malta will be included in the next expansion. The reference also mentions Hungary and Poland. Regarding Turkey, the European Council characteristically notes only the convening of a meeting--which would happen anyway--that will deal with concluding the customs union agreement. I recall that the European Union pursues the customs union agreement, but the Turkish side is in no position to conclude it. I believe this is a significant development and I believe that I have answered your question, which was without reason. [Correspondent] [name indistinct] representing the Yugoslav News Agency. A question for Prime Minister Papandreou. Mr. President, after six months of a very successful presidency during which you pointed out many times the urgent need for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, do you believe that a just solution will be found soon and, if so, when? Also, what are the details of the peace plan that you have been discussing at the EU summit regarding the policy of the contact group that is playing a very crucial role but we know nothing about? [Papandreou] I will ask Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias to answer the question. [Papoulias] The EU effort for finding a just and permanent solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina was continuous, and the EU peace plan still guides the EU efforts toward a solution. I believe the contact group continues its work and thoughts are being discussed about a second Geneva meeting. The visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian foreign minister provided the opportunity for meetings for a better preparation of a second Geneva meeting. The discussion we had on Friday night [24 June] at the working dinner--international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg were present--gave us adequate hope that the contact group's efforts will have a positive outcome in the next few weeks and that a more general solution, especially on the territorial problem, will be found. [Unidentified correspondent] President Delors, do you rule out the possibility that we will have the pleasure of seeing you in the same position for the next five years? And how do you believe the four new countries will mainly affect the European Union's course? [Delors] Regarding your first question, I rule out such a possibility. On the second question, despite Papandreou's efforts and the fact that we must realize that the four candidates are fully respected by him and me, I would have preferred that during their first EU summit, the four new member states not attend discussions on the election of my successor. I was particularly happy with the reaction on the white paper because we ascertained that these are countries with economic and social democracy, which are firmly connected to the political democracy. These are countries that really attribute particular significance in finding a new development model. These are countries that have made superb experiments about managing the labor market and devoted two or three times more means--human and financial--than we did. Therefore, they are countries that agreed on all issues that are contained in the white paper. This really pleased us because the presence of the four countries enriches us in the fight against unemployment and the promotion of the community's social and environmental dimension. [Evstathiadhis] Evstathiadhis from the newspaper VIMA. A question for Prime Minister Papandreou. It has been determined--you have also said it in writing--that the EU people did not show great interest in the idea of a union. This has also been proven in the recent European Parliament election. In your opinion, what is the message that the Corfu summit gives to the European people on how to become more active in favor of the United Europe's ideas and realities? [Papandreou] Undoubtedly, the latest European Parliament elections proved that the European people are only slightly interested in the course of a United Europe. This is a phenomenon that must be examined. However, we can add the following: With the passage of time and the escalating role of the European Parliament and given that many of the national decisions will be dictated by our capacity as members of the United Europe, I believe that this course will be overturned. I have no fuller explanation. [Unidentified correspondent] My question is for both Mr. Delors and Mr. Papandreou. Europe very much wants to be a single family. Within the framework of the EU summit, did you discuss the issue of the Greek border and FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and the Greek embargo against it? [Delors] No, we did not discuss this issue but having presided at the dinner of the European Union Foreign Ministers, Mr. Papoulias could tell you something more. [Papoulias] Indeed, at the EU Foreign Ministers meeting I briefed my colleagues on the contacts between the Greek Government, mine personally, with UN mediator Cyrus Vance. You are aware that I will be in New York in a few days to meet Vance and U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz in an effort to find a solution to this problem. [Pelekis] Nikolaos Pelekis from FLASH radio. Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask whether Britain's decision not to consent with the unanimous election for Delors' successor, sets in motion a serious crisis within the European Union and what could this mean for EU's unity? How serious is the crisis? [Papandreou] Right now it is difficult for someone to evaluate this. If such a stance is maintained, then we would be able to speak about a crisis. Today was an unfortunate event that somewhat stained the overall work of the EU summit, which was excellent. If it continues, then it would mean something deeper. I do not want to predict a big crisis right now. I do not want to make predictions. Thank you.
