FBIS4-67309 "jptdd022__l94074" JPRS-TDD-94-022-L JPRS Narcotics 3 April 1994 NEAR EAST & SOUTH ASIA PAKISTAN Drug Money Reportedly Being Invested in Commerce, Industry Drug Money Reportedly Being Invested in Commerce, Industry 94WD0348I Karachi AMN in Urdu 3 Apr 94 p 3 94WD0348I Karachi AMN Urdu CSO [Commentary by Jumma Khan: "Drug Money is Being Invested in National Commerce and Industry"] [Text] According to the latest news Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India are the first, second, and third countries respectively in drug production, abuse, and smuggling in the whole world. Mr. Giorgio Giacomelli, executive director of the UN International Drug Control Program, is visiting Pakistan these days. He addressed a press conference in the UN drug control office in Karachi on Thursday and presented some facts and figures on which one cannot but express remorse. Mr. Giacomelli said that the number of drug addicts in the world was three million. Half of them live in Pakistan! Pakistan is not a very important drug producer, but drug abuse has reached dangerous proportions here. According to Mr. Giacomelli's records Pakistan produces 150 ton heroin and opium annually. In Afghanistan, this amount has reached between 1,000 to 3000 tons. About 50,000 acres of land is used for growing drug crops in Afghanistan. He explained that this was due to the war raging in Afghanistan for about a decade. The United States could not implement its drug control program because of it. This has led to an increase in drug production, abuse, and smuggling in Afghanistan. The UN facts and figures have their own place, and we have analyzed this problem more than once in this column. It is surprising that an organization like the United Nations bases its conclusions only on the magic of numbers. Why doesn't it discuss the activities that give birth to these numbers? For example, I had explained in detail in this column how the production, use, and smuggling of drugs was on the rise in Pakistan, and also that it was an extension of the increasing production in Afghanistan. The war and civil war over two decades in Afghanistan had opened the Afghan border for free movement of the Mujaheddin. This helped drug dealers to successfully transfer their business to Pakistan. Since the United States had no objection to it at that time, this business continued to flourish. Now that the U.S. interests in Afghanistan have been served, it is continuously expressing its dissatisfaction over Pakistan's increasing drug trade. At that time when Pakistan had formed a blind policy on Afghanistan, did not the United States know of the frightening outcome of this trade? You can imagine how explosive this situation is by the fact that when Pakistani government decided to limit the movement on Afghanistan-Pakistan border and to close the border, a situation was created that the government had to reverse its decision. It is not difficult to estimate how long the hand of the drug mafia is. Abduction of foreigners and government officials is a common occurrence in Balochistan, Sarhad, and Sindh. The people of Balochistan, Sarhad, and Sindh are hostages of the drug mafia. Terrorism and abductions are part of the same story. It is deplorable that the law enforcement agencies know these facts and, instead of taking action against the drug mafia or making the Pakistan-Afghanistan border safer, they are taking action against the peaceful citizens. This is not a secret that no one is aware of. At one time, Afghan citizens came to India for business, and they were still viewed with suspicion. At present, a lot of Afghans have Pakistani passports or identity cards and are giving a bad name to Pakistan all over the world. This has brought Pakistan to the top of the list of nations involved in drug smuggling. Is it not the responsibility of these organizations to record the fact that Pakistan got this curse during the war while protecting U.S. interests in Afghanistan without regard to the country and its people being destroyed? A U.S. deputy secretary of state recently lamented that drug money has penetrated Pakistani politics. However, this situation was created by the U.S. government. Mr. Giacomelli states that 40 percent of Pakistan's GDP is drug money. This can be fatal to any economy. He said that commerce and industry in Pakistan were going into the hands of drug smugglers, therefore, Pakistani government should be alert about them. He emphasized the need for law enforcement and said that law enforcement agencies must be made more effective. The effectiveness of law enforcement agencies is contingent upon their diligence. There is no guarantee that they will not be effected by the "glamour." In the present situation of our law enforcement agencies, any legal action will be useless. But, what does Mr. Giacomelli know! Mr. Giacomelli knows that 25 percent of Pakistan's raw material production last year was from drug money, and this had doubled to 50 percent in one year. Still, Mr. Giacomelli does not want to debate the "why" of this situation. Perhaps, he does not want to raise this issue on purpose. However, it cannot be left alone. We have to first determine which people of which group have what benefits associated with this business. Until this basic fact is determined, no drug program can be successful. This subject is extremely difficult, but we have to discuss it one day. Mr. Giacomelli informed us that the United Nations and its agency is planning to start a program in cooperation with Iran and Pakistan to reduce drug production in South Asia and to stop drug smuggling from this region to the West. This program will cost three million dollars. Iran will contribute $20 million while the United Nations and Pakistan will contribute $5 million each. Mr. Giacomelli while explaining details of his meetings with the prime minister and the president said that Pakistan was very troubled by this drug situation and is willing to cooperate with the United Nations. However, he said that if Pakistan's industry, commerce, and politics were fully controlled by the drug Mafia, there will be extremely dangerous results and Pakistan's economy will be destroyed. If we look at our national politics in the context of drugs, do we not see the bitter fact that youthful, strong, and active forces of our society have been made helpless and innocent people who are being left at the mercy of the drug mafia? No village or city is safe from the terrorists. Is it not pathetic that the forces that can stand firm against the drug mafia are being pushed forcibly against the wall? The forces that can be used against the anti-social elements, terrorists, and drug dealers, are being murdered by the hands of those who are supposed to enforce laws. The question is: Who has invested in what part of this trade? Why are these operations and fake campaigns of the drug enforcement agencies so aberrant.
