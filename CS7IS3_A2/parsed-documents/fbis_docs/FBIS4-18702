In a statement to TRT, Cetin stressed that the German aid extended within the framework of NATO is not used for internal security purposes, adding: We regret this decision. Pointing out that he sent a letter to German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on this matter, Cetin remarked that the military equipment, which was allegedly used for internal security purposes, is similar to that acquired from the Russian Federation some time ago. The military equipment received from Germany is used only for its original purpose, Cetin stressed. He said that he conveyed the issue to the German foreign minister in a telephone conversation this evening. [Begin Cetin recording] I spoke to him on the telephone a while ago. I related to him that this is very wrong, that Turkey and Germany are good friends, and that they have important ties. I remarked that various extremists are engaged in efforts to disrupt Turkish-German relations, that this is wrong, and that in its struggle against terrorism Turkey definitely cannot accept such actions, which could lead to misunderstandings on the part of its allies and friends. I told him that decisions to be made in this vein will damage our relations. I believe that the German Government should also attach the necessary importance to Turkish-German relations; and I conveyed this to him. The German foreign minister noted that he attaches great importance to Turkish-German relations, that he is dwelling on the subject, and that he will exert every possible effort to resolve the problem. He stated that the government will discuss the issue again. I would like to take this opportunity to say the following: Turkey is facing a serious terrorism problem. In this regard, Turkey is determined to exert every possible effort and wage every struggle to preserve its unity and integrity within the rules of a state of law and democracy. Any indirect encouragement accorded by our friends and allies to circles which desire to disrupt our relations will adversely affect our relations. The Turkish and German peoples and countries will certainly not benefit from this. I hope that in the current election atmosphere in Germany, such issues will not be used to serve internal political aims, because they are too sensitive and important to be used for internal politics. Moreover, it is very easy to damage relations. You can disrupt relations with the use of one sentence or one word, but it will take a long time to repair them. I hope that our German friends will realize this fact and demonstrate the necessary understanding for Turkey's justified cause and position. [end recording]
