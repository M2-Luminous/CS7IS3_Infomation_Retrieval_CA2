None of the diplomats wanted to make the slightest comment at the end of the meeting, which lasted over two hours and took place at the residence of Greek Ambassador Marinos Raftopoulos, who represents the country that heads the EU. Meanwhile, this afternoon, there seemed to be no new developments at the Belgian ambassador's residence. The police, which are visibly increasing the number of agents as the night unfolds, cordoned off the diplomatic residence. Some of those who took over the house could be seen from the street at the windows of a house adjacent to the ambassador's residence. Some very young children could also be seen at play in the garden. Official sources emphasized that the negotiations between the two governments continue and that the Cuban Government has guaranteed that these people will not be punished when they leave the embassy. They will be able to start the legal procedures to leave the country.
