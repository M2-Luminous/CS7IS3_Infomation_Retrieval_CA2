Fifteen armored personnel carriers, jeeps equipped with light artillery and several ambulances crossed San Cristobal on Tuesday around 2200 apparently heading toward Ocosingo, which was still occupied by the rebels of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. Military authorities are still keeping quiet regarding the ongoing operations against the EZLN, which launched a surprise attack on 1 January. Apparently, some 12,000 soldiers are participating in the counteroffensive. According to several witnesses, the rebels -- who reportedly total 1,000 -- continued their withdrawal from various towns on Tuesday, moving their casualties to the mountain area.
