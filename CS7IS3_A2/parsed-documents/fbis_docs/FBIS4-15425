Hunt on for Foreigners in Southern Russia. From Near Abroad"] [Text] For several years now Kuban society has been in a state close to panic owing to the intensive immigration into the kray of refugees from all corners of the former Union. At present, the actual number of migrants in the region is put by experts at 600,000. It is not surprising that real estate prices here are growing faster than anywhere in Russia, and that public health conditions have sharply deteriorated. Competition for jobs has become tougher, and there is no need to talk about crime -- the Russian minister of internal affairs, who recently visited Krasnodar, confirmed what everyone already knew --that Krasnodar Kray has a steady lead in this area. Another detail of some importance is that in recent years the Kuban has virtually become a no-man's land or joint rear area (quite safe and therefore particularly convenient and attractive) for at least three warring states.... Fear of being buried under the debris of other people's disasters is forcing the Kuban authorities to take increasingly severe administrative measures. As of April last year the registration of citizens from the near abroad has been under way in the kray. In the space of 12 months the Kuban has expelled around 700 unregistered migrants, and the fines levied on miscreants total 76 million rubles [R]. Total fines levied on illegal migrants have come to R46 million in the first quarter of this year alone.... The Kuban authorities used B. Yeltsin's vacation in Sochi to try to persuade the president "on the spot" of the need for further steps in this direction. As a result, the presidential "go-ahead" was given for the introduction of a visa system in the kray, and the Kuban governor immediately signed the relevant decree. It came into force the other day. Will this turn into a painful offensive against human rights in the kray? Mikhail Savva, chief of the kray administration for nationalities affairs and migration issues, replied categorically in the negative. The decree does not apply to Russian citizens at all, much less to "foreigners from far away." The decree is aimed at our homegrown "near abroad." Movement of these citizens around Russia has hitherto been entirely uncontrolled. Paradoxical situations have emerged: For instance, one such foreigner, exploiting his absolute freedom, committed a crime on Russian territory and went back home -- from where it subsequently proved exceptionally difficult to extradite him ("Sorry, we're a sovereign country..."). As for human rights, Mikhail Savva said, they are being trampled not in the kray, but rather in Moscow, which is creating such an amazing normative base that the provinces have simply been forced to protect themselves. For instance, just what are we to make of an open border with Azerbaijan -- which, in its turn, has an open border with Iran and Turkey? This means one thing -- we have been turned into a cesspit, a sieve, a transit lounge.... The kray administration's administration for nationalities affairs and migration issues has drawn up a document entitled "Description of the Economic Situation and Likely Scenarios for the Development of Events in the Caucasus," setting out a concept for the kray's "Caucasian" policy. Among the main tasks it mentions are to protect the rights of Russians in the Caucasus and to reduce the criminal influence exerted on the kray by neighboring republics. As for the rumors in the press that certain emergency measures will soon be introduced in Krasnodar Kray -- along the lines of Tatarstan -- we can only say that deep in the bowels of the administration work is indeed being done on a number of "hardline" documents within the framework of the latest attempt to launch an anticrime offensive. But these documents have no direct bearing on the visa regime.
