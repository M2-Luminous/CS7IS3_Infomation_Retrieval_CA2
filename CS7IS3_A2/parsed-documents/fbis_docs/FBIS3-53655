Rabin's initiative is directed at three targets: Hafiz al-Asad, the United States, and Israeli public opinion. The message to al-Asad is simple: We heard from the Americans that you are under pressure and would like to achieve peace this year. If this is so, you had better moderate your demands, otherwise we will have to appeal to Israeli public opinion, which would lengthen the process. The Americans told us you are familiar with the Israeli political scene. You are certainly aware of the massive opposition among the Israeli public to any concession on the Golan Heights, and certainly to the total concession you are demanding. The message to the U.S. president and secretary of state is unequivocal: The Sinai withdrawal precedent, UN Resolutions 242 and 338, and mainly the tough Syrian position, could force Israel to concede the entire Golan Heights contrary to vital security interests. This is a difficult, exceptional, sensitive, and complicated issue. Such an issue obliges every prime minister in any democracy to seek the public's opinion. The public could give Syria a negative answer. If you -- like us -- fear such an answer, you can make good use of your direct channel to al-Asad. Rabin's message to the Israeli public is this: I understand you and will try to get the best deal for you. Let me work quietly; stop demonstrating. I got your message. We will try to get the best possible peace agreement, but eventually we will leave the decision in your hands.
