Both indices surpassed 200 billion yuan; of the 220 billion yuan of total income, the net increase was 72.4 billion yuan over the previous year. Last year, Guangdong's township and town enterprises earned a net profit of 16 billion yuan, turned over 6.7 billion yuan in taxes, and earned $7.5 billion through exports. These three economic indicators rose by more 40 percent compared to those of the previous year. Enhancing competitiveness by having an appropriate operational scale, developing high and new technologies and opening up new markets, and making efforts to earn foreign currency by utilizing Guangdong's advantage as the native land of overseas Chinese were the three main reasons why Guangdong's township and town enterprises could make break-through developments last year, and they were also a major embodiment of the greatly increased overall economic strength. In the process of developing township and town enterprises, governments at all levels in Guangdong have paid good attention to maintaining an appropriate scale of operation, have optimized the organization of the finished projects in many respects, and have promoted the rational flow and recombination of personnel, capital, technology, resources, and other means of production so as to obtain returns through an economy of scale. For new projects, they have adopted various means of management such as stepping them up, slowing them down, or stopping them, to ensure the development of key projects, infrastructure, and projects that meet market needs. During the period of macroscopic regulation and control last year, Zhongshan and Sanshui cities stopped or slowed down the development of 100 projects, thus reducing an investment of approximately 2.2 billion yuan and ensuring the development of some key projects there. In order to improve the market competitiveness of township and town enterprises and continuously open up new markets, they can only rely on technology-intensive quality products. It has been learned that, of the new projects started by townships, towns, and villages throughout the province last year, a fairly large number were high-technology projects. Once these technologically advanced projects have been put into operation, it not only will greatly enhance the economic strength of these places but will bring along the development of related industries. At present, Guangdong has over 130 township and town enterprises whose output value has reached 100 million yuan each, representing a 1.4-fold increase over last year; Foshan city alone has 80 of these enterprises. These township and town enterprises which have strong capital support, which are technologically advanced, and whose products sell well have become a powerful and important force in Guangdong's economy.
