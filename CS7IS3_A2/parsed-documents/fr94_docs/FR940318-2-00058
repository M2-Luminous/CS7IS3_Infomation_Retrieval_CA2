FR940318-2-00058 FR940318-2-00045 [OPP&hyph;30000/10H; FRL&hyph;4760&hyph;6] Lindane; Proposed Decision not to Initiate a Special Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces EPA's proposed decision not to initiate a Special Review of pesticide products containing lindane. A Special Review was proposed based on contentions of irreversible kidney effects from certain lindane exposure. EPA has determined that the kidney effects observed are specific to the male rat and are not relevant to human health risk assessment; therefore, a Special Review is not appropriate. DATES: Written comments, identified by the document control number OPP-30000/10H, must be received on or before May 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit comments to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person, deliver comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice announces EPA's decision not to initiate a Special Review of lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) and sets forth the rationale for this proposed decision. In summary, EPA has reevaluated the concerns raised in the September 18, 1985 preliminary notification to registrants and applicants in light of subsequent relevant information. Based on this review, EPA has determined that a Special Review of lindane is not warranted based on its effects in the male rat kidney. I. Introduction A. Legal Background A pesticide product may be sold or distributed in the United States only if it is registered or exempt from registration under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.). Before a product can be registered it must be shown that it can be used without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' (FIFRA section 3(c)(5), 7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(5)), that is, without causing ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use of the pesticide'' (FIFRA section 2(bb), 7 U.S.C. 136(bb)). The burden of proving that a pesticide meets this standard for registration is, at all times, on the proponent of initial or continued registration. If at any time the Agency determines that a pesticide no longer meets this standard for registration, the Administrator may cancel this registration under FIFRA section 6, 7 U.S.C. 136d. The Special Review process provides a mechanism to permit public participation in EPA's deliberations prior to issuance of any Notice of Final Determination describing the regulatory action which the Administrator has selected. The Special Review process, which was previously called the Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration (RPAR) process, is described in 40 CFR part 154, published in the Federal Register of November 27, 1985 (50 FR 49015). Prior to formal initiation of a Special Review, a preliminary notification is sent to registrants and applicants for registration pursuant to 40 CFR 154.21 announcing that the Agency is considering commencing a Special Review. If the Agency determines, after issuance of a preliminary notification pursuant to 40 CFR 154.21, that it will not conduct a Special Review, it is required under 40 CFR 154.23 to issue a proposed decision to be published in the Federal Register . That regulation requires that a period generally not less than 30 days be provided for public comment on the Proposed Decision Not To Initiate a Special Review. Subsequent to receipt and evaluation of comments on the Proposed Decision Not To Initiate a Special Review, the Administrator is required by 40 CFR 154.25 to publish in the Federal Register his/her final decision regarding whether or not a Special Review will be conducted. B. Regulatory Background Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is a broad-spectrum organochlorine insecticide/acaricide registered for control of insects and other invertebrates on a wide variety of sites. Lindane is currently used for agricultural crop seed treatments, livestock, hardwood lumber/logs, pecans, commercial ornamentals, and a variety of other sites including households and structures, forest trees, pets, and assorted fruits and vegetables. 1. Special Review (1977-1983) . The regulatory history of lindane includes a full Special Review based on questions of carcinogenicity, fetotoxicity/teratogenicity, reproductive effects, its potential to cause blood dyscrasias, and acute toxicity to aquatic wildlife. Previous Position Documents (PD) published on lindane include: a. A PD-1 (which initiated a Special Review) in 1977, on the basis of carcinogenicity, chronic reproductive and fetotoxic effects, and acute effects on aquatic organisms. b. A PD-2/3 (which provided a full discussion of hazards, exposures, risks, benefits, regulatory options and a proposed regulatory decision) in July 1980 proposed to cancel most of the uses of lindane. The proposal was based on a risk/benefit determination which suggested that the risks considerably outweighed the benefits associated with lindane's continued use. c. A PD-4 (final determination)/NOIC, published in the Federal Register of October 19, 1983 (48 FR 48512), presented EPA's final determination on lindane. It was based on a revised analysis of the risks and benefits, following careful consideration of the comments EPA had received from the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, members of the affected industries, and the general public. The decision described in the PD-4/NOIC was quite different from the proposed decision in the PD-2/3. EPA originally planned to cancel all of lindane's uses except for the commercial ornamental, livestock, and dog wash uses. The final decision was to continue registration of most uses of lindane. The Agency cancelled the indoor uses of smoke fumigation devices and the use of dog dips to control pests other than mites. All other uses were continued with various restrictions. Those restrictions varied according to the degree of hazard associated with the use, but typical requirements included protective clothing, label statements describing necessary precautions, and restrictions of some products to certified pesticide applicators. The carcinogenic effect was not rebutted by information submitted in response to the PD-4/NOIC. Following an Agency risk/benefit analysis based on the carcinogenic risk, the registrations for lindane smoke fumigation devices for indoor domestic use were phased out (with cancellation becoming effective May 1986), and lindane dog dips for the control of pests other than mites were cancelled. The dog dip cancellation was challenged, and subsequently the dog dip use for pests other than mites was permitted for commercial use (kennel, farm, and sport dog uses only) provided additional precautions to limit applicator exposure appeared on the labeling. The PD-4/NOIC stated EPA's intent to restrict certain lindane products to Certified Applicators or persons under their direct supervision. The restricted uses include avocados, pecans, livestock sprays, forestry, Christmas trees, commercial ornamentals, structural treatment, dog shampoos, and dog dusts. The PD4/NOIC also stated EPA's intent to require the use of protective clothing for applicators using lindane products for seed treatment by manual means, livestock sprays, avocados, pecans, forestry, Christmas trees, hardwood lumber, ornamentals, crawl space treatments, dog dips, and dog shampoos. 2. Special Review Preliminary Notification (1985) . Just prior to publication of the PD-4, the Agency received from the registrants of lindane a 90-day subchronic rat feeding study showing kidney effects. In order to properly evaluate the study, a thorough review of the complete subchronic and chronic data base was necessary. The Agency decided not to delay issuance of the PD-4 until this review was complete because it did not want to delay the implementation of the regulatory measures outlined in the PD4. Pursuant to 40 CFR 154.21, on September 18, 1985, EPA notified registrants and applicants for registrations for lindane that it was considering initiating a new Special Review based on the study results showing kidney effects. This notification, which is the subject of today's notice, noted the Agency's concern for workers who are exposed to lindane for the forestry and uninhabited building uses. Registrants and applicants for registration were given 30 days to comment on the Agency's proposal to commence a Special Review for certain uses including forestry and warehouses. Registrants requested and received a 3-week extension for submitting comments. Registrant rebuttal comments were submitted by Centre International d'Etudes du Lindane (CIEL) on October 22, 1985. (CIEL represents all lindane registrants holding U.S. registrations for the insecticide lindane). These comments will be briefly addressed in Unit III. of this notice. Furthermore, a Registration Standard was scheduled to be issued which would include a complete review of lindane's general toxic effects. 3. Registration Standard. A Registration Standard was published on lindane in September 1985 (EPA RS-85-027) and reflected a reassessment of the data base used in the Special Review for lindane as well as a review of all other data available to the Agency, including the 90-day subchronic rat feeding study. Based on a comprehensive rereview of previous submissions and some new data, the Agency determined that for most use sites, the benefits of use of lindane exceeded the risks, so long as the precautions mandated by the PD-4 were adhered to. As discussed above, potential unacceptable risks to workers were calculated for spray uses for forestry and warehouses (uninhabited buildings and empty storage bins) based on irreversible kidney toxicity observed in the rat 90-day feeding study. 4. Section 6(f) Notice . A notice, published in the Federal Register of November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60630), pursuant to section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), announced EPA's receipt of requests from a number of registrants to voluntarily amend registrations of pesticide products containing lindane to delete certain uses. The section 6(f) notice included one site (uninhabited buildings) which is also a subject of today's notice. II. Risk Concerns Underlying Preliminary Notification A. Toxicity Concerns The Registration Standard discussed the results of the subchronic 90-day feeding study in the rat which showed that lindane causes adverse pathological effects (i.e., lesions), primarily in the kidney of male rats, but also in the liver of male and female rats. Kidney lesions were not completely reversed after allowing 6 weeks for recovery on a lindane-free diet. No adverse effects on kidney structure in fe2male rats were noted. Renal changes, which included tubular degeneration, hyaline droplets, tubular casts, tubular distention, interstitial nephritis, and basophilic tubules, were stated to be irreversible with a no-observable-effect level (NOEL) of 4 parts per million (ppm) in the diet equivalent to 0.3 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day). Hepatocellular hypertrophy was noted at the same lowest effect level (LEL) as the kidney lesions. The liver toxicity results from the increased need to produce enzymes to detoxify lindane and are considered a typical response and defensive mechanism to the presence of foreign substances. The liver toxicity was not regarded as a specific response to lindane. B. Exposure The September 18, 1985 preliminary notification to affected registrants and applicants stated that the Agency's concerns were limited to exposure from two uses: forestry and warehouse (uninhabited buildings and empty storage bins). The Margins of Exposure (MOE) for forestry applicator/mixer/loaders and for warehouse applicators were 11 and 20, respectively. MOE's for forestry applicator uses ranged from 20 to 90. Applicators, mixers, and loaders were assumed to follow precautions on the registered labels current at that time. The notification indicated that the Agency would consider all comments in its determination of whether to initiate a Special Review of pesticide products containing lindane. Since the issuance of the preliminary notification, the Agency has determined that the kidney effects do not meet the risk criteria for initiation of Special Review. Because EPA no longer believes there is a kidney-related hazard posed to humans, a discussion of exposure will not be presented. A more detailed discussion of the exposure assessment used as a basis for the September 18, 1985 preliminary notification may be found in the Registration Standard. III. New Information After the initial demonstration that lindane produces kidney lesions, the Agency required and received 90-day subchronic inhalation studies in rats (HED Document No.: 005059, April 25, 1986), and mice (HED Document No.: 007304, June 30, 1989), dermal studies in rats (HED Document No.: 007189, May 18, 1989) and rabbits (HED Document No.: 008610, September 27, 1991) and a chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats (HED Document Nos.: 007461, August 30, 1989 and 009909, December 30, 1992). In summary, only studies in rats demonstrated the occurrence of lesions in the kidneys, and only the males were affected. There was no evidence that the kidneys of mice, rabbits, or female rats were similarly affected. After publication of the Registration Standard, the Agency received a 90-day rat subchronic inhalation study with lindane which was written in German. Translations of this study indicated a NOEL for the kidney changes of 0.1 mg/cubic meter. The kidney lesions noted were transient in nature and were not noted in rats after allowing 6 weeks for a recovery phase. The study results did not demonstrate any signs of kidney dysfunction. The chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study did not indicate any evidence of lindane-induced kidney tumors or preneoplastic lesions. However, the characteristic nonneoplastic lesions produced by a protein (Alpha 2 u -Globulin ( a 2 u -g)), found in the kidneys of male rats which induces kidney effects were present. For example, one aspect of this study included a chemical analysis of the kidney for increased levels of the a 2 u -g protein. Clear and pronounced increases in this protein were demonstrated in a dose-related manner (HED Document No.: 007859, April 10, 1990). Independent industrial and academic researchers had, a few years earlier, reported similar effects in the male rat kidney due to responses to certain chlorinated hydrocarbons and other chemicals. A pattern of effects emerged that indicated that only the male rat kidney, but not the kidney of female rats or the male and female kidneys of other species, was affected by this special group of chemicals. This particular kidney lesion was ultimately demonstrated to be linked to the potential for this special group of chemicals to increase levels of a 2 u -g. This special group of chemicals apparently bind the a 2 u -g in such a manner that it is not excreted in the urine but accumulates in the kidney of male rats and ultimately causes pathological lesions. For some, but not all, a 2 u -g binding chemicals, the pathological condition progresses to neoplasia (kidney tumors). Thus, consistent with the chemical structure of lindane, animal models and analytical chemistry, lindane was demonstrated to be a classical example of an a 2 u -g-inducing kidney pathogen in the male rat kidney. The Agency published a document outlining the policy for risk assessment for chemical agents that affect the male rat kidney through the a 2 u -g mechanism (refer to document EPA/625/391/019F, September 1991, Risk Assessment Forum Monograph entitled ``Alpha2u-Globulin: Association with Chemically Induced Renal Toxicity and Neoplasia in the Male Rat''). Consistent with this policy, chemicals which cause lesions in the male rat kidney through the a 2 u -g mechanism exclusively are not regulated on the basis for their potential to cause kidney effects in male rats. IV. Comments Received on Preliminary Notifications The Centre Internationale d'Etudes du Lindane (CIEL), which represents all the lindane registrants, commented in detail on the Agency's preliminary notification. The main points of CIEL's comments and the Agency's responses are summarized below. CIEL Comment : CIEL challenged the Agency's claim that lindane exposure produced irreversible renal effects in rats by pointing out that the 90-day subchronic data show a trend toward reversibility of renal effects; only the lack of a longer recovery period in the study prevented a full reversibility of renal changes. Agency Response : After reinspecting the pathology report and data sheets, the Agency concurs with CIEL that the kidney pathology should not be described as permanent or irreversible, but that the term ``slowly reversible'' more appropriately describes the effect. Although some signs of pathology are evident after a 6-week recovery period, the intensity or severity is much reduced and there is no tubular degeneration, the lesion that was considered to be the most serious. In addition, the Agency believes that the kidney effects were the result of a 2 u -g and are specific to male rats and not found in other species. CIEL Comments : The MOE values should be increased by a factor of 5 to 10 because the rats in the 90-day study received oral administration of lindane, whereas the lindane applicators for the uses in question have mainly dermal exposure. CIEL commented that there is a 5- to 10-fold lower acute toxicity after dermal exposure than after oral administration. Agency Response: The Agency's original review of existing studies on lindane indicated that there were no adequate studies to assess lindane toxicity through the dermal route of application. Therefore, the Agency required that registrants perform additional studies to clarify this point. A rat dermal toxicity study was submitted on May 18, 1989, and a rabbit dermal toxicity study on September 27, 1991. These studies support the hypothesis that lindane induces a lesion specific to the male rat kidney. The Agency will use the 90-day dermal toxicity studies for future risk assessments. CIEL Comment : Studies on humans, including occupational exposure, revealed no kidney damage. Agency Response: The Agency originally determined that the results of the studies on human occupational exposure were inconclusive. Although the studies reporting the results of human exposure did not include specific kidney function tests, the available data indicate that individuals potentially exposed to lindane did not develop overt kidney functional changes. Although two studies showed decreases in levels of blood creatinine and increases in reticulocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes relative to controls, it is not conclusive that these changes were the direct result of exposure to lindane per se. However, the epidemiology studies have several weaknesses which include a small number of subjects, failure to report the health status of absentees at the time the blood samples were taken, and failure to test for subtle changes in kidney functions. Also, pathological changes in the kidney may occur in the absence of overt functional changes; the studies designed could not assess this possibility. The Agency has no evidence that human kidney function has been affected by lindane. CIEL Comment : The Agency's estimates of applicator exposure are inaccurate because: (1) For forestry uses, the estimates are based on a surrogate study using grassland application (Lavy et al., 1980), rather than forest trees; (2) the forestry use exposure figure should be 1.3 mg/hour with a dermal absorption of 5 percent; and (3) for warehouse exposure, a study with aerosol application should be used instead of the surrogate DDT fan-type spray study used by the Agency to estimate exposure. Agency Response: Regarding points (1) and (2), the Agency's assessment for forestry use of lindane utilized three surrogate studies in addition to the study by Lavy et al., in order to increase replicates and minimize bias that could result from the selection of a single surrogate study. The Lavy et al. study had a number of weaknesses by Agency standards, including failure to specify the height of application; brush application when backpack equipment was used; failure to measure hand dermal exposure (often an appreciable part of the total dermal exposure); and failure to measure exposure to the legs. The Agency's mean value of 5.3 milligrams per hour is considered reasonable, given the degree of variability inherent in exposure studies. The Agency is not aware of any dermal absorption study showing 5 percent dermal absorption and therefore assumed a dermal absorption of 10 percent based on data on liquid formulations as described in the preliminary determination (PD 2/3) of the earlier Special Review of lindane. EPA still considers the 10 percent dermal absorption factor appropriate. Risk assessments, however, should be based on the 90-day dermal studies. Regarding point (3) in which CIEL claims that a study using an aerosol sprayer would be more appropriate for warehouse exposure assessment, the Agency realizes that the aerosol characteristics are partially dependent on the type of equipment used. However, there is no evidence that a very fine spray is used for storage bin application; in fact, the label of one registered product instructs the user to apply the material as a coarse spray, not a fine aerosol as claimed by CIEL. Therefore, after careful consideration of the CIEL's comments about exposure, the Agency believes that the exposure estimate used to calculate the MOE's were reasonable and appropriate for the forestry and warehouse uses. V. Agency's Decision Regarding Special Review At this time, the Agency proposes not to initiate a Special Review of pesticide products containing lindane based on the male rat kidney effects. EPA has concluded that any renal lesions in male rats observed in connection with a 2 u -g accumulation is a species-specific effect that is not relevant to human risk assessment. The Agency agrees that the evidence as provided in the 90-day subchronic rat study does not raise as great a concern regarding lindane as originally suspected. The available evidence does not establish a credible relationship between lindane and potential renal effects in humans. In conclusion, the Agency has determined that it is not appropriate to conduct a Special Review of lindane based on male rat renal effects. The Agency is reexamining its assessment of lindane's potential to cause liver tumors in mice and developmental toxicity in rats. Lindane is currently classified by the Office of Research and Development Carcinogenicity Assessment Group (ORD CAG, July 23, 1985) as a ``B2-C'' (a probable-to- possible carcinogen) based on liver tumors primarily from reports in the published literature. Based on these data CAG provided a cancer potency Q1 * of (1.1 mg/kg/day) -1 for risk assessment. The Office of Pesticide Program's Health Effects Division (HED) Reference Dose (RFD) Committee Peer Review met on July 8, 1993, and determined that while the available mouse studies with lindane provide some information, there are no mouse carcinogenicity studies which meet current criteria for acceptability for regulatory purposes. Thus, the reevaluation of lindane for carcinogenicity classification is pending receipt and review of a new mouse carcinogenicity study to be conducted under current guideline criteria which will be required in the form of a Data Call In (DCI) to be published in the near future. The committee also determined that a developmental neurotoxicity study should be conducted to assess the effects of lindane on the development of the nervous system as previous studies suggest that lindane is able to cross the placenta and to be a neurotoxicant. This data request will also be included in the above-mentioned DCI. Upon receipt and review of the above studies, if such review indicates any remaining concerns, EPA could initiate a Special Review or take other appropriate regulatory action. VI.
