The appeal says in particular: We have chosen a peaceful way of settling the conflict in Abkhazia. The hallmark of the Abkhazian separatists is easily recognized in the tragedy which has unfolded recently. They are continuing their practice of ethnic cleansing and terror against civilians. All this shows that the Abkhazian side is not interested in establishing, since the latest tragedy which unfolded in Gali rayon coincided with the timing of the return of displaced people to Abkhazia, as envisaged by the Geneva talks. The only solution is to speed up a UN-sanctioned deployment of peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia and to establish strict international supervision. The start of the normalization of relations between Russia and Georgia, which by itself is the foundation for the establishment of peace in the Transcaucasus, has evoked a wide response from beyond the borders of our countries. I appeal to the leadership of Russia, on whose mediation and peacemaking role largely depends the future of peace in Georgia, in particular Abkhazia, to take all measures for a peaceful settlement of the conflict and a (?dignified) return of the refugees.
