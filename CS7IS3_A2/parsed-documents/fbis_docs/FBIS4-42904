The VVD wants to reduce these cutbacks to zero. The PvdA [Labor Party] on the other hand wants to see even more defense cuts, of as much as G1.4 billion in all. The three party leaders who are negotiating to form a "purple" coalition government comprising the PvdA, the VVD, and D66 [Democrats 66] are today to discuss defense policy. In the election program, the Liberals position was that defense should be spared any cutbacks. But, since the present government is leaving behind it a "hole" of G5 billion, the VVD may also be unable to escape defense cuts. In the election campaign, the VVD referred to this legacy of the present government as "[outgoing Finance Minister] Kok's hole." On calculating the cost of the election programs of all parties, the Central Planning Bureau concluded that all ministries would have to contribute to the G5 billion shortfall. The VVD later regretted that this "cheese-slicing method" also involved defense. D66 also ran an election campaign in which defense was to be spared any cuts. But the Democrats have now reconciled themselves to a maximum of G600 million being cut from the defense budget. The only conclusion reached by talks on public health, pursued by the three party leaders yesterday, is that there are to be no major changes to the system. PvdA leader Kok reported that the negotiators agreed that a "practical, businesslike approach" must be adopted to achieve costs management in the health sector. Kok said that "no negotiating took place yesterday." Instead, the negotiators drew up a list of "major questions" to which the public health experts from the three parties must find an answer.
