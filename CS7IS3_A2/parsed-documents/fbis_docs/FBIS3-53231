Official sources told LANKAPUVATH that these prisoners were being held under tight security, which have been described as hell holes. They are equipped with torture chambers. Intelligence reports say that among the other prisoners were terrorists who tried to desert the LTTE and others, like Mahattaya and Yogi, who have criticized the LTTE leadership for its intransigence in refusing to lay down arms and seek peace with the Sri Lankan Government. Meanwhile, eight LTTE terrorists were reported killed by a Sri Lankan Navy patrol craft on the high seas in the eastern coast of Jaffna at a point between Point Pedro and Vettilaikerny on Saturday [8 January]. A military spokesman said that the LTTE had confirmed in a radio transmission that three of its boats were sunk and eight terrorists killed in the encounter.
