FR940208-1-00044 FR940208-1-00011 On July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576), the Agency published an initial list of source categories that emit HAP's, in response to Section 112(c) of the Act. In this listing, the gasoline distribution network was included as a major source but was not listed as a category whose area source facilities were to be considered for regulation. The Agency's subsequent analysis (summarized in the background information document (BID)) of HAP emissions from all subcategories of the gasoline distribution network concluded that only two of these subcategories, pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals, contained major sources and should therefore be considered for regulation under Section 112(d). All the other subcategories of the network (pipeline pumping stations, bulk plants, and service stations) encompass only area sources and as a consequence were not included in the proposed standards. These sources will be studied and may be considered for regulation at a future date pursuant to the urban area source provisions of Section 112(c)(3) of the Act. Public comments and data are specifically requested on today's proposal to exclude area sources in this rulemaking and on the analysis contained in the BID to estimate emissions for determining area and major source facilities. Also, the Agency is specifically requesting any data that would document that any service station, bulk plant, or pipeline pumping station could be considered a major source of HAP's. B. Selection of Emission Points Covered The proposed standards would regulate all HAP emission points at major source pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals. As noted in Section III.A.2, there are two HAP emission source types at pipeline breakout stations. These sources are: (1) Equipment leaks from pumps, valves, and other components, and (2) losses from storage tanks. Both of these sources can be significant sources of emissions. Of the total of nearly 7,200 Mg/yr baseline HAP emissions from gasoline at pipeline breakout stations, it is estimated that 12 percent can be attributed to equipment leaks and 88 percent is emitted from storage tanks. Emissions from pumps arise from liquid gasoline leaking from packed or mechanical seals in the pumps used to move the product through the pipeline. Leaks also occur from seals around stems of valves and other equipment components that control or isolate gasoline from the environment such as connections, drain lines, and pressure relief devices. Storage tanks at breakout stations may be of either fixed-roof, external floating roof, or fixed-roof with an internal floating roof construction. Emissions from fixed-roof tanks consist of breathing and working losses. Breathing loss is a vapor loss due to expansion or contraction of the vapor space in the tank above the liquid because of daily changes in temperature or barometric pressure. These emissions may occur in the absence of any liquid level change in the tank. Working losses consist of emptying and filling losses. Emptying losses occur during the expansion of air that is drawn into the tank during liquid removal. This air becomes saturated with hydrocarbon vapor and, when it expands due to changes in temperature or barometric pressure, exceeds the fixed capacity of the vapor space. Overflow then occurs through the pressure-vacuum valve. Filling losses occur when incoming gasoline displaces air and vapors through vents to the atmosphere. Standing-storage losses, which result from causes other than a change in the liquid level, constitute the major source of emissions from external floating roof tanks. The largest potential source of these losses is an improper fit between the floating roof seal and the tank shell (seal loss). Withdrawal loss is another source of emissions from floating roof tanks. When liquid is withdrawn from a tank, the floating roof is lowered and a wet portion of the tank wall is exposed. Withdrawal loss equals the amount of liquid vaporized from the wet tank wall. Standing-storage losses from internal floating roof tanks arise through a somewhat different mechanism due to the enclosed design of the tanks. As ambient air flows over the exterior of the tank, it flows into the enclosed space between the fixed and floating roofs through some of the shell vents and flows out of the enclosed space through others. Any vapors that have evaporated from the exposed liquid surface and that have not been contained by the floating deck are swept out of the enclosed space. The withdrawal loss from an internal floating roof tank is similar to that discussed for tanks with external floating roofs. There are four contributors to HAP emissions at bulk gasoline terminals, all of which contribute significantly to the overall totals: (1) From loading racks when gasoline is loaded into tank trucks or railcars (about 18 percent of the nationwide baseline total of 16,500 Mg/yr HAP emissions from bulk gasoline terminals), (2) fugitive leakage of vapors from tank trucks or railcars during loading of gasoline (23 percent of baseline total), (3) evaporation of gasoline from storage tanks (33 percent of the baseline total), and (4) equipment leaks from pumps, valves, and other components (26 percent of baseline values). Emissions occur at loading racks when gasoline that is loaded into cargo tanks of trucks or railcars displaces vapors inside these containers. These emissions may occur either uncontrolled (when facilities are not using vapor collection and processing equipment) from tank truck or railcar cargo compartments, or from the outlet vents of control systems used to process these displaced vapors.
