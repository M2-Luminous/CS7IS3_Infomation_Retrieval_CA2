He also presents an analysis of his firm, which will celebrate its 21st anniversary on 9 November. "Telebras is the result of an antiprivatization movement, seeing that the situation in the preceding period was one of private concessions and hundreds of obsolete and inefficient municipal systems. Its work during these 21 years has been extraordinary in that it has expanded the Brazilian telephone network from about 1.5 million terminals in 1972 to more than 11 million today. In mathematical language, that is what we call a positive derivative." With those words, Air Force General Adyr da Silva sums up the role played by Telebras in the 21 years of existence that it is now completing. In his opinion, one of the holding company's most significant gains is the "complete technological cycle" that has been achieved thanks to the work of the Cpqd [Research and Development Center]. That work has guaranteed development of the main basic technologies--ranging from digital telephone exchanges to fiber optics. Here we present the main passages from his lengthy interview, which was given by telephone at 2300 hours on Friday 8 October. 1.8 million terminals--"We have now contracted for over 1 million terminals, and by December [1993] we will have added to that number another 720,000 terminals for large public digital exchanges. That will give us to a total of 1.8 million lines contracted for in a single year, including 200,000 cellular telephones. That is a historical record. But it is not a question simply of setting records, but of reversing the previous situation. The fact is that a little over 300,000 lines were contracted for in 1992. We have had to put more emphasis on signing such contracts to guarantee an annual average of close to 1 million during the three-year period and thus reach the 2.2 million planned for 1995 and beyond. And to the surprise of those most skeptical, the cost of an integrated terminal is declining and may reach $2,600. There has been a sizable drop in the cost of switching." Record installation--"By the end of December we will have installed 1 million new terminals. This means that Telebras will be making favorable progress by increasing the number of terminals installed from about 800,000 in 1992 to 1 million in 1993. We hope to reach 1.4 million in 1994." Fiber optics--"Brazil now has many optical fiber manufacturers, among them Pirelli, Bracel, ABC Xtal, Furukawa, and others. This proves that the market is growing. The Telebras system uses many thousands of kilometers of fiber-optic cable, including not only long-distance cables--such as Embratel's [Brazilian Telecommunications Company's] cable between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo--but chiefly the urban connections that no one sees. I returned recently from Sao Luis, where I signed the Telma [Maranhao Telecommunications] cellular telephone contract. This means that the fiber-optic ring in Sao Luis will soon be completed. So optical fibers are becoming a technological reality and playing a part in day-to-day Brazilian telecommunications." Card-operated public telephones--"The rate at which public telephones are expanding is speeding up, and we are going to reach a total network of over 270,000 this year. We have had to overcome various problems in order to consolidate the card technology and even the industrial cost of producing new public telephones. It was a struggle, but we won thanks to the Cpqd's work." Tropico and Zetax--"When Zetax objects to the acquisition of 720,000 Tropico terminals and accuses us of protecting the three Tropico manufacturers, I argue that Zetax telephone exchanges are still a long way from achieving the capacity of our RA. As far as I know, Zetax exchanges have trouble handling 2,000 terminals. So if Zetax wants to build Tropicos, it can do so. Telebras will transfer all the know-how to it immediately. But is there a market for so many manufacturers?" Six Major Goals Adyr da Silva reviewed the six major goals adopted under his management: a resumption of growth, an increased social contribution by the industry, PQP's (quality and productivity programs), a new policy for the Cpqd, international cooperation, and establishment of the ombudsman system. Here is an evaluation of those six courses of action in the words of the Telebras president himself: Resumption of growth--"Considering the fundamental role played by telecommunications, which are a real springboard on which the country depends, our first goal is the resumption of sectoral growth. This is reflected in the contracts signed for over 1.8 million lines this year and the installation of 1 million terminals. And as a contribution to the country, we are thinking much more about integrated development than simply about economic, technological, or social development." Social contribution--"We have often been criticized for giving priority to this goal on the grounds that we are simply subsidizing the cost of telephone tokens and basic residential service. That is not true. We are going far beyond those two areas with projects such as these: "Virtual telephony, by means of which people and professionals with low incomes can have a terminal or `mailbox' enabling them to receive messages and giving them access to the telecommunications system at much lower cost. "Community centers, such as the one inaugurated recently in Toledo, Parana, which provide the public with access at a single location to telephones, domestic and international direct dialing, faxes, microcomputers, and so on. It is `the poor man's teleport,' to use the picturesque nickname it has been given. "The encouragement of fund drives such as Child-Hope, which may collect something in the neighborhood of $2 million this year alone for helping needy Brazilian children through UNICEF. Our support is not limited solely to the Globo Network's drive, as one might think; it is available to any other broadcaster that wants to launch similar drives. We also have the Campaign in Support of the Physically Handicapped, which is co-sponsored by the government of the Federal District, and Betinho's Campaign Against Hunger, by means of which the Telebras system encourages its companies to accept contributions in nonperishable foodstuffs and products and send them to accredited agencies. "Low-cost rural telephone service is a program that we intend to launch before the end of the year. "Incidentally, the issue of rural telephone service has been a challenge for Brazil. When people criticize the state monopoly on the grounds that only 2 percent of Brazilian rural properties have telephone service, I don't know whether that is little or a lot, considering that according to the IBGE [Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics], there are over 7 million parcels of rural property in our country. At any rate, considering the extremely low purchasing power of farmers and the high cost of rural telephone service, how can this problem be solved? In my opinion, the best prospects will have to come from the new technologies." Quality and productivity--"We are establishing total quality and productivity programs in many firms belonging to the Telebras system, among them Telebahia [Bahia Telecommunications], Telepar [Parana Telecommunications], Teleceara [Ceara Telecommunications], Telpa, Telerj [Rio de Janeiro Telecommunications], and, obviously, Telebras itself. For that purpose, we have international agreements allowing us to send professionals to Japan and other countries for training. The UFMG [Federal University of Minas Gerais], for example, has been playing a prominent role in this area of total quality and productivity." Policy for Cpqd--"The Cpqd cannot disperse its funds among dozens of projects. A better plan is to concentrate its efforts on a few development projects that are real priorities. In line with that thinking, the center is putting more emphasis on the following projects: "1. Adding new features to the Tropico telephone exchange. "2. Refining and innovating resources in connection with card-operated telephones. "3. Exploring all the possibilities of virtual telephony based on voice mail technology. "4. Mastering the technology of intelligent networks. "5. Investing as much as possible in network management, one of the most important areas for the country in the future. "6. Exploring all developments in the field of personal communications services in accordance with the PCS (Personal Communications Services or Personal Communications Network) concept." International cooperation--"Telebras has been benefiting from international cooperation programs, among which I would like to emphasize the following: "1. The Cpqd has technological cooperation contracts with the following international firms: Northern Telecom, the NTT, AT&T, Alcatel, Siemens, Ericsson, Millicom, and others. "2. The National Training Center, which the ITU [International Telecommunication Union] considers a worldwide model and example, has been used intensively for programs to train professionals from all over Latin America and from Portuguese-speaking African countries. "3. Telebras is preparing to provide international consulting and support services. This will be the case in Hungary, where we have been awarded the contract in international bidding." Ombudsman--"Ten firms in the Telebras system--among them Telerj, Telebahia, and Telepar--now have an ombudsman system for protecting the interests of the users. The ombudsman is always an employee, has complete support and autonomy, and cannot be fired while in that job. But the rules as adopted do not allow him to investigate accusations that crimes have been committed. In those cases, the Federal Government's ombudsman steps in." Triumphalist Tone In his interview, Gen. Adyr da Silva selects the best figures in the firm's history and pays tribute to the "people who have devoted and do devote the best of their creativity and competence to the development of this sector," the "work of industrial partners who, with initiative and technology, have believed and do believe in this sector," and, lastly, all those who "have contributed all along the way... some of them anonymous heroes." The figures that fill the draft of his speech for the firm's 21st anniversary also show that from January through August 1993, investments in telecommunications totaled $1.975 billion, or 61.7 percent of the total planned for the year. Next comes the number of terminals installed during the same period: 495,431, 140,000 of which are cellular mobile telephones. The number of terminals placed "in service" during the first eight months of the year was slightly higher at 507,000. Besides those successes, the president of Telebras draws attention to the long-distance fiber-optic cable program and the public telephone program as milestones of his management.
