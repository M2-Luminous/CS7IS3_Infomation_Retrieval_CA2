The prime minister intends to set up a private advisory body next spring, at the earliest, with the task of fully studying ways to formulate Japan's comprehensive security. The idea is surfacing that the "basic defense buildup plans" aimed at maintaining Japan's necessary minimum defense capability in peace time, a fundamental philosophy of the current "Guideline," should be replaced with new defense buildup plans which are in tune with the relaxed international tensions. With the prime minister deciding to replace the current "Guideline" with a new one, Japan's defense buildup plans based on the current "Guideline" that was set in 1976, will face a turning point. The current "Guideline" features a call for the shift from the conventional defense plans designed to cope with external threat to the "basic defense buildup plans." An attached table of the "Guideline" set the fixed number of troops for the Ground Self-Defense Force at 180,000, and mainstay military hardware and organizations for three services of the Self-Defense Forces. Former Prime Minister Miyazawa announced that his government would review the current "Guideline" in 1995, but he did not think of changing the basic defense buildup plans. Prime Minister Hosokawa has been eager to set the direction of reviewing the current "Guideline" as soon as possible in light of the dramatically changed international situation following the collapse of the Cold War structure. The Defense Agency [DA] has already inaugurated the "Study Group for Discussion of Japan's Defense in the 21st Century" consisting of pundits in various fields with the intention of compiling a defense budget for fiscal year 1996 based on a new guideline. The DA, which set up a research council consisting of defense experts, originally planned to place the council under the Defense Agency director general, but it later decided to shelve the plan and cooperate with the prime minister by "elevating" the council to a private advisory body for him. The prime minister envisions the private advisory body as a body like the Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa Council, says a government source). A plan is under examination to organize the private advisory body with a dozen former DA officials and Foreign Ministry officials. Former Defense Agency Vice Minister Seiki Nishihiro is surfacing as a member of the body.
