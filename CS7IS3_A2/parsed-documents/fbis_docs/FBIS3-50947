Television is an institution that has been totally subsidized by the Cuban state in both its national currency and its convertible currency costs. It is now advisable to seek new ways of pursuing its educational, cultural, and informational mission. For some years television, through the INTER TV organization, has been working on a self-financing system, but it is still quite far from meeting television's very expensive financial needs. The income that has to date been generated from the sale of technical services and of some Cuban programs to foreign agencies is still not sufficient to cover its short-term requirements. Starting in 1993 they began to look at other ways of increasing services at competitive prices to major productions of foreign organizations, including cinema, and they will begin coproductions in which television will receive dividends based on its participation. One example of this is the production of a series set in Cuba and the Caribbean with a Spanish television company, in which Cuban television will provide the talent and equipment without payment having to be made in convertible currency. Other possibilities are dubbing and subtitling. This is available to date in up to seven languages. The potential of film archives is also being explored. There is a great wealth of images, and this product carries a high price per minute. The marketing of sound archives of productions that are the property of Cuban radio and television has also not been ruled out. These activities also include the start of the production of advertising, intended especially for foreign organizations. This is taking place at a time when there are foreign capital investments in Cuba, and mixed public-private enterprises are being formed with Cuban groups. The inevitable products, firms, and commercial brands of a number of internationally known companies are beginning to appear. Most of these companies have good budgets for promotional costs, publicity, and public relations. One part of the media that could most benefit from this is radio and television. How it should be done requires intelligent handling. Juan Hernandez, vice president of ICRT [Cuban Institute of Radio and Television], told me some time ago that one of the strong points of Cuban television is precisely that it is not commercial or subject to the will of advertisers who in other television stations decide on its fate. So including ads in ours may seem contradictory. However, within the array of publicity available, we will select ads that seek to enhance a company's image, emphasizing its social orientation. In that way the viewer receives a pleasant, nonconsumerist image that may often become a message promoting behavior that will benefit families and society. This is done through sponsorship, in which an advertiser helps to finance a broadcast in exchange for his participation being mentioned. Using this concept, and based on experience with sports broadcasting (where internationally the presence of active publicity has become inevitable), and given the high costs of satellite transmission of sports events, Cuban television decided to experiment with the Central American and Caribbean Games and seek sponsors. Foreign firms and associated Cuban groups responded to this invitation and--apparently--everyone benefitted. This commercial opportunity was especially advantageous for Cuban groups, most of which have very limited budgets for presenting their image. According to the president of Cubanacan S.A., Abraham Maciques, it is necessary to boost the image of merchandise that is not advertised and, therefore, not sold. For the corporation he heads, investing about $8,000 in the television promotion in Ponce may mean a great deal in the future, since all over the world major tourist attractions invest 10 percent of their profits in activities of this nature, while Cubanacan has only spent 2 percent. Canada now spends about $400,000 on promotional advertising to attract 110,000 tourists, and a much higher amount needs to be spent to induce a German to choose Cuba as his destination. The experiment with the Central American Games in Ponce proved successful economically, and the impact on the population was examined in social surveys. There were varied responses, ranging from "I was not surprised," or "this is normal in sports arenas," to "it makes the broadcast seem more dynamic," or "I do not like it, but I will accept it if it is best for Cuba." Certain that the practice is feasible with the philosophy we have outlined, it would not be difficult to finance sports broadcasts in the coming years, as long as good management is exercised for the acquisition of rights and sponsors. The daring move of attempting this experiment, apart from the financial return it produced for Cuban television, gave viewers at home access to a spectacle in which the Cuban team won the gold medal in games at which dignity and patriotism were on display.
