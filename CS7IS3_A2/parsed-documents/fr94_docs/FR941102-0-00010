FR941102-0-00010 FR941102-0-00004 The OCC's proposed requirements on the use of a preliminary prospectus and the delivery of a final prospectus differed from the comparable SEC requirements. The OCC proposal simply incorporated the former part 16 requirements. The proposal required prior OCC authorization to use a preliminary prospectus. The proposal also required that, except in a situation where the OCC has authorized the use of a preliminary prospectus, offers must be made through the use and delivery of a prospectus that has been declared effective by the OCC. Unlike the SEC rules, the proposal did not generally permit a bank to provide the final prospectus to purchasers with the confirmation. Five commenters addressed the OCC's proposed requirements on the use of a preliminary prospectus and the delivery of a final prospectus. All five commenters agreed that the OCC should follow the Securities Act requirements and SEC rules. Upon further consideration, the OCC agrees and has revised ยง16.3 of the final rule to more clearly follow the requirements in the Securities Act and the SEC rules. The final rule provides that a preliminary prospectus may be used if (1) a registration statement including the preliminary prospectus has been filed with the OCC; (2) the preliminary prospectus includes the information required in a final prospectus (except for omission of certain information dependent on the offering price); and (3) a copy of the final prospectus is furnished to each purchaser prior to or simultaneously with the sale of the security. Communications Not Deemed an Offer (Section 16.4) The proposal listed a number of communications that the OCC did not deem to be offers and which therefore did not violate the prohibitions on making offers in ยง16.3. The list included communications that comply with SEC Rule 134 or 135 (17 CFR 230.134 or 230.135). SEC Rules 134 and 135 govern advertisements used prior and subsequent to the filing of a registration statement. The proposal also provided that supplemental sales literature could be used after a registration statement has been declared effective if the sales literature was accompanied or preceded by a prospectus. In addition, the proposal provided that advertisements only had to be filed with the OCC upon the OCC's request. The proposal also eliminated certain restrictions on advertisements that were in the former part 16. Former part 16 permitted the use of only extremely limited information in advertisements, such as the name of the bank and the amount of securities being offered, did not provide for the use of sales literature, and required all advertisements to be cleared by the OCC prior to use. The OCC received no comments on this section of the proposal. However, the final rule adds to the list of permissible communications four types of communications that were not in the proposal, but which are permissible under SEC rules. Those communications include an oral offer of securities covered by a registration statement that has been filed with the OCC, a summary prospectus that satisfies the requirements of SEC Rule 431 (17 CFR 230.431), a notice of a proposed unregistered offering that satisfies the requirements of SEC Rule 135c (17 CFR 230.135c), and a communication that satisfies the requirements of SEC Rules 138 or 139 (17 CFR 230.138 or 230.139_Definition of ``offer for sale'' and ``offer to sell'' in sections 2(10) and 5(c) of the Securities Act in relation to certain publications). Exemptions (Section 16.5) Under the proposal, the registration and prospectus requirements did not apply to an offer or sale of securities exempt under certain sections of the Securities Act or the rules promulgated thereunder. The registration and prospectus requirements did not apply if the securities were exempt from registration under section 3 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c) by reason of an exemption other than those contained in section 3(a)(2) (for securities issued by banks) or section 3(a)(11) (for intrastate offerings). The proposed registration and prospectus requirements also did not apply to transactions exempt from registration under section 4 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d). Section 4 of the Securities Act exempts transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter or dealer, transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering, transactions involving offers or sales by an issuer solely to accredited investors, and other transactions that meet certain specified requirements.
