Located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province is the country's largest owner of sylvite and is rich in many other mineral resources. To better exploit local resources and improve the investment environment, a total of 17 billion yuan has been earmarked by the state for the construction of seven major projects in Qinghai during the past decade, including the Longyang Gorge hydropower station, Qinghai potash fertilizer plant and Golmud oil refinery. Completion of the Longyang Gorge hydropower station on the upper reaches of the Yellow River has created great profits, increasing Qinghai's electricity supply by 1.5 billion kwh [kw hours] annually and bringing electricity to most of the rural households of the province. The first phase project of the Golmud oil refinery has laid a firm foundation for the future development of the local petro- chemical industry as well as injecting vitality into the whole economy of Qinghai. In accord with the mushrooming of large projects, Qinghai Province has also developed a host of related industrial enterprises and established township enterprises, taking advantage of abundant local resources.
