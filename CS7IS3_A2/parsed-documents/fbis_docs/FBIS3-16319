He believes the meeting's agenda reflects this tendency by including all key issues ranging from the protection of human rights to the protection of borders, more efficient peace-keeping operations and the prevention of regional conflicts. "Clearly, none of us will solve these problems. We should do so only within the framework of the Community on the basis of equality and mutual respect," he said. Kozyrev believes that there is no need to speak about the international recognition of the Commonwealth of Independent States. "We need no international recognition. It is enough to have the decision of our presidents and parliaments for the CIS to work on and occupy a worthy place in the world. We should only speak about the development of CIS contacts with other international structures," he said. At the meeting CIS foreign ministers plan to discuss the draft convention on the protection of the rights of national, ethnic, and religious minorities and the possible creation of a standing consultative commission for peacekeeping activities under the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers, diplomatic sources have told Interfax.
