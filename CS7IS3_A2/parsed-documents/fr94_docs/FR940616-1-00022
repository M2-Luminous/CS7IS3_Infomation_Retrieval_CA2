ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM); withdrawal. SUMMARY: This document withdraws a proposal to amend the Federal Aviation Regulations to require the operator of an aircraft used in conducting authorized news-gathering operations in an area covered by temporary flight restrictions (TFR) to contact the official in charge of the on-scene emergency response activities for the purpose of obtaining information about current and forecasted disaster relief aircraft activities. The objective of the NPRM was to increase the level of safety afforded aircraft used in conducting rescue or disaster relief operations. The FAA has carefully considered all of the comments received in response to the NPRM and as a result has concluded that safety in TFR's can be increased through procedural versus regulatory means. Accordingly, the NPRM is being withdrawn. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Ellen Crum, Air Traffic Rules Branch, ATP&hyph;230, Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267&hyph;8783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On July 24, 1991, the FAA published Notice No. 91&hyph;14 (56 FR 34000). The NPRM proposed amending §91.137(c)(5) of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to require that: (1) All pilots of aircraft carrying properly accredited media personnel initially contact the official in charge of on-scene emergency response activities to ascertain the routes, altitudes, and operating areas in use by disaster relief aircraft; and (2) the aircraft be operated clear of all disaster relief aircraft operations identified by the official in charge. Currently, when TFR's are established for the purpose of providing a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft, aircraft carrying properly accredited newspeople may enter the prescribed area without prior approval, provided a flight plan has been filed. However, the aircraft must be operated above the altitude(s) being used by rescue or disaster relief aircraft. The process a pilot uses to determine which altitudes are being utilized is not prescribed in the current regulation. Discussion of Comments Thirty-one comments were received in response to the NPRM (the comment period closed September 23, 1991). Most commenters supported the goal of the NPRM to promote increased air traffic safety in TFR's; however, the best means to accomplish this was disputed.
