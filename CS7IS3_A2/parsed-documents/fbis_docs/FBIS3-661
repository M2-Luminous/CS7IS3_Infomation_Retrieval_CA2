Seleke, commissioner of the Bophuthatswana police force; issued by the Information Service of Bophuthatswana on the SAPA PR Wire Service] [Text] The Bophuthatswana government this morning announced that the situation in Mmabatho/Mafikeng had been brought under control during the course of the night, and that actions were being implemented to restore full stability. Mr Cronje stressed however, that an offer of assistance from the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement] (AWB), had been declined. As a result, any AWB presence in the Mmabatho/Mafikeng area is without the knowledge or consent of the Bophuthatswana authorities. Minister Cronje said: "The presence of AWB contingents in Bophuthatswana would not be acceptable in terms of the morale of our security forces and in view of the political sensitivity of the current situation. This was firmly explained to AWB leader, Mr Eugene Terreblanche. Major-General Turner disclosed that during the course of last night's defensive action by the Bophuthatswana security forces - which took the form of a joint operation between the Bophuthatswana Defence Force and the Bophuthatswana police -- one person had died and 36 had been wounded -- 12 seriously -- in clashes between security forces and unruly elements. General Turner said the injured had been transported to Mafikeng's Victoria Hospital by military personnel where medical attention had been provided throughout the night. In the course of the security force action, a limited number of rounds of live ammunition had unavoidably been fired, in addition to birdshot and rubber bullets. Injuries sustained had been almost entirely in the stomach and leg region. General Turner added: "This was a tragedy which is deeply regretted. The security forces acted purely in terms of restoring law and order and operated with great restraint, in the face of intense provocation from hostile elements, many of whom were armed with automatic weapons and petrol bombs." Mr Cronje said the outbreak of unrest had clearly been aggravated by inflammatory statements from senior ANC [African National Congress] officials, including Mr Popo Molefe and other senior officials from the ANC's Western Transvaal region, who had been actively lobbying and organising inside Bophuthatswana in the days leading up to the outbreak of violence. "These facts are beyond dispute. The results of their actions are now plain to see. We ourselves had been at great pains to avoid any provocative action or statement that might inflame a sensitive situation. This blatant interference by the ANC has had, as its direct consequence, the tragic and regrettable loss of life and injuries that have ensued. "The events of the past few days are indicative of the turmoil and instability facing southern Africa unless leaders of all political persuasions re-double their efforts to find an inclusive political settlement. We ourselves remain committed to that quest."
