General Secretary of the People's Unity Party of Tunisia Mohamed Bel Hadj Amor said when he received the Korean ambassador to his country on February 4 that he fully supported the proposal of achieving the reunification of Korea through a confederacy according to the three principles of national reunification advanced by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. He expressed full support and solidarity for the January 31 statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman, saying it is a very important and just step for defending the sovereignty of Korea and the interests of the third world countries. He denounced the United States for increasing the tensions on the Korean peninsula and stressed that the Korean people's struggle which enjoys support of the world people would surely be crowned with victory. Betty Frydensbjerg Carlsson, chairperson of the Communist Party of Denmark, met with the Korean ambassador to her country on February 4 and said the United States is leading the situation to the brink of war in crude violation of the points agreed upon between the DPRK and the United States, but it cannot subdue the Korean people who are fighting for their cause of justice. The Communist Party of Denmark fully supports the Korean people in their struggle in defence of sovereignty and socialism, she said. She added that the January 31 statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman regarding the prevailing situation was an extremely just step.
