Tallinn's Arguments Prove Unconvincing for Moscow"] [Text] Estonia's territorial claims on Russia formed the topic of yesterday's hearings in the Duma. An active pressure being put by the Estonian side of late on the residents and local authorities of Pskov and Novgorod Oblasts (free distribution of Estonian citizenship, issue of Estonian passports and real estate privatization certificates on Russian territory) has run against Moscow's harsh reaction, something unexpected by Tallinn. Not only representatives of Russia's state power in these oblasts, but also all the power structures have received instructions to cut short, using all legal means, "Estonian provocations." Simultaneously, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Federal Border Service have produced a draft government decision to tighten checkpoint rules along the Estonian border. The emergence of this document came as an unpleasant surprise for Estonian representatives attending the hearings. In the view of Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma International Affairs Committee, having signed on 12 January 1991 a treaty with Russia on the principles of interstate relations, Estonia virtually recognized the absence on its part of territorial claims (in Article 6, the sides recognize each other's territorial integrity and territorial sovereignty). Because of this alone, references to the Tartu Peace Treaty signed in 1920 have no legal force. The very progress of talks that terminated in the signing of this treaty attested to the Estonian side's intention to get from Russia as much as possible in solving the state border problem. (The talks were frequently interrupted by Tallinn while Estonian troops, which had resumed military actions, were moving deeper into Russian territory). Besides, in the opinion of the Russian side, having become part of the USSR in 1940, Estonia lost its status as an international law entity. Hence, there exist at least two reasons for which Tallinn's territorial claims (incidentally, they studiously avoid this term in Estonia) today are unfounded. Tallinn's representatives at the hearings, naturally, disagreed which such a solution of the border question. In their opinion, Article 2 of the Tartu Treaty is in effect even today; that is, the border should run across the present territory of Pskov Oblast. Russia intends to dot the "i's" by toughening the border area rules and strictly indicating the position of border checkpoints. Russia will draw the final border "on location" even if Estonia declines to take part in this process.
