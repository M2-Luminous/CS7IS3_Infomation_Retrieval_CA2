Head of the Kray Administration Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, his deputy for foreign economic activities, Vladimir Stegniy, and Chairman of the Committee for Foreign Economic and Regional Relations Andrey Zagumennov took part in the proceedings of the conference representing the Maritime area. The Joint Statement, the draft of a technology park in the Nakhodka Free Economic Zone which is ready for the stage of technical and economic feasibility study, and the organization of the Korean College at the facilities of the Far Eastern State University were the results of the Korean-Russian conference. As Vladimir Stegniy stated, the conference in Seoul proceeded under the leadership of KRKS Chairman Yevgeniy Nazdratenko and AKRS Chairman Chang Yi-haek. Some 300 prominent representatives of the statesman and business communities of the two states took part in the conference. The parties found it feasible to form a specific economic zone in Northeastern Asia and in the basin of the Sea of Japan with the participation of countries such as Russia, China, and Japan. In the process, the need to use the significant geopolitical situation of the Far East in an optimal way was stressed. The parties agreed to approach their governments with a proposal to establish a private-governmental Joint Committee for the Far East and Siberia under the Russian Intergovernmental Commission for Economic Cooperation. The committee in question could engage in resolving differences and overcoming difficulties that develop in the course of effecting commercial-economic, investment, scientific- technical, and cultural cooperation between the Republic of Korea and Russia's Far East and Siberia. It was resolved to seek that the relevant authorities of the two states begin regular flights between Vladivostok and Seoul in 1994, as well as regular flights between Korea and Sakhalin, Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, and Kamchatka Oblasts in the future. The parties agreed to facilitate the creation of customs warehouses in the principal seaports and air terminals of the Far East and to make efforts to improve the operation of the Transsiberian Railroad. It is planned to hold the Fourth Joint Conference in Irkutsk in 1995.
