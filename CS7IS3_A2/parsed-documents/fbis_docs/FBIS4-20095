He can speak passionately about the new approach the outgoing government had to the environment, the Treaty of Maastricht, and social renewal. His approach is based on convincing people, on finding support within society, rather than on rules and regulations imposed from above. Kok wants to continue in this way during the next term of government. His outline says a great deal about the way he wants to govern the country. "Traditional policy, as pursued in this country," the PvdA leader says, "is too often based on implementing a couple of objectives laid down in a government pact. It is rare for a process-based approach to be adopted, with the question "what do you want?" being immediately linked to the question "how are you going to do it? I am in favor of such a process-based approach for the next government. If we form the new government in a couple of weeks time, I will press for a new style of government along these lines." [Empel] What does that mean specifically? [Kok] I am convinced that if we state that we are going to help thousands of the long-term unemployed to find a job, it remains a nonstarter if you do not simultaneously try to implement such a project from the ground up. Specifically, this means that divisions between institutions, the employment office, social service, and various training institutes must be removed and that room must be created for initiative and creativity. [Empel] That is like the approach adopted by Bill Clinton and Al Gore in the United States: Reinventing government. [Kok] Yes. I discussed this recently with Frank de Grave. An excellent man, De Grave (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] alderman for finances on the Amsterdam city council -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note). When forming the Amsterdam city council, several parties were in favor of further developing the "Jan Schaefer school of thought," namely the productive use of benefit money to create jobs in the care sector, public supervision, etc. We came to the mutual conclusion that we must be through with bureaucracies. And this requires a project-based approach: If you do not decide to do this when forming a new government, then you may as well forget about it altogether. That is my aim when forming a new government. [passage omitted] [Empel] Over the last 18 months, without being aware of it, we have been presented with a new Kok. Can this Kok, for example, also get on with D66 [Democratic 66] leader Hans van Mierlo? Or is Van Mierlo still wary following the 1989 government? [Kok] I don't think so. It is so long ago. Three matters were involved when forming that government: The number of ministers, the furious opposition to the D66 by the CDA [Christian Democrat Party] which feared its own position of power would be compromised and our own strong preference to simply get on with running the country. The danger that such a government with the PvdA would not be achieved weighed very heavily among the PvdA faction. Since then, relations between the D66 and the PvdA in general, and between Hans and myself in particular, have sufficiently normalized to be able to look to the future with a great deal of confidence. [Empel] Your consensus approach does not always have the desired effect. Things went seriously wrong over the WAO [Law on Labor Disability] with the previous government . [Kok] The WAO was a different kind of matter. In that case, it was not enough to set a course and to acquire the widest possible support. Something of this nature applies to major infrastructure projects: the extension of Schiphol airport, the Betuwe line. There also you are facing fundamental conflicts of interest, which you cannot overcome with conviction alone. You often hear calls for a better presentation. Hans van Mierlo is very good at that. I then say: If that leads to saying "we need more time" -- when you know very well that there is no alternative -- then you are avoiding your responsibility to make decisions which will have to be made sooner or later. The D66 does that more often. In the case of the Betuwe line, Schiphol, and the WAO. [Empel] What do you think needs to change in the next government? [Kok] Governing over the next four years is not a matter of business as usual. We must perform better on a number of points. Is the citizen getting sufficient value for his money? We must set ourselves a task. Not fine sentences laid down in a government pact but an action plan. And if bureaucracies have to be brushed aside to make room, so be it. That is the only way to restore trust to the citizens. If such a new approach results in recognizable results, the citizen will once again believe that the government is there for him and not that he is there for the government.
