The agency made the appeal in releasing the results of a survey on environmental protection measures, including a deposit system for recyclable resources such as cans and bottles. The survey showed that it is possible to make environmental preservation and economic activities compatible through the implementation of various measures, such as the introduction of an environmental protection tax and regulations under the existing law, the agency said. The EPA said the survey centered on the merits and demerits of pollution control measures, including a levy on environmental protection and penalties against pollution. The taxation and penalty method will be effective for environmental protection depending on tax rates and penalty fees, but it will raise the possibility of boosting prices of products, leading to a decline in consumer demand, it said. The agency said government subsidies will be effective in helping factories install pollution control equipment, but it creates a problem of how to secure necessary funds. A U.S. system which allows factories to purchase the right to discharge harmful carbon dioxide is effective in controlling pollution but it entails high costs for working out such a system, it said.
