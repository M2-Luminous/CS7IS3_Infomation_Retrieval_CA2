In recent days, the sociopolitical situation in Kurgan-Tyube and neighboring districts has become especially explosive. Local observers believe that, in spite of all decisions taken by the Dushanbe authorities on the disbanding and disarming of various paramilitary groups, these groups do not intend to hand over their weapons. Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the Government of Tajikistan may resort to force within the next few days as a way of resolving the conflict. ITAR-TASS learned from military sources that the body of a former field commander of the People's Front of Tajikistan, Talat Mirusmanov, was discovered yesterday on the road linking Kurgan- Tyube and Dushanbe. Until November last year he was chief of staff of a special police unit deployed in Kurgan-Tyube. Mirusmanov was shot by unknown gunmen. The motive for the killing is being investigated by the republic's law enforcement agencies. However, local observers do not rule out the possibility that Talat Mirusmanov became the latest victim of violence amongst various armed groups in the former Kurgan-Tyube oblast. The Government of Tajikistan has virtually no control over these groups. Ten people, including Mirzo Saidov, chief of staff of a special Tajik defense ministry brigade, and Zargorov, an employee of the international nongovernmental organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres, have already died in the violence during the past month.
