Phalangist Secretary General Karim Paqraduni told AFP that the party wanted to recover the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC), Lebanon's most watched television station which has been run by the militia since 1985. He said that the LBC was set up in 1980 with Phalangist funds after a political decision was taken by the rightwing party. It began broadcasting five years later. "The dissolution of the LF has opened the way for us to recover what rightfully belongs to us," he said. Paqraduni added that the party had already filed lawsuits against the LF to retrieve cooperatives and buildings controlled by the former militia. Last week the government outlawed the Lebanese Forces as part of an investigation into the bombing in February of a Maronite Christian church that killed 10 worshippers and wounded 54. The authorities charge that seven out of nine suspects are LF members, including the former militia's deputy Fu'ad Malik. The LF was set up in 1976 by assassinated president elect Bashir al-Jumayyil to be the military wing of the Phalangist Party, which was founded in 1936 by al-Jumayyil's father Pierre. It grouped a string of Christian militias until the government disbanded the militias in 1990. One year later the LF formed a political party under the leadership of Christian warlord Samir Ja'ja'.
