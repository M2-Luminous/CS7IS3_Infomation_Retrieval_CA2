FR940830-0-00129 FR940830-0-00014 (c) The filing of a transfer of interest, when properly executed and recorded under State law, is placed on the BLM record when it is filed with the proper BLM office. The transfer will be deemed to have taken place on its effective date under State law. 34. Section 3833.4 is amended by revising the heading and paragraphs (a) and (b), redesignating paragraphs (c) through (e) as (d) through (f), respectively, and adding paragraph (c), to read as follows: §3833.4 Failure to file, or to pay maintenance or location fees. (a)(1) The failure to make annual filings required by §§3833.2&hyph;1 and 3833.2&hyph;2 on or before the December 30 immediately following the August 31 by which the small miner filed for a waiver of payment of the maintenance fee, shall conclusively constitute a forfeiture of the mining claim or site. (2) Failure to record the notice or certificate of location required by §3833.1&hyph;2(a), §3734.1(a), or §3821.2 of this title, or failure to pay the maintenance or location fees required by §§3833.1&hyph;4, 3833.1&hyph;5, and 3833.1&hyph;7, or failure to file the documents required by §3833.1&hyph;7 (b) through (d) within the time periods prescribed therein for claimants who also fail to pay the maintenance fee, shall be deemed conclusively to constitute a forfeiture of the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site. (3) Claimants who fail to pay the maintenance fee, but file a waiver certification under §3833.1&hyph;7, shall perform the assessment work required by subpart 3851 of this title by the waiver statement filing deadline, or the mining claims under the invalid waiver certification will be conclusively deemed forfeited for failure to pay the maintenance fee on time. (4) Failure to list the 10 or fewer mining claims and/or sites for which the fee is requested to be waived on the applicable certification document filed pursuant to 3833.1&hyph;6 or 3833.1&hyph;7 will result in the affected mining claims and/or sites being deemed abandoned by the owner or owners thereof. (b) Failure to file the complete information required in §§3833.1&hyph;2(b), 3833.1&hyph;7(d)&hyph;(f), 3833.2&hyph;4(a), 3833.2&hyph;4(b), 3833.2&hyph;5(b) and 3833.2&hyph;5(c), when the document is otherwise filed on time, shall not be conclusively deemed to constitute an abandonment or forfeiture of the claim or site, but such information shall be submitted within 30 days of receipt of a notice from the authorized officer calling for such information. Failure to submit the information requested by the decision of the authorized officer shall result in the mining claim, mill site, or tunnel site being deemed abandoned by the owner.
