Afonso Dhlakama was speaking at a news conference shortly after the first provincial cadre conference that began on 14 June. Afonso Dhlakama said he had information that two Tanzanians have been arrested in Cabo Delgado Province. They had been registered for the October elections and were going to vote for Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front]. Dhlakama accused electoral registration officers of furthering the interests of the ruling party, noting that they have been trained by Frelimo. He said in registering voters, electoral officers show a photograph of the president of the Republic, instructing the electorate to vote for Joaquim Chissano. Asked to comment on Renamo's plans to (?monitor the registration of voters), Dhlakama said members of his movement have already been selected for that purpose. He said tomorrow Renamo monitors will be assigned to registration centers to put an end to irregularities. Afonso Dhlakama also accused the government of hindering the electoral process because no registration centers have been established in certain localities, forcing the residents to walk for miles to register. Dhlakama noted that registration teams should meet the electorate and not the other way round. Turning to the role of Renamo advisers, Dhlakama said he was disturbed with the manner in which they are being treated in Inhambane Province. He said the advisers have no vehicles and the governor is undermining their activities. Turning to the Renamo conference, which was designed to review party activities in the province, registration and education of voters, and the adoption of a Renamo election strategy, Dhlakama said those goals had been achieved. He described the conference as positive. Meanwhile, the command of the Republic of Mozambique Police in Cabo Delgado Province has already denied Renamo's claim that two Tanzanians had been detained after being registered as voters. Afonso Dhlakama has left for Xai-Xai for a meeting with Renamo cadres. The Gaza provincial cadre conference was scheduled to begin this afternoon, but had to be postponed due to Dhlakama's late arrival. [passage omitted] Renamo spokesman (Rehire Khan) yesterday accused the UN Mozambique Civilian Police Command [Civpol] of collaborating with the Mozambican Government in violation of the General Peace Accord. (Khan) alleged that Civpol elements went to Chigubo District without informing the Renamo advisers to the governor of Gaza Province. (Khan) noted that Chigubo is a Renamo area. [passage omitted]
