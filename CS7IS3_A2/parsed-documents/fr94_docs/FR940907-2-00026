FR940907-2-00026 FR940907-2-00015 Financial Assistance for Utility Battery Storage Program AGENCY: Department of Energy, Albuquerque Operations Office. ACTION: Notice of Intent to Award a Noncompetitive Financial Assistance. SUMMARY: The Albuquerque Operations Office (AL), pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), intends to award, on a noncompetitive basis, a cooperative agreement to Omnion Power Engineering Corporation of East Troy, Wisconsin. DATES: Award to be effective September 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Address comments to the attention of Erwin E. Fragua, Department of Energy, Albuquerque Operations Office, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185&hyph;5400 (505) 845&hyph;6442. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose to be served by this award is to advance the Department's goal of cooperating with the electric utility and manufacturing industries to develop battery storage systems as an economically attractive utility resources option by the end of this decade. Battery energy storage can help utilities address: increased competition with respect to electricity supply, greater required energy efficiency, and more restrictive environmental regulations by improving: cost-effectiveness, reliability, and power quality, and by reducing the environmental impact of electricity generation and distribution. The particular significance of the development to be funded is a demonstrable battery storage system that can be evaluated and tested by an electric utility. It is anticipated that the cost-shared cooperative agreement will be funded annually for a total project period of two years. The government's funding of this cooperative agreement is subject to the availability of funds. This noncompetitive action is based on continuation of this program which is presently funded by the DOE and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the program. Issued in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on August 12, 1994. Richard A. Marquez, Assistant Manager for Management and Administration.
