The news coming from the gold-ingot-shaped PBC tower on Beijing's Fuxingmen confirms that: the central bank's management of monetary and credit funds in 1994 will change to mostly control of the money supply and oversight of financial institution operations, with its regulation and control of the money supply gradually introducing the international practice of open market operations. Authoritative figures claim that open market operations are a major reform of China's Central Bank style of macroeconomic regulation and control of the national economy, as well as a key market economy style of coordinating monetary and fiscal policies. What are open market operations? They refer to actions by a country's central bank, through open market buying and selling of financial commodities, such as government bonds, to regulate money-market money supply and interest rates. When money market funds are tight, the Central Bank buys government securities on open markets, pouring basic currency into markets; when too much currency is in circulation on markets, the Central Bank sells government securities on open markets, withdrawing funds from circulation, to deflate the currency. One of the "Magic Weapons" of Indirect Regulation and Control The three monetary policies of open market operations, rediscounting, and legal deposit reserves, are called in international monetary circles the "three key magic weapons" for exercising macroeconomic regulation and control of a national economy. In certain economically developed countries, open market operations are regularly used by the Central Bank to ease or tighten credit. The reason that China did not take this step [practice open market operations] in the past, in addition to system factors, was that we had not yet met two objective terms: 1. The Central Bank has to hold sizeable amounts of government bonds, without which open market operations are mere empty talk. In certain developed countries, 50 to 60 percent of Central Bank assets are national treasury bonds, while in China, central fiscal deficits can be made up directly through PBC overdrafts, so that Central Bank assets do not include control of national treasury bonds. 2. There has to be a quite deep, broad, and flexible national treasury bond market. In such a market, commercial banks, stock companies, and other individuals and institutions all hold sizeable amounts of treasury bonds, and there is also a complete transaction system and standards. Otherwise, it is hard for the regulation of credit to have any impact. So beginning in 1994, open market operations will take a developmental step, with central finance no longer directly overdrawing on and borrowing from the Central Bank, but rather selling treasury bonds to the public, to raise the needed national construction funds. In conjunction with these monetary and fiscal reform steps, the Central Bank will set percentage requirements for the liquid assets of financial institutions, stipulating that all types of financial institutions hold a set amount of treasury bonds and policy-finance bonds. Meanwhile, we will allow all commercial banks or their authorized branches, based on the minimum assets liquidity percentage set by the central bank, to buy and sell treasury bonds on secondary markets, or through forms, such as outside dealings, central bank collateral, and "buy-back agreements," to adjust the percentages of their own liquid reserve fund structures. Based on this overall principle, we sold Central Bank financing bonds in 1993, and will expand treasury bond sales in 1994 to 100 billion yuan, all of which bodes well for open market operations to reach a higher level. On 31 January 1994, our first batch of 15 billion yuan worth of treasury bills was completely underwritten by an exclusive sales group composed of 35 financial institutions. The overall coordinator of this exclusive treasury bond sales group was the PBC. The joint sale of treasury bonds by the Ministry of Finance and the PBC was a historical first. It is understood that the Central Bank has recently begun to buy treasury bonds, beginning to practice open market operations, which will also be a historical first. The operating tools of open market operations are treasury bonds and foreign exchange, with the ultimate aim being to stabilize the value of the RMB. Our choice of treasury bonds as our open market operating tool in 1994 will first: help us to draw on international practice to avoid detours and second; coordinate well fiscal and monetary policies through buying and selling treasury bonds. The experts involved in the planning of this new monetary policy hold that the Central Bank use of open market operations to indirectly regulate and control the money supply will be like a trickling stream, which can effectively prevent the social and economic repercussions caused by the past forms of direct regulation and control, such as relending and controlling credit scope. This is because only when it is necessary to regulate and control the economy will the Central Bank handle basic currency through the three major channels of its discount collateral window, treasury bond market, and foreign exchange market, transmitting basic currency through these channels to financial institutions to produce the regulation and control effect, so that all financial institutions certainly do not deal directly with the central bank, but rather with money markets. Meanwhile, this policy will operate with constancy and continuity, in that once money markets experience changes, the Central Bank can quickly change its operating direction, to quickly adjust the market money supply. Welcome News for Our Whole Society Central Bank initiation of open market operations is good news for financial institutions, as well as for enterprises and individuals. Ensuring that open market operations work to achieve the desired regulation and control impact will require the sale of large amounts of treasury bonds, which will sharply increase public investment opportunities. Banks and nonbank financial institutions can also, when funds are abundant or in short supply, directly or indirectly adjust their assets structures through treasury bond transactions with the Central Bank. As the Shenzhen Development Bank is a listed corporation, the relevant provisions do not allow it to invest in the stock market, so that for many years, treasury bonds have been a key part of its capital structure. Open market operations will undoubtedly provide fine opportunities for such institutions. A figure affiliated with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is acting as a major underwriter for the first batch of voluntary treasury bond sales, states that: "We particularly welcome the reform of treasury bond sales. Since many commercial bank assets are now credit loans, current lending seems to be a bottomless pit. But if we buy treasury bills, we can effectively change our former assets structure." Central bank initiation of open market operations will also have a certain impact on current and future stock market prices and returns. For instance, when the PBC is buying large amounts of treasury bonds, this means that it is easing money and expanding credit, which will generally raise bond prices, lowering their yields. But when the PBC is selling large amounts of treasury bonds, this means that the central bank is tightening money and shrinking credit, creating the impression that interest rates will go up, thus lowering demand for investment bonds, causing bond prices to slide. For the investor, correctly grasping these "signals" for timely purchases or sales of treasury bonds, will sharply increase investment returns. Open Market Operations Are a Heavy Responsibility Central Bank open market operations are intertwined and mutually promotional with treasury bond markets. China's treasury bond circulation is less than ideal, one of the signs of which is a low turnover rate. For U.S. treasury bond sales, the turnover rate can reach 100 percent in about one week, while the turnover rate for China's treasury bonds was less than 100 percent for all of 1993. We are facing a similar problem in 1994. The Shanghai Stock Exchange offers a series of treasury bond services, such as buybacks, futures, and spots, for which trading volume and turnover rates are all low, with almost noone using its treasury bond buyback service for capital financing. In other words, China's open market operations still depend on the size and vigor of the secondary bond market, as well as on related central bank steps, without which their initiation will be negatively affected. In another area, China's open market operations are just beginning in 1994, with few possible means of regulation and control, meaning that for some time to come, it will be impossible for them to become the Central Bank's major means of macroeconomic regulation and control, and that it will be hard for them to have much impact on macroeconomic conditions. It is predictable that as the Central Bank's monetary policy tools increase, and its regulation and control means improve, it will not be too long before indirect means of regulation and control, such as open market operations, will play the key economic regulation role, to replace direct means of regulation and control.
