Geroski: "Symptomatic Exclusivity"] [Text] The interrupted session of the communal assembly is expected to be resumed in Tetovo today, when the board members will discuss the recent arrests of four citizens of Albanian nationality who were caught with a considerable quantity of firearms. The PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] and the NDP [People's Democratic Party] link this case to the "paramilitary army" affair and demand the release of those arrested, as well as the liberation of the group accused of creating paramilitary formations. Interior Minister Ljubomir Frckovski's attempt to persuade the Tetovo board members at the first (interrupted) session that the latest arrests had nothing to do with the affair, and thus had no political background, was obviously inadequate. Today, the Justice and Administration Minister, Tuse Gosev, is expected in Tetovo. However, it is still an open question whether the new round of pressure will produce any results. According to the latest information of the PDP and NDP, and the Democratic Forum for Protection of Human Freedoms and Rights in Macedonia, located in Gostivar, any serious discussion of the case was undermined from the outset. That is, the leading political formations of the Albanians in Macedonia saw the latest arrests as factor in the affair, as an attempt to discredit the PDP, as a manipulated political process, an organized action against the Albanians, as a great provocation, and so on. Since the event has been characterized in such political terms, one can expect that today's discussion between the Tetovo board members and the representatives of the executive authority will develop into a discussion between the deaf. The case of those arrested in Tetovo (four) and Gostivar (two) is clean, at least as far as concerns the police. They are all accused under Article 218 of the Macedonian Criminal Code -- the carrying of arms and explosives is prohibited. The Tetovo group was, for instance, caught with 28 firearms (automatic rifles) and 10 bombs. Nonetheless, the straight description of the deed refers to data in which the authorities do not link it with the "paramilitary soldiers." Therein lies the dilemma -- why do the PDP and NDP do so? We can to some extent understand the strength of feeling in the political representative body of Albanians in Macedonia, and the fact that all cases are seen through the prism of the PDP's internal party conflicts. However, does this mean that arms smugglers will no longer be affected by law if they are Albanians because they might be connected with the "paramilitary army" affair? Can anybody in this state be granted such an exclusive position? Finally, is it permissible to ask for Macedonian state bodies (administration) to be substituted with an international commission, not to allow for the possible monitoring of the events in the "paramilitary army" affair (which could be accepted), but for "clarifying the case"?
