Another important task in deepening the reform of China's financial system reform is to separate policy-lending banking from commercial banking and turn state-owned specialized banks into genuine commercial banks. This is an important part of comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction that "efforts must be made to manage banks as genuine banks" and the key to deepening the financial system reform. The financial organizational system preliminarily set up during the 14 year period of reform and opening up doubtlessly represents a remarkable progress as compared with the banks in the past which only hired "tellers" and "accountants." This system is under the leadership of the People's Bank of China and mainly composed of state-owned specialized banks with various other economic sectors working side by side and coordinating with one another through a division of work. However, for many years, China's state-owned specialized banks have, on the one hand, performed the functions as commercial banks, while on the other hand, they have not developed the mechanism of modern commercial banks in managing theirs own affairs, assuming their own risks, restraining themselves and assuming the responsibility for their own profits and losses. This has prevented the entire banking system in China from meeting the requirements in developing a socialist market economy. The functions and scope of operation of the four specialized banks which are regarded as the major forces of the financial circle have not been clearly defined. Due to the fact that the functions of the government are not separated from those of enterprises, the bank's business operation has been interfered by the local authorities. As a result, the credit operations of the national bank are provincialized and funds divided into pieces. There is no guarantee for the supply of funds in developing the major construction projects of the state. Moreover, the profit-oriented specialized banks have plans to expand their credits, but they lack the mechanism to avoid risks. Thus, there are increasing number of bad debts and overdue bills, and their credit rating is notably lowered. Bad debts in some specialized banks make up as much as 30 percent of their total assets. The shortcomings and problems which have cropped up show that it is of great urgency to manage state-owned specialized banks as commercial banks and establish a good system of modern commercial banks in order to meet the requirements in the development of socialist market economy. This is because that with the vigorous development of the reform and opening up program, tremendous changes have taken up in the environment under which the banks operate. The banks' funds have gradually become market-oriented, and the banks have been asked to use their funds as a commodity in running their businesses. Industrial and commercial enterprises have become legal persons of self-management. Banks have been asked to run as enterprises instead of administrative organs and cooperate with each other on an equal basis. After the barriers between different departments and regions are removed, credit funds are continuously increasing on the market. Banks at home and abroad are expanding their cooperation. All this demands that banks in China link with international commercial banks in business operations and change their system of only supplying credit funds to a system of business operation. Efforts must be made to transform the specialized banks into genuine state-owned commercial banks, which mainly handle deposits from and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises and regard profits as their main target in doing business. Organizationally they will be national commercial banks, each with a head office and many branches. In dealing with outsiders, they are independent legal persons under centralized business management. After the modern commercial banks start to operate, it is necessary to follow the principle of managing their own affairs, assuming their own risks, bearing the responsibility for their own profits and losses and restraining themselves. It is essential to view the commercial banks in the country as a whole, centralize their management and unify the procedure of fund management. In business operation, modern commercial banks must uphold the principle of combining profitability, fluidity and safety. Since they mainly use money deposited in the banks in extending loans, their risks are higher than ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises. Meanwhile, they are not obliged to do policy-oriented financing and "subsidize" those enterprises which are suffering losses, they can justly pay full attention to profits from now on. Modern commercial banks should also independently make their own decisions on investments, break away from the administrative interferences from the governments at all levels, and strive to reap maximum profits with minimum risks. Efforts must be made to strengthen supervision and control over the risks taken by state-owned commercial banks. As the owner of state-owned commercial banks, the state must supervise, through the board of supervisors, their management and how they preserve and increase the value of state assets. Nevertheless, the state should not interfere with the banks' routine business activities. The most basic characteristics of state-owned commercial banks is their need to manage their own affairs, bear the responsibility for their own profits and losses, assume their own risks and restrain themselves. They must implement the various guidelines and policies of the party and the state. Under no circumstances should they regard making investments in stocks and shares, and buying securities and real estate at lower prices and selling them out at higher prices a part of their regular operation. According to international practice, various countries have set limits on the scope of business operation for the commercial banks. Even many countries with fairly developed market economy explicitly forbid commercial banks to make investments in industries and illegally buying and selling securities. Therefore state-owned commercial banks should be forbidden to make direct investments in nonbanking enterprises. After the reform of the financial system, China's system of commercial banks should include state-owned commercial banks, the Bank of Communications and other national and regional commercial banks and rural and urban cooperative banks. Specialized banks must go through a process to become state-owned commercial banks. It depends on the external environment, particularly the gradual establishment of the system of modern enterprises. It also depends on the internal management mechanism such as the principle of operation and the system and methods for internal management. All these must be standardized and improved in accordance with the general principle governing the commercial banks and the Banking Law. Efforts must be made in a down-to-earth manner to study and explore how to carry out reform in this respect. After reforming themselves, state-owned commercial banks will become the mainstay of the new financial organizational system. They will be able to do a better job in providing financial services of all types, to keep pace with the developing socialist market economy and to help promote the national economy continuously, swiftly and healthily.
