However, that of the drug boss and gangster king must not remain closed to the police. Just as in other rule-of-law states around us, the police must be able in the future to bug German apartments for reconnaissance purposes if new crimes are being discussed there. Therefore, I appeal to the delegates of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] congress, which begins in Rostock next week, to give a signal for the introduction of the great bugging campaign in Germany. The population and certainly the majority of the FDP followers expect this from their party. Therefore, I hope that at the end of the week, the path will be free so that the police can combat crimes even more successfully on the basis of clear rules of the rule-of-law state, which make arbitrariness impossible. The past has clearly shown that, without the great bugging campaign to gain evidence, we cannot successfully combat international crime in the long run. Therefore, we must act together.
