In another statement signed by the chief press secretary to the head of state, Mr. David Attah, government said it finds it absolutely necessary to give more information on the border feud between Nigeria and the Cameroon in order to put the facts straight. According to the statement, historically, the Efiks of Nigeria in Cross River state, who migrated from (Uwan), now in Akwa-Ibom state, while searching for better fishing grounds, discovered (Udombi), which the early Europeans to the area later renamed Bakassi Peninsula. More specifically, (Udombi) or Bakassi was founded in the late 16th Century on the authority of the king and chiefs of Old Calabar. It was then too that fishing settlements were established at Ekang, renamed Archibong in Abana and Atabong out of south (Udomhi). The statement has it that the Efiks and (?Efuts) declared to the British Council in 1884 that their allegiance was to the kings and chiefs of Old Calabar, the only authority approved by them for entry into a treaty with the British Council. British acceptance of the legal authority of the king of Old Calabar of (Udombi) led to the treaties of 1985 [as heard], 1890, 1893, and 1906 between the UK and Germany. The treaties preserved (Udombi) as part of Old Calabar. The implication of the treaty is that Germany, which had authority over the then Cameroon agreed totally that (Udombi) people are Efiks and the territory Nigerian, not southern Cameroon. Even when southern Cameroon passed on to the UN trusteeship after World War II, it did not alter the legal status of (Udombi) as an integral part of Nigeria. The statement goes on to assert that when the present Western Cameroon was part of Nigeria, (Udombi) area was administered from Eket on the authority of the former Eastern Nigerian Government. The statement expressed the Federal Government's disquiet when Cameroon let loose its gendarmes into Nigeria's fishing settlement in Bakassi to harass, plunder, and murder at will Nigerians. Nigeria continued to remain calm despite the provocations, and sought dialogue with Cameroon, using established diplomatic machinery. Nigeria's efforts would have resulted in a meeting between President Paul Biya and General Sani Abacha in Maiduguri in the northeastern part of Nigeria which has border with Cameroon. Government explained that, unfortunately, before the planned meeting, the Government of the Cameroon took steps to externalize the conflict with French connivance. The statement stressed that Nigeria's policy of accommodation should not be construed to mean inability to maintain Nigeria's territorial integrity in the face of violation of our rightful borders on land, sea, and air.
