It is reported, however, that because the individual countries had not fined-tuned their position, they agreed to hold a meeting on Tuesday, 31 May, after making informal contacts between member countries. The UNSC member countries had planned to convene an emergency countermeasure meeting today, Sunday, with a view to hastily adopting a statement of warning or a resolution pointing out the seriousness of the situation to North Korea which has been making haste in replacing fuel rods more than necessary. But, there is a prevailing opinion that it will take more time to fine-tune the opinions of not only permanent members, but of other members as well and that it is desirable to further watch the attitude of the North Korean side. As a result, well-informed sources have said that it was agreed among member countries to hold a countermeasure meeting this upcoming 31 May. In today's informal contacts between UNSC members, the U.S. side asked China to exercise a strong influence on North Korea to immediately stop replacing fuel rods. The Great Britain and France advocated adopting a statement calling again for holding negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea while sending out a warning about the seriousness of the present situation. But, it is reported that the Chinese stressed the need to deal with this question with prudence as well as to have dialogue with North Korea with patience.
