The purpose of the regulations in this Part is to implement the designation of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary by regulating activities affecting the Sanctuary consistent with the terms of that designation in order to protect and manage the conservation, ecological, recreational, research, educational, historical and aesthetic resources and qualities of the area. §925.2 Boundary. (a) The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary consists of an area of approximately 2500 square nautical miles (approximately 8577 sq. kilometers) of coastal and ocean waters, and the submerged lands thereunder, off the central and northern coast of the State of Washington. (b) The Sanctuary boundary extends from Koitlah Point due north to the United States/Canada international boundary. The Sanctuary boundary then follows the U.S./Canada international boundary seaward to the 100 fathom isobath. The seaward boundary of the Sanctuary approximates the 100 fathom isobath in a southerly direction from the U.S./Canada international boundary to a point due west of the mouth of the Copalis River cutting across the heads of Nitnat, Juan de Fuca and Quinault Canyons. The coastal boundary of the Sanctuary is the mean higher high water line when adjacent to Federally managed lands cutting across the mouths of all rivers and streams, except where adjacent to Indian reservations, state and county owned lands; in such case, the coastal boundary is the mean lower low water line. La Push harbor is excluded from the Sanctuary boundary shoreward of the International Collision at Sea regulation (Colreg.) demarcation lines. The precise boundary of the Sanctuary is set forth in appendix A to this part. §925.3 Definitions. (a) The following terms are defined for the purposes of this part: Act means Title III of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.).
