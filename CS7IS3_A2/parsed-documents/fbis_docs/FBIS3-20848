Sutalo: "`Dubrovnik' in Dubrovnik"] [Text] Dubrovnik -- A few days ago the missile ship Dubrovnik arrived for the first time in the port whose name it bears and from which it will sail for regular monitoring of the maritime borders of Croatia. This ship became the property of the Croatian Navy upon the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Navy from the repair institute in Sibenik, and, as Deputy Commander Ivan Vukovic told us, it was given the name Dubrovnik during the heaviest attacks on this town. Since then, this vessel participated in battles around Sibenik and in the Maslenica action when things were the hardest, Commander Miljenko Crljen said. "When the former Yugoslav People's Army was still on Vis and Lastovo islands, we used to defy it by sailing near Korcula," Crljen added, stressing the ship's cooperation with the Maritime Police.
