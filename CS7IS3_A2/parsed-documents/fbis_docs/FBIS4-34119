Upon his arrival in this city, which has close similarities to Havana, Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Salinas' visit had shown the Cubans' and Mexicans'-- especially their governments' -- capacity and will to increase bilateral ties. He considered it especially significant that the Aztec country had respected the path taken by the island to initiate its economic changes and had not allowed Cuba to be left alone in these moments. His stay in Havana, Robaina added, was very intense and provided the Cuban delegation to the fourth summit a head start in the collateral bilateral relations program and the celebration itself. The Cuban foreign minister believes the activity of the Mexican leader in Havana furthered practical steps to be taken in a new situation for both countries. During his stay, important agreements were signed and still others are in a process of negotiations. In this sense, he considered the signing of the agreements as very important, especially the agreement on the telephone system. Agreements in other sectors, such as in the cement, textile, tile, and sanitary furniture manufacturing industries, had also been advanced. Finally, he recalled that both leaders had valued their encounter as being courageous, deep, fruitful, and extremely friendly. Robaina is a member of the official Cuban delegation to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, headed by President Fidel Castro. The Cuban president was received here by an enthusiastic solidarity group which awaited, since very early today, his arrival close to the Hilton Hotel, where the presidents have been staying.
