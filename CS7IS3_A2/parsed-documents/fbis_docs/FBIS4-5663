There may remain "an unpleasant feeling" between Sakigake and Shinseito, however, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. Shinseito is regarded as the most influential force in the seven-party coalition. Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata, who is deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has emerged as the most likely successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, coalition sources said. During the course of the power struggle following Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation last Friday, Sakigake has sided with the coalition's biggest group, the Social Democratic Party, to oppose Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's influence over the choice of a successor to Hosokawa, political sources said.
