Savage is heading a delegation of businessmen interested in initiating trade relations with the island. The group accompanying Savage is comprised of representatives of 16 Nova Scotian companies. Nova Scotia is a territory on Canada's Atlantic coast. The entrepreneurs see Cuba as a place with real business prospects. "Taking into account the business opportunities available in Cuba, the entrepreneurs accompanying me are very eager and interested in doing serious business with the island," Savage said. Savage is making the first working visit to Cuba in 17 years by a provincial chief of state. The delegation was welcomed by Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas Ruiz and Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, president of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce, who briefed the visitors on the current economic situation in Cuba, its problems, and development prospects, as well as on the availability of capital investment opportunities. Savage, who became prime minister with the Liberal Party in a landslide victory last May, said that the results of the trade probe and discussions the group expects to complete will surely be mutually beneficial. There are now 400 companies that maintain trade relations with the island. There are 112 companies or joint ventures in operation, 22 of which are with the Canadian capital. Canadian Ambassador to Cuba Mark Entwistle commented that the Canadian entrepreneurs have a growing interest in the Cuban market, where they find commercial and investment stability. Cuba is Canada's fourth most important trade partner in Latin America, and first in the Caribbean and Central America. During their stay, Savage and his commercial delegation will also be greeted by Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of Ministers; Nicolas Rodriguez, the acting foreign minister; the ministers of health, fishing industry, and agriculture; and Ricardo Alarcon, the president of Parliament. They will also visit centers of scientific and economic interest. Cuba maintains certain agreements, especially in fishing, with the Atlantic Province of Nova Scotia, whose Halifax Bay is the world's second largest and is the site of heavy trade traffic. Now Cuba will be able to broaden such ties to other areas.
