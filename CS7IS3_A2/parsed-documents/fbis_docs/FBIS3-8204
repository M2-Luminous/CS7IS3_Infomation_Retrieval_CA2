The R.S.K. army command said in a statement on Monday that the fighting took place in the area of Cukovac, which was captured by Croatian troops on Saturday. However, following strong pressure by the Serb forces and after suffering considerable casualties, Croatian troops were forced to withdraw to their initial positions. The same source said that the crushing of the last strongholds of the Croatian army in the area was underway. The Serb forces have suffered no casualties in the fighting although considerable material damage has been inflicted on civilian targets. The statement said that Croatian forces had on several occasions provoked the Serb forces by opening infantry fire in the broader area of Drnis and Benkovac, in the south of the R.S.K. Croatian forces have repeatedly violated the ceasefire agreement, which was signed before Christmas and extended twice since then. The latest ceasefire violation indicates that Zagreb has not given up attempts to resolve disputed issues with the R.S.K. by force. The R.S.K. was set up in 1991 on Serb ethnic and historical territories in the former Yugoslav republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and its violations of Serbs' human and national rights.
