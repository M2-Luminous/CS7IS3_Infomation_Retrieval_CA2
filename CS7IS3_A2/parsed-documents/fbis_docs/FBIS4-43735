Stop steering by the stars, otherwise you run the risk of losing your bearings." And if there is one thing that the AN leader wants to avoid, it is this government running onto the rocks. If anything, his dream is of the executive going from strength to strength and a close pact between Forza Italia, League, and the AN. [Caprettini] Is it a single majority party that you would like to see emerge, Fini? [Fini] I see a single party as a difficult goal to achieve, almost impossible, at least for the time being. But I think there is a case for forming a single electoral group. Take the local elections: Some second ballots have the AN and Forza Italia versus the League. These are wasted opportunities. The same thing happened in the general election. We lost out. Meanwhile, they have made a deal on the Left.... [Caprettini] [Interior Minister] Maroni seems willing to consider your proposal, but not Bossi. Do you see signs of a split in the League? [Fini] No. I think they are speaking different languages owing to the fact that Maroni is working to strengthen the majority from his position as a minister, while Bossi is claiming greater freedom of action as secretary. The main thing is for them not to start playing clever.... [Caprettini] How do you explain Bossi's sorties? [Fini] He is going through an unsettling period, with the election defeat in a lot of northern towns, such as Verona and Como, and the break with Miglio, which has left his federalist flank very exposed. Then, above all, he has a strategic problem. Until 26 March it was easy for him to present himself as an alternative to the system.... [Caprettini] You are making allowances.... [Fini] No, it is just that I understand what he is going through at the moment. I respect the man who has come to a crossroads. [Caprettini] But, now that you know him better, what do you think of Bossi? [Fini] He says what he thinks. He is not at all "constructed." The speeches that he is giving at the moment are an admission of the crisis that the League is going through. However, my comment is that it is important for them to choose a course of action once and for all, looking ahead and avoiding clever tricks and antics.... For instance, I do not like his launching the idea of an independentist current within the League when he knows perfectly well that there is a definite government agreement on the unity of the state. His announcement of a labor party with a nudge and a wink to the Left, while even Maroni was tugging at his sleeve, strikes me as out of place. I appreciate that he feels caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, but I should like to understand what his real intentions are. [Caprettini] Will he make them clear at Pontida today? [Fini] I will be interested to see, but I do not have great hopes. These rallies usually serve the purpose of galvanizing the grass roots. His appeal will be more to party pride. [Caprettini] Bossi fears Berlusconi, but you do not. Why not? [Fini] The identity of the AN is now well established. For a couple of months, we sailed through a storm of allegations, but we confirmed our strength in the European elections, and in many cities, such as Rome, we have maintained our leading position. This is why I do not fear deals with Forza Italia. [Caprettini] But Bossi would have none of it.... [Fini] True, he justifies his stance on the grounds that the League has to defend its identity. I remember I told him: "You can get away with it in the European elections, where there is proportional representation, but you will be running an enormous risk in the local elections." The outcome has proved me right, even leaving aside the fact that where there are AN and Forza Italia candidates in the second ballot, the League's electorate will end up by opting for us.... [Caprettini] Are you quite sure? [Fini] Sure I am sure! The majority of the League's electorate does not have a labor-voting soul. These are people who voted for the League because it was the sole representative of free-market tendencies. What is more, was Maroni not supposed to be the party's left wing? And is he not the staunchest supporter of the three-way electoral deal? [Caprettini] Meanwhile, however, there is friction between AN and the League as regards regional electoral reform.... [Fini] Yes, and here I must put my foot down. [Institutional Reform Minister] Speroni and the League must not think that they can solve their problems by offloading them onto the government. Regional electoral laws? Impossible, not least because the regional governments elected in 1990 still have parties that have since been wiped out in positions of strength, while other parties -- such as Forza Italia -- are not represented. What needs drafting, therefore, is a national bill, maybe framework legislation.... But it is inconceivable that it should be others -- some of them dead and buried -- who decide. [Caprettini] What should be done about reforming the parliamentary election system? [Fini] Here we must remember that [Radical leader] Pannella's referendum is just around the corner. So what should we do? Either we draft a bill or we go ahead with the referendum. And if the choice should be the British system, how can we avoid confronting the issue of an electoral deal at least within the majority? Because it strikes me as obvious that, in either case, we shall have to go back to the polls....
