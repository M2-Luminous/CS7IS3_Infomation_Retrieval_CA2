FR940826-0-00024 FR940826-0-00010 7 CFR Part 1205 [CN&hyph;94&hyph;006] RIN 0581&hyph;AB29 Amendment to Cotton Research and Promotion Regulations Regarding Assessment of Imported Cotton-Containing Products AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is adopting without modification an interim final rule amending the Cotton Board Rules and Regulations to allow for the continuation of collections on renumbered imported cotton-containing products as long as no change in the product's Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) description occurs. Since renumbering of products by the U.S. Customs Service occurs rather frequently, providing for a continuation of assessment collection will prevent unnecessary and costly interruptions of the program. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Craig Shackelford, Chief, Cotton Research and Promotion Staff, Cotton Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2641&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; or telephone: (202) 720&hyph;2259. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Prior Document: Interim final rule-Amendment to Cotton Research and Promotion Regulations Regarding Assessment of Imported Cotton-Containing Products published July 1, 1994, (59 FR 33901). Regulatory Impact This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under Section 12 of the Act, any person subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the District Court of the United States in any district in which the person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling, provided a complaint is filed within 20 days from the date of the entry or the ruling.
