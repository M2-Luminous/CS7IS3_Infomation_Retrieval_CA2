FR940819-0-00106 FR940819-0-00019 The fleet size for an operator of aircraft for hire to be considered a small entity is nine or fewer aircraft. The threshold annualized cost levels for operators of aircraft for hire in 1993 dollars are $117,800 for scheduled operators whose fleets have aircraft with seating capacities of more than 60, $67,000 for scheduled operators whose fleets have aircraft with seating capacities of 60 or less (other scheduled operators), and $4,570 for unscheduled operators. The proposals in the NPRM would affect air carriers that provide passenger-carrying operations in aircraft for which flight attendants are required. Other types of aviation companies would not be affected. A ``substantial number'' of small entities is a number that is not less than 11 and that is more than one-third of the small entities subject to this rule. According to FAA records of small entity air carriers that provide passenger-carrying operations in aircraft that require flight attendants, there are 23 part 125 and 135 operators that could be affected by the final rule. Of these 23 operators, 7 are part 121/135 operators, 12 are part 125 operators, and 4 are part 135 operators. The affected operators are those with nine or fewer aircraft. At least one of the aircraft that they own have a seating configuration of more than 19 as described in either ยง125.269 or ยง135.107 and therefore would have at least one flight attendant on board. There are also 8 part 121 operators that would be affected by the final rule. In July 1993, there were a total of 25 part 121/135 operators, 39 part 125 operators, and 3,040 part 135 operators. There are also more than 100 part 121 operators. The number of carriers that could be affected by the rule does not exceed one-third of the total number of carriers in any of the four categories of operators (parts 121, 121/125, 125 and 135). The FAA has therefore determined that a regulatory flexibility analysis is not necessary. International Trade Impact Statement This final rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American goods and services to foreign countries and the import of foreign goods and services into the United States. The FAA has determined that the amendments to parts 121 and 135 will not have a significant impact on international trade. The final rule is not expected to have an impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas or foreign firms doing business in the United States. This finding is based in large part upon the review of foreign civil aviation regulations governing flight attendant flight and duty time practices and minimum rest requirements found in the Industry Study as well as information supplied by commenters to the public docket. The Industry Study review shows that 23 countries, including Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and West Germany, have government regulations on flight attendant flight and duty times and rest periods. The comment provided by the Flight Attendants states that the European Community, through its Joint Aviation Authority (JAA) ``is poised to issue flight attendant duty time and rest provisions which would be based on state of the art research concerning work schedules and fatigue.'' They state that the JAA rule would base duty time and rest limits on the time of departure and the number of segments flown. On the other hand, the Industry Study noted that 24 countries, including Australia, Canada, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, and Mexico, do not regulate flight attendant work time. The FAA concludes that there are many countries with flight attendant flight and duty times and rest periods and many countries without these regulations. Second, many firms in the United States appear to be already in compliance or near compliance with the final regulation. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the amendments to parts 121, 125, and 135, will not have a significant impact on international trade. Federalism Implications The regulation herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this regulation will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this regulation is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the rule is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures. However, the FAA has determined that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities or on international trade. A final regulatory evaluation of the regulation, including a final Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.

Paperwork Reduction Act Approval Sections 121.683(a)(1), 135.63(a)(3), 135.63(a)(4)(x), 135.63(a)(5), and 135.63(b) are not effective until the OMB has approved the Paperwork Reduction Requirements. The FAA will publish a document in the Federal Register following OMB approval of the Paperwork Reduction Requirements.
