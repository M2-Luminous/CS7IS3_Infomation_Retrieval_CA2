For this purpose, the State General Institute of Animal and Plant Quarantine and the Animal and the Plant Health Inspection Service under the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently signed the "Plant Hygiene Conditions for the Export to China of Apples From Washington State in the United States." In recent years, domestic demands for imported fruit have been growing steadily. To enhance bilateral trade between China and the United States and to meet the demands of the domestic market, China's animal and plant quarantine organ has, on the basis of widely collected relevant information, formed a specific group to carry out a study of the destructive nature of insect pests which might be present in apples imported from the United States. Based on their scientific analysis, experts hold that Washington state is not included in the area infested by the Mediterranean fruit fly, and that apples produced by this state may be exported to China with conditions. According to the agreement signed between China and the United States governing the plant-hygiene condition of apples to be imported from Washington state, the apples to be exported to China must be produced by orchards designated by the Chinese State General Institute of Animal and Plant Quarantine, and must be packed, frozen, and stored by designated factories. During the process of packing and prior to export, they must be strictly inspected by the U.S. animal and plant quarantine organ and it must be guaranteed that they meet the quarantine requirements as imposed by China. Moreover, upon their arrival in China, the apples exported to China must enter the country through designated ports and must be quarantined and cleared by a Chinese animal and plant quarantine organ before they are allowed to be put on sale. The Mediterranean fruit fly is a destructive pest to fruit, one from which China is free. To prevent it from entering China, and to safeguard China's fruit production, China has banned the import of fruit from the United States and other countries affected by the pest. The current lifting of the ban is confined to apples produced by Washington state and shipped directly to China.
