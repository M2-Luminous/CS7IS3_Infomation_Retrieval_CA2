"The ruling is illegal and valueless," Duran-Ballen stated while announcing that the new price structure, in effect since 29 January, "will not be revised." The ruling of the Constitutional Court, which is controlled by the opposition parties, would have been implemented immediately, halting price increases on several fuels announced by the government to compensate for fiscal revenue losses brought about by the fall of international crude oil prices. Today, however, prices remain at the same levels as before "because there is no reason to alter them," as explained by Interior Minister Marcelo Santos. The minister accused the opposition of "cheap maneuvers" by requesting a declaration of unconstitutionality against the price increase because the opposition claims it was done by creating new taxes, an attribute that does not correspond to the government but is limited to only Congress. The government's challenge came about as a result of the Constitutional Court's irregular structure. The mandate of its members, which was scheduled to end December 1992, was extended. Under this configuration, the court did not obtain the mandatory five votes that would have suspended the price increase. On Friday, National Congress President Samuel Belletini, "representing the government," unexpectedly swore-in a lawyer as the new court magistrate. This same lawyer had been appointed by former President Rodrigo Borja but had never assumed his responsibilities because at that time he did not have the required minimum age. The current administration, which came to office in 1992, did not appoint its representative to the court because it was waiting for a complete reorganization, which was scheduled to take place in December 1992. In a swift court decision taken last night (local time), the new court magistrate provided the necessary fifth vote allowing the fuel increase to be declared unconstitutional. The fuel price increase caused two weeks of violent street protests, especially in Quito. In addition, a workers strike and an Indian mobilization were also declared. New protest marches against the fuel increase have already been announced for this coming Wednesday, after the long carnival holidays. Following the court's decision and the government's challenge, we foresee that the opposition parties, which control the Ecuadoran Congress, will react harshly to these events.
