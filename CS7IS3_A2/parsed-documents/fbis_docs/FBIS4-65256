On Tuesday evening [10 May], during his television speech and when he did not yet know the exact number of portfolios held by the neofascists, French President Francois Mitterrand "regretted" their presence while recognizing "the Italians' right to choose." "The first right to be respected," he stressed, is that of a "people who have given large numbers of votes to the neofascist party. I regret it, but I recognize the Italians' right to choose, especially in view of the fact that this neofascist party does not have a majority and I do not think that this party can determine Italian policy." "We must," he concluded, "educate, advise, and speak in a friendly way to the Italians, and I think it is nonsensical for us to declare a `ban' on them." This is a viewpoint which surprises Charles Millon. "I think Francois Mitterrand was surprisingly moderate," the chairman of the UDF [French Democratic Union] National Assembly group stressed yesterday. As a member of the Foreign Affairs Commission, he wants to go further: "The European Union [EU] was built on a scale of values and on a concept of human rights which refers to notions of freedom, equality, and respect for the individual." Consequently, he "wants and demands that the Italian president should guarantee the Italian Government's respect for these values." However, like former Socialist minister Jack Lang, Charles Million "is not calling for the boycott or ostracism (of the neofascist ministers), but for respect for European values." For his part, Dominique Baudis, head of the united UDF-RPR [Rally for the Republic] list for the European elections, said in a communique that the ministers of the other 11 EU countries will have to be "extremely vigilant with regard to the representatives of the Italian extreme Right. The entry into the Italian Government of neofascist representatives is an event, the gravity of which must be gauged." While the RPR leadership remained silent on the subject, there were many statements at Socialist Party [PSF] headquarters on the "danger" presented by the presence of neofascists. Jack Lang, former culture minister, expressed the hope in LIBERATION on Tuesday that "through diplomacy, the French Government will make it known that the French counterparts of the neofascist ministers will not establish relations with them." Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, PSF secretary for external relations, yesterday called for a boycott and the establishment of an "exclusion zone." As for First Secretary Michel Rocard, he "greatly regretted that Italy has done this," but stressed that it was necessary "to remember that the election was democratic" and that "this is clearly a majority choice by the Italian people. Nobody has the right to dictate to others." [passage omitted]
