Appearing before the Joint Standing Committee on Finance, he said both the IEC and TEC did not have budgets approved by Parliament, and therefore there was no over-spending on specific allocations. Mr Smit was replying to a question by Mr David Graaff (NP) [National Party] on over-spending by the IEC and TEC. He said the IEC, funded from the budget of the Department of Home Affairs, had received R119 million [rand] from the 1993/94 budget and R128.5 million from the department's 1994/95 allocation. The IEC had then requested an additional R700 million, bringing its total allocation to R948.3 million. The TEC had received R7.5 million from the 1993/94 home affairs budget and R8.4 million in 1994/95 -- a total of R15.9 million.
