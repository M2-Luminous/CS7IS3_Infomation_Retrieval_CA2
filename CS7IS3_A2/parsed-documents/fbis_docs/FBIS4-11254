This is how Brazilians would vote if the presidential election were held today. Ibope considered three possible candidates for the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, PMDB. Here are the figures: If the election were held today, according to Ibope, Workers Party candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva would be first with 34 percent of the votes; Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party would be second with 17 percent; former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola of the Democratic Labor Party would be third with 9 percent; former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia -- if he were the PMDB candidate -- would be fourth with 6 percent; Senator Espiridiao Amin of the Progressive Renewal Party would be fifth with 3 percent; and Liberal Party candidate Flavio Rocha would be sixth with 2 percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and void ballots, would total 29 percent. Let us now see what would be the electoral outcome if the PMDB candidate were Senator and former President Jose Sarney: In this case, if the election were held today, Lula would be first with 31 percent; Cardoso would be second with 16 percent; Sarney would be third with 13 percent; Brizola would be fourth with 8 percent; Amin would be fifth with 3 percent; and Rocha would be sixth with 2 percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and void ballots would total 27 percent. If the PMDB candidate were former Parana Governor Roberto Requiao, the electoral outcome would be as follows: Lula would remain in first place with 34 percent; Cardoso would be second with 17 percent; Brizola would be third with 10 percent; Amin and Requiao would be joint fourth with 3 percent, and Rocha would be at the bottom of the list with 2 percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would be 27 percent. The Ibope survey also inquired how Brazilians would vote in a runoff election among the most voted candidates during the first round. Four possible alternatives were considered. Here are the results: A runoff between Lula and Cardoso: Lula would obtain 44 percent and Cardoso 32 percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would total 24 percent. A runoff between Lula and Sarney: Lula would obtain 44 percent and Sarney 31 percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would total 25 percent. A runoff between Lula and Quercia: Lula would obtain 51 percent and Quercia would obtain 19 percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would total 30 percent. A runoff between Lula and Requiao: Lula would obtain 52 percent and Requiao would obtain 17 percent. The rate of undecided voters, blank and voided ballots would total 31 percent. Ibope also asked voters who would be the best candidate for the PMDB. Senator Sarney is first with 37 percent, Quercia is second with 18 percent, and Requiao is third with 11 percent. A total of 36 percent of those polled stated that they have no preference among these candidates. Ibope also asked voters for whom they would not vote under any circumstance. Brizola appeared as the most rejected candidate. Here are the figures: According to Ibope, 49 percent of those polled said they would never vote for Brizola; 34 percent said they would not vote for Quercia; 31 percent would not vote for Lula or Rocha; 30 percent would not vote for Amin; 29 percent would not vote for Sarney; 27 percent would not vote for Requiao; and 21 percent would not vote for Cardoso. Some 7 percent of those polled said they have nothing against any of these candidates while 9 percent declined to state their opinion. Ibope polled 2,000 voters nationwide between 13 and 17 April.
