It was natural for one to hope that the government would show some alertness and efforts would be made to save the nation from negative outcomes of the open market policy. However, it appears that the government has learned a very different lesson after protecting it from the fire test of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) questioning. Here is one example. The announcement to transfer State Bank chief G.B. Ramakrishna to Planning Commission was an open submission of the finance ministry to the stock exchange broker's demands. Why did this happen? It happened because these brokers opposed Mr. Ramakrishna's efforts to control and restrain the anarchy in trading and laundering black money in the stock market. The warning given by Mr. Ramniwas Mirdha, the head of the JPC, was accurate and timely. He had said that, "It was important to implement strict guidelines while economic reforms are carried out. Otherwise, there would be unlimited and uncontrollable grief." He had made it clear that due to the lack of monitoring system in the economic system, the open market approach might result in something like the Pratibhuti fraud. We need to remember the fact in this context that the JPC had approved all the State Bank activities carried out under Ramakrishna's leadership. In this context, removal of Ramakrishna from the State Bank gives birth to the fear that the government is giving us wrong signals and that signal is that the government will try to appease the brokers even at the cost of losing investments. This is the pre-experience of these reforms that will be implemented in economic and banking areas and about which the finance minister and the prime minister had assured us in the Parliament. Within one week after the debate on the JPC report in the Parliament, the cabinet exposed another side of the Manmohan Singh economics. He had assured six foreign investors that they will make profits in electricity area. This has not been done since the East India Company. At that time, arrangements were made to make sure that the British investors make profit in the British-owned railways system. No one has benefitted from such an extraordinary exemption since then. This government action will not only be called an act to remove all the hurdles faced by foreign investors but will be counted as an exemption given to foreign investors that was never made available to our own industries. This action clearly indicates a special preference for foreign investments in the Manmohan Singh economics. This should be called a major discrepancy in our country's economic strategy. Under the present system, internationalization means unequal treatment of foreign and Indian investments, and special partisanship toward foreign investors. This bias in which foreign investments are favored over internal investments can definitely be called a new form of economic colonialism. The economic reasoning given in support of this action cannot deceive the people now. It is said that the government will be more able to invest money in social programs with the foreign investments. This argument is totally dishonest because the assurance of profit given to the foreign investors will require cutting development money from the state in question. First, the foreign investors have been promised 16 percent profit and this will be paid in dollars. Second, the electricity generated by these foreign companies will not cost less then three rupees per unit, which is three times more expensive than the one rupee rate at present. It is clear that in order to make the promised 16 percent profit to the foreign investors, they will exploit the state government on the one side and on the other side, the consumers will have to bear the burden of 300 percent increase in electricity price. In the light of these facts, it is clear that the government is avoiding telling the people the real meaning of government's submission in front of the foreign companies. Any democratic government is expected to present such a proposal for approval at the legislative level as it calls for a major change in policy. This main change is not about the question of open market, but of giving special treatment to foreign investors. These are special privileges which have not been provided to internal investors. Heavy dependence on foreign debts is on one side and assurance of profit to foreign investors is on the other side. Do we need to do anything else to mortgage our country's economic future? The JPC has clearly established that foreign banks have played a decisive role in both the Pratibhuti fraud and the stock market fraud. In such a situation, any self-respecting government is expected to take action against these foreign banks to stop their mischievous act. The finance minister had also promised during the debate on the JPC report in the House that he will not allow these banks to take away the profits made in the Pratibhuti fraud case. However, the finance ministry has not taken any concrete step to regulate the activities of these foreign banks operating here. It would be foolish to expect the finance ministry to take action against the banks operating here because of its favorable leaning toward these banks. Keeping in mind its leaning and its record, we can expect it to support and defend the foreign banks at any cost. The finance ministry under the leadership of Manmohan Singh has set its mind to help the interests of foreign investors over protecting our country's interests and self-respect. In this atmosphere of derogatory and insulting submission to foreign investors, the finance ministry has opened another area to foreign investors through the Malhotra Commission report in which privatization of insurance industry has been lauded. The social goals inherent in nationalization of the Life Insurance Corporation soon will be forgotten. After implementing this plan, the next target of Dr. Manmohan Singh definitely will be the banks. After privatization of these banks, the work of driving another nail in the coffin of mixed economy will be complete. At this rate, the railways should also be in the list of privatization, and if this happens, the foreign investors will be receiving a major award. If the public sector is facing this fate, why should we deprive the maharajahs of their privy purses? During this time, some indications of the worries that our economic system will cause have surfaced. The average rate of industrial growth is stuck at 2 percent for the last three years. This rate during the 80s was 8 or 9 percent. The rate of growth of investment property is at the level of 12 percent. There has been no significant increase in the earnings from imports. The praise of our finance minister being lavished by national and foreign investors cannot assure whether his February budget will be welcomed warmly. It is possible that the major investors will be given new tax incentives, but what will be done for the masses who make the majority of our democracy? If Manmohan Singh tries to implement his policy for which he has expressed his commitment to the World Bank, he would be putting the existence of this government in danger.
