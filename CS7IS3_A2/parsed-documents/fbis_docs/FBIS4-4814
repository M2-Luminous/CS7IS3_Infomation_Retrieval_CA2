Norodom Sihanouk said he had the highest honour of visiting again the DPRK in auspicious April greeting the birthday of President Kim Il-song. He further said: Having been seriously ill and hospitalised between early October 1993 and late February 1994, after my election as King of Cambodia in September 1993 by the beloved people of Cambodia, I am extremely happy and profoundly moved and honored to have returned today beside Your Excellency who accord me the supreme honour by considering me forever your close anti-imperialist comrade-in-arms and your own brother. This is my greatest happiness. The forthcoming April 15 will be a very glorious historic day marking the 82nd birthday of Your Excellency, that the nation and patriotic people of Korea within and without it will celebrate with the greatest fervour and the greatest enthusiasm. With our brothers and sisters of Korea, the Cambodian people and all the other anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist, anti-neocolonialist, anti-dominationist and anti-expansionist progressive peoples aspiring after justice and freedom are full of joy and pride to celebrate your august birthday and render a vibrant hommage to Your Excellency the Great Leader who are the greatest hero in Korea's history of thousands of years, the great and immortal father of the chuche idea and the greatest champion of the just cause of the Third World peoples fighting against the injustice and menace from certain big powers and against underdevelopment and for progress, freedom, independence, territorial integrity, non-alignment and peace in mutual respect and equality between all countries, big and small. Your Excellency Generalissimo President Kim Il-song are and will be the irreplaceable champion of this just cause. We sincerely hope that Your Excellency will live more than a hundred years for the greatest happiness of the nation and valiant people of Korea and for that of us all and all peoples who are indefectibly attached to Your Excellency the Great Leader and who are united with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the unique symbol of the independence of Korea. Thanks to the wise leadership of His Excellency President Kim Il-song and His Excellency Marshal Kim Chong-il, the DPRK has turned into a veritable paradise on Earth for the greatest happiness and prosperity of the Korean people and a great military power, modern and invincible, Norodom Sihanouk noted, and continued: Your formidable military power fully supports and will support the cause of peace in your geographical region and the rest of the whole world. At present, certain foreign powers threatening peace in this region and world peace are posing unjust threat to the DPRK. As king and head of state of Cambodia, I have the honour of expressing my full and invariable support to Your Excellency the Great Leader and to the DPRK not only in the important process of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea but also in the present dramatic situation in which the DPRK has the absolute reason to defend with greatest fortitude its right to be "the sole master of its own home" and of expressing my total rejection to all foreign interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK whose military policy is and will be purely defensive. Between 1955 and 1969, the Kingdom of Cambodia worked to firmly defend its legitimate frontiers and its complete independence and repulse all the attempts of interference in its internal affairs on the part of certain foreign powers. They did not allow its uncompromising spirit of independence and this led to the coup d'etat of Lon Nol on March 18, 1970 and the ensuing great war (1970-1975). Today the danger of war is grave in the region in which the DPRK is situated and consequently in East Asia and Far East, nay, in all our Asia. In this regard, the DPRK has committed no fault. It only defended uncompromisingly its sacred right to complete independence in its own territory and the pancha shila of bandung and the five principles of peaceful coexistence, including non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. Your Excellency the Great Leader revered and beloved by the Korean people have declared that the DPRK will not attack or invade anyone. The DPRK has the right to defend itself from the attack or aggression of another country or administration. The fidelity of the DPRK to peace and the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the 10-point programme of Korean reunification is indisputable and should be appreciated for its just high courage by the United Nations organisation and others. Cambodia and I stand and will always stand for this peace and the five principles and 10-point programme. We Cambodian people will invariably solidarize with Your Excellency the Great Leader and the glorious DPRK.
