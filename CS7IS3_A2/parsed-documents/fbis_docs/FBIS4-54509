We asked General Major Oldrich Barta, engineer, who heads the Main Office for Material and Technical Support at the Ministry of Defense, what lay behind this general statement. [Marek] What kind of equipment will the Army of the Czech Republic require in the immediate future? [Barta] The concept of equipping the Army of the Czech Republic was entrusted to the Department for Development of Equipment at the Ministry of Defense. It will not be possible to finalize the concept until all political interrelated questions are clarified. The equipping of our Army must be in line with even the latest facts, such as, for example, the Partnership for Peace. [Marek] Nevertheless, it is reported that working out of that concept should not take longer than the fall of this year. [Barta] We expect that by fall we could already have some data collected. I personally feel, however, that we will require more time to put together the entire concept. [Marek] Under these conditions, how long will actual modernization take? [Barta] It should be realized by the year 2005. Even some key programs have been planned with that date in mind. [Marek] How much money will modernization require? [Barta] At present, annual expenditures for the Army amount to 2.5 percent of the national income. We must unequivocally state that this amount of resources is inadequate. Modernization, particularly that of the Air Force and other technical components, is financially very demanding. But the answer to this highly complicated question must be sought not only at the specialized level but also at the economic and particularly the political levels. [Marek] There are many discussions regarding the purposeful distribution of the military budget. Which part of it should be allocated to modernization? [Barta] Of course, it would be desirable for it to be the largest percentage. In my view, it would involve about one-third of the budget. [Marek] What will be the phases of modernization? What is considered to be a priority? [Barta] The priorities have generally been identified. They involve systems of command and control so we could communicate with the NATO armies. Then there are the information systems, in both logistics and command structures. Next are the reconnaissance systems and, of course, the rapid-deployment brigade. For me to list those priorities in a more specific manner, I would have to base my statement on the defense strategy. And, for the time being, that has not been precisely outlined. [Marek] Should that process be primarily shared by Czech armaments manufacturers, or are express purchases of weapon systems from abroad even being contemplated? [Barta] I repeat once more: It is not a question of rearming but, rather, a question of modernization. For the present, we are not contemplating any new deliveries of weapon systems. We intend merely to modernize existing gear and equipment. If some new project has come to light, it is exclusively based on domestic production. [Marek] Does that mean that the RDP Group, which is an association of Czech armament manufacturers, will have the green light with our Army? [Barta] We have created certain principles for ourselves in terms of acquisitions activities. We are making contact with the RDP Group just like with every other entity. Of course, we perceive the RDP Group as a component of a specific Czech armaments industry. But that is all. [Marek] I will ask the question more specifically: What hope for utilization in our Army is there, for example, for the Skoda-Plzen idea to modernize the T-72 tank? [Barta] We told the RDP Group that we will not stand in its way in modernizing any kind of gear. We will be announcing requests for proposals, and, if the RDP Group comes up with a project that will be interesting for the Army of the Czech Republic, it will, of course, be realized. [Marek] And what about, for example, the modernized modification of the Albatross? Are you figuring on it for our Air Force? [Barta] The Albatross is a subsonic aircraft that is a training aircraft at present. Although a specific combat version is being considered, it would have to be augmented by the addition of at least more high-tech equipment--in other words, it would have to be made supersonic. [Marek] Could you at least indicate what type of gear will have to be purchased from abroad in the immediate future--what will definitely be beyond the capabilities of our armaments industry? [Barta] Because the army of 2005 has not been defined (but only that of 1995), it is very difficult to answer that question. But I think we certainly will not be manufacturing tanks. It is quite possible that we will not even need them. At present, I am unable to answer that question. We will certainly be buying some small numbers of materiel and equipment abroad, items domestic industry will not be producing. [Marek] It is said that defense capability is not exclusively the Army's. It is said that it also involves the armaments industry. Is there not the threat, in the event of an actual conflict of some kind, that we would be cut off from possible service from abroad? [Barta] Our Army will be small in numbers but will have high-quality equipment. The armaments industry will be smaller but of peak quality. It will certainly be made up of manufacturers of aviation systems and munitions. It will be an industry that will assure the stability of the Czech Republic and will exclude precisely what you have just defined. No country can afford to be dependent on the delivery of decisive spare parts and munitions from abroad. [Marek] But our Army is predominantly equipped with former Soviet equipment. Are we not exposed to a certain risk, given the current instability in the territory of the CIS? [Barta] Although our equipment is originally Soviet, it was manufactured predominantly by license, for the most part in Slovakia. At the present time, we have certain spare parts, certain stockpiles. We have nothing to fear in that direction. Moreover, the fabrication of some spare parts is possible even on the part of a non-Russian supplier. I have in mind, for example, Ukraine, Poland. [Marek] How do you view the possibility of purchasing secondhand weapon systems from the U.S. Army? [Barta] I personally believe that, at a time when we are downsizing the amount of gear and equipment, there is no reason to purchase used cheaper equipment. Even so, it is expensive for us, and, moreover, systems would have to be finalized to accommodate it. For example, the purchase of aircraft alone solves nothing in and of itself. You have to support the training system, you have to provide trainers, ground support, etc.
