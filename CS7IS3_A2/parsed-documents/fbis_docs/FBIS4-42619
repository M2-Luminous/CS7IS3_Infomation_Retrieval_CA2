In the last few days, the debate on the subject of a successor has called up many emotions, some of them old ones. The office of EU Commission chief, at the head of Europe, is more important today than it was 10 years ago when Delors took up office -- not just because the Frenchman himself has set new standards for European unity, but also because the Brussels leadership has assumed greater political significance, not least because this year is the first time that the European parliament must approve the new EU Commission chief in accordance with the Maastricht treaty. Notwithstanding this, activities in Brussels will continue to be in the limelight because the constant EU expansion calls for further reforms, despite the widespread Europe-weariness of the citizens. Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, and Jean-Luc Dehaene, his Belgian counterpart, both of them Christian Democrats, are two serious candidates for Delors' post. Irishman Peter Sutherland, former EU secretary for economic competition issues, and a successful GATT general secretary linked to the Uruguay Round of talks, might also stand a chance as a sort of compromise. The significance of Sir Leon Brittan, former British secretary of state for foreign trade, lies in his own ambition. Whoever is appointed as the new EU Commission chief, who would normally have to wait six months before assuming his new office, must be viewed in the light of numerous other personnel appointments, such as that of the new OECD general secretary, a new head of the Western European Union, a new chairman of the EU Council, and a chief of the new World Trade Organization. What is certain is that German conduct in the question of a successor of Delors' has caused undue sharp tones in the debate. At quite an early stage, Bonn let it be known that, with France, it was lending its support to the Belgian Dehaene, from whom one expects a determined course of integration and who, during his country's duty presidency of the EU in the second half of 1993, proved himself to be a master of the art of reaching a compromise in talks. Lubbers, on the other hand, will long be negatively remembered for his hesitation during the Brussels candidacy, as well as for his misinformed remarks about Dutch problems caused by German unity. What speaks in favor of Lubber's chairmanship of the EU Commission is that his country has never been duty president of the EU, apart from a six-month interim chairmanship held by the well-known Agriculture Commissioner Sicco Manshot; has only just surrendered its chairmanship of the European Monetary Union to Germany; and has otherwise not been given very generous treatment regarding the tenure of other EU posts. In the last few days, Lubbers has taken the offensive and with reference to the old fears in the smaller EU countries, has stubbornly affirmed his candidacy. By supporting Dehaene, Paris and Bonn might be expressing their disapproval of The Hague's courtship of the British, who are not willing to integrate. It will be difficult for Bonn to escape this cul-de-sac without any damage.
