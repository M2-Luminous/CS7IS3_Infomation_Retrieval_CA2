The ruling Congress suffered a severe setback today as it could win only two Rajya Sabha seats against the expected three. The voting pattern not only revealed disunity between the erstwhile JD(G) [Janata Dal-Gujarat] and the `original' Congress but massive cross-voting in favour of the Opposition BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]. The BJP won the other two seats though it had a strength of only 67 in the House of 178, enough to get only one. The party managed 24 `extra' votes and its little known nominee, Mr. Kanaksinh Mangrola topped the four winners with 49 votes. The party favourite, Ms. Anandiben Patel got 42 votes and stood second. Two votes were declared invalid. The Congress stalwart, Mr. Madhavsinh Solanki retained his seat with 33 votes and his runner-up, Mr. Raju Parmar maintained his seat with 28 votes. The third candidate, Mr. J.V. Shah could get only 25 and lost the battle. With the support of nine independents and a lone member of the Lok Swaraj Manch, the Congress strength of 98 had officially got augmented to 108. Jolt to Urmila The defeat of Mr. Shah, a hot favourite of the former JD(G) controlling 66 votes in the CLP [Congress-I Legislature Party], is considered to be a severe jolt to the claim of Ms. Urmila Patel, to succeed her late husband, Chimanbhai Patel. If the talk in the lobby of the Assembly is any indication in the light of the poll outcome, then the Congress is in deep trouble. The JD(G) faction has already served an ultimatum to the party high command that under no circumstances would they accept a leader who did not belong to their ranks. On this point, the two feuding claimants of the faction, the second being the interim Chief Minister, Mr. Chhabildas Mehta, are united. The ruling party has now two options. It should either dissolve the House and impose President's rule to enable the party prepare for the general elections, due next winter or just instal a compromise candidate, winning over a substantial number of JD(G) legislators promising them tickets. The BJP is overjoyed. The party had worked overtime to entice the disgruntled elements and to particularly win the three votes of the Janata Dal (VP Singh). "The Congress with its just 32 votes has bagged two seats and the JD(G) with its 66 votes has got nothing," said the party's poll manager and deputy leader, Mr. Suresh Mehta while stressing that the Government is now a minority one.
