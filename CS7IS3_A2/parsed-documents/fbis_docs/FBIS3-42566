Dzhokhar Dudayev Unmasks the Culprits in All Troubles"] [Text] [Dzhanashiya] Dzhokhar, the situation in Chechnya is very aggravated... [Dudayev] We have operational data to the effect that the secret chancery has prepared a scenario that will unfold within days. Here, in Groznyy, they kill, slash, and bayonet, and do nothing else. We should make a choice: Either to lead the nations to rebuff any aggression that the personnel of the secret, dark imperial chancery are preparing, or surrender voluntarily into colonial slavery for yet another century. There is nothing in between in this instance. The supreme command of all special services, including the Armed Forces, and Yeltsin's team have developed a scenario for a blockade and stepped-up terrorism and subversion within Chechnya, with combat action beginning subsequently. There are some young gung-ho generals who are saying: "I will enter Chechnya!" However, they should be asked how they will withdraw. They have already entered Chechnya and Afghanistan many times, but they have withdrawn badly. They have withdrawn very badly. [Dzhanashiya] With some justification, they are apprehensive about the "first shot" in Chechnya, where the blood-feud tradition is strong and there are many weapons. [Dudayev] An assessment of the situation, a projection, an analysis, and a civic position--and in this case, there should be no shooting, no woes, and no tears. This is the strongest weapon of the time. Moscow is stuffing all republics of the Caucasus with weapons on all pretexts for subversion and for fueling wars. Later, disinformation is spread to the effect that the weapons came from Chechnya, as if they were produced here rather than in Russia. Chechnya itself fights the importation of weapons, fights thousands of units of weapons, drugs, and funds. These weapons are being spread in precisely the same manner throughout the Caucasus--everybody is being stuffed with nuclear charges. The secret chancery is perfecting the fueling of enmity between peoples along national, territorial, ethnic, cultural, and spiritual lines. There will be no mercy, just as there has been none to date. The last aggressive forces of the imperial chancery have put everything at stake to maintain totalitarianism at any price, to break the will of democracy for a normal life among the nations in this imperfect world by the methods of intimidation, physical violence, terror, subversion, and provocations. This is my position, and may the Almighty grant us that everything will be brighter then I expect. [Dzhanashiya] Do you have specific, substantiated complaints about the leadership of Russia? [Dudayev] We should grasp clearly that methods used by the so-called "new democratic forces" are so sophisticated and perfidious that the mentality of a Soviet man is not prepared for them. When Yeltsin and his team fought the empire of the USSR, all nations of the Caucasus, and not just the Caucasus, supported these endeavors. This is how democracy won. The nations of the Caucasus stood in the same ranks with democracy, and many manned the barricades. It was a most profound delusion that days of a democratic thaw would come as soon as the Supreme Soviet, which was so easily and simply shot up, became a thing of the past. It turns out that a draft of the new constitution, new far-fetched elections were being prepared in the dark offices contrary to all common sense and laws of human community. These elections are not legitimate in any way based on a multitude of attributes of international law, absolutely not legitimate. Their objective is simple: to suppress the will of Caucasians through the force of physical pressure so that they will obey the dictatorship of power of the new empire. It is no accident that a few days ago a film about the training of the internal troops was shown on TV in which it was blasphemously announced that these guys had been in Khodzhaly, Tajikistan, and Ingushetia. There were the same painted mugs, the same bad element, the same brutal faces covered from the camera, the same scenario. We should decide: either civil courage, or slavery; and we should make this decision in the most severe times of provocations, subversion, and terror on an immense scale, emanating from the secret black chancery of the former empire. This chancery has no intention of sparing the nations, including the Russian, in order to once again throw the people on their knees at any price, and onto the path of a totalitarian regime in a new cycle of so-called democracy. I will venture to assure you--no mercy will be shown. Such are the realities. [Dzhanashiya] Do you have specific constructive proposals for improving relations with Russia? [Dudayev] My specific proposals are outlined in the book Thorny Path to Freedom, which has been published. The main point is the recognition of the independence of Chechnya. [Dzhanashiya] What is your attitude toward the CNC [Confederation of the Nations of the Caucasus]? [Dudayev] This is the only force that has stabilized the situation in the entire Caucasus to some degree, and I attach great hopes to it. I raised at a CNC congress the issue of granting the status of Supreme Soviet deputies of their republics to members of the CNC parliament in the republics of Northern Caucasus. [Dzhanashiya] Most nations of the CNC are in favor of staying within Russia. At the same time, you are resolutely fighting for independence. Is there not a contradiction? [Dudayev] Oh no. The expression of the will of the people should be the foundation. If a nation wants to belong to Russia--Godspeed! If the Chechens do not want to, there should be "Godspeed" too! However, it is very hard to be together with the current Russia, in which subversion, terrorism, and provocation have been elevated to the rank of a state policy. I do not know who voluntarily wants to go there, into such a Russia. Let Russia achieve legitimacy and democratic legal institutions, let it become capable of respecting its own laws, primarily within itself, and later it will be possible to conduct a dialogue with it concerning mutual relations. [Dzhanashiya] To your mind, what are the prospects for the development of the Caucasus situation? [Dudayev] The Caucasus is, after all, the oldest civilization on the globe in the last 50 million years. The civilization of the future should belong to it. It is precisely the nations of the Caucasus that have preserved the ages-old traditions of morality, spirituality, humanity, philanthropy, tactfulness, and intellect. The Almighty is preserving this genetic pool in order to regulate normal relations in the future. The stimulator of mutual relations for the world is here, in the Caucasus. All of this through freedom. Freedom is the loftiest possession of man.
