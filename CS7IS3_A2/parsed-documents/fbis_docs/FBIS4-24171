We get the impression that the first stage of your operation is first and foremost, a diplomatic one: You have tried to convince the people you met that you were coming with good intentions. [Lafourcade] Listen, we have begun to carry out the mission entrusted to us by the United Nations, the mission that is to put an end to the massacres in Rwanda, and we are also setting up a system that, as you can see, is a large-scale one. It will take a few days to set up this system, but we did not want to wait until we went to Rwanda to go on the first reconnaissance missions to refugee camps and start showing our faces in order to put an end to the massacres. I believe that this mission has been going well so far. [D'Arvor] Do you intend to go further, for instance, as far as Kigali? [Lafourcade] My UN mandate--that is, Resolution 929--does not require me to go to Kigali. My mandate is to put an end to the massacres by using force if necessary against those troublemakers who carried out all those crimes. I am starting by discovering refugee camps. We are seeing what is what there so that humanitarian organizations can see what the situation is like.... [D'Arvor, interrupting] If need be, could you evacuate them? [Lafourcade] For the time being, there has not been any talk of evacuation at my level, but humanitarian organizations in the background are going to take care of this problem, and we have in our force a unit that is dealing with this problem, together with the humanitarian organizations. [D'Arvor] It is obvious that your mission is to be the link until the arrival of the UN troops. Is your mandate--the precise mandate of the French forces--really going to end at the end of July, as has been said, or as the prime minister has said? [Lafourcade] You know that some foreign countries are currently willing to take part in this UN force which will be called UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] II. In the mandate that I have received from the United Nations--that France has received from the United Nations--there was a delay spanning about two months. I do not know how this increase has come about, but I think that, together with General Dallaire--who is in Kigali and is currently the commander of the UNAMIR I force--we will organize the hand over of the baton. [D'Arvor] Thank you very much, General Lafourcade.
