The chemical industry and a number of EU [European Union] nations will permit drinking water to contain toxins, as long as it does not harm humans. Denmark has said no to more toxins in the waters. But Danish scientists maintain this position is unreasonable. "Never drink water," said W.C. Fields, who would never have dreamed of mixing a drop of the stuff into his shot glass of whiskey. The Danes were not listening. They drink several billion liters of it each year. All in good conscience. For, as long as there have been humans on this earth, clean groundwater has been a given as profound as life itself. Yet, even as the second millennium is humming its final refrain, the conception of this pristine necessity of life has been challenged by something resembling the first bar of the virgin spring's swan song. The threat arises from chemicals leached from old industrial sites and nitrates from the use of agricultural fertilizer. To this may be added new information about raw water that arrives at water purification plants polluted with pesticides. Denmark's Geological Survey (DGU) has just published this finding in a report on the state of the groundwater. How great is the threat? Have they found quantities in the groundwater so minuscule they are incapable of causing harm? Is the perception of pollution in reality a deception perpetrated by instruments so sensitive they (to use a scientist's words) could measure Napoleon's urine production on an anxious morning at the front? Can Denmark and Europe sacrifice with equanimity the principle of uncontaminated groundwater for the sake of maintaining our present-day intensive and industrialized agricultural operations? Or is the discovery of toxic sprays and nitrates in the groundwater so alarming that agriculture must accustom itself to the use of much less fertilizer and poisons? That is a question that will occupy an important place on the EU agenda in the coming year. Pressure on the EU Billions and billions of kroner are at issue. The chemicals industry is afraid that restrictions on the use of pesticides will cause their profits to plummet. And many governments in EU countries have so much difficulty in achieving the requirement of zero-contaminated groundwater that they are facing extraordinary expenditure for water purification, if the regulations are not relaxed. It is estimated that 25 billion kroner will be used in Denmark over the course of 30 to 100 years for cleaning up old dump sites and industrial locales. Purification of water or the relocation of water wells because of the nitrate and pesticide content in reservoirs is expected to cost the society an additional billion. Reflecting the concerns of agriculture, the economy, and the environment, the dilemma has taken the form of an assault upon two EU directives. A number of member countries are demanding that the regulations on certification of plant toxins and protection of the groundwater be relaxed. The main argument being advanced is that it is all right for groundwater to contain traces of pesticides when it is a question of harmless quantities. Following an Irish initiative, the Belgian chairmanship shortly before Christmas made the proposal that the World Health Organization's water quality standards, rather than the principle of zero contamination, should be applied to pesticides in drinking water. Ireland, Great Britain, France, Spain, and Belgium support this proposal. If they are to avoid billions in expenditure for purification, threshold values will have to be set at a level they can achieve, according to one of the main arguments. The push for more relaxed regulations for pesticides in drinking water has come at a time when the EU's fifth environmental program is advocating stronger protection of groundwater and a lower consumption of pesticides. It also comes at a time when the EU heads of state have auspiciously announced "that the major battles on behalf of the environment will be won or lost during the course of this decade." The official Danish position is as clear as uncontaminated drinking water. More relaxed regulations will be a major setback. But Danish scientists are posing the question whether healthwise it is even reasonable for Denmark to insist upon the principle of uncontaminated drinking water. Critical Scientists Associate Professor Erik Arvin of the Laboratory for Technical Hygiene at Denmark's Technical University is one of the critical voices: "Pesticides in the microscopic quantities found in Danish groundwater are not harmful. However, Danish environmental policy in the groundwater issue is determined almost exclusively by what it is technically feasible to measure. The attitude is, if it can be measured, it's toxic. ``An ordinary halt in traffic causes the ingestion of 30 to 40 times the concentration of chlorinated solvent as is found in groundwater. And a public pool is a downright gas chamber viewed from this perspective,'' he said. Veterinarian Bent Fenger, director of WHO's European Water and Sewage Office, dared to lay his head on the block when it came to the health and scientific threshold values the organization has established for chemicals in drinking water. Although the values are up to 1,000 times higher than the existing threshold values of 0.1 microgram (in principle, zero), he guaranteed them to be so safe that human health is not an issue as long as the values are not exceeded. This would hold true even if there were many different substances present in the water at the same time. "The threshold values build upon a thorough scientific documentation of materials with built-in safety factors of up to 100,000," said Fenger. Pesticides and Cancer In some of the scientific investigations on pesticides under discussion, one may read that many of these substances are carcinogenic. This is true of a study published in 1992 by Dr. Flemming Lander, a Danish physician who studied occupational diseases. Lander demonstrated a frequency of up to five times the average number of cancer cases among gardeners. That is, among people who have frequent contact with pesticides. On the basis of his work with cancer patients and pesticides, Lander stated that, as far as health was concerned, it was playing the lottery to place threshold values on the pesticide content of drinking water. His study, which included 4,000 gardeners, did not mention types or doses of the pesticides the gardeners had been exposed to. But an organization under WHO, the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC), has recorded a number of pesticides that are potentially cancer causing. This includes, among others, five of the eight chemicals that DGU measured in treated water. "We register chemicals that have the ability to cause cancer. But our records do not tell what doses are necessary to cause it," said biologist Henrik Moller from IARC in Lyon. How much or how little of these substances must be present to cause cancer or other health problems has simply not been evaluated by Danish environment administrators. The idea that an evaluation of levels dangerous to health should supplant the guiding principle of zero contamination runs up against strong resistance from environmentalists. Finn Bro Rasmussen, chairman of the EU's advisory Environmental Chemicals Committee, considered it absurd to place one's fate in the hands of science in so basic a question as groundwater. And in the Danish Environmental Board, Gunver Bennekou, director of the Office of Preventive Means, agreed: "You can perhaps run a risk with food or medicine. Because those substances can quickly be removed if we learn something new. But with groundwater it is a question of an ongoing process over many years. In other words, our knowledge is of no use if we find out that we set our threshold values too high," she said. Anders Baekgaard, director of the Danish Purification Plant Association, said: "We would have considerable difficulty explaining to our consumers that they can feel easy about drinking water with toxic residues or solvents in it. But it is also a bad idea to relax quality standards in an area, like water, that is an important pillar in the maintenance of life itself." The People's Voice The voice of the people is as yet very meek. The battle over drinking water has so far not appealed to popular movements to anything like the same degree as the question of nuclear power did, for example. Danish environmental opinion on the subject has been virtually synonymous with agronomist Lone Albrektsen. She started the Greenpeace agricultural campaign. Ever since the organization shut down that aspect of its work, she has worked alone on her own to capture people's attention concerning the groundwater problem. Her main point is that the threat to the groundwater cannot be eliminated unless agriculture is radically transformed into an extensive and ecological operation. "If EU support to today's industrialized agriculture were to be given instead to ecological operations, ecological agriculture would pay for itself far better in the long run than conventional agriculture. At the same time, society would save the money for prevention of pollution that conventional agriculture generates. To slack off on environmental requirements for the sake of encouraging the current form of agriculture would be an unforgivable experiment with the health of our own and future generations," said Albrektsen.
