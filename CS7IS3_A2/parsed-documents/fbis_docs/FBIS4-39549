Commenting on the results of his two-day meetings with Estonian Foreign Ministry Vice Chancellor Raul Malk, Churkin hoped that the parties would agree that social guarantees be given to retired Russian servicemen living in Estonia. Churkin said there must be a special document for preventing possible tension between Tallinn and Moscow. The document must be realistic and conform with the highest standards in human rights, Churkin pointed out. Churkin did not rule out that Russian troops could be withdrawn from Estonia by August 31, 1994. Russia conditions the troop withdrawal with social guarantees for retired Russian servicemen in Estonia (there are about 11,000 of them). There are currently about 2,300 acting Russian servicemen in Estonia. Commenting on the recent statement by Estonian Defense Force Commander Aleksander Einseln saying that if the appropriate order were received, force might be used to push out Russian servicemen who would remain in Estonia after August 31, Churkin said, "We have absolutely no doubt that the position of Estonia consists in settlement of all problems by political means, through negotiations. The position of Russia is the same."
