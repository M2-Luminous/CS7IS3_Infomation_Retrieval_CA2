In the three months, Tianjin approved the establishment of 554 foreign-funded projects, involving a total investment of 1.4 billion U.S. dollars, figures available today show. The inflow of foreign funds has topped one billion U.S. dollars, representing an increase of 55.4 percent over the same period last year, an official from the municipal foreign trade and economic cooperation commission said. The official attributed the increase mainly to the improved investment environment in the city, and to the efforts made to improve services and simplify approval procedures. Over 70 big projects involving overseas investment were worked out and tracts of land were leased to foreign investors to develop in the city last year. So far, the number of the foreign-funded projects whose total investment surpasses five million U.S. dollars each has reached 38 this year, a hefty 52 percent rise over the same period last year. Among them, 27 topped 10 million U.S. dollars each. Foreign investment in real estate also gained the ground last year, with 35 newly-approved foreign-funded real estate projects and 170 million U.S. dollars of agreed overseas funds. The city also earned nearly 100 million U.S. dollars by leasing 9,900 sq m of land, the official said. It signed contracts for 38 new projects to renovate and upgrade old industrial enterprises. The move made it possible for 300 million U.S. dollars of overseas capital to be used in this aspect. The 1,220 operational foreign-funded firms in the city are reported to have completed 5.15 billion yuan in output value and 5.27 billion yuan in turnover, and created 590 million yuan in profits and taxes in the first quarter. Exports by these foreign-funded firms accounted for 27.9 percent of the city's total. In the first three months of this year 26 foreign-funded firms expanded their investment, and the amount of increased investment was more than 77 million U.S. dollars, including 32 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds. The city has newly added 400 projects this year to attract more foreign investment.
