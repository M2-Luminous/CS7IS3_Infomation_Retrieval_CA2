This is an important idea that Comrade Xiaoping has stressed many times in the process of leading reform and construction in our country, and is an important component of his theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is certainly of great immediate significance to study this concept of Comrade Xiaoping's in connection with the realities in our present reform, opening, and economic construction. I. Why is it necessary to stress the need of consolidating the authority of the central leadership while it is necessary to decontrol and enliven things in the course of developing the socialist market economy? Consolidating the authority of the central leadership is a need in the development of the socialist market economy. Although the market can play an effective role in the distribution of resources, it is not a panacea and has its own weaknesses and deficiencies. For example, it is hardly possible for the market to completely guarantee the balance between gross demand and gross supply in society, and this may cause periodic fluctuations in economic development; it is hard to maintain a reasonable order of competition within a short period of time; it can hardly solve the issues of infrastructural construction and environmental protection required by economic development; and it can hardly ensure fairness in the distribution of resources and wealth. The settlement of all these issues requires the government's necessary macrocontrol and management over market activities. Macrocontrol is, in essence, central control. Therefore, the authority of the central leadership must be consolidated. Consolidating the authority of the central leadership is a need in reform, opening, and economic invigoration. In view of the fact that some people were keen to adopt their own countermeasures against the policies laid down by the upper authorities in the course of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping seriously pointed out: "In order to make reform a success, we must carry it out in an orderly way under unified leadership. Otherwise, there will be disorder everywhere, and people will just go their own way. How could reform be successful under such circumstances?" He also said: "We must fix a principle. That is, reform should be carried out in depth under the unified leadership of the central authorities." China is a large country. Reform in such a large country will inevitably lead to the adjustment of interest relations in various aspects. At the same time, China is a developing country, and is facing such problems as an ill-coordinated production structure and an undergrown market, so we will inevitably encounter various difficulties when carrying out reform and establishing the socialist market economic structure if "the party Central Committee and the State Council lose their authority and cannot control the situation." In practice, our reform's successes were attributed to the fact that reform was carried out in an orderly way under unified leadership. According to different conditions, major reform measures were adopted after corresponding backup measures were ready in some cases, or after pilot schemes were carried out and successful experience was gained in other cases. This prevented a shock to society. For example, without the leadership of the party central body and the State Council and without the authority of the party central body and the State Council, the macrocontrol in 1993 would not have achieved the expected results. Consolidating the authority of the central leadership is a need in the correct handling of relations between localities and a need in accelerating our economic development. Ours is a large socialist country with vast territory, and local economic development is uneven. Reform and opening up enables the southeast coastal areas to give full play to their economic and geological advantages and to develop ahead of other areas, thus bringing along economic development in other localities. However, such uneven development is also directly related to the issue of local interests. In order to correctly handle such interest relations and settle such contradictions, there must be the authority of the central leading body. Comrade Xiaoping predicted this issue long ago, and pointed out that the early development of the coastal areas "will bring along better development in interior areas, and this is a matter concerning the overall situation. The interior localities should take the overall situation and overall interests into account. As development continues, the coastal areas will be required to make greater contributions to help the interior localities develop, and this is also an issue concerning the overall situation. At that moment, the coastal areas should also subject themselves to this overall interest. All this will not be possible if there is no central authority." Consolidating the authority of the central leadership is a need in giving play to the superiority of the socialist system and tiding over difficulties. When mentioning the superiority of the socialist system, Comrade Deng Xiaoping always linked it with the authority of the central leadership. He pointed out: "As compared with capitalism, socialism's superiority is reflected in the fact that the whole country can be coordinated as a chess game and strength can be concentrated to guarantee key projects." Ours is a socialism with the means of production mainly in public ownership, and the people share the same fundamental interests. The party and the government can concentrate the strength of the whole nation to arrange key projects in the national economy according to the long-term fundamental interests of the entire people. In times of difficulty, the party and the government can mobilize the strength of all quarters to overcome and tide over difficulties. For an economically backward large country, all this is indispensable. In view of the fact that too many "local lords" went their own ways and this made it impossible to make or carry out decisions on important matters, Comrade Deng Xiaoping sharply pointed out: "Nobody is allowed to disobey the instructions of the central leadership and the State Council. In particular, in times of difficulty, without the authority of the central leadership and the State Council, it is impossible to solve problems. With such authority, great accomplishments can still be made in times of difficulty. The authority cannot be denied, and centralization should be effected if necessary; otherwise, at the very least, time may be wasted." This year, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made sufficient preparations for the adoption of the new reform schemes. However, no reform scheme could be perfectly designed before it was put into practice, and the reform tasks remain arduous and complicated. In order to overcome the difficulties of structural reforms, the authority of the central leadership must be consolidated. This is an important guarantee for our efforts to further deepen reform and promote the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. II. By stressing the need to consolidate the authority of the central leadership, we do not mean that we should use the previous methods. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out long ago: "In the past, we just exercised management on the basis of poverty; now, things are different, and we are exercising macromanagement for the purpose of building a comparatively well-off society. We cannot continue to use the methods we used in the past when we were facing difficulties. Now the central authorities should issue instructions and wield power only on major issues and on issues concerning the general orientation." Here he explicitly pointed out the two different methods of consolidating central authority in the different periods. The content of consolidating the central authority has changed. In the past, the government was both manager and direct investor. It had to control the overall scale and structure of the economy, and also had to take care of microeconomic input and output. This caused a situation in which the government's functions were lumped together with those of enterprises, and enterprises did not have any decisionmaking powers. At present, the economic activities of enterprises are oriented to the market, and enterprises will become units operating independently on their own and bearing sole responsibility for their profits and losses. In such circumstances, the government's control over the market will only be found on "major issues and issues concerning the general orientation." That is, the government will just take care of the overall balance and the optimization of the overall structure. The microeconomic decisionmaking powers will be delegated to the enterprises, which will make decisions on their own according to market signals. At present, the central authorities have stressed the need to resolutely control the size of investment in fixed assets and to continue to stabilize and develop the rural economy. This is exactly the concrete expression of macrocontrol. The method of exercising central authority has changed. In the past, the government laid down various targets to determine the scope of the enterprises' economic activities, and directly managed the enterprises' production, product marketing, and materials procurement, as well as the enterprises' personnel, material, and financial affairs. At present, the government mainly applies economic means, guiding enterprises with the market mechanism to bring their activities into line with the overall macroeconomic development targets. In the past, the government managed the economy according to the administrative powers of the departments and the local authorities, and arranged projects and distributed money and materials according to the plans. At present, the government mainly applied the economic and legal means to ensure the implementation of the development programs, to coordinate the interest relations of the market entities, to supervise market operation, and to provide necessary services for the market. Of course, the government can still use administrative power if necessary to interfere in economic activities. The reform measures of the fiscal, tax, and banking systems adopted this year showed that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council mainly applied economic means to exercise macrocontrol. III. What should be done in order to consolidate the authority of the central leadership? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "This should find expression in the effectiveness of the central instructions." To achieve this purpose, two points must be stressed: First, take overall interests into account. To do this, we should first understand the overall interests. This year, the general guideline for the work of the whole party and the whole nation is: Grasp the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening, promote development, and maintain stability. The whole party must clearly understand this general guideline which represents the overall interests, consider and handle things according to this guideline, and bring things into line with the guideline. Second, we should understand the importance of safeguarding overall interests. Take this year's fiscal and tax reform as an example. If such reform is not carried out, the state's financial revenue will account for too small a percentage of the gross national product, and the government will have no sufficient financial capacity for performing its administrative functions and for making reasonable and effective redistribution of the limited resources among various localities. It is obvious that such a situation must not continue. Moreover, it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between the partial interests and the overall interests and between the immediate interests and long-term interests. Some things may be feasible in certain localities, but they may not be acceptable to the overall interests; some things may not be desirable according to local interests, but they must be done according to the overall interests. So we must take the overall interests into account. At present, some local governments and some departments only care about their partial and immediate interests. They do not act in unison with the central authorities' macrocontrol. For example, as the scale of investment in fixed assets is too large, some comrades are still keen to start new projects and expand investment, and are still keen to vie with each other in rapid growth and in ostentation and extravagance, and some comrades recklessly issued shares and bonds without regard to the financial needs of the state's key construction projects. All this went against our current overall interests. All localities and departments must always take the overall interests into account, and must always make their partial and immediate interests subordinate to the overall and long-term interests of the whole nation. Second, stress discipline. While resolutely carrying out the new reform measures adopted by the party central leadership and the State Council, it is also necessary to continue the resolute enforcement of the discipline laid down by the party central leadership and the State Council for macrocontrol. For example, the fiscal and taxation department should continue to resolutely carry out the regulations laid down by the State Council: Strictly control tax reductions, strictly control financial expenditures; stop bank overdrafts; and do not get involved in commercial credit business without the approval of the People's Bank of China. This year, the tasks of reform and development are arduous. As long as we can willingly safeguard and consolidate the authority of the central leadership, unify understanding and action under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, take the overall interests into account, and observe discipline, then we will certainly be able to maintain stability, promote development, and win the tough reform battle.
