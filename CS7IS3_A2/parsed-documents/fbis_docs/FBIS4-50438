"It is an important breakthrough in the taboos of the past," said Gao Shangquan, China's all-time champion of the concept of a labour market, in a recent interview with Window. Gao was deputy minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy from 1982 to 1990 and has been a key member of the team which is designing China's market economy. He is also China's chief economist on the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The major breakthrough or, as the official press called it, the most "earth-shaking" reform, has been to let the formerly permanently employed workers in state-owned enterprises flow into the marketplace--to trade their services and skills for their "rice bowl" (instead of earning it by just being in possession of an urban resident's card). Workers in the state sector did get the message, even though few of them would have cared to read the long-winded 50-point official document. The document was released shortly after a Beijing company manager returned from a business trip to the prosperous Pearl River Delta where he had sold his firm's assembly lines to a buyer in the south. This meant his company would cease to exist and its staff would join a former rival firm, under an arrangement with the municipal authorities, even if only temporarily. But the manager himself had made up his mind already; he had chosen early retirement at the age of 50. Women workers in his factory were entitled to early retirement at 45. "Next year I will go down south on my own business trip," the electrical technician-turned manager said. "I'll set up a small workshop with a few friends of mine." For years, the very concept of labour market was taboo in China's "workers' paradise" economy. In the earlier reform years, all kinds of euphemisms such as "service market" were used for labour market which still remained an ideologically unacceptable concept. Things began to change last November when Gao urged in the official press that it was time to call a spade a spade. This was just several weeks before the concept of a labour market was written into the official policy paper. Gao said it would be unimaginable for a market economy not to have a labour market. It would be "weird" economics if there was a market economy but the door remained shut for people to prove what they could do best by changing jobs. Protection: [previous word published in boldface] But a labour market should trade only labour, not the personal freedoms of workers. And that was exactly the role to be played by the government, he suggested, not by closing down the labour market but by protecting workers' rights. If workers lost their freedoms, the labour market would be inefficient, he warned. What the government should do during China's economic transition was to concentrate on building up its market facilities and maintaining their orderly function, instead of continuing to assign goods and jobs arbitrarily. This would remove one major ideological distortion of the economy. Observers of China's state-owned enterprises have long claimed their managers are either saddled with too many responsibilities (running factory kindergartens, for instance) to concentrate on business or, because it takes so much hassle for them to get rid of even one undisciplined worker, a prerequisite for effective management, they seem to feel entitled not to be responsible at all. Now, however, the latest reform will provide enterprises with a competitive supply of labour, enabling them to find whatever skills they need and encourage workers' devotion to their work and sense of discipline. At the same time, as Gao noted, there has been a de facto labour market in China since at least the mid-1980s. Even outside farming, the state sector provides just 43 per cent of job opportunities; the market's "the invisible hand has already arranged jobs for more than half of China's off-farm labour. Gao also pointed out that the market provided 60 per cent of the work force for the transportation and telecommunication industries, 67 per cent for hotels and restaurants and 77 per cent for the building industry. He believes that recognising this reality would help the government make a more serious effort in looking for solutions to problems, such as the shortage of jobs and the potentially large number of lay-offs from state-owned enterprises. "The most pressing problem right now is our state sector's welfare reform." he said. China's industrial welfare system is still to a large extent factory-based, and pensioners are paid by their former employers, for instance. A society-wide safety net is still an experiment purely at the government's initiative. The terms that the Beijing manager mentioned above received after his factory's merger are perhaps of the best kind. In an early retirement scheme, a worker (or a manager) is paid about 70 per cent of his former monthly income, along with most medical bills. But if he possesses certain skills, he can set up his own shop or work as an independent contractor. This is part of the welfare reform experiment in which the merger, or sometimes the government, takes care of the welfare of laid-off workers. "There are still a lot of details to be worked out in the state sector's welfare reform," Gao explained. "This year, according to last December's reform plan, is meant to be a year of reform in China. But how much reform we can actually make will depend on the economy's health in the middle of the year." This period could be an extremely difficult time for workers in state-owned enterprises. Gao was born in 1929 and graduated from St John's University in 1952 as an economics major. Apart from his appointment on the PWC, he also holds a number of other important positions including vice- chairman of the Chinese Society for Restructuring the Economy and honorary professorships in some of China's best universities.
