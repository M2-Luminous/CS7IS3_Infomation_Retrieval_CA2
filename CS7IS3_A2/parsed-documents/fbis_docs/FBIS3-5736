Christopher made the call in a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at his official residence, saying Japan has not yet produced results in correcting its trade imbalance or boosting imports. Hosokawa told Christopher the Japanese Government is working on a market-opening package that is "substantially meaningful," the officials said. Earlier in the day, Christopher met with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and agreed the United States and Japan should make efforts to prevent existing tension from escalating and try to solve problems through negotiations, they said. Christopher told the prime minister that the U.S. is trying to reduce its fiscal deficit and to strengthen its competitiveness. Christopher noted the need to improve bilateral economic relations and remove the current negative elements, the officials said. The prime minister told Christopher that he is devoting great energy into pushing for "changes" in Japan because they are important for consumers and the public. Hosokawa explained that although other countries may think the speed of change is slow, it is not easy to transform systems that have long existed in Japan, they said. Christopher expressed respect toward Hosokawa's efforts, including political reform, they said. Christopher told Hosokawa that the U.S. and Japan have good relations in the political and security fields, noting the planned "two-plus-two" security talks on Friday and the International Conference on Aid to Cambodia which began in Tokyo in a two-day session. Christopher and Hata, both of whom attended the opening day session of the Cambodia aid conference, are scheduled to meet again Friday in a security forum session to be joined by Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi and U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner. During the 45-minute meeting with the prime minister, Christopher conveyed President Bill Clinton's message to Hosokawa, the officials said. In the message, Clinton gave high marks to the February summit and a breakfast meeting with Hosokawa in Washington and noted that he respects the prime minister very much as a best friend, they said. On the international front, Christopher urged Hosokawa to convey the U.S. stance to place importance on China's human rights record in considering extension of its the most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status when Hosokawa visits China from March 19 to 21, the officials said. Christopher, who will visit Beijing on Friday after wrapping up the three-day trip to Japan, said if no improvement in China's human rights record is seen and Washington does not extend MFN status, the entire economic system in Asia would be negatively affected. Hosokawa replied that he will bear that in mind when he visits China, officials said. Earlier, Christopher held two-hour talks with Foreign Minister Hata. Hata told Christopher tension exists over economic problems, and that although it is unlikely to negatively influence bilateral ties immediately, the two countries should not underestimate it, they said. Hata was also quoted as saying it is important that Japan and the U.S. keep their ties in good form because Asia, Europe and the rest of the world are watching. Ties between Tokyo and Washington turned sour last month when Hosokawa and Clinton announced the collapse of the trade framework negotiations aimed at redressing Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States. The two sides have since been in a cooling-off period. Japanese figures show Japan registered a third straight rise in its trade surplus with the U.S. in 1993, gaining 15.2 percent to 50.19 billion dollars, the third-largest amount. U.S. figures put the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in 1993 at a record 59.3 billion dollar. Christopher told Hata that Washington wants to closely watch what Tokyo hammers out as a market-opening package and then decide on what to do with the framework talks, the officials said. Christopher, who arrived in Japan late Wednesday night for a three-day visit to Japan, called for "tangible" results and said the U.S. does not want "ambiguities" or just procedures, they said. The officials said Hata and Christopher did not discuss specific economic problems. They did not take up the U.S. Government's reinstatement last week of a trade law known as Super 301, which gives the administration power to impose sanctions against countries it determines guilty of unfair trade practices, they said. Japanese officials believe the action is aimed at pressing Japan into opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus. Christopher and Hata agreed Japan and the U.S. have commitments to their alliance relations based on a bilateral security pact and that both countries have joint responsibilities for maintaining peace and prosperity throughout the world, they said. Christopher expressed worries about possible deterioration of the relationship of trust between Japan and the U.S., noting voices in the U.S. that Tokyo is not sufficiently making efforts to reduce its current account surplus or to boost imports while the U.S. is fulfilling its responsibilities to reduce its fiscal deficit and strengthen competitiveness, the officials said. The two men agreed that Tokyo and Washington should both try to offer ideas to seek a solution, they said. Hata told Christopher that Japan is making "voluntary" efforts and is compiling a package of market-opening measures, such as deregulation and import-promotion steps. He added Japan is making such efforts not only for the sake of relations with other countries but for the improvement of its own people's lives. Earlier in the day, Christopher told reporters that Japan, in the course of its reforms, could benefit from advice from the U.S. "I think there is a change and reform taking place in Japan and, if they'll permit an outsider to be heard, it may be helpful to express our views about the importance of the relationship we have with Japan," Christopher said. He mentioned security, diplomacy and economy as areas in which the bilateral relationship has particular importance.
