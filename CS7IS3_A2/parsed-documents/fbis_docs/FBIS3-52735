Details in the following report: Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the information minister and minister of state for Prime Ministry affairs, briefed the delegation on the developments in the peace process since the announcement of the Declaration of Principles between the PLO and Israel and the impact of this agreement on Jordan as a result of its relations with the occupied Arab territories. He said that developments on the Palestinian-Israeli track clearly affect the course of Jordanian negotiations and Jordan's basic interests. He said: We are now coordinating with the Palestinian brothers in order to unify stands and avoid any contradictions or negative aspects between the two sides in the future. He said that Jordan believes that peace should be just and comprehensive and that all parties should get their rights with all due respect and appreciation, especially Jordanian and Palestinian interests. Following the meeting, BBC television held an interview with Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani. [Begin al-'Anani recording, in English] You know Jordan was the only country which opened its borders with the Palestinians and kept them open since the war of 1967. And, therefore, you know, there have been cumulative rights over time, there have been entangled business relations and so on. We don't want to sound like we are engaging in a tug of war, you know, who should win the West Bank. But it is not a question either of a zero option. But we believe that the fact that the Israelis have complete dominance over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, by virtue of occupation, if we can use the word virtue, but at the same time Jordan seems to be on the paying end of the equation. [sentence as heard] This development should really be reversed because Jordan has put a great deal of sacrifice. [end recording] [passage omitted]
