[Muhammad] I had warned from the beginning that unless the Yemeni institutions (Presidential Council, Cabinet, and House of Representatives) convened, the Pledge and Accord Document implemented, and the problems which appeared from time to time contained, the alternative would be a power vacuum, anarchy, accusations, explosions, and war. [passage omitted] [Al-Ustuwani] Missiles entered the arsenal of the South Yemeni forces when you were president, when you received them from the Soviet Union. Did it never occur to you that they might be used in some wars? [Muhammad] I remember that after signing the agreement to purchase that weapon, Brezhnev told me that "this is a lethal and dangerous weapon and should only be used to threaten and intimidate, not to be fired." We saw it as an element of Yemen's strength against any foreign threat. We never used it in any of our past battles because we wanted stability for Yemen, the region, and our neighbors. [Al-Ustuwani] What, in your view, should be done to end this grinding war? [Muhammad] I am in favor of dialogue and I will not change my position even though that may not be in harmony with what is going on now or its consequences; but that is my position and sole responsibility. I call on them to resort to dialogue to resolve the crisis despite the fact that there have been considerable losses and clashes. [Al-Ustuwani] The Arab League had proposed sending Arab forces. Are you in favor of such a solution and of Arab League intervention, bearing in mind that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih rejected that? [Muhammad] I support dialogue and the efforts being made by the Arab League and some Arab and friendly states to contain the crisis, but that, in my view, does not justify sending Arab forces to Yemen because the crisis is a Yemeni crisis and the solution must be a Yemeni solution. I am against partition and division in this case. The Arab efforts cannot succeed unless all parties respond, which is not what we are seeing now. [Al-Ustuwani] How do you feel about foreign military intervention? [Muhammad] As a matter of principle I am against the dispatch of any Arab or foreign forces. I reject that. Somalia is maybe an example of the failure of that to solve the problem. This is a Yemeni problem and it is up to the Yemenis to define it and to solve it. [Al-Ustuwani] There are those who claim that neighboring states such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are behind the crisis and that they have provided aid for the south. What do you think? [Muhammad] We should not apportion blame haphazardly or hold the brothers in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, or other foreign powers, responsible in any way because the problem is an internal Yemeni problem and the conflict an internal conflict, and the solution must be a Yemeni solution. We should not blame fraternal or friendly states for our own mistakes and failure in Yemen. The brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have made statements reaffirming their interest in Yemen's stability, and we have felt these sentiments from them. [Al-Ustuwani] In your view, what role can the United States play to contain the crisis? [Muhammad] We have, from the beginning, welcomed the positive U.S. role in containing the crisis. The U.S. initiative emphasized Yemeni unity, democracy, modernization, and stability. We saw these proposals and initiative as a special stance by Washington toward the Yemeni people. Washington realizes that stability in Yemen means stability in the region. [Al-Ustuwani] Are you in favor of raising the issue at the Security Council? [Muhammad] I do not believe that is necessary. What has the Security Council got to do with it, if these are internal differences? We have rejected Arab military intervention, so are we to accept foreign solutions? This is an internal matter and we do not allow intervention in it. [Al-Ustuwani] Are you holding any consultations or contacts with the Yemeni parties? [Muhammad] There have been contacts between me and the Yemeni president and vice president, and Salim Salih Muhammad, the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] assistant secretary general who is now in London, and other political figures in Yemen and abroad such as Brigadier General Shaykh Mujahid Abu-Shawarib. In all these contacts I emphasized -- and still do -- that the crisis must be contained and resolved peacefully and that the army and people of Yemen must be saved because anything else would weaken Yemen and its standing in the world. [Al-Ustuwani] What about your own personal initiative for the settlement of the Yemeni crisis? [Muhammad] I am now making contacts with the aim of finding a way to halt what is happening now. The Yemeni people are always my concern because they are suffering for no fault of their own. I want peace and security for the Yemeni people. I had previously made an initiative, and last month I submitted another initiative to the political leadership -- but they did not respond to it, nor did they respond to the other Arab initiatives made by our brothers and friends. [Al-Ustuwani] Can you tell us about your second initiative, concerning which nothing has been published? [Muhammad] It is a practical program for the next phase. It would not be beneficial to divulge its details now. My role is not one of mediator but of someone who cares about national unity, Yemeni unity, and sparing Yemen the dangers of war, destruction, and partition. It is not a role in pursuit of personal gain or interest, nor of achieving personal political objectives. At any rate, we are awaiting what happens next. [Al-Ustuwani] So, you are not at present contemplating returning to Yemen to help stop the deterioration? [Muhammad] Quite the contrary. I am willing to go to Yemen if the general interest requires it and if the leadership is willing to respond to such an initiative. I am prepared to sacrifice for Yemen and for the future and security of Yemen, whatever the consequences. [passage omitted] [Al-Ustuwani] It has been claimed that forces loyal to you have now joined the military battles on the side of the northern forces to topple the Aden [leaders]. Is that true? [Muhammad] I have instructed the forces and people loyal to me to put Yemen's unity above all other considerations. They are fighting for that now. Wherever my forces are, they are a part of the Yemeni forces working for Yemen's future...and I am in contact with them and with all the Arab brothers and friends. We await the settlement of the situation and the restoration of calm for the Yemen people, but there are still fears about the possible consequences of victory by either side.
