[Prime Minister] "I need you to do what you can to eliminate the discrepancies between domestic and foreign prices." [Nakauchi] "But the Finance Ministry is keeping an eye on us on beer [prices]." Dissatisfaction With Lower Beer Prices On 14 April, Daiei reduced domestic beer prices by 7 percent. Daiei has maintained its lowered retail prices despite the 1 May rise in the liquor tax, in what was a strong competitive blow to smaller and mid-sized liquor retail outlets. According to Nakauchi, the action even had reverberations within the Ministry of Finance's National Tax Administration Agency, which oversees the industry. Officials of the National Tax Administration Agency's Alcoholic Beverage Tax Division maintain, "Beer is priced by open market forces. We cannot interfere." However, keeping prices low in the face of the division's instruction that the impact of increased taxes be passed on to the consumer certainly had to annoy the bureaucrats. Even though Nakauchi is championing the cause of lower prices as Keidanren's vice president in charge of administrative reforms, there are whispers in Kasumigaseki that "He is just trying to expand sales for his own retail operation." "Last summer, large retail outlets of over 10,000 square meters in size were granted licenses through a special exemption clause. A further easing of regulations is uncalled for." On 12 May, the day before Nakauchi met with the prime minister, the National Tax Administration Agency rejected seven separate petitions for deregulation on liquor sales at a session of the "Import Expansion, Improving Market Access and Distribution" working subcommittee of the Promotion Headquarters for Administrative Reform held at the prime minister's official residence. At the working subcommittee session, eight government ministries and agencies concerned agreed to "take positive steps" on only two of the 71 proposals on the distribution sector made by a private sector hoping for deregulation. It was evident that in all areas, there is a deeply rooted resistance to any actual loosening of control. Recommendations Outside Jurisdiction The passive attitude of the various government agencies toward deregulation has become more pronounced with the advent of the Hata administration. "To facilitate any easing of regulations, some guarantee of the political authorities' determination to immplement such measures is necessary, but that is improbable in the current situation where the budget is not even passed, " (a senior Ministry of Construction official) voiced cynical insight into the dubious footing of the minority coalition government. In the midst of this, the machinations of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry are elaborately orchestrated. In 16 areas where it has no jurisdiction, such as in rice and liquor sales, the ministry presented a mid-May report recommending a sweeping easing of regulations. The senior officials of the ministry have even personally approached the working subcommittee's experts from academia and the business sector. In lieu of offering a menu of choices to the experts and the prime minister, who are looking for impressive deregulation measures, the ministry has adopted a strategy to win acceptance of its own plan to "gradually ease regulations" under its jurisdiction, such as those embodied in the Large Retail Store Law. However, inasmuch as deregulation is part of international commitments, the pressure for them nonetheless persists. In the final stage, the bureaucrats are inwardly prepared to table at least some minor deregulation measures as they stage a game of "awaiting the prime minister's political decision." What the central government ministries and agencies vehemently oppose is the decentralization of government powers. Finally Eviscerating the Legal Provisions "In the end, we had no choice but to compromise." So say Ministry of Home Affairs senior officials looking back on their struggle since January to liaise with other ministries and government bureaus in seeking to establish "regional amalgamation." Regional amalgamation will be established by the amendment of the Local Government Act, enabling various prefectural-level governments or municipalities to work together on issues such as refuse disposal. The pillar of regional amalgamation was its ability to demand that the central government delegate authority. However, the overwhelming resistance from the other ministries has resulted in the appendage of numerous provisions enhancing central government involvement to the proposed bill. In the final draft, requests to delegate authority can only be granted for "powers closely related to regional amalgamation." The negotiations between the various ministries and agencies overlapped the final days of the Hosokawa administration and the birth of the Hata administration. Evidence of active leadership by the Prime Minister's Office was barely visible. The issue of information disclosure is as prominent as the issue of decentralization. Koshiro lshida, director general of the Management and Coordination Agency, has recently started to emphasize that the proposed reforms will be "the most sweeping reforms in half a century." Nobuyoshi Namikawa, secretary general of the People's Conference on Administrative Reform, is worried: "That is what bureaucrats say when they mean, `We are not going to make this easy'."
