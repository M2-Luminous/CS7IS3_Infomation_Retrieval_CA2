Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah confirmed this information during a news conference he held at the Yemeni Foreign Ministry today. On the sidelines of the news conference, Basindwah spoke to the MBC, declaring that his country wishes to strengthen its relations with fraternal countries, particularly Saudi Arabia. [Begin recording] [Basindwah] As an Arab citizen, not Yemeni foreign minister, I would like all the brothers to understand that their current position might not serve their future interests. [Zaytuni] Minister, a UN envoy will shortly arrive in Sanaa. Does Sanaa have conditions to present to him? How will Sanaa deal with the UN envoy in light of current domestic and international developments connected with the Yemeni crisis? [Basindwah] We welcome his excellency brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi as an envoy of the UN secretary general. We are confident of his competence, ability, wisdom, and long experience. I believe that any mediation effort must respect the need to preserve Yemeni unity.

The Ministry insisted, however, that the two principles of Yemeni unity and constitutional legality be maintained.
