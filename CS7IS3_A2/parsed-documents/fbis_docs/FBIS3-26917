Researchers at the Space and Applied Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said that ground control received the satellite's remote measurement signals at 0423 [2023 GMT] on 9 February immediately after the satellite entered China's airspace for the first time. Initial scientific data has been obtained following the decoding of some signals indicating that the six scientific probing instruments on board have started working normally. According to a person in charge at the Space and Applied Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who had just returned to Beijing from the Xichang Satellite Launching Center, the "SJ-4" is China's first special large, flat, high-altitude-orbit satellite designed to study the space environment and its effects [as received]. Immediately after the satellite entered orbit, the Satellite Measurement and Control Center of the State Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense captured the satellite's remote measurement signals and measured the satellite's orbit. The satellite's greatest altitude from the earth is 36,133 km, its lowest altitude from the earth is 217 km, and its dip angle is 28.58 degrees. On 12 February, the Measurement and Control Center began an experiment which applied high pressure on its static analyzer remote control. Monitoring and measuring data indicated that the high pressure applied on instruments was normal and that the instruments had begun to sent back space-plasma data. Now, all the probing instruments on board have been put into normal operation. With the special characteristics of the present orbit of the "SJ- 4" the major purpose of the "SJ-4" is to probe and study charged particles in near-earth space and their effects on space vehicles. Its obtaining of systematic environmental data will help boost our country's research into the plasma environment. The successful launch of the "SJ-4" is helping to accumulate experience in using our country's powerful carrier rockets to launch applied satellites and in using experimental rockets to carry small scientific research satellites.
