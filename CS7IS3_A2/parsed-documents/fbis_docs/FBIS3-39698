On the eve of his meeting with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, EL PAIS has learned the contents of the first document drafted by the generalitat premier's office to raise Catalonia's autonomy ceiling, to which contributions are already being made by the two coalition parties -- CDC and Democratic Union of Catalonia -- and which will be debated at a specific meeting of their liaison committee. Catalan government councillors such as Macia Alavedra (Economy), Josep Maria Cullell (Territorial Policy), Joan Maria Pujals (Education), and Ignasi Farreras (Labor) are acquainted with it, as is Joaquim Pujol, secretary general of the Prime Minister's Office. The document, which Jordi Pujol has given to various colleagues to seek their suggestions, proceeds from the assumption that the Generalitat is the state's ordinary representative in Catalonia, in accordance with the Constitution and the autonomy statute, although subsequent legislation has been diluting this role to the extent of making the autonomous community's political significance subsidiary. In fact, the document partially develops a brief extemporaneous remark by Pujol at his last investiture in April 1992, when he cited the pre-1714 model, under the Habsburg rule, as the reference point for refounding the Spanish state. The throne would remain as a symbolic link -- albeit not the only link -- between the various peoples of Spain. The document proceeds from the premise of not reforming the Constitution or the statute but making a reinterpretation. Its plan is based on the almost total assumption of the functions resting with the state's executive power by the Generalitat government, thus developing the single administration idea; respect for the Cortes' legislative power; respect for the judiciary as an independent power (albeit with the autonomous government assuming many of the [central] government's powers in its relations with it), and respect for the throne in its symbolic and moderating roles. The document will be handed over at the anticipated meeting between Felipe Gonzalez and Jordi Pujol that is to lay the foundations of the so-called "turnabout in autonomy" demanded by the Catalan nationalists in order to continue their support for the Socialist government. Almost 15 years after the approval of the statute, the assessment the document presents is that, in many respects, the government has a restrictive view of autonomy and an incorrect approach from the legal viewpoint. In order to put into effect the state of the autonomies, "there must be a radical change in the state's structures," the document states. Protocol In order to restore what the nationalists believe to be the legislators' intention in granting the Generalitat premier the highest representation of the Generalitat and the ordinary representation of the state in Catalonia (Chapter II, Article 36, paragraph 2 of the statute), the document proposes preparing a number of legal measures concerning, for example, the prime minister's role and his place in protocol when he is in Catalonia, and the need for all authorities operating in the principality, irrespective of the administrations to which they belong, to accept its primacy and cooperate with the Generalitat. Ramon Maria Llevadot, director of the Generalitat's central legal department, was the technical coordinator of the document, which was drawn up on the basis of the contributions of Jordi Pujol and, to a lesser extent, other members of his government. The document maintains that the current protocol decree is not in keeping with the Constitution and the statute. The Generalitat's interpretation is that, after the head of state, the first place in protocol governing ceremonies taking place in Catalonia should belong to the Generalitat premier, not the Spanish prime minister. Since he [the premier] represents the state, the document argues, his importance is greater than that of Felipe Gonzalez, since the latter, in his capacity as prime minister, is just the representative of one of the state powers -- the executive -- and not even of all of it, since the autonomous and municipal administrations are excluded. In order to strengthen the Catalan premier's political role, the Generalitat proposes a direct relationship -- without intermediaries -- with the head of state. In this new framework, Pujol would be the regular vehicle of communication with the king for all the Catalan public institutions. An initial result would be the disappearance of the figure of the minister of the royal visit [ministro de jornada] during visits by King Juan Carlos. In line with this is the demand that the Generalitat premier's appointment after his election by the Catalan parliament be endorsed by the speaker of the house and by the king, without the signature of the prime minister, who is described as an "extraneous" element. Wherever the Constitution and the statute allow it, the nationalists propose using in the most extensive way possible the transfer by organic law of powers corresponding to matters within the purview of the state which by their very nature are capable of transfer or delegation. Article 150, paragraph 2 of the Constitution already takes note of this eventuality and, as a safeguard for the state, states that "the law will provide in each case for the corresponding transfer of financial means, as well as the forms of oversight which the state reserves for itself." The central administration should adjust to the gradual reduction of its powers by cutting its personnel. The Generalitat believes that in many cases elements of the state peripheral administration will disappear, albeit partially. While the corresponding laws on the delegation of powers are being approved, it proposes using the method of agreements which will enable the Generalitat to extend its powers now. The specific areas in which the Generalitat wishes to assume more powers and which it intends to place in the front line of its political demands include those affecting territorial policy, language, culture -- where it proposes including representatives of the Generalitat in the international bodies which have functions concerning culture and language -- security and public order, justice, the news media, and education.
