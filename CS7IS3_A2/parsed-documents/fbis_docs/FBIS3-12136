In exclusive statements to MENA, Dr. Shihab said the massacre was criminal and barbaric and should be strongly condemned by all peace loving powers. He pointed to the danger of maintaining Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, adding that Israel should seriously contemplate the removal of these settlements from the Palestinian territories if we want peace and security to be real and to last. Dr. Shihab held Israel fully responsible for the massacre, since the 1949 Geneva agreements give the occupying state the authority to run and organize utilities in the occupied territories. These agreements hold the occupying state solely responsible for protecting the lives and safety of all the residents of these territories, he said, adding: Hence, Israel has not honored these commitments. He remarked that this calls for serious thinking about imposing international protection on the territories and their residents. This protection should be approved by the international community and the concerned institutions, primarily the UN Security Council. He emphasized that this international protection should be provided to the Palestinians on their lands, since it has been proven that the Israeli army and administration are incapable of providing protection to them, adding that this is important if we want the peace negotiations to continue. Dr. Shihab voiced his support for Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's call for a Security Council meeting to discuss this issue. He called on the Council to intervene quickly and decisively and discuss this incident and its consequences and to discuss the setting up of the necessary guarantees to protect the security of Palestinian citizens from the violent practices of the Israeli settlers and the Israeli forces' lack of seriousness in confronting these violent practices. He added that it is painful to see the Israeli forces confronting the unarmed demonstrators who wanted to denounce this massacre and to see them killing more demonstrators instead of seriously acting to stop the Israeli settlers' criminal acts.
