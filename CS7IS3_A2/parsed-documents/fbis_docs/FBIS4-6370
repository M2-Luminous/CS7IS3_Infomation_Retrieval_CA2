Comrade Nguyen Hong Nhi, secretary of the party committee, delivered the report of the party standing committee, in which he pointed out that in the past two years the Vietnam civil aviation sector has recorded new progress in its effective operations and has enhanced its prestige both domestically and internationally. The sector has started to reform its technology, means of transportation, and equipment, and has upgraded many of its facilities, thus effecting a change for the better in the air transport business. The Vietnam civil aviation sector has stood firm despite fierce competition. It has developed its network of air routes covering purely neighboring markets to include some more complex routes further afield. The conference set up targets for the next few years, which include overcoming the risk of lagging further behind compared with world and regional aviation services, further developing the level of transport services, constructing and upgrading the infrastructure, and stepping up training in parallel with ensuring safety and efficiency for flights.
