FR941202-1-00008 FR941202-1-00002 Section 226.33_Reverse Mortgages 33(a) Definition Section 154 of the Equity Protection Act defines a ``reverse mortgage'' as a nonrecourse transaction that is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and that ties repayment (other than upon default) to the homeowner's death or the permanent move from or transfer of the home. The proposed regulation tracks the statute. A nonrecourse transaction limits the homeowner's liability to no more than the proceeds of the sale of the home (unless a lesser amount is provided for in the credit obligation such as by an equity reservation or an equity conservation agreement between the consumer and creditor). Neither the statute nor the proposed regulation defines ``nonrecourse transactions.'' Similarly, specific acts of default for purposes of the reverse mortgage rules are not defined. Neither the act nor the legislative history identifies such acts, and the Board believes that the determination of ``default'' is most appropriately left to the legal obligation between the parties and state or other law. However, the Board notes that further guidance could be given if such an approach results in creditors defining default in a way that circumvents the protections for consumers entering into reverse mortgage transactions. 33(b) Content of Disclosures Section 138 of the TILA establishes a new standard to measure the cost of reverse mortgage credit. The statute requires reverse mortgage creditors to disclose a good faith estimate of the projected total cost of the credit to the consumer, expressed as a table of annual interest rates. The legislative history states that the Congress contemplated a disclosure scheme modeled after the matrix disclosure currently required by section 255 of the National Housing Act and implemented by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program. The proposed regulation reflects that approach, except as noted below. The regulation requires creditors to use the term ``total annual loan cost rate'' rather than ``annual interest rate'' in complying with this section. The statute does not mandate the use of the term ``annual interest rate,'' and the Board believes that using a different term will avoid possible confusion between the disclosure of an ``annual interest rate'' and the ``annual percentage rate,'' which is required by other parts of the regulation. The term ``total annual loan cost rate'' is unlikely to be confused with the more frequently used APR. Furthermore, the Board believes ``total annual loan cost rate'' is a more accurate description of the percentage cost of reverse mortgages than ``annual interest rate.'' For example, the rate may reflect costs other than interest, such as annuity premiums, appraisal fees and a percentage of any appreciation in the consumer's home. Section 138(a)(1) of the TILA requires creditors to disclose total annual loan cost rates for not less than three projected appreciation rates and not less than three credit transaction periods, as determined by the Board. HUD's HECM matrix similarly discloses nine ``average annual percentage rates'' based on three assumed annual home appreciation rates and three assumed loan terms. The proposed regulation would require the tabular disclosure of nine total annual loan cost rates. The HECM matrix is accompanied by a listing of the basic factors used in calculating the projected total cost of credit, such as the age of the borrower, the value of the consumer's home, etc., and a brief discussion of some assumptions used in calculating the rates in the matrix. The proposed regulation would require that the matrix be accompanied by a listing of key factors used in calculating the total annual loan cost rates, along with a brief narrative that helps consumers to interpret the rates disclosed in the matrix. (See the supplementary material accompanying proposed Appendix K for further discussion of the model disclosure.) 33(c) Projected Total Cost of Credit Section 138(a) and 138(b) of the TILA identify factors creditors must consider when calculating the projected total cost of credit and the corresponding total annual loan cost rates. The proposed regulation lists those requirements in paragraph (c) of this section. (The mathematical formulas for determining the total annual loan cost rate is contained in Appendix K.) 33(c)(1) Costs to Consumer Section 138(b)(2) of the TILA includes in the projected total cost of credit all costs and charges to the consumer, including the costs of any associated annuity that the consumer elects or is required to purchase as part of the reverse mortgage transaction. The proposed regulation parallels the statute, except that the term ``associated'' has been deleted. The Board believes the Congress intended a very broad application of the terms ``costs and charges.'' For example, the Board believes all costs and charges connected with the reverse mortgage transaction must be included in the projected total cost of credit, whether or not the charge is deemed to be a finance charge under Subpart A of the regulation. Some creditors require or permit consumers to purchase an annuity as part of the transaction that at some future time supplements or replaces the creditor's payments. The law and regulation require the amount paid by the consumer for the annuity to be included as a cost to the consumer. This is the case whether the purchase is made through the creditor or a third party, or whether the purchase is mandatory or voluntary. The HECM program does not include disposition costs as a part of the total annual loan cost rate, and the proposed regulation follows that approach. The Board solicits comment on the treatment of disposition costs that may be incurred when the loan is repaid. 33(c)(2) Payments to Consumer Section 138(b)(3) of the TILA requires creditors to consider in the projected total cost of credit all payments to and for the benefit of the consumer, including annuity payments received by the consumer from an annuity purchased as part of the reverse mortgage transaction. The regulation would generally track the statute, with slight modifications for clarity. 33(c)(3) Additional Creditor Compensation Section 138(b)(1) of the TILA includes in the total cost of a reverse mortgage loan any shared appreciation or equity that the creditor is entitled to receive pursuant to the credit contract. For example, creditors sometimes offer a reduced interest rate in exchange for a portion of the appreciation or equity that may be realized when the dwelling is sold. 33(c)(4) Limitations on Consumer Liability Section 138(b)(4) of the TILA requires creditors to consider in the projected total cost of credit any limitation on the consumer's liability under the reverse mortgage loan. This would include, for example, equity conservation agreements. These agreements protect a portion of the equity in the dwelling for the consumer or the consumer's estate.
