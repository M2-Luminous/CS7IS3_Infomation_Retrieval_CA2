Exporters of Strategic Raw Material Will Determine Competition"] [Text] The latest measures in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations show that the ministry leaders are consistently changing from administrative methods of regulating foreign economic activity to market mechanisms. This pertains not so much to the expansion of the practice of conducting bidding for the distribution of orders for the delivery of raw material for state needs as it does to the complete replacement of the administrative method for distribution of all state orders with the competition method. In particular, beginning 1 January of this year the distribution of state orders for exports of petroleum, petroleum products, and nonferrous metals--the most important items of state exports--will be conducted only according to the results of the competition. At a conference held yesterday in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations they named organizations that had passed the competitive selection. The winners will be able to begin export deliveries of petroleum products after the list is approved by leaders of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The distribution of state orders conducted in keeping with the new procedure should not be confused with federal trading sessions for the distribution of export quotas conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. At these, as a rule, they place one-time orders or orders that are limited to a short period of time for fulfillment. In the former case this pertains to making deliveries for a year. The plan for conducting the competition is the same for all kinds of raw materials. According to it, the competition is conducted by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, and, at least at first, only organizations that have traditionally fulfilled the state order or participants in last year's bidding organized by the foreign economic department may participate in it. Participants in the competition must submit to the Ministry of Finance the calculated effectiveness of the forthcoming export operations--in other words, indicate the quantity of currency that will be transferred into the budget per unit of commodity. If all other conditions are equal, this criterion will be the decisive one. Additionally, the competitors will be required to submit a schedule of payments backed up by bank guarantees of meeting the indicated time periods for receiving the amount of the first payment. If the schedule is not met, a fine is collected from the exporter in the amount of the bank guarantees. But they are allowed to adjust both the payment deadlines and the payment amounts--in the event of force majeure circumstances or a change in conditions in the world and domestic markets. As for exporters who will be making deliveries of fuel oil and diesel fuel for state needs in 1994, so far there are only 17 of these organizations. [begin box] Commentary from the Department of Economic Policy In the system for competitive distribution of state export quotas in 1994 there were higher and lower leagues. In the lower league the bidding sessions being conducted are the same as in 1993. In the higher league, where the role of the main arbitrator will be played by the Ministry of Finance and where the winners of the bidding from last year and this year will be included, much larger quotas are being distributed. Thus 23.4 million tonnes of oil credited to state export quotas have already been distributed among six organizations. The specific feature of the new model is that in it we have managed to coordinate the functions of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the Ministry of Finance (in the past it was the conflicting interests of these departments that reduced the results of the bidding sessions). The division of labor looks like this: The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations determines the group of participants and the Ministry of Finance evaluates their proposals from the standpoint of maximizing budget currency receipts and hands down a final verdict. If the new system for regulating exports, which continues the policy of liberalization of foreign economic activity, is approved, it, along with the unraveling currency control, could make the institution of specialized exporters superfluous.
