If the IAEA Secretariat, provoking us, tries to put another pressure upon the DPRK, we will have no other alternative but to respond to it with a resolute step." The spokesman for the General Department of Atomic Energy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea served this warning in a statement today. Recalling that the DPRK accepted an inspection of the IAEA necessary for the continuity of safeguards from March 1 to 15, the spokesman says: This inspection was aimed exclusively to maintain the continuity of safeguards, proper for the unique status of the DPRK characterized by the temporary suspension of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Therefore, on the basis of our desire to implement in good faith both the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions and the DPRK-IAEA agreement in the whole period of the presence of the inspection team, we permitted all the inspection activities within the scope needed for maintaining the continuity of safeguards and provided the inspection team with our unreserved cooperation for its work. Consequently, the agency's inspection team was able to carry out satisfactorily all the activities in the DPRK's nuclear facilities as specified in the Vienna agreement of February 15, including the reloading and servicing of containment and surveillance devices, the verification of the physical inventories, the examination of a number of records and documents, verification of the design information, samplings and measurements. While the inspection was proceeding, however, the agency Secretariat and the inspection team unilaterally claimed that their inspection was a safeguards agreement-bound inspection, not an inspection necessary for providing the continuity of safeguards and pressed their inordinate demands that would make their inspection equivalent to routine and ad hoc inspections, a wanton violation of what was agreed in the Vienna agreement of February 15. The agency Secretariat gave the inspection team instructions inconsistent with the Vienna agreement and made the inaccurate report from the inspection team a fait accompli, taking it at its face value, and insisted on unreasonable demands for samplings from locations where seals as the means of containment remain unbroken, gamma mapping at most of the points, instead of a few selected points, and even verification of the cooling systems, which the Vienna consultations had never dealt with. In addition, the agency Secretariat went the length of threatening us with its telex messages addressed to us three times, saying that it "will have to report to the board of governors that the agency is not in a position to verify non-diversion of nuclear material," unless its demands are met. On the other hand, the inspection team members during their stay in our country found themselves helpless when the operators gave them logically reasonable explanations with regard to the requested samplings from locations where seals remain unbroken, and excused themselves for their demands, saying "it cannot be helped because this is the task from the agency Secretariat." Moreover, even after they confirmed firsthand the maintenance of the original seals they placed last August, they illogically made out their case, saying that "we cannot believe the integrity of the one-year-old seals." The unjust demands of the agency Secretariat including request for sampling from the input accountability tank contained by the agency's seals have no relevance at all to the aim and character of the recent inspection designed to verify the absence of nuclear activities, and constitute a flagrant violation of the Vienna agreement of February 15. During its inspection we have shown flexibility as an expression of our good will by agreeing to the impertinent demands from the IAEA Secretariat, including samplings at some locations where containment devices remain intact, and the gamma mapping at all the necessary points. Therefore, the recent inspection activities performed by the IAEA inspection team are sufficient to enable the agency to fully verify non-diversion of nuclear material at our nuclear facilities and definitely ensure the continuity of safeguards as well. In fact, the receiving stage and major processes at the radiochemical laboratory remain controlled by dozens of IAEA seals, surveillance cameras and IAEA's tracer chemicals, so that the facility is a placed under the agency's double and triple containment control. Notwithstanding this fact, before the analysis of the inspection results was available, the IAEA Secretariat announced its unjust conclusion that "although many of the agreed inspection measures were carried out as envisaged, some other activities were restricted at the radiochemical laboratory," and that "the agency was not in a position to verify that there had been no diversion of nuclear material, at the facility." And the Secretariat is making a dustup by scheduling a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors on this matter. This is an utterly unjustifiable action of openly revoking the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions and the DPRK-IAEA agreement with respect to the continuity of safeguards, and there can be no justification for this action in any case. All the facts demonstrate that the agency Secretariat has been further widening its partiality and still continues pursuing its ill-disposed political purposes under the United States' manipulation in an attempt to strangle the DPRK. If the IAEA Secretariat sincerely wants a fair resolution of our "nuclear issue," it must rescind the unreasonable assessment it had rushed to with regard to the result of the recent inspection.
