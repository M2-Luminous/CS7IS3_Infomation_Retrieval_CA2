The bank president, Ma Yongwei, said last week at a national conference of bankers that the bank will control its lending according to the policies of the central bank, the People's Bank of China. Ma said that this year the bank will continue its mandated lending to support the State's plan for developing rural industry and the fixed assets in the countryside. In response to the growing demand for capital for the countryside, Ma said, the bank's arranged loans this year for various sectors in the rural economy are expected to surpass last year's. But because a market economy requires the country's lending institutions to operate more commercially, the bank must also consider the risks in extending credit, Ma said. In a firm response to the government's call for strongly backing agriculture, the bank intends this year to expand loans for crop production by 25 billion yuan ($2.87 billion) from last year, when it lent about 233 billion yuan ($26.78 billion). Ma predicted that in 1994 inflation will exert greater pressure on farmers to cut production costs. If inflation remains at last year's level, he said, it will stimulate a rising spiral in agricultural prices as well as in the demand for bank loans. In addition, Ma said the disparity between available capital and the demand for credit will widen this year as the Agricultural Bank must shoulder a heavier burden in buying State Treasury bonds and co-operated bonds.
