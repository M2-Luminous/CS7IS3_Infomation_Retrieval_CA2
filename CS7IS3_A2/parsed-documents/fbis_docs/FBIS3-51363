FBIS3-51363 "drlat012_g_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-012 Document Type:Daily Report 19 Jan 1994 Guatemala Army Denies Advising Mexican Army on Counter Insurgency PA1901025194 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2106 GMT 18 Jan 94 PA1901025194 Panama City ACAN Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Guatemala City, 18 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Tuesday [18 January], the Guatemalan Army denied advising its Mexican colleagues in the counter insurgent struggle; although it admitted holding routine meetings ever since the peasant rebellion began in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said Mexico does not need "our experience" of more than 30 years fighting the Guatemalan guerrillas, and that the meetings held have been the usual ones. The dailies PRENSA LIBRE and SIGLO VEINTIUNO, who quote sources close to the Army, said high-ranking Mexican military officers had been to Guatemala in early January and they had travelled to Ixcan, an area of conflict located in the northern Quiche Department. "To provide military advice is a political decision. If the Mexican authorities request it, I must ask the president for authorization," the minister said, pointing out that the meetings were not about the Chiapas situation. Gen. Enriquez denied Guatemalan military officers had travelled to Mexico to learn about the situation caused by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion, although he said that way "we would have more reliable information." In relation to the surveillance along the area bordering Mexico, he reiterated the troops remain in a state of alert because the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) "has concentrated its forces in that area." The military command in Huehuetenango is coordinating surveillance in the border area, which has been divided into seven zones, and therefore, "it has not been necessary to send reinforcements," according to Army spokesperson Edith Vargas. As of 5 January, the EZLN rebels have been in Guadalupe Tepeyac, some 800 meters from the Guatemalan border, north of Huehuetenango Department. In this area, Military Zone No. 19 is in charge of security and defense but the border is also guarded by troops and detachments which depend on the central military zones located in the northern Quiche, Alta Verapaz, and Peten Departments. According to the Guatemalan defense minister, "the entire border is a shield for subversion. We fight them in Ixcan and they show up in Mexico," where military intelligence has detected hospitals for treating the guerrillas as well as arms caches. The daily SIGLO VEINTIUNO quotes a Guatemalan military document which says the arrest of a "terrorist criminal" in Cacahuatan, Chiapas in July 1984 led to the dismantling of a "clandestine surgical hospital." Enriquez ruled out the URNG as having the capacity for organizing a rebellion like the EZLN rebellion in Chiapas State on 1 January because "it is militarily weak." He also said Guatemalan military attaches in Mexico have not reported on the alleged Guatemalan guerrillas who were fighting with the Zapatists, and he voiced concern about the arrest of Dr. Ruben Alejandro Bailey. The medical doctor was arrested on 10 January and accused of forming part of the Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party (PROCUP), which the Mexican authorities have accused of terrorist actions.
