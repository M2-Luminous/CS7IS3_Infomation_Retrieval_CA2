Two IAEA inspectors, A. Bodadilla Muchino of Mexico and I. Acquah of Ghana, arrived in Seoul Sunday for a one-week inspection of nuclear reactors in Kori, Uljin and Youngkwang, as well as nuclear processing facilities. They begin their official duties by examining documents and records on management and storage of nuclear fuel and comparing them with on-the-spot field studies. They will change the batteries and film of surveillance equipment and seal some areas when necessary. Storage of used nuclear fuel will also come under investigation. Officials said the IAEA conducts routine inspections every two months of the heavy-water reactor at Wolsung and every four months of the other eight light-water reactors. The inspectors will first visit the Seoul office of the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) to study records on its research reactor and management of nuclear fuel. They will then tour the research center at Taeduk science town and check KAERI's research facilities and manufacture of heavy- water fuel as well as its processing of Australian uranium. They also plan to investigate KAERI's light-water fuel manufacturing company to check its use and storage of uranium imports.
