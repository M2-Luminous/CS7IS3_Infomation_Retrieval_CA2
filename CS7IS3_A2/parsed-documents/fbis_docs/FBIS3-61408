Kamenskaya; UDC 621.039.337+546.799] [Abstract] Previous work on the possibility of obtaining M[.sub]22[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] actinoid clusters showed that all bivalent actinoids having an electron configuration of [f[.sup]n- 1[/]d[.sup]1[/]][.sup]2+[/] are capable of co- crystallization with Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/], and the possibility of individual actinoid cluster synthesis was demonstrated. However, attempts of such synthesis by classical means proved unsuccessful. Other attempts by electrochemical means also proved unsuccessful. In the present work, an attempt of An[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster synthesis (where An = Th, U, and Np) from melts resulted in reduction to the metallic actinoid, and it was concluded that actinoid cluster synthesis from melts is not possible by this method.
