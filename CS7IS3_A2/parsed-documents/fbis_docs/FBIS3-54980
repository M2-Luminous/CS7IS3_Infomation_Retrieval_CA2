The transformation of the Presidential Guard, which is directly attached to President Geydar Aliyev, into a "regular army" has brought the victory nearer. The guardsmen are being trained at a location some 50-km from Baku to adapt to any natural environment. The Azerbaijani commanders in their turn have been trained by the officers of the Turkish Armed Forces. The Discipline of the Turkish Army The [Azerbaijani] commanders are saying: "We were trained by Turkish officers. Had we received this training beforehand, the Armenians would not have been able to occupy our lands." Indicating that their military discipline is fashioned after the discipline in the Turkish Army, the commanders are saying: "The Armenians will now see how we fight. The previous defeats were not our fault. The volunteer units were the cause for our reverses. Any person wanting to fight must fight under the command of the national army."
