FR940318-2-00067 FR940318-2-00054 FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL Appraisal Subcommittee [Docket No. AS94&hyph;2] Order Terminating Temporary Waiver Relief for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Request for Comments AGENCY: Appraisal Subcommittee, Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. ACTION: Order terminating temporary waiver relief and request for comments. SUMMARY: The Appraisal Subcommittee (``ASC'') of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (``FFIEC'') is issuing an order finding that a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers resulting in significant delays in obtaining the services of such appraisers no longer exists in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (``CNMI''). Therefore, the ASC is terminating the temporary waiver relief from State appraiser certification and licensing requirements granted CNMI in the ASC's Final Order Granting Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Temporary Waiver Relief (``Relief Order''), which was adopted on February 17, 1993, and published at 58 FR 11235 (February 24, 1993). In accordance with ASC rules and regulations, the ASC is requesting comments from interested members of the public on this action, and, in the absence of ASC action to the contrary, this finding of waiver termination automatically will become final 21 calendar days after the close of the comment period. The ASC also is extending the February 28, 1994 termination date stated in the Relief Order to the final termination date specified below. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before April 18, 1994. This Order will become final on May 9, 1994, unless the ASC takes further action to the contrary. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to submit written comments should file them with Edwin W. Baker, Executive Director, Appraisal Subcommittee, 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., suite 200, Washington, DC 20037. All comment letters should refer to Docket No. AS94&hyph;2. All comments received will be available for public inspection and copying at the above location. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edwin W. Baker, Executive Director, or Marc L. Weinberg, General Counsel, at (202) 634&hyph;6520, Appraisal Subcommittee, 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., suite 200, Washington, DC 20037. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Relevant Statutory Provisions and Regulations As of January 1, 1993, Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (``FIRREA''), as amended, 1 required all federally regulated financial institutions to use State licensed or certified real estate appraisers, as appropriate, to perform appraisals in federally related transactions. See Section 1119(a) of Title XI, 12 U.S.C. 3348(a). Thus, each State, territory and the District of Columbia (``State'') should have had in place at that time its entire regulatory scheme for certifying, licensing and supervising real estate appraisers. 1 Pub. L. 101&hyph;73, 103 Stat. 183 (1989), as amended by Pub. L. 102&hyph;233, 105 Stat. 1761, 1792, (1991), Pub. L. 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2330, 2386 (1991), Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, 106 Stat. 3672 (1992), and Pub. L. 102&hyph;485, 106 Stat. 2771 (1992). Section 1119(b) of Title XI, 12 U.S.C. 3348(b), provides the ASC and the States with a degree of flexibility in dealing with extraordinary circumstances that may occur. The Section enables the ASC to waive, on a temporary basis and with the FFIEC's concurrence, any State certification or licensing requirement on a written finding that: (1) ``There is a scarcity of certified or licensed appraisers to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions''; and (2) that the scarcity is ``leading to significant delays in the performance of such appraisals.'' Temporary waivers terminate when the ASC ``determines that such *␣*␣* delays have been eliminated.'' ASC Rule 1102.2, 12 CFR 1102.2 (1993), requires a State appraiser regulatory agency (``State agency'') to address seven informational areas when requesting temporary waiver relief. The ASC then must publish a notice in the Federal Register respecting the received request and must give interested persons 30 calendar days from its publication in which to submit written comments. The ASC must grant or deny a waiver in whole, in part, or upon specific terms and conditions, within 45 calendar days of the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register . The ASC retains significant flexibility in the case of an emergency. Rule 1102.7, 12 CFR 1102.7 (1993), relates to the termination of temporary waiver orders. The ASC at any time may terminate such an order on a finding that: (1) The ``significant delays in obtaining'' certified or licensed appraiser services ``no longer exist''; or (2) the ``terms and conditions of the waiver order are not being satisfied.'' The ASC is required under the Rule to publish its waiver termination finding in the Federal Register and to solicit public comments on the finding for at least 30 calendar days. Absent further ASC action, the finding becomes final automatically 21 calendar days after the end of the commend period. 2 2 Rule 1102.6, 12 CFR 1102.6, allows the ASC to initiate an extension of temporary waiver relief and enables a State agency to request such an extension in writing. Such a request is subject to all the requirements of 12 CFR part 1102, subpart A, and therefore is processed in the same manner as an initial temporary waiver request. CNMI has not requested such an extension.
