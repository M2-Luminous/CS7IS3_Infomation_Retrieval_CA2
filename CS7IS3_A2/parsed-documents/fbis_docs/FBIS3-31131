Why are he and the deputies keeping silent when intelligence expert Brigo Asparukhov warned that the air strikes against Bosnia augur the greatest danger Bulgaria faced in the last 50 years? Is it really a consolation that the Defense Ministry has a different opinion? If the general is right our diplomats must oppose the bombings by any means, and not merely call upon the Balkan countries to refrain from interfering in the Yugoslav war. We all know that Ankara is demanding a corridor through Bulgaria in order to make its strikes more powerful. One should not be concerned about whether, by some mistake, those doing the bombing or those being bombed also strike Bulgaria. Such a danger always exists when air strikes are inflicted. However, this is the first time that one who should know about the plans of others warns publicly about the danger that exists. If Zhelev believes the intelligence chief, who is his subordinate, then he must immediately assume his role as supreme commander in chief.
