The program starts with an introduction over video footage of the State Duma in session and Rutskoy and Khasbulatov being released. The amnesty is referred to as the focal point of the week. The unidentified interviewer tells S.A. Filatov, head of the Russian president's administration, that he will ask him about the amnesty later, but first asks Filatov to speak about the decrees signed by Yeltsin last week. Filatov starts off by talking about Yeltsin's decree on the award to Patriarch Aleksey II of All Russia of the Order of the Friendship of Peoples on the occasion of his 60th birthday. He praises the patriarch for his work towards the stabilization of society and congratulates him. Filatov states that 50 decrees were issued last week in all. He briefly refers to the decree on the release of Kazannik from the post of procurator general and his replacement. He discusses the two trends at the State Duma -- those who wish to get off to a fresh start without any investigations,and those who want to mark a political victory. Filatov does not perceive agreement among the parliamentarians in spite of such decisions as the "memorandum on accord. The interviewer comments that a lot seemed to happen on the night of Friday to Saturday, and asks Filatov what he learned on a visit to the prosecutor's office today. Filatov complains that the procuracy was also riven with differences. He says that there seemed to be an instruction to release those amnestied as soon as possible. He notes that the president as the guarantor of the constitution was powerless to do anything about what happened. The interviewer notes that Filatov spoke to the president this morning and asks Filatov what Yeltsin's reaction was. Filatov replies: "Well, the president is naturally concerned about what happened. Undoubtedly he is. The greatest perplexity is evoked by the fact that he addressed a definite message to the State Duma. He asked them to explain a number of positions, because in that message in general the question is formulated of it not being an amnesty but a pardon. This is the prerogative of the president alone. He asked for an explanation of these issues. At least one might have expected that no action would be taken until a reply was received to that message. Well, when it was necessary the Supreme Soviet even used to meet at night. If it was an emergency situation, the State Duma could have been convened quickly. They are here. They had not yet left Moscow for anywhere else. Therefore, if it is a question of an emergency or is becoming a question of an emergency, then one should react to that in the relevant manner. But to simply carry out the decision of the Duma just like that, or to compel it to be carried out, so to speak, without even replying to the president's message, is not just lack of respect, but one cannot even find the words to describe it. If there was such a a hurry -- the first question I put is why it was done in such a tearing hurry. Furthermore, they even told me that a duty officer was sitting in the editorial office of the State Duma, waiting to print the document in a hurry, and it was to be sat on for as long as possible before it went to the presidential structures. It was to be submitted in such a way that no reaction was any longer possible. But I did not know, I thought that Saturday and Sunday might turn out to be very serious in their consequences." The interviewer asks Filatov whether executive power is ready to react sufficiently if Ampilov and his supporters organize street fighting again. Filatov replies that it is up to the State Duma to deal with that, since they have released people for whom they have taken responsibility, as it were. He stresses the need for the State Duma to understand its responsibilty and ensure the safety of the public.
