The transitional government announced an end to the fighting for 2200 GMT, 7 May and the Rwandan Patriotic Front is considering an end to the fighting for this evening. What is certain is that fighting continued in Kigali yesterday with heavy fighting taking place near the airport. The Rwandan Patriotic Front is still refusing to negotiate with the government, but it does not exclude talks with the Rwandan Armed Forces if they dissociate themselves from the government. A member of the RPF political bureau, Mr. Sendashonga, explains the reasons behind this attitude. He was interviewed from Byumba, in the north of the country, by Monique Mas: [Sendashonga] If the Rwandan Armed Forces dissociate themselves from this government, then we are ready to sign a cease-fire agreement, an agreement to end the fighting, however this does not imply the recognition of the self-proclaimed government. [Mas] What is your main objective? [Sendashonga] Obviously, it would be to take Kigali. This is the eventual objective. [Mas] Do you believe in a military solution? [Sendashonga] We believe that there are now three issues. We must be allowed to achieve the rescue of the people who managed to survive the genocide, the killings. The civilian and military elements responsible for these killings and this genocide must be rendered harmless forever; I mean, mostly the people behind the killings. We must be left to restore law and order, peace and security throughout the country and this for each and everyone. We know that there are sound elements in this army, but they are hostage to their environment and their commanders. If these commanders understand that this complicity with corrupt politicians is pointless we are ready to welcome them at any time.
