Inacker report: "Bonn Plans To Reduce Compulsory Military Service to 10 Months"] [Excerpt] Bonn -- The FRG Defense Ministry is planning new, basic changes in the size and structure of the Bundeswehr and also the duration of military service. Framework conditions are currently being worked out. Even though the Federal Government wants to avoid committing itself to exact figures at the moment, according to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, a reduction of the "present strength" has already been decided: The overall strength of the German armed forces of 370,000 men, which was set down by the two-plus-four treaty, is to be reduced to 320,000 to 340,000 soldiers during the second half of the 1990's. At the same time, compulsory military service is to be reduced from 12 to 10 months. These targets are to be examined as part of the "conceptional guidelines" -- that is, the future structural and framework data -- for the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], wants to present these guidelines to the public at the end of April. With these guidelines, the Defense Ministry wants to react to the drastically reduced defense budget and, at the same time, take into account that -- according to internal calculations by the Ministry -- as of 1996 there will be a deficit of 30,000 to 40,000 men eligible for military service for maintaining the intended Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men. In addition, the reductions are to bring about savings, with which the investment share in the defense budget, which has been considerably reduced over recent years, can be increased once again. According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, Defense Minister Ruehe plans to explain the details at a meeting behind closed doors of the Defense Working Group of the CDU/Christian Social Union Bundestag Group in Siegen on 24-25 April. One day later defense politicians of the coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party of Germany, are to be briefed on the matter. The official presentation of the "conceptional guidelines" in the Bundestag is planned for 28 April. It is still unclear whether this will be done in the form of a government statement with the participation of the chancellor or, for the time being, as a briefing of the Bundestag Defense Committee.
