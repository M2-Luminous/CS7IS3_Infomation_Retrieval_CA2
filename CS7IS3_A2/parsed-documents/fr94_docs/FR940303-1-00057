FR940303-1-00057 FR940303-1-00011 FSIS is considering issues in regard to the lack of a regulatory definition and standard for certain poultry products produced by mechanical deboning_products which are deemed to be similar to MS(S). Poultry products produced by mechanical deboning result from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle and other tissue of poultry carcasses and parts of carcasses. Over the years, the meat and poultry industries have referred to poultry product produced by mechanical deboning as ``mechanically deboned poultry'' and ``comminuted poultry,'' and have declared the product as poultry or poultry meat (e.g., ``chicken'' and ``turkey meat'') on the labels of products in which they are used as ingredients. Several red meat sausage manufacturers have alleged that without a regulatory definition and standard for poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, a disparate situation exists between labeling poultry products produced by mechanical deboning and MS(S) which poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of poultry products. FSIS has considered the appropriate course for addressing these issues and has initiated two actions in response to them. FSIS is contemplating proposing regulations on poultry products produced by mechanical deboning, and will be soliciting comments and requesting data on various tentative positions in a notice that appears elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register . The second action is the subject of this proposed rule which focuses on the meat product derived from the advances in meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined in 9 CFR 301.2(rr). FSIS now believes that advances in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems, which do not grind, crush, or pulverize bone in order to remove skeletal muscle tissue adhering to bones of livestock (i.e., bones of cattle, sheep, swine, and goats) result in a product which, unlike MS(S), is comparable to ``meat'' as traditionally defined. Since the 1970's, there has been increasing commercial production of processed meat products that are formulated with comminuted (i.e., ground) meat, e.g., hot dogs, in order to meet the demands of the market for such products. Most of the technology that has found commercial use will evolve in the form of improvements to meet the demands of consumers and industry. The demands of the industry have centered around the desire to harvest more usable protein, i.e., muscle tissue, and to find alternatives to recovering more usable protein, from livestock carcasses to meet consumer demands for the processed meat products formulated with skeletal muscle tissue obtained by mechanical removal. Mechanization also diminishes the economic implications of removing meat by hand caused by repetitive motion disorders for workers that hand-debone carcasses and parts of carcasses using knives, and by knife accidents. Industry data 2 indicate that over 300,000 cases of cumulative trauma disorder (e.g., Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) have occurred in the meat industry due to the strain of repetitive movements to remove meat from bones. The demands of the consumer and industry have resulted in improvements in meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems to improve yields and, simultaneously, to make the process better ergonomically. 2 Data received in comments from Longmont Foods and Butterball Turkey Company on Docket No. 93&hyph;008ANPR, ``Labeling of Poultry Products Produced by Mechanical Deboning and Products in Which Such Poultry Product is Used,'' (58 FR 33040) June 1993. These data are available for public inspection in the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office. Over the past decade, FSIS has monitored the tremendous strides in modernizing the meat/bone separation machinery. FSIS believes that there are meat/bone separators and meat recovery systems that are fundamentally different than the machines used to manufacture MS(S). These differences occur in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of the process of separating skeletal muscle tissue and bone. The Removal of Muscle Tissue From Livestock Bones Since the advent of automatic means of skeletal muscle tissue removal from bone using high-speed knives, e.g., the Wizard knife, machines that are classified as meat/bone separators have been developed that emulate the physical action of the high-speed knives. The advances in meat/bone separation have led to recovery systems that separate meat from bone without crushing, grinding, or pulverizing bones such that the meat is removed by shaving, pressing, or scraping the muscle tissue from the bone surface similar to the action of the hand-held high-speed knives. Thus, this meat is obtained in much the same manner as that which is obtained using traditional hand-deboning techniques, where the bones emerge separately from the meat in the process, essentially intact and in natural physical conformation. For example, the most commonly used bones would include rib bones and loin bones and would be recognized as such when they emerge from the meat/bone separation machinery. FSIS believes that the description of the bones from which muscle tissue has been removed as ``essentially intact'' is consistent with the description of the bones resulting from the removal of muscle tissue by hand-deboning using knives, including high-speed mechanical knives, such as the Wizard knife. FSIS recognizes that even with the use of hand-operated knives, e.g., in the processing establishment, at the supermarket meat counter, or by the consumer, there is the possibility of shaving, pressing, or scraping close to the bone surface so as to unavoidably remove a minute amount of the bone's surface when meat is removed. FSIS believes that this is a normal occurrence because of the difficulty in exercising precision in hand-deboning operations, and, as such, it is still in conformance with good manufacturing practices that render products safe and wholesome. Because the bones emerge from the advanced meat/bone separators in their natural shape and structure, i.e., with the connective tissue linkages that normally occur in bones, FSIS maintains that they are in natural physical conformation. Furthermore, under FSIS's longstanding boneless meat inspection procedure for meat derived by hand-deboning techniques, it is expected that the finished comminuted (i.e., ground) meat product made from the meat removed from livestock bones contains no bone perceptible to sight or touch. This result would be expected for meat derived from the advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems.
