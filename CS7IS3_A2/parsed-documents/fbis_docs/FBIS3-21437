An agreement was signed on the occasion between the three joint venture partners promoting the park: Ratan N. Tata, chairman, Tata Industries Ltd; Albert Hong, chairman, Information Technology Park Investment Pvt Ltd (ITPI), Singapore; and M.C. Satyawadi, chairman, Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB). The investment of the three partners will be in the ratio of 40, 40 and 20 per cent respectively. Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Goh felt Bangalore would soon attract a large number of persons from the region, with an increasing number coming from Singapore itself. However, the resulting boom would cause congestion and Bangalore would soon find itself tackling a problem similar to the one Singapore has been grappling with for a long time--that of balancing growth in a limited area with environmental protection. Though Bangalore's leaders had shown vision in demarcating a green belt, the problem of restructuring to meet the influx could be tackled with expertise from Singapore, Goh said. Karnataka Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily noted that the park will represent Singapore's single largest investment in India to date. He said the park had been conceived and set in motion in the quickest possible time, and this will be the state government's attitude to future projects proposed by industrialists. Singapore's Economic Development Board Chairman Philip Yeo agreed. "The launch is testimony to the initiative taken by the Government of Karnataka," he said. Ratan Tata said the park would hopefully attract companies to India for high-tech activities by providing an environment equal to or better than the best abroad. Others who spoke on the occasion included Karnataka Governor Khurshed Alam Khan and Union Railway Minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief.
