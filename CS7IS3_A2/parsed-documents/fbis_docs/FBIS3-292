Nigeria's deputy permanent representative to the UN, Isaac Ayewa, said on Thursday [3 March] that the mission had embarked on a "one-on-one consultation" with members of the UN Security Council to [word indistinct] Nigeria's side of the dispute. On Tuesday, Cameroon took the dispute to the UN when its foreign minister, Ferdinand Oyono, sent a letter to the world body requesting an urgent meeting of the Security Council over the dispute. [passage omitted] The Nigerian mission on Thursday met the Non-aligned caucus of the 15-member Security Council, of which Nigeria is a member. Ayewa said that the main thrust of the mission's efforts was to "stall the actual consideration of the subject matter" by the council to give bilateral discussions by the two countries a chance. A reliable source said Abuja would soon reply to the Cameroonian letter. "Nigeria believes in good neighbourliness, and since there is a [word indistinct] swell of goodwill between Nigeria and Cameroon, the two countries should be able to solve their problems without any international mediation," the source said. The council, presided over by the French ambassador, Jean-Bernard Merimee, the rotational president for the month of March, met on Thursday to consider its programme of work, but did not discuss the dispute. Nigeria's ambassador to the U.S., Zubair Kazaure, has also briefed State Department officials and some members of the U.S. Congress on the conflict. [passage omitted]
