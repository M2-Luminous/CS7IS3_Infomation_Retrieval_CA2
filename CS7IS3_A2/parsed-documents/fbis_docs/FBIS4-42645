RAI Director General Gianni Locatelli was also at the meeting. At the top of the agenda was the initiative by the Marco Taradash, chairman of the committee who yesterday handed over a number of documents that cast doubt on the legality of some of the management methods at the public broadcaster to the Rome prosecutor's office. Donato Bendicenti reports: [Bendicenti] San Macuto the day after the storm. Marco Taradash, the newly elected chairman of the RAI oversight committee, arrived first and he appeared to be in good spirits. He had called a meeting of the committee at 1030 and one of the possible topics for discussion was the visit that he paid yesterday morning -- just a few hours after his election -- to the Rome prosecutor, Michele Coiro. Taradash handed over a number of documents to the prosecutor which concerned the management of RAI. According to the new chairman of the overisght committee, these documents show how the company failed to fulfill its public service duties, and was instead used by the political parties. Taradash has asked if there are grounds for bringing prosecutions, and of course his visit has managed to make front-page headlines. The opposition parties are vying with each other to see which will make the harshest criticism. In fact, this morning Passiglia, a deputy from the Democratic Alliance, lodged a complaint at the prosecutor's office against Taradash. Passiglia said that if Taradash knew of illegal episodes taking place then he ought to have visited the judge immediately without waiting to be elected as committee chairman. How will the matter end? Fabrizio del Noce, who is the man in charge of Forza Italia's press communications, is skeptical. He said that, if behind gestures such as Taradash's there was the desire to break up the public broadcaster, then he would play no part in it. This is also the position of Forza Italia. The position of Francesco Storacce, who is from the National Alliance and deputy chairman of the committee, is much more hard-line. He said that serious things had happened at RAI, if not in the legal sense then certainly in the moral sense. Storacce added that he wanted to dismantle the party politics at the network and proposed that a subcommittee be set up to review the executive appointments made at RAI since last August.
