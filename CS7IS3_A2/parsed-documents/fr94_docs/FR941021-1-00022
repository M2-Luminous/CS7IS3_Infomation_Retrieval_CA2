FR941021-1-00022 FR941021-1-00007 40 CFR Part 271 [FRL&hyph;5093&hyph;2] Michigan: Final Authorization to Revisions to State Hazardous Waste Management Program AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and public comment period. SUMMARY: Michigan has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste management program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (hereinafter RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Michigan's application and has reached a decision, subject to public review and comment, that these hazardous waste management program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Michigan's hazardous waste management program revisions. Michigan's application for program revision is available for public review and comment. DATES: All comments on this proposed rulemaking must be received by 4:30 p.m. central time on November 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State of Michigan's final Authorization Revision Application are available during normal business hours at the following addresses for inspection and copying: Library of Michigan, Government Documents Section, 717 West Allegan, Lansing, Michigan; Olson Library, Northern Michigan University, Harden Circle Drive, Marquette, Michigan; Ms. Judy Feigler, US EPA Region 5, RCRA Regulatory Development Section, 77 West Jackson, Seventh Floor, Chicago, Illinois. Written comments should be sent to: Ms. Judy Feigler, RCRA Regulatory Development Section (HRM&hyph;7J), USEPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson, Chicago, Illinois. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Judy Feigler, RCRA Regulatory Development Section, at the USEPA address noted above or telephone 312/886&hyph;4179. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6929(b) have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste management program. When either EPA's or a State program's controlling statutory or regulatory authority is modified or supplemented, or when certain other changes occur, revisions to State hazardous waste management programs may be necessary. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270. The procedures that States and EPA must follow for revision of State programs are found at 40 CFR 271.21. B. Michigan The State of Michigan initially received final authorization for its hazardous waste management program effective on October 30, 1986 (51 FR 36804&hyph;36805, October 16, 1986). Subsequently, Michigan received authorization for revisions to its program effective on January 23, 1990 (54 FR 225, November 24, 1989), June 24, 1991 (56 FR 18517, April 23, 1991), and November 30, 1993 (58 FR 51244, October 1, 1993). On November 8, 1991, the Governor of Michigan issued Executive Order 1991&hyph;31, which resulted in reorganization of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), the State agency that administers the RCRA program in the State of Michigan. However, the Order did not immediately take effect due to court challenges by the State House of Representatives and environmental groups. A State Supreme Court ruling on September 2, 1993, upheld the Governor's power to organize the executive branch and lifted the stay on the Order, making the Order immediately effective on September 2, 1993. On March 10 and August 18, 1994, Michigan submitted an application seeking authorization of the revised program. The application consisted of a modified program description, a statement by the Michigan Attorney General, and an addendum to the memorandum of agreement between the State and EPA outlining the policies, responsibilities and procedures under which the program is administered. EPA has reviewed Michigan's application and has determined that the MDNR's operation of the State hazardous waste management program continued on and after September 2, 1993, without interruption, and the MDNR has continued to act as the lead State agency responsible for administering the program. EPA has also determined that the reorganized MDNR did not result in significant modification of Michigan's hazardous waste management program, nor did the Order transfer any part of the program from the approved State agency to any other State agency. Therefore, EPA does not view the reorganization as a transfer within the purview of ยง271.21(c). Consequently, EPA has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Michigan's hazardous waste program, as revised, satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. The public may submit written comments on EPA's decision up until November 21, 1994. Copies of Michigan's application are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the Addresses section of this notice. Approval of Michigan's program revision shall become effective when the Regional Administrator's final approval is published in the Federal Register . If adverse comment pertaining to Michigan's program revision is received during the comment period, EPA will publish either: (1) A notice of disapproval; or (2) a final rulemaking approving the modifications, which would include appropriate comment response. If final approval is granted, Michigan will maintain final authorization to operate its hazardous waste management program as revised. MDNR will continue to have responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitation of its revised program application and previously approved authorities. Michigan also will maintain primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA. Michigan is not seeking authority to operate the Federal program on Indian lands. This authority will remain with EPA unless provided otherwise in a future statute or regulation.
