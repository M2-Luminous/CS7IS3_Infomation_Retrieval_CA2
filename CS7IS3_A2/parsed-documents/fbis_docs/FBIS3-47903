Greater efficiency and benefit is derived from utilizing the seaport in the Islamic Republic of Iran and by avoiding the maritime transportation route in the continuously troubled Ukaranian region. In a statement to KOMPAS at the Sukarno-Hatta international airport on Saturday 8 January, Hashim Jojohadikusumo, President Director of PT Prima Comexindo Trading stated to KOMPAS that in future Bandar Abbas will become an important transit port for the shipment of Indonesian export commodities to the former Soviet republics. According to him, the company shipped six containers loaded with consignments of Indonesian ready-made garments to Tashkent in October 1993. The consignments were found to be intact. Hashim said, "The consignments only proceeded to Tashkent after our careful study regarding the shipment of six containers through Bandar Abbas." According to the report forwarded by his company representative based in Bandar Abbas, the transhipment of the consignment at the Iranian port was rapid, safe, and the storage charges are very competitive. He said, "That is the reason we decided to use the port as a transit point for the shipment of our commodities to the former Soviet republics." It took only 47 days for the six containers to arrive in Tashkent. Hashim added that there are two benefits to be derived from using the new trade route. First, the competitively short period in shipping commodities to their destinations compared with the trade routes in West Europe and some others that were previously used by PT Prima Comexindo. Second, the journey of the commodities through Bandar Abbas is much safer by avoidng the continuously troubled Ukaranian region.
