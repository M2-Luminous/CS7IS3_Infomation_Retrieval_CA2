FR940216-0-00217 FR940216-0-00010 (v) For each of the following parameters, either gasoline or RBOB which meets the standard applicable to that parameter on a per-gallon basis or on average: (A) Toxics emissions performance; (B) NO x emissions performance; (C) Benzene content; (D) With the exception of RBOB, oxygen content; (E) In the case of VOC-controlled gasoline or RBOB certified using the simple model, RVP; and (F) In the case of VOC-controlled gasoline or RBOB certified using the complex model, VOC emissions performance; and (vi) In the case of RBOB, either as RBOB that may be blended with any oxygenate, or RBOB that may be blended with an ether only. (3) Each batch of reformulated or conventional gasoline or RBOB produced or imported at each refinery or import facility, or each batch of blendstock produced and sold or transferred if blendstock accounting is required under §80.101(d)(1)(ii), shall be assigned a number (the ``batch number''), consisting of the EPA-assigned refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender registration number, the EPA- assigned facility registration number, the last two digits of the year in which the batch was produced, and a unique number for the batch, beginning with the number one for the first batch produced or imported each calendar year and each subsequent batch during the calendar year being assigned the next sequential number (e.g., 4321&hyph;4321&hyph;95&hyph;001, 4321&hyph;4321&hyph;95&hyph;002, etc.). (e) Determination of properties. (1) Each refiner or importer shall determine the value of each of the properties specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section for each batch of reformulated gasoline it produces or imports prior to the gasoline leaving the refinery or import facility, by collecting and analyzing a representative sample of gasoline taken from the batch, using the methodologies specified in §80.46. This collection and analysis shall be carried out either by the refiner or importer, or by an independent laboratory. A batch of simple model reformulated gasoline may be released by the refiner or importer prior to the receipt of the refiner's or importer's test results except for test results for oxygen, benzene, and RVP. (2) In the event that the values of any of these properties is determined by the refiner or importer and by an independent laboratory in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section: (i) The results of the analyses conducted by the refiner or importer for such properties shall be used as the basis for compliance determinations unless the absolute value of the differences of the test results from the two laboratories is larger than the following values: ␣ 1Fuel property 1Range Sulfur content 25 ppm Aromatics content 2.7 vol % Olefins content 2.5 vol % Benzene content 0.21 vol % Ethanol content 0.4 vol % Methanol content 0.2 vol % MTBE (and other methyl ethers) content 0.6 vol % ETBE (and other ethyl ethers) content 0.6 vol % TAME 0.6 vol % t-Butanol content 0.6 vol % RVP 0.3 psi 50% distillation 5 ○F 90% distillation 5 ○F API Gravity 0.3 ○API (ii) In the event the values from the two laboratories for any property fall outside these ranges, the refiner or importer shall use as the basis for compliance determinations: (A) The larger of the two values for the property, except the smaller of the two results shall be used for MTBE, ethanol, methanol, or ETBE for calculating compliance with all requirements and standards except RVP; or (B) The refiner shall have the gasoline analyzed for the property at one additional independent laboratory. If this second independent laboratory obtains a result for the property that is within the range, as listed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, of the refiner's or importer's result for this property, then the refiner's or importer's result shall be used as the basis for compliance determinations. (f) Independent analysis requirement. (1) Any refiner or importer of reformulated gasoline or RBOB shall carry out a program of independent sample collection and analyses for the reformulated gasoline it produces or imports, which meets the requirements of one of the following two options: (i) Option 1. The refiner or importer shall, for each batch of reformulated gasoline or RBOB that is produced or imported, have the value for each property specified in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section determined by an independent laboratory that collects and analyzes a representative sample from the batch using the methodologies specified in §80.46. (ii) Option 2. The refiner or importer shall have a periodic independent testing program carried out for all reformulated gasoline produced or imported, which shall consist of the following: (A) An independent laboratory shall collect a representative sample from each batch of reformulated gasoline that the refiner or importer produces or imports;
