While the calamitous deaths and the nightmare of the massacre of civilians have cast their shadow over the residents of the oppressed city of Gorazde, UN officials, the Security Council, and Western leaders are seeking a political solution for the crisis of the city of Gorazde, which is on the verge of falling. This is the West's new tactic in response to the world's rage and concern and the horrific nightmare the Gorazde residents are facing. It is a pattern of behavior on the basis of the new rule of acting and interfering after the tragedy. The objective behind this new tactic is to officialize the presence of the Serbs inside and around Gorazde and to delineate the political map of the area on the basis of its current military situation. And this will grant the Serbs the legitimacy they need. Basically, the Serbs prefer to have Gorazde, on the basis of a political agreement, in the war, not as an aggressor to be confronted and with whom the people are enraged. The Muslims and the leaders of Bosnia too may have no alternative. This comes at a time when the world of Islam is silent and indifferent. In this case, the West and the United Nations and the Serbs will emerge victorious and respectable from this bloody and calamitous game. With this new tactic, the West will achieve its political objective, which is the political crushing of the Muslims in Europe, in addition to the propaganda success that the Bosnian crisis was solved by politics. Once they dominate, occupiers, aggressors, and their mentors support political solutions so that they can thus legitimize their aggression and what they have gained through such solutions and portray confrontation with such solutions as illegitimate or doomed. The Westerners also hope to calm people with this game. The Serbs too will achieve one of their most important military and political objectives and will gain full control of east Bosnia. Basically speaking, there could be no better condition than this for them to reap the political fruit of their savage military and inhuman crimes. But behind this deceitful and bloody game, it is clear that even if the United Nations and the Western officials can apparently prevent the fall of Gorazde, they can no longer prevent the fall of the values of Western culture and of the prestige and credibility of the United Nations in the eyes of the world. Gorazde today reminds the world of Islam of the tragedy of the fall of Andalusia into the hands of the crusaders and of the fall of holy Jerusalem into the hands of the Zionists and it will thus leave a great mark in the history that is in front of Islam and the West.
