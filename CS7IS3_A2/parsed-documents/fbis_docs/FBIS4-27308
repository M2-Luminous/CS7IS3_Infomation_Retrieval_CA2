It is not only the blood vessel of the revolution, but is also the cornerstone of the revolution, which links generations into one lifeline in the course of the revolution. Only when the revolutionary tradition is purely carried on can the revolution constantly advance along the straight road designated by the leader [suryong] and all sorts of hardships and trials be surmounted. Historic experience and the situation shown in today's revolutionary movement have left a bitter lesson that the revolution runs off its track, its generations are cut off, and the precious revolutionary gains won with blood by the preceding generations and patriotic revolutionary forefathers are lost when it fails to firmly defend and purely maintain its lineage. This was eloquently proven by the collapse of socialism in East European countries. Today our party and people are resolutely safeguarding, defending, constantly inheriting, developing, and enriching the anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition created by the great leader under the wise and tested leadership of the dear comrade leader. All successes attained by our people in their rewarding struggle to consummate the chuche revolutionary cause are the immortal merits attained by our dear comrade leader in the course of brilliantly inheriting and developing the anti-Japanese revolutionary tradition. The revolutionary tradition of our party and people is a most brilliant one unprecedented in the history of the movement of socialist, communist revolution in terms of the profoundness and richness of its contents, in terms of its width and depth, and in terms of its driving force and vitality. Our revolutionary tradition is the great chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition, the one and only tradition of this world, which was created by the great leader and which is being purely inherited and developed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. On the days of the arduous and bloody anti-Japanese resistance the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song brilliantly created the immortal chuche idea by embodying the demands of the times and the aspirations of the people and pioneered the revolution independently and creatively. On this course he provided the glorious chuche revolutionary tradition, which is the cornerstone for ages to come. The chuche-oriented revolutionary cause that the great leader constantly developed and enriched on the days of building of a new democratic Korea after national liberation and on the days of leading the totally new socialist revolution and construction to the single road of victory following the fierce fatherland liberation war is being further deepened and developed on the historic march road on which the dear comrade leader is modeling the whole society after the chuche idea. The revolution's guiding ideology, guiding theory, and guiding method which are the guiding principle in revolutionary struggle and construction are extensively and broadly embodied in our revolutionary tradition and the noble revolutionary achievements and rich struggle experience is reflected in it. This is why our revolutionary tradition is shining as the immortal banner which firmly ensures the consummation of the chuche revolutionary cause and as the brilliant beacon which opens an infinitely bright path ahead of our revolution. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our party has consistently and resolutely safeguarded and defended the glorious revolutionary tradition created by the leader [suryong] and is extensively inheriting and developing in conformity with the demands of modeling the whole society after the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader defined it as an important task to resolutely defend the chuche revolutionary tradition provided by the great leader on the days of his anti-Japanese resistance and takes it as an invariable iron rule to purely defend the chuche revolutionary tradition and to apply it in the revolution and construction. One day in October 1964, when our party entered a new stage in the course of its development, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il called in a functionary and urgently told him that the tradition that we advocate is not a tradition of mere patriotism but a chuche revolutionary tradition, in other words, it is not only a problem related to the historic roots of the party and the revolution, but is also a problem related to the bloodline which carries forward the party and the revolution. Hearing the dear comrade leader's unique ideology and theory on the revolutionary tradition, the functionary was deeply moved by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's firm faith and strong will to firmly defend the purity of the revolutionary tradition. [Text] Also, during the days of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's on-the-spot guidance of the revolutionary battle site in Yanggang Province, the precious revolutionary tradition achieved during the anti-Japanese armed struggle period was 100 percent succeeded and 100 percent fulfilled. Therefore, he once again clearly elucidated the rock firm position and strong will to complete the Korean revolution to the end as intended by the great leader. One-hundred percent succession and 100 percent fulfillment. This is a high intention of the dear comrade leader who said that this was a cherished desire of the many Korean communists who passed away first after sacrificing their lives to defend the headquarters of the revolution. When this kind of firm faith and iron-like will of the dear comrade leader was echoing along the mountain ridges of Mt. Paektu, this made all the people's hearts wrapped up in a solemn feeling. The dear comrade leader cleanly washed out all kinds of odds and ends with Paektu's clear spirit and energy and firmly adhered to the chuche-oriented bloodline. Therefore, he maintained our party into a militant and iron-like party that has vigor and our people into an invincible force who are firmly united around the party and the leader. What is the most beautiful song our people like to sing, and what song do our people enjoying singing the most today? That song is the revolutionary song highly sung by the members of the Saenal Juvenile League of Musong during the dawning of our revolution, and it is an immortal revolutionary song proudly sung by the first youth vanguards of Korea on the advance road of our revolution in admiration of the great leader. What are the immortal towers most magnificently and most highly rising on this land today? They are the immortal historic revolutionary monuments which were established in each sacred track left by the great leader during the arduous period when our revolutionary cause was being pioneered for the first time. Beginning from Mt. Paektu, there are revolutionary battle sites and historic places of revolution everywhere in our country. In all revolutionary battle sites and historic places of revolution including Mangyongdae, Ponghwari, Mt. Paektu, Samjiyon, Chongbyong, Pochonbo, Popyong, Wangsejan, they are permeated with the great leader's revolutionary history and immortal revolutionary achievements in which he made his way through the thorn thickets of the arduous struggle in the forefront and led our revolution to the one road of victory and glory. Reflecting our people's earnest desire to convey the great leader's immortal achievements generation after generation, the dear comrade leader energetically led all the work in maintaining all the country's revolutionary battle sites and historic places of revolution. Therefore, revolutionary assets of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle period were revived in its original form. Thus, it was possible to advocate, adhere to, and eternally elucidate the great leader's revolutionary struggle history, revolutionary activities, and lofty leadership achievements generation after generation. It was also possible to wholly, purely, and extensively succeed and develop the chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition achieved by the leader, and it was possible to be elucidated as a revolutionary asset of a far-reaching plan and a cornerstone of the revolution. Embodying the revolutionary tradition in the revolution and construction, and the life and work is the course of developing and inheriting the revolutionary tradition and, on this course, the revolutionary cause can be inherited and consummated. The purpose of developing and inheriting the revolutionary tradition is consummating the revolutionary cause till the end by thoroughly embodying it in the people's work and life, and in every domain of the revolution and construction. If the revolutionary tradition is not embodied, it would only remain as a legacy or a historic fact, and lose its vitality as an origin of the revolution development. Accordingly, the dear comrade leader has launched the historic march of modeling the whole society after the chuche idea and lifted high the revolutionary slogan urging the people to carry on their overall social life in the way the anti-Japanese guerrilla army did. "Producing, studying, and living in an anti-Japanese guerrilla army way," the slogan calls on the people to inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition to today's life and worksand, thus, fully bloom the tradition. The slogan carries the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's resolute faith and will to endlessly inherit and develop a revolutionary treasure which the great leader himself achieved during the period in which our revolutionary cause was pioneered for the first time. The slogan calls for inheriting and embodying the revolutionary tradition in everyday thinking and mental activities, not keeping it as a mere historic record or a knowledge. The presentation of such slogan has brought about a new landmark not only in the economic and cultural construction, but also in the people's way of thinking and work. How is it that the upright spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle flutter in every domain of our country's construction and production? How is it that the wind of speed campaign furiously came up? How is it that the entire country turned into an anti- Japanese guerrilla army-style learning site which resembles the university of revolution and the studying ground of (?Madanggou and Paeksughan)? How is it that the entire country is filled with the ranks of forerunners of communist virtues, hidden heroes, and hidden men of merit? How is it that the Song of Comrade is warmly resounding from the hearts of not only the first generation of the revolution, but also the second and third generations? This is because the dear comrade leader is giving upright guidance to consolidate the glorious chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition as an everlasting footstone of our revolution and a durable foundation for the cause of modeling the whole society after the chuche idea, and to embody the tradition in everyone's work and life. No matter how stern and dark the situation may be, we are surmounting the imperialists' ever-aggravating maneuvers to isolate and crush us in the way the invincible anti-Japanese guerrilla army did -- overcoming all sorts of difficulties with firm confidence in victory and optimism. Likewise, we are creating a new history of endless upsurges and advancement in the socialist construction. Because there is the dear comrade leader, a true hero of heroes, a great commander of commanders, and a great figure of our time, our people are accelerating the construction and revolution in the way the people did on the days of the anti-Japanese struggle even though so many years have passed. Kang Yong-sil, lecturer at the Korean Revolutionary Museum, speaks about her impression felt during her meeting with numerous visitors at home and abroad and foreign friends who came to learn the chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition: [Begin Kang recording] The chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition which was created by the great leader and which is being purely inherited and developed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong- il is a loftiest and purest revolutionary tradition which cannot be found in elsewhere. Because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il defends, adheres to, inherits, and enriches our revolutionary tradition, our revolution is winning victory after victory, unflinching even under whatever hardships and trials as the spirit of anti-Japanese struggle and the temperament of Mt. Paektu. Hence, we take it as honor and pride to have such chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition which is incomparably better than anything else in the world. Numerous foreign friends and guests who visited the Korean Revolutionary Museum unanimously envied the Korean people for having the chuche revolutionary tradition and fervently extolled the Korean revolutionary tradition as the one and only tradition of the world. Asking who has brought the Korean revolutionary tradition into full bloom, they then praised the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the greatest and the most excelled inheritor and leader [yongdoja] of the chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition. Whenever they praise him, we cannot help taking greatest pride in being the Korean people who have the great chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition. We, as in the past, will fully unfold our revolutionary tradition under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [End Kang recording] Truly, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's lofty achievements -- making the chuche revolutionary tradition which was created amid the arduous anti-Japanese flame be inherited for good without loosing its glare even if myriad years pass, and letting boundless vitality and attraction be displayed even in the future communist society -- will glorify for all ages to come, and will push forward our people's revolutionary struggle to consummate the chuche- oriented revolutionary tradition. Today, our people have won the world-renowned fame for being proud and glorious people who have the great chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition. With invincible faith, our people are fighting and living staunchly even under the situation in which the imperialists' anti-socialist, anti-Republic maneuvers are getting more vicious than ever. This is because there is the wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], and the brilliant revolutionary tradition of having smashed the formidable evil imperialist enemy. Our people, as in the past, will invariably defend and adhere to the chuche-oriented revolutionary tradition and glorify it for all ages to come. Bearing in mind lofty meanings inscribed on trees by anti-Japanese fighters with writing brushes, we will fight and live in the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu as during the days of anti-Japanese struggle without missing one foot. The road we are traversing now is the road of revolution which reaches the secret camp of Mt. Paektu. On this road, we will consummate the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause for sure by inheriting the anti-Japanese revolutionary spirit to next generation and faithfully upholding the leadership of the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.
