This was stated by Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan while addressing a function in Lahore last night. He categorically stated that Pakistan has not withdrawn its resolution on Kashmir from the UN Human Rights Commission and has agreed only to defer the voting on the resolution, which is still effective and can be taken up at any time. Appreciating the Islamic Conference Organization's [ICO's] support on the Kashmir issue, the foreign secretary said the ICO has unanimously approved resolutions on Kashmir five times in the past. These resolutions have greatly helped to generate sympathies for the Kashmiri people, who are waging a struggle to achieve their right of self-determination. Shaharyar Khan said India cannot renege on its promise to allow a visit of a mission comprised of envoys from Islamic countries to assess the repression committed in occupied Kashmir. He disclosed that Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's special emissary is arriving in Islamabad today to discuss this particular issue. He said India's acceptance of this proposal is on record.
