[Longuet] We have two reasons to be happy: France, which is already the fourth-ranking export nation in the world, is seeing new markets open up. Thanks to French-U.S. cooperation, we will now be able to introduce the famous social clause for which we have been calling. As it will take time before such a clause is adopted, it is better to raise the issue right away. It will be included of the work schedule of the World Trade Organization (WTO), that will see the light of day in 1995. [PARIS MATCH] Will this agreement help us find a way out of the crisis? [Longuet] It does constitute a serious boost for our economy. Thanks to the rules of the game accepted by all the signatory countries, we will have a stable economic framework which is more beneficial to the development of trade. The growth rate of world trade is twice that of the world economy. [PARIS MATCH] Are you not worried by that many of our companies will relocate in the future? [Longuet] Companies must get used to a permanent reallocation of roles. We must help certain sectors, those that are more exposed than others, to adapt. Take the clothing industry, for instance. We will help this sector to become more upmarket and to protect its brand name policy. There are many positive aspects of the GATT agreement in this connection, notably the respect for intellectual property. [PARIS MATCH] And what about the negative aspects of GATT? Are there any? [Longuet] I regret that countries like India and Pakistan did not join with us in opening up their markets to a greater extent. They want to benefit from the advantages without accepting the discipline. [PARIS MATCH] Is the United States not the clearest winner out of GATT? [Longuet] No, the clearest winner is Europe! Admittedly, the United States is more powerful in economic terms. They wielded a very large stick which enabled them to have their way. From now on, the stick will be more in the hands of the future WTO, which will become the policeman of world trade. [PARIS MATCH] The French foreign trade surplus in 1993 (89 billion francs) is vast. Will that performance be repeated in 1994? [Longuet] Our surpluses will not be as large in 1994. As our economy improves, companies will invest in new equipment, some of which we shall purchase from abroad. This will further reduce our trade surpluses, but, at the same time, our companies will continue to conquer new markets. Consequently, we will again achieve a significant surplus in 1994. [PARIS MATCH] Changing the subject, as president of the Republican Party, were you happy with the choice of Dominique Baudis as the majority's top candidate for the upcoming European elections? [Longuet] We would have preferred to see Jean-Francois Deniau nominated, but now we have Dominique Baudis. Since he was designated, he will be our candidate. We shall support him loyally so that the RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-Union for French Democracy] union scores the best possible result in the European elections. [PARIS MATCH] That hardly sounds enthusiastic. [Longuet] It is support without any reservations.... [passage omitted]
