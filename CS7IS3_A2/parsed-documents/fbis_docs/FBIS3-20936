To attain its ambitious goal, in a context in which acquisitions are at a forced standstill, and in which double-digit growth is a thing of the past, this Cap Gemini Sogeti [CGS] subsidiary is banking mainly on a new organization and on a shift in strategy toward the most promising sectors in terms of growth. "Overall, French industry's spending on computerization last year totaled Fr92 billion, of which Fr29 billion went into software and computerization services alone," says Gerard Mezin, general manager of Cap Sesa Industrie. This figure can be expected to grow at an average rate of 8.6 percent annually, approaching Fr40 billion in 1996, and to represent approximately 35 percent of the industrial sector's computerization budgets. "With the big enterprises reducing their investments in computerization, the growth of the market is currently being fostered by the medium-sized industries." A Cap Sesa survey of the major industrial sectors indicates fields of activity that are still largely underequipped. The food processing industry devotes not more than one percent of its revenue to information processing, versus around 12 percent for the aeronautics and defense industries. The automobile, steelmaking, and petrochemical industries devote between 2.5 and 3.5 percent of their revenue to this need. Based on these findings, the CGS subsidiary has decided to shift to a new operational organization, effective 1 January 1994, involving market development units designed to sell to specific sectors and to centers of expertise specializing in a particular type of services or applications. This should enable Cap Sesa Industrie to better attack the market and occupy niches with high value-added potential.
