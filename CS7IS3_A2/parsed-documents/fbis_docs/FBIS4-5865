The areas in and around Pailin: On 12 April, we attacked and seized control of the general command post of the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government at Boeng Pralit. Its commander fled back to Pailin. At 1400 on 12 April, we seized five enemy soldiers and two T-54 tanks. On the morning of 12 April, we fired at enemy trucks, damaging two of them and setting two others on fire in the southern part of Phnum Veng north of Route 10. Also on 12 April, we set an oil tanker on fire in an area between Phnum Yat and O Ta Vau. We still control O Rum-el and Ba Tang So. We have continued to attack Pailin with infantry forces and artillery fire. 2. On the eastern part of Pailin: We set another military truck on fire, south of Phnum Srang hill adjacent to Phnum Veng. All troops on the truck were killed or wounded. We continue to control Sala Krau. Here is the situation on 13 April. The invading forces of the communist Vietnamese puppets and two-headed government have begun to collapse bit by bit. They have been plunged into confusion. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea is attacking them from all directions. They have run out of ammunition, food, and medicine. Many of those who were killed or wounded were left scattered about. Nobody cares about anybody else. Their supply routes have been cut off completely for several consecutive days now.
