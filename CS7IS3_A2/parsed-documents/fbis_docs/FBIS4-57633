Stock market expert Eduardo Moraes said the losses also can be attributed to the withdrawal of foreign investors from the stock market because they were responsible for about 30 percent of the financial operations in the field. Moraes added that stock market investors were frustrated by the end of the constitutional reform, the apparent failure of former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidential campaign, and the privatization program's slow implementation.
