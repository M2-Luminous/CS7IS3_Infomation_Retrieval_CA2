The conviction followed a plea of guilty to one count of a multiple-count criminal indictment. Mega Computer was convicted of knowingly violating the Act by exporting from the United States to Singapore United States-origin computer equipment without the validated export license required by the Export Administration Regulations (currently codified at 15 CFR Parts 768&hyph;799 (1994)) (the Regulations). Section 11(h) of the Act provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, 1 no person convicted of violating the Act, or certain other provisions of the United States Code, shall be eligible to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the Act or the Regulations for a period of up to 10 years from the date of the conviction. In addition, any export license issued pursuant to the Act in which such a person had any interest at the time of its conviction may be revoked. 1 Pursuant to appropriate delegations of authority that are reflected in the Regulations, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, exercises the authority granted to the Secretary by Section 11(h) of the Act. Pursuant to §§770.15 and 772.1(g) of the Regulations, upon notification that a person has been convicted of violating the Act, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, shall determine whether to deny that person permission to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the Act and the Regulations, and shall also determine whether to revoke any export license previously issued to such a person. Having received notice of Mega Computer's conviction for violating the Act, and following consultations with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, I have decided to deny Mega Computer permission to apply for or use any export license, including any general license, issued pursuant to, or provided by, the Act and the Regulations, for a period of 10 years from the date of its conviction. The 10-year period ends on March 23, 2002. I have also decided to revoke all export licenses issued pursuant to the Act in which Mega Computer had an interest at the time of its conviction. Accordingly, it is hereby Ordered:
