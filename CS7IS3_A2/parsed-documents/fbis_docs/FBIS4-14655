The units are located at 242 sites and facilities. There are 827 trucks belonging to the Northwestern Army Group, which are currently assigned to economic enterprises. At the ammunition depots in Cekule, there are 60 freight cars filled with explosives, in Garkalne -- 300. In reply to a question from DIENA at a press conference held by the Democratic Party on Wednesday [23 March], Ilgonis Upmalis, chief of the Bureau for Army Withdrawal Control, expressed his anxiety over Russia having not yet submitted a timetable for full withdrawal of its troops, which makes it impossible to establish commissions to assume control over military facilities. Moreover, the agreement, which was initialed last week, foresees that the timetable should be confirmed by both sides. I. Upmalis stated that the commander of the Northwestern Army Group has been asked many times to at least show the Latvians the mentioned timetable, but each time the answer is negative. As DIENA has already reported, Russian Ambassador to Latvia Aleksandr Rannih had affirmed to Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs Andrejevs that the timetable is ready, but cannot be supplied before the agreement is signed. I. Upmalis reported that approximately 60 freight cars are being withdrawn each month from the ammunition depot at Garkalne, so now is the latest time possible for the agreement to be implemented, for otherwise it will be impossible to remove 300 freight cars full of ammunition by 31 August 1994. The Bureau for Army Withdrawal Control has calculated that Russian Army units still stationed in Latvia owe a combined debt of 9,865,031 lats for unpaid taxes and services already rendered.
