To be called the National Intelligence Agency, the new service will operate for an interim period prior to a fundamental reorganisation of the intelligence services. The high-level political tug of war comes amid reports that President Nelson Mandela has agreed to cede control of intelligence matters to his deputy, F.W. de Klerk, in an apparent barter for ANC control of the police and the South African National Defence Force. Senior sources say "De Klerk is attempting to grab control of intelligence," with Mandela -- who is officially minister of intelligence -- still studying the implications of delegating his authority. Intelligence officials familiar with the integration debate are understood to have advised Mandela against including intelligence in the national unity trade-off. They fear that unless the intelligence services report to the president, they could continue to function in a partisan manner. Inclined towards the NP [National Party] by tradition, they could become a powerful weapon in De Klerk's hands in the run-up to the next election. Senior ANC officials have indicated that structures currently being finalised will ensure presidential control of the shadow services. The new intelligence dispensation is likely to include four agencies. Military Intelligence will return to its classic role of information gathering and analysis on potential threats to the sovereignty and integrity of the country. Police intelligence could be restricted to information gathering on criminals, including international gun runners and drug dealers. The current premier political intelligence service, the National Intelligence Service, is to be divided into two agencies, one responsible for domestic surveillance and analysis, the other involved in international work. It is unclear whether any or all of the agencies will have police powers such as the right of arrest, or whether the German model of a strict separation of powers will be followed. A national intelligence co-ordinating mechanism, most probably a committee made up of the heads of all the agencies, will report to a state secretary for intelligence in the president's office. This is likely to be a political appointee, possibly ANC security chief Joe Nhlanhla if Mandela holds on to intelligence.
