The Sino-New Zealand relations have been developing steadily since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1972 and the parliaments of the two countries have also kept in contact, Qiao said. He believed, the current visit by Tapsell would play important role in advancing the relations between the two parliaments. Both China and New Zealand are in the Asia-Pacific region and are both attaching great heed to the region's peace and development, Qiao said, adding a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region would benefit the world as a whole. In this sense, the NPC wished to promote the cooperative relations between the two countries through joint efforts. China had made great achievements over the past 15 years thanks to the reform and opening to the outside world and the prospects are still brighter, Qiao said, adding however, efforts of several generations are still needed before China could catch up with some developed countries. Therefore, he noted, the Chinese Government has maintained an "objective and cool-minded" attitude in its future economic development. Tapsell is New Zealand's first speaker from the opposition party and the first speaker from the indigenous Maori people. He said New Zealand has been shifting its trade and economic ties focus from the traditional European Market to the Asia-Pacific region, in particular to China, which has registered a high economic growth. Among those present at the meeting was vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun who also greeted the speaker at the airport upon his arrival Sunday [3 April]. Zhu Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, held talks with NZ [New Zealand] delegation on a wide-range of issues of mutual interest.
