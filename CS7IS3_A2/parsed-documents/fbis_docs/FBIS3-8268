It is a question of the offensive which the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army began after the Croat-Muslim agreement was signed in Washington. The offensive had also been announced on several occasions in the media by the chief of their General Staff, Army General Rasim Delic, and the chief of the Supreme Command, General Sefer Halilovic. The Serb army statement adds that in the past few days the Muslim army stepped up the concentration of its forces from the 117th Muslim brigade, 208th shock Muslim brigade, and of new units brought in from Kakanj to the areas of Gracanica and Lukavac. Offensive actions have already started against Ozren, Trebava, and Doboj. [passage omitted] The statement also warns of a link between the commands of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], and also representatives of the EU observer mission staying at the Internacional Hotel in Zenica.
