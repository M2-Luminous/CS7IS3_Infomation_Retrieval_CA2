"We want a correct channel to solve the fishing problem with Vietnam," Bunthan told THE NATION. Vietnam has always insisted there must be an end to poaching and violation of its waters by Thai fishermen before there can be any cooperation on joint fisheries development. Since the beginning of this year, Vietnamese authorities in Soc Trang Province have seized 11 Thai fishing boats and 67 crew members on charges of violating their waters. Three trawlers and 17 crew were freed after paying heavy fines last month. Last year, at least 80 Thai trawlers and 788 crew were seized by the Vietnamese. The ambassador said he believes the two countries will eventually agree on a solution to the fishing issue, but it may take time. The two sides have mutual interests to share, he said. "The fishing industry cannot survive without cooperation," said Bunthan, referring to Thai expertise in fishing technology and the abundant fish resources of Vietnam. On Jan 25, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet ordered that all fishing licences given to foreign companies be revoked within three months to allow the Ministry of Aquatic Resources to review the fishing sector. Ministry of Fisheries deputy chief of cabinet Nguyen Trong Binh said some of the agreements had been violated and others were unsuccessful. But Binh did not say the violators were all Thais. Binh said some companies kept parts of the catch to sell back home and others trawled in waters reserved for local fishermen. "We want all foreign fishermen to respect the law... otherwise we cannot allow them to continue in business," he said. Affected by the order were four Thai fishing companies: Hoc-Thepnarong and Thai Phochana in Minh Hai, Surat Canning in Kian Giang, and Sirichai in Vung Tao. An informed source said Thai fishing companies in Vietnam hope to continue in business despite the revocation of their licences. Their prime concern is how to recover the millions of baht they have already invested. "There is no clear answer from the Vietnamese side so far on what criteria they will use to liquidate the assets put into the deal," said the source, who asked not to be named. It is very difficult to clear the assets as in most joint ventures the Thais put capital into offices, vessels and other facilities and the Vietnamese invest in land.
