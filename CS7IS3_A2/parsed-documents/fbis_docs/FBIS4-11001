FBIS4-11001 "drlat077_b_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Haiti State Department Charged With Coup Complicity State Department Charged With Coup Complicity FL2004173194 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 20 Apr 94 FL2004173194 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] The Movement of Young Patriots [MOJEP] calls on the healthy forces of the country to stand in the way of the stateless persons. Those who staged the coup wanted to create a situation favorable to drug trafficking, according to statements by a MOJEP official. [Begin unidentified MOJEP official recording, in Creole] Press declaration by MOJEP: We in the coordinating body of MOJEP call on the Haitian people to (?understand) why the Haitian Army and parliament staged the coup d'etat. (?The reason why) all phony political leaders, senators, and deputies of the State Department have plotted against democracy in order to crush the people is to maintain thieves, drug dealers, and zenglendos [pejorative for those who carry out tasks for the Macoutes] within the Army and crooked dealers in the parliament. This is due to the fact that the State Department knows that if President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns to power, it will not be able to lead properly the drug trafficking in the country. In that sense, MOJEP calls on all militants, people's organizations, and staunch political parties that side with the people to throw their support behind President Aristide's battle so democracy can be established in the country.
