In section 9038.1, new paragraph (f) would be added, to read as follows: §9038.1 Audit. * * * * * (f)(1) Sampling. In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of related audit findings. A projection of the total amount of violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may become the basis, in whole or in part, or any audit finding. (2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding concerning excessive or prohibited contributions shall respond only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee demonstrates that any errors found among the sample items were not excessive or prohibited contributions; were timely refunded, reattributed or redesignated pursuant to 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) and (3); or for some other reason were not errors; the Commission shall make a new projection based on the reduced number of errors in the sample. (3) The committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the total amount of any contributions not refunded, reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3). 29. In section 9038.2, the introductory language of paragraph (b)(2) would be republished, and paragraph (b)(2)(iii) would be revised, to read as follows: §9038.2 Repayments. * * * * * (b) Bases for repayment *␣*␣* (2) Use of funds for non-qualified campaign expenses. *␣*␣* (iii) The amount of any repayment sought under this section shall bear the same ratio to the total amount determined to have been used for non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds certified to the candidate bears to the candidate's total deposits, as of 90 days after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For the purposes of this paragraph_ (A) All matching funds certified in response to matching payment submissions received by the Commission as of the candidate's date of ineligibility will be treated as though they were certified as of the date of ineligibility; (B) Total deposits is defined in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.3(c)(2); and (C) In seeking repayment for non-qualified campaign expenses from committees that have received matching fund payments after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review committee expenditures to determine at what point committee accounts no longer contain matching funds. In doing this, the Commission will review committee expenditures from the date of the last matching fund payment to the candidate, using the assumption that the last payment has been expended on a last-in, first-out basis. * * * * * 30. Section 9038.7 would be added to read as follows: §9038.7 Administrative record.
