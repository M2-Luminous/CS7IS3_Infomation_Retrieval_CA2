As many as 24,800 highly qualified experts (12.9 percent) discharged from defense enterprises, 8200 people -- from military research institutes and design bureaus, he reported. As he said, "there has occurred decrease of traditional markets to sell this products due to their high price and reduction of demand for military products and military orders."
