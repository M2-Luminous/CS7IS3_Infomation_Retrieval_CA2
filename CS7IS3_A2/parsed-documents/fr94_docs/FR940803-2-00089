FR940803-2-00089 FR940803-2-00070 [Docket No. 91&hyph;66; Notice 3] Chrysler Corporation; Petition for Renewal of Temporary Exemption From Three Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards Chrysler Corporation of Highland Park, Michigan, has petitioned for a renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 92&hyph;1, expiring August 31, 1994 (57 FR 27507) which was granted covering three Federal motor vehicle safety standards, for electric-powered multipurpose passenger vehicles (``TEVan''). As of June 10, 1994, the company has produced 52 TEVans under the exemption. Its petition for renewal was accompanied by a copy of its original petition, and NHTSA interprets this as an indication that the company is repeating its original requests and arguments. The TEVan is an electrically driven version of the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager multipurpose passenger vehicle. If the exemption is renewed, modifications will be made to production Dodge and Plymouth vans manufactured between September 1, 1994 and August 31, 1996. Although a successor to the current van will be introduced within this time frame, ``electric conversions of that new platform will not be ready for production initially'' and Chrysler is planning ``to produce the current TEVan versions until the new electric conversion units are ready for introduction.'' The TEVan was developed in cooperation with the Electric Power Research Institute, U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium, and the United States Department of Energy. The basis for the petition was that a temporary exemption would facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle, as provided by 49 CFR 555.6(c). The vehicles use electric motors powered by nickel-iron or other equivalent batteries that replace the internal combustion engine. According to Chrysler, the TEVans meet the California Air Resource Board zero emission requirements, and are low-emission vehicles as defined by section 123(g) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The TEVan differs from regular production vans as follows: the internal combustion engine, transmission, coolant system, power brakes, gasoline fuel system, and power steering system have been replaced by an electric drive motor, a nickel-iron or equivalent battery pack, a micro-processor based battery management system, a controller-converter-charger unit, a two-speed manual/automatic transmission, and electric-motor-driven pumps for the vacuum power brakes and the hydraulically assisted power steering. Finally, the hot water heater/defroster unit is replaced by an electric resistance type heating/defrosting system. The TEVan is based on production vehicles certified as complying with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. However, it does not comply with the portions of the standards indicated below. 1. Standard No. 101, Controls and Displays. S5.1. The TEVan is equipped with a state-of-charge gauge to serve as an indicator of reserve battery power, rather than the fuel gauge required by the standard. 2. Standard No. 102, Transmission Shift Lever Sequence, Starter Interlock, and Transmission Braking Effect. S3.1.2. The requirement for transmission braking effect is met by regenerative braking, in which the electric motor becomes a generator, recharging the batteries and dissipating energy in the process. Regenerative braking can be switched off at the option of the driver to restore steering control on slippery surfaces. S3.1.3. The starter interlock mechanism is deleted since there will be no electric starting motor. S3.1.4. The automatic transmission shift mechanism is replaced with an electric switch control device that operates in a similar manner. 3. Standard No. 105, Hydraulic Brake Systems S5.1. The performance of the service brake system is predicated on the use of the regenerative characteristic of the drive motor to augment the power-assisted hydraulic wheel brakes. The motor, driven through the transmission by the mass of the coasting vehicle, functions as a generator to dissipate energy through charging the drive batteries. Chrysler has never conducted tests using regenerative braking, however, tests of a conventionally powered weighted simulation of the TEVan indicate that the TEVan will meet the stopping distance requirements of S5.1.1. In the fade and recovery test, S5.1.4, the distance specified between the starting points of successive brake applications at 60 mph is 0.4 mile. The TEVan cannot accelerate to 60 mph in that distance, so the test cannot be conducted as prescribed, but based on the performance of a simulated TEVan, the TEVan could comply if it could accelerate as specified. On TEVans equipped with anti-lock brake systems, the regenerative braking is disabled during hard stops that actuate the anti-lock feature of the brakes. According to the original petition, an exemption would facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle by enabling the petitioner to develop the electric drive motor, battery controller, battery, and other subsystems to increase the efficiency and durability of future generations of electric vehicles. The petitioner requested extension of its exemption for a two-year period beginning September 1, 1994. In its original petition it argued that the exemptions will not unduly degrade the safety of the vehicles because the vehicles from which the TEVan is adapted are certified as conforming to the standards. Chrysler observes in its petition for renewal that its ``field experience to date would indicate no negative result if this extension was granted.'' Finally, petitioner originally argued that granting the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act because it would accelerate the development of electrically-driven vehicles and related technology which could help to reduce the dependency on foreign oil. Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above. Comments should refer to the Docket No. 92&hyph;1; Notice 3 and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated below will be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Notice of final action on the petition will be published in the Federal Register pursuant to the authority indicated below Comment closing date: [30 days after publication of the notice in the Federal Register ].
