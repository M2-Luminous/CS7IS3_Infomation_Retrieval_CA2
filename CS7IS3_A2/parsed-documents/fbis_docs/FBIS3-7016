Komeito, which has led the moves together with Shinseito, has recently been quiet on the issue. Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa is gradually shifting his emphasis to partnership with the JNP, while maintaining friendly ties with Komeito. Other coalition parties are keeping their distance from Komeito. As a result Komeito members are becoming anxious about their party's isolation in the coalition government. Executives of Shinseito, JNP, and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] met on the evening of 17 March and reconfirmed their accord to form a "new party." Komeito, however, did not join the meeting. This looked somewhat odd because Komeito had been the most enthusiastic about "new party" proposal. After the dispute over Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's introduction of a public welfare tax, the Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist group which serves as Komeito's primary sponsor, reportedly expressed concern that an alliance between Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa gave the public a strong impression of collusion on the issue. Komeito members also complained that the "Shinseito-Komeito" initiative was an attempt to reshuffle the cabinet. It seems Ichikawa is doing his best not to advertise his links with Ozawa for the time being. Komeito will probably watch merger talks between Shinseito and the JNP, and decide on its response depending on how the issue develops. Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent lower house member who left the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], recently met Ichikawa to urge that he have positive exchanges with other parties. Ichikawa reportedly replied: "If I take action right now, people will again criticize the Ozawa-Ichikawa link."
