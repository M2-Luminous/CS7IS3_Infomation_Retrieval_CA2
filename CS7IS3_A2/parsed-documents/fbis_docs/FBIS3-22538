Four children who had hemophilia contracted the HIV virus because of contaminated blood used in transfusions. The blood plasma was imported from abroad. The Chinese Government banned the import of plasma immediately after that case. Additional HIV infections were found among intravenous drug users in the southern border province of Yunnan in 1989. Since then, China has identified more than 1,150 cases of HIV carriers, and 19 people have become afflicted with full-blown AIDS. At present, 85 percent of those infected with the AIDS virus in China are intravenous drug users. The border area with Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia is the most infected area because of its long history of opium trade and drug abuse. This area is still backward economically and far from urban areas. Transportation is limited. Radio and television sets, which can be used to warn people about the dangers of contracting AIDS, are rare, and medical service is not always available. In addition, cultural habits are responsible for some of the infections, as the local Dai and Jingpo ethnic groups believe opium is a cure for headache and diarrhea. Planting and processing opium is banned by the government, but it is difficult for the small police force in the area to eliminate the illegal practice when the villagers plant opium in very small fields in the dense forests. Another problem is the shortage of needles, forcing many of the drug users to share needles. This causes the disease to spread even faster. The Chinese Government has set up a clinic in Yunnan to monitor AIDS cases and educate the public about the dangers. But getting the information out is very difficult. Zhu Wei is working as a researcher with the AIDS surveillance center under the China Academy of Preventive Medicine. He has worked with the local teams in Yunnan Province. [Begin recording; Zhu Wei is briefly heard, speaking in Mandarin, fading into English translation] The local people know little about disease that is threatening their lives. When talking with them, we need interpreters in Dai and Jingpo languages, because these people do not speak Mandarin, and most of them do not know how to read and write. The only thing they care about seems to be drugs. Every year the AIDS surveillance center sends a number of researchers to Yunnan to help with the local work and get firsthand information. I went to Yunnan last year. A lot of local medical workers who know the languages and have knowledge of AIDS went to every family with us, explaining the fatal disease to them. We put up a poster warning about the danger of AIDS in the villages. We paid special attention to the families that already had AIDS patients or HIV carriers. We talked to the family members on how to protect themselves from being affected. And now and then, the local medical workers visit these families to see how things go on. [end recording] Though drug users make up the majority of AIDS victims in China, they are not the most dangerous factors of the spreading of AIDS in the country. Medical experts say the most dangerous factor is promiscuous sexual activity. For more than three decades after the founding of the PRC, Chinese successfully protected themselves against venereal diseases. However, while the opening and reform programs that began in the 1980's have brought prosperity to the country, they have also caused dramatic changes in people's ideas about morality and sex. Cases of prostitution are increasingly rapidly every year. The number of people who have sexual partners outside marriage is increasing, and sexual activity among young people and teenagers is now occurring much earlier. The number of venereal disease cases has increased dramatically. In 1991, sexually transmission accounted for 10 percent of the total number of HIV cases. In 1992 it was 20 percent. The rate is still growing.
