The orphans who were taken by the ICRC to the border village of Rilima had been tended by Belgian and Italian nuns. ICRC spokesman Paul-Henri Morard said most children were ethnic Tutsis. Trucks which made the Nyanza trip also carried 250 patients from a Nyanza hospital and 250 ICRC staff and local workers. Since the weekend the ICRC has also evacuated 105 patients from its overcrowded hospital in a government-controlled area of the capital to the King Faisal hospital in a district held by the rebels, according to Morard. Five hundred wounded are still in the ICRC hospital. French General Raymond Germanos meanwhile said in Paris French troops would evacuate 40 nuns from the west Rwandan village of Kibuye to the headquarters of the French intervention force in Goma, Zaire, on Tuesday. The nuns from Canada, Rwanda, the United States and other countries were "highly afraid" after threats, he said.
