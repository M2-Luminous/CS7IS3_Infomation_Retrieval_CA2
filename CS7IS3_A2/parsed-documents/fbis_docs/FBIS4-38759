The framework document was signed on Wednesday at the NATO headquarters here by Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev, who is currently paying an official visit to Belgium at the head of a Kyrgyz state delegation. Taking the floor during the signing ceremomy, Akayev noted that the world was no longer divided into opposite blocs, but the process of the Soviet Union's disintegration proved to be painful; it is accompanied by conflicts and crises in the economic and other spheres of public life. "This is why Kyrgyzstan is turning its attention to international unions, set up by the civilised mankind -- the United Nations, the CSCE, the NATO, etc. It shares the idea of partnership as an expression of its conviction that the stability and security of every country can be ensured only through joint actions," Akayev stated. The president reaffirmed the adherence of his country to the principles of freedom and democracy, stressing that liberty and human rights were at the bedrock of Kyrgyz state policy. "But the road of democratic and market reforms proved longer and more difficult than initially anticipated. Exploiting the difficulties of the country, the communists, nationalists and other conservative forces are endeavouring to turn back its development. The crisis can be overcome only in conditions of a strong democratic state and through cooperation with the international community," he stated. The president specially stressed America's huge role in the support given to the independent Kyrgyzstan. Acting NATO Secretary-General Sergio Balancino noted the alliance's readiness to cooperate with Kyrgyzstan in many areas, beginning with peace-making operations and ending with the creation of democratically controlled armed forces. He noted Akayev's role and efforts to implement democratic reforms, to promote the freedom of speech, and to guarantee the rights of all the citizens of the country and of its national minorities.
