In view of double-digit unemployment figures, the European Trade Union [ETU] Federation delegation's talk with FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl focused on employment policies, Austrian ETU President Friedrich Verzetnitsch later told journalists in Bonn. The implementation of the proposals on combating unemployment that are contained in Commission President Jacques Delors' white paper will also increase employees' preparedness to deal with Europe, Verzetnitsch said. According to Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel, Kohl also affirmed that the planned guidelines for the establishment of European works councils, part-time work, and limited employment are a major priority for Bonn. ETU Secretary General Emilio Gabaglio; Dieter Schulte, newly elected chairman of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB); Roland Issen, chief of the German Salaried Employees Union (DAG); and FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian Democratic Union) also participated in the discussion. The European Union unionists's visit to Kohl, planned a long time ago, took place on Schulte's first working day in his new office. Because of the traditional character of this meeting before the takeover of the Council presidency, which changes every six months, Schulte said he did not assess his visit to the chancellor's office as his first formal visit there.
