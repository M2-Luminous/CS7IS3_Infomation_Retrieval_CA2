The coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been pleading with the LDP to agree to convene the two-chamber consultative body comprising 10 legislators each from the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. In a meeting with reporters, Hosokawa hinted that he would explore the possibility of arriving at a compromise on political reform bills through the proposed joint panel. The calls for the consultative body became loud after the upper chamber on Friday voted down Hosokawa's package calling for completely redesigning the mechanism for electing members of the powerful lower house. The directors of the lower chamber's Diet Steering Committee from the ruling and opposition camps are slated to assemble Monday to discuss convening the proposed two-chamber conference, they said. If they agree to put the proposal to set up the consultative body to a vote, the lower chamber will vote on the proposal Tuesday, coalition officials said. LDP opponents of Hosokawa's package are urging the LDP leadership not to agree to the establishment of such a consultative body, saying it may open the way for formulation of a compromise package, they said. If the lower chamber votes to ask the upper chamber to set up the consultative body, the body would immediately start talks for reconciling differences between the coalition's package and the LDP's counterproposals, the officials said. Unless Hosokawa could secure LDP consent to hammer out the compromise package, he would be forced to observe his oft-repeated vow to "take the responsibility" -- an euphemism for disbanding the cabinet or dissolving the lower chamber, they said. Appearing on a television program, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe urged the LDP leadership on Sunday not to agree to work out a compromise package that would replace the current multiseat constituency system for the lower house with any system comprising single-seat districts.
