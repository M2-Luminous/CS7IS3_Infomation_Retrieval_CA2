U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is touring Central and Latin America, has continued the campaign started at the end of the week by President Clinton's pronouncements. Apparently, the secretary of state's task is to rally American countries to such an extent that they allocate military contingents to overthrow by force the regime that has held sway in this island state since the expulsion of democratically elected President Bertrand Aristide. Although the U.S. Administration acknowledges that the people will be the chief victim of any blockade, it is intensifying the blockade stranglehold as the final means of exerting pressure before a direct military invasion. At the end of last year U.S. marines were on the verge of launching an assault on the Haitian coast, but the White House withheld the order to attack at the last minute. In accordance with Bill Clinton's doctrine, the United States does not intend to participate in any peacemaking operations (that also involve measures to restore democracy and the rule of law in foreign states) unless it is as part of a coalition. The United States has frozen the Haitian leaders' deposits, banned them and members of their families from visiting the United States, and confined flights from Haiti to the United States to commercial flights, carried out in accordance with schedules that were apporoved a long time ago. One factor that has contributed to the hardening of the U.S. line is the Haitian military authorities' gradual strengthenning of their regime. It is claimed that the military's reign of terror has led to a sharp fall in support for exiled President Aristide. The success of Secretary of State W. Christopher's trip will to a large extent determine the date of the U.S. military invasion of Haiti. An invasion by U.S. forces without the support of allies on the continent, symbolic though it may be, is considered unlikely.
