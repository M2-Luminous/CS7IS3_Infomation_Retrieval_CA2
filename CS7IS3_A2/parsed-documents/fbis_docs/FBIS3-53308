Wednesday said army's operation clean-up in Sindh was likely to continue until June. Talking to newsmen here at the exhibition of Japanese calendars, he said the police and Rangers were being retrained to handle the situation in the province. He said the government was planning to introduce police and jail reforms to improve the law and order situation in the country. The minister said the Peshawar-based Arab volunteers had been asked to leave the country before January 31. He said the government had decided not to renew the passports of the nationals of other countries residing in Pakistan. He said the government was facing some difficulties due to its earlier decision to issue passports to 150,000 foreigners. About the presence of RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] agents in the country, the minister said the number of Indians visiting Pakistan had increased manifold after the late President Zia's cricket diplomacy. He said a large number of Indians made it difficult for police to check them properly. About the process of accountability, the minister said: "We do not want to harass any one. The government has always taken the nation into confidence over major issues." Commenting on the possibility of filing reference against the Nawaz government functionaries, he said: "We should be positive." However, he said, the matter would be decided after the finalisation of enquiry report of schemes like Motorway and yellow cab. "Whoever plundered the national exchequer will be taken to task," he said. He said: "There is no emergency. We do not have much time to continue chasing them. We should be firm, the cases should not be half-baked like the previous government had done. It was just the waste of time and money." Commenting on Nusrat Bhutto's recent remarks, he said the government was stable and becoming more and more stable day-by-day. He said Nusrat referred to an astrologer and her comment was not based on any political analysis. "We do not want to be disrespectful to anyone. She is the mother of the Prime Minister, but no one is above the law. Asking the press not to exploit the family matter, he said: "Nusrat is a mother who faced many tragedies." Gen. Naseerullah Babar said the opposition was trying to satisfy their ego. "They are not harming us but the national interest," he said. Referring to Nawaz's visit to Bosnia, the minister said it should be investigated as to how he got money for the visit. He said it was up to the CBR [Central Board of Revenue] to enquire into the matter. About Mir Murtaza Bhutto, he said: "if he is declared innocent by the court, we will have no objections to his release. Let the law take its course. Murtaza Bhutto was not a political threat to the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government as he had no impact on the party." About Altaf Hussain, he said: "The MQM [Muhajir Qaumi Movement] leader will meet the same fate as Murtaza Bhutto had faced," adding that the law was same for everyone.
