After the session, Minister Ruml said that no immediate threat to the Czech Republic and its population can be derived from the analysis of the present situation. In addition to the analysis, the revised report lists the main risks and specific measures, adopted or prepared by the government, for their elimination. The legislative concept of the government in the security sphere is enclosed. The report indicates that two distinct groups of risks exist for the Czech Republic. Among the large ones, immediately affecting the stability of the political system, are especially migration, ethnic conflicts, financial scheming, and the narcotics problem. The group of small risks, threatening protection of freedoms, health, and the property of citizens, includes general crime (car theft, burglaries) and economic crime (tax evasion and fraud).
