Syrian sources said that nothing would achieve "calm and relaxation in the region" like an Israeli initiative to withdraw from the occupied territories. The sources pointed out that the policy of "evasion" has achieved nothing for the Israelis so far, and some 27 months have elapsed since the peace process began. And "the occupation has not achieved, nor will it achieve, security for Israel. Peace is the guarantee of security, and peace depends on complete withdrawal from the occupied territories." The sources said that the peace process between the Arabs and Israelis is now "at the final turning point: Either it will overcome the challenge successfully or it will fail," especially after the Hebron massacre. The sources pointed out that the Jordanian, Lebanese, and Syrian tracks have not achieved any progress so far, "as the Israelis spend their negotiations with the Jordanians talking about economic cooperation, not withdrawal from the occupied Jordanian territories." The Syrian sources, which reflect the official view, went on to say that Syria has invited the parties concerned to meet in Damascus in the light of Israel's refusal to comply with the demand for peace and withdrawal from the occupied territories. The sources said: "If a change emerges in the Israeli position to move the peace process toward the establishment of a real peace, the Arab parties will show every possible response" when the bilateral negotiations resume in Washington.
