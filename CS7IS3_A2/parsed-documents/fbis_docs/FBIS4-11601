These images clearly indicate what happened in the city of La Paz on 28 April following the COB-sponsored workers mobilizations. Without attributing responsibility to either side, and merely viewing the responsibility of the authorities in handling the situation the best way possible, Social Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado regretted the incidents at Government House. He singled out these attitudes that caused these extremely serious criminal actions against private property and individuals.

We merely sought to [words indistinct] for the talks to be fruitful because [words indistinct] on the one hand, they implement pressure measures, and, on the other hand, they participate in talks [words indistinct]. This shows a contradiction in terms: To be a friend and to not be a friend at the same time. [end recording]
