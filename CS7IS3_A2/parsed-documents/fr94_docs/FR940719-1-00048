FR940719-1-00048 FR940719-1-00015 [V]entilation of a mine is important not only to provide fresh air to miners, and to control dust accumulation, but also to sweep away liberated methane before it can reach the range where the gas could become explosive. In terms then of the safety of miners, the requirement that a mine be adequately ventilated becomes one of the more important safety standards under the *␣*␣* Act. S. Rep. No. 181, 95th Cong. 1st Sess. 41 (1977), reprinted in Senate Subcommittee on Labor, Committee on Human Resources, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., Legislative History of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, at 629 (1978). On May 15, 1992, the Agency published a comprehensive revision of its ventilation standards for underground coal mines. Because of the scope and extensive coverage of the new standards, the Agency held a series of informational meetings across the country to brief the mining public on the provisions of the new rule. As a result of these meetings and other comments received by the Agency at meetings with industry and labor groups relative to the ongoing litigation, as well as its own review of the application of the regulations, MSHA became aware of several provisions that needed to be further evaluated and analyzed. In many cases, comments received were verbal. Therefore, any references in this preamble to ``comments'' or ``commenters'' do not necessarily mean either written or formal comments. Persons wishing to formalize comments made during public meetings or other meetings with the Agency should submit their comments as a part of this rulemaking. In general, the proposed standards specified below address the stayed provisions, clarify the Agency's intent, refine the application of the rule in light of information received, and more fully address the recognized precautions and procedures necessary to avoid hazards associated with improper ventilation of underground coal mines. Major areas addressed include: examinations, including preshift examinations; recordkeeping and certification; involvement of the representative of miners in the plan approval process; escapeway dimensions; equipment in primary escapeways and fire suppression systems. These standards are intended to fit within the comprehensive structure of the ventilation rule now in effect. In addition, a segment of the mining community has asserted that certain provisions concerning the installation and removal of mechanized mining equipment were promulgated without the benefit of adequate comment. The Agency disagrees. The September 1989 explosion at the William Station Mine in Kentucky demonstrates, however, that proper ventilation during the installation and removal of mechanized mining equipment is essential and can greatly enhance the protection provided to miners in these areas. Therefore, for the purpose of receiving and giving full consideration to all pertinent comments on this issue, MSHA is reproposing each provision that addresses the installation and removal of mechanized mining equipment, and is soliciting comments for each. The section-by-section portion of the preamble discusses each provision affected and the proposed rule sets out the reproposed language. Since publication of the ventilation rule, the Agency has received comments stating that Atmospheric Monitoring Systems (AMS) should be permitted to operate by battery backup during fan stoppages and not be required to be intrinsically safe. The commenters indicated that the information thus provided by the AMS would assist the operator in obtaining information regarding the underground conditions of the mine. To allow the battery backups would require a revision of §§75.311(h) and 75.313(e). The Agency solicits comments on the merits and the effect on safety of allowing battery backups and conditions, such as low methane levels, that must exist if they are permitted to be used. Also, since publication of §75.383, the Agency has received comments suggesting that older miners be allowed to individually decline participation in escapeway drills. The Agency is not proposing any revision to §75.383; however, comments are solicited as to the appropriateness of providing an option which would allow miners to individually ``opt out'' of escapeway drills, and the circumstances under which miners would be permitted to ``opt out.'' The Agency solicits comments on the specific provisions addressed in this proposal. Comments received that also address other provisions will be considered to the extent that they address the issues relevant to this proposal. B. Section-by-Section Discussion Section 75.301␣Definitions Since the final rule became effective on November 16, 1992, it has come to the attention of the Agency that the §75.301 definitions of intake and return air are being interpreted in a manner not wholly consistent with the original intent. Under the proposal, the definition of return air would be modified to more clearly convey the intended meaning. Instances have developed where operators desire to take air from an intake air course to ventilate shops, electrical installations, or for other purposes, and this air is then coursed directly to the surface and is not used to ventilate working places. Under one reading of the existing definition, because this air has not ventilated a working place or a worked-out area, the air in this air course cannot be considered return air. Therefore, a violation could exist in that the air ventilating the shop, compressor, or electrical installation was coursed into an intake rather than into a return as required. This was not the intent of the Agency and no safety benefit is associated with such a result.
