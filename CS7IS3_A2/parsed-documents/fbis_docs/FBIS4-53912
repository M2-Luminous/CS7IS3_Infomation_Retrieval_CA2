This was emphasised by both Deputy Prime Ministel Brigadier General [BG] (NS [National Service]) Lee Hsien Loong and Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing at a press conference held after the inaugural meeting of the Joint Steering Council (JSC) for the Suzhou project yesterday. Chaired jointly by BG Lee and Mr. Li, who is here on a five-day visit, the JSC is the bilateral body which oversees the development of the Singapore-style Suzhou Township. Its members include ministers and senior officials from key ministries and agencies of Singapore and China. Among Singapore's representatives are Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong; the acting minister for national development, Mr. Lim Hng Kiang; and Rear Admiral (NS) Teo Chee Hean, the minister of state for finance. BG Lee said that Singapore's software transfer programme to Suzhou should not be treated merely as a commercial investment project. While Singapore has helped pay for part of the software transfer programme, "finance is not an important part of this project," he said. If the project could, in some small way, help China prosper, it would be in Singapore's long-term interest, he noted. Furthermore, he said Singapore would derive enormous benefits by developing "a long-term understanding with Chinese officials at many levels who would rise over the years." A successful Suzhou, he added, would also "provide another outpost for Singapore in its efforts to go regional." Under the software transfer arrangement, Singapore will help provide public administration and management skills needed for industrial township development to Suzhou officials. So far, nine officials from Suzhou have been attached to various statutory boards in Singapore to learn about urban management as well as economic development and financial management. If successful, BG Lee noted, the Suzhou experience could then be replicated in other township developments in China. On its parts, said Mr. Li, China would adopt a very flexible approach towards the Suzhou project in order to help ensure its early success. As an example, he pointed out that the Jiangsu Provincial Government had decided to make an exception by transferring the administrative authority of five towns which were affected by the township project, but which were not part of Suzhou City, to the Suzhou Municipal Government itself. That would allow the Suzhou Industrial Township Authority, a Jurong Town Corporation-style statutory board that will be set up soon, to have better control over the entire township development. BG Lee said Singapore will continue to share its experience on industrial township development with Suzhou as long as the latter finds it relevant and useful. But the initiative for the "software transfer" will have to come from the Chinese side, he noted. "You have to decide what is relevant to China's needs which priority areas to focus on, and how to adapt Singapore's experience for use in Suzhou. Singapore will proceed as quickly and as extensively as the Chinese officials want to," he added.
