Over the past few days it had already become clear that Moscow (for the time being) feels unable to consolidate such a cooperative link with the Western alliance. The reason given by Kozyrev, his colleague Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, and others, was that the United Nations and NATO did not inform them about the air strikes launched against Bosnian Serb positions. Moscow describes this as a breach of confidence and as proof that the West is still not prepared to regard the Russians as full partners. Moscow wishes to express its displeasure at this, authoritative sources claim. While nobody would deny that the latest developments in Bosnia have indeed not gone as the Russians might have wanted (the United States, in particular, is emphatically attempting to weaken the position the Russians have built up for themselves), this alibi is far too comfortable. So the question arises as to whether Moscow has not merely waited for an appropriate moment to put off its rapprochement with the West. After all, in February the Russians themselves agreed that the UN commanders in Bosnia had the authority to request NATO actions. So they knew that no further approval by the Security Council was necessary in this respect. For anyone within NATO it is clear that the Russian hesitation to sign up with the Partnership for Peace can be directly attributed to the power struggle over foreign policy which has long been fought out behind the scenes in Moscow. Although "ultranationalist" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would appear to have been neutralized, his influence is still filtering through in many circles. He is playing on the latent fear among the Russian people that from now on Russia will only be a second-rate power. Figures like Kozyrev, who is regarded among the pro-Western Russians, are not in a sufficiently strong position to turn around the tide of nationalistic, anti-Western feeling. They cannot convince their opponents that it would be advantageous for Moscow to cooperate with NATO. Moreover, it is noticeable that President Boris Yeltsin is not playing any role in this debate, possibly the clearest indication yet that he is finished. Consequently, Moscow is immediately confronting NATO with a new dilemma. The Partnership for Peace, limited though it may be, was not only a way of offering the countries of Central and East Europe a prospect of NATO membership, but was also intended to set off the dangers of a shattering Soviet Union. By bringing Russia and other former republics into play in a cooperative alliance, the West counted on averting potential unrest within the armed forces. However, that calculation presupposed that Moscow would play a subordinate role to Washington. Now that Moscow appears unprepared to do this, NATO is once again faced with problems that it thought it had solved. A Partnership for Peace without Russian participation is dangerous. The hardliners in Moscow could exploit such a situation by asserting that the West is indeed out to isolate Russia. That would not benefit pro-Western elements. However, such a situation merely consolidates the worst fears of the countries of Central and East Europe. They were scared to death of a development whereby Russia would once again adopt an anti-Western stance while they had no guarantee of security. Precisely that is now threatening to happen. The Partnership was meant to give all parties involved the time they required to prepare for full NATO membership. There would now appear to be little chance of any quiet preparations. NATO diplomats will once again have to show all their creative flair to find a way out of the situation.
