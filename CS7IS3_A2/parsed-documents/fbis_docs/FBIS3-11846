[Text] Kidnappings of incumbent or would-be legislators and of their spouses or relatives; taking mayors and councilmen hostage; selective assassinations of regional political leaders; bombings of political headquarters...Besides their customary destruction of the nation's assets and violence against law enforcement, the guerrillas are now bent on "making their presence felt" in the elections. And what a way of doing it: by killing, kidnapping, and setting fires. It is ultimately a pitiful cry of political powerlessness. It is a clumsy, brutal attempt to show that they have not yet become criminals through and through, that they still have something to do with politics. This is why they are going about disrupting the elections. But what is it that they want? This is something that no one has been able to figure out. Aside from their by now timeworn platform of cliches and generic slogans (against militarism, Yankee imperialism, the oligarchy, multinational oil corporations, foreign capital, privatization, etc.) we have not heard a single proposal that would suggest to us that they have a specific, viable, credible agenda for Colombian society. Their pathetic lack of ideas and suggestions came to the fore during the long months of talks in Caracas and Tlaxcala, where the Guerrilla Coordinator failed to offer a single proposal that would set the stage for serious negotiations. It is also true that the 1991 constitutional reform left them without major arguments. Their petrified discourse about the closed, cliquish nature of Colombian democracy was laid to rest by the many political guarantees, social rights, and minority protections that the new constitution established. But unlike the M-19, EPL [Popular Liberation Army], PRT [Revolutionary Workers Party], CRS, Quintin Lame, and other armed groups with some political vision, the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] and the ELN [Army of National Liberation] never understood or even wanted to understand the profound institutional change and democratic opening that the Constitutional Convention represented. History passed them by. They were left without arguments or proposals. But they held on to their weapons and to the cool millions that they make from kidnapping and extortion. And now they want to make themselves felt in the election campaign in order to demonstrate that they still count, that they are still interested in politics. And there they are, engaged in the only thing that they know how to do. There is talk that the guerrillas are conducting their kidnapping campaign to soften up the political class and build a future negotiating base. But this brings us back to the same point: To negotiate what? On what conditions and with what proposals? The guerrillas in Central America undertook negotiations. They had suggestions and proposals and showed that they were indeed interested in putting down their weapons and were not addicted to violence or corrupted by money. In Mexico, the emergence of the so-called Zapatist Liberation Army might make the ELN and FARC believe that the armed struggle is indeed still valid. But the emergence of this group was due to the specific conditions of backwardness and oppression besetting the Indians in Mexico's poorest province, and it is striking a responsive cord nationwide by questioning a political system (one that is indeed closed and cliquish) in which the same party has held power since the days of Emiliano Zapata. Commander Marcos, who has turned out to be something of a poet as well, has already declared that the talks with the government "are on the right track" and has expressed his desire to arrive at a just solution and lay down his arms. He is thus not trying to perpetuate the armed struggle or turn it into a profession or lifestyle, as the Colombian guerrillas are, by all indications. Unable to accept the rule of law, set their weapons aside, and embrace the dynamic, changing realities of a country that has left them behind, the FARC and ELN want to show that they still count for something by disrupting the elections as much as they can. They are not going to succeed in preventing elections from being held anywhere in the country, except in some isolated village. They have neither the military might nor the political credibility to do so. This does not mean that they cannot create serious disruptions, as they are in fact doing with their rash of political kidnappings. There is no way, though, to guarantee that the State can protect the thousands of congressional hopefuls, nor can the Armed Forces prevent the guerrillas from blowing up checkpoints or staging ambushes. An attack on a toll station guarded by women is hardly a show of military might, as General Adrada rightly pointed out in recent days. But there are likely strategic targets that could be better protected. Electric power plants, for example, or communication pylons like the one that they blew up on Monday in Cerro de Guasca, cutting off contact with that region of Cundinamarca. If the past election campaign was marked by the atrocities of the narcoterrorists, with a macabre death toll of three presidential candidates, this campaign will bear the stigma of guerrilla violence. This seems to be the tragic fate of a country with a democracy that is permanently under fire. But nothing lasts forever. Colombia has already put the nightmare of narcoterrorism behind it. And although it may take somewhat longer, Colombia will also cast off the yoke that the guerrilla criminals are endeavoring to impose on it.
