The forests in this province can only provide firewood. And now, even the firewood is disappearing. Nearly one-half of the population of the province had made a living by cutting and selling firewood as a permanent occupation especially in the Tuk Phos, Samakki Meanchey, Kompong Tralach, and Rolea Pier districts. The decline of the forests in Kompong Chhnang Province to the level where all the forests are unable to grow means that the forests which have been cut grow back and then are repeatedly cut. Therefore these forests cannot grow large. This is only one part of the population. Another part is a group of merchants who go up into the mountains to cut the big trees illegally; the provincial forest wardens fear this group and do not dare arrest them because when they leave the forest they always have carloads of armed guards to protect them. Mr. Sarun, Deputy Chief of Agriculture responsible for provincial forests has reported that they do not know what steps to take to effectively solve this problem and keep the forest from further deterioration. At the present time, the Khmer Rouge is gradually moving to use these forests very intensively. And the collecting of taxes by the Khmer Rouge is increasing. As for the province, they have admitted to the anarchy that they are unable to protect the forests from destruction. When the Cambodian government gets new legal powers or there is an armed force to assist the province, only then will the province be effective. The chief of the provincial forest wardens has pointed out that while the province did not have large trees to saw, there were sawmills in 56 locations including 16 legal mills. In the days of the Sangkum, there were only three sawmills in the province, and ll of them received timber from Pursat Province. Every day timber flows from Pursat Province into Kompong Chhnang by the hundreds of logs. The province does not know how to close down all these sawmills and everyone seems to be waiting for a change in conditions in the country. As for the flood plain forests, Mr. Sarun found out that 20 percent has been destroyed yet the provincial water products [department] seems not to have taken an interest in the problem because the prevention of the destruction of the flood plain forests is more dangerous than the prevention of other violations. Furthermore, there is the problem of planting young trees. It is not a ve ry effective strategy. That is, it is only one way without a strategy. If we spend millions of riels on the planting of new trees, it will not be any more useful than our spending money to protect the natural trees. If the province learns how to protect the natural trees so that they can grow well, it will be better than planting new trees. The natural trees are already there and we will only have to spend money to increase protection as the best solution.
