"As an Asia-Pacific nation, the Republic of China cannot stay outside regional development. We are prepared to make our contributions to Asia-Pacific security and economic cooperation," Jason Hu, director-general of the Government Information Office, said in a speech delivered at the Yen-Ching Library of Harvard University. In the speech titled "The Prospects for a changing Asia: A Case for Open-Style Regionalism," Hu stressed that "we are willing to play an active and appropriate role under the more inclusive and dynamic political and economic framework that is taking shape in the Asia-Pacific region." However, the government spokesman pointed out a minimum military balance across the Taiwan Strait must be sustained so that the 21 million people on Taiwan can live free from worry and devote themselves to economic development and political reform. "It can also give us a sense of security in dealing with the People's Republic of China, and foster the confidence to promote positive interaction between the two sides," Hu said. In his speech, Hu also pointed out that the number of potential crises in the region has fueled the desire for a Southeast Asia regional security system. Hu quoted ROC President Li Teng-hui as saying that such a system should start with an informal ad hoc "security dialogue," and the ROC is more than willing to join the system. Taiwan, located at a pivotal point between Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia, "surely would constitute an indispensable link in the Asian security system and among partners in the security dialogue." Turning to the ROC's mainland policy, Hu said Taiwan is bent on maintaining non-official channels of communication, strengthening people-to-people exchanges, mapping out economic and investment activities, and increasing a bilateral "win-win" consensus.
