Three of them claimed that they had heard shots fired from more than one direction, and suggested that Barukh Goldstein did not carry out the killings by himself. One of them said he heard the sound of hand grenades, as well as automatic gunfire. A fourth witness said soldiers prevented people from leaving the cave after the massacre and even raised their weapons, but the worshipers ignored them and went on their way.
