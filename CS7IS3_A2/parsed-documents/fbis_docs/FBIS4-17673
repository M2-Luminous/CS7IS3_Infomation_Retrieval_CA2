The concern was voiced by Azerbaijani parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev who had a meeting with Russian State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin on Tuesday. Guliyev recalled that earlier it had been planned to create a free trade zone on the Russian-Azerbaijani border. The speaker also called for a greater Russian role in ending the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. He said much in this respect depends on the Russian peace-keeping efforts. "We greatly want that Russia says its important word in this respect", Guliyev stressed. Political stabilisation in both countries can be promoted through better economic ties, according to him. "We count on the understanding of Russian partners" in this respect, he added.
