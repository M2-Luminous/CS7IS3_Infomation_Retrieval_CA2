At a meeting of parliamentary vice ministers, Yuriko Koike of the Management and Coordination Agency said that behind strained ties between the two nations is Japan's massive trade surplus, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama told a news conference. Koike reportedly spoke of the need to take necessary surplus cutting measures to put Tokyo-Washington ties back on the right track. Japan's global trade surplus soared to some 130 billion dollars last year, of which about 60 billion dollars was with the U.S. Washington has been increasing pressure on Tokyo to whittle down its lopsided trade surplus since the collapse of talks on a bilateral trade framework in mid-February. Aogu Matsumae, parliamentary vice minister for the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, echoed Koike's view and also called for steps to rectify the trade imbalance with the U.S. as quickly as possible, Hatoyama said. Noting relations with the U.S. are the most important bilateral ties for Japan, Morio Kimura of the Agricultural, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Tokyo must strive to maintain positive relations.
