The United States insists on its "indispensable leading role," but, if possible, it wants to "cooperate with others." Intervention in Rwanda is the "only possibility to stop the killing," the President said, but the United States should not interfere. In the case of Haiti, on the other hand, one has "hesitated for too long;" here, intervention is being considered. Accusations regarding a zig-zag course in Bosnian policy are unjustified. Nevertheless, Clinton was unable to give any specific information about how the United States intends to behave in view of the imminent escalation around Brcko, not to speak of what kind of policy is intended to be pursued in Bosnia in the long run. "Clinton helpless" was the primary impression that the President gave at his much publicized news conference in Atlanta. He announced dubious and very squishy things, while he left others out. Why has the United States emphatically supported the elected president of Haiti but, at the same time, kept silent while the military regime established itself in power and exports from Haiti to the United States rose by about 50 percent? And why does it now suddenly want to act since the streams of refugees have diminished after all? Clinton did not have much to say on the human rights situation in China nor on the conflict with North Korea. He escaped into generally known things and remained vague. In this way, he was unable to refute the criticism of the lack of concepts in his foreign policy.
