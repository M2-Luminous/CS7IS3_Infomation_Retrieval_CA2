(Valenie Denikoskov), director of the Asia Affairs Bureau of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters that Russia hopes to see the nuclear issue solved in a diplomatic and political way. He stressed that Russia would agree to the imposition of sanctions against North Korea only when all efforts for the solution of the issue were exhausted. Prior to this, in an interview with Russia's INTERFAX news agency, Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev, also said that all possible efforts, including holding international conferences, should be made before the sanctions are imposed. He added that after that, sanctions should be introduced in stages. Such remarks by officials of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs differ from those made by President Kim Yong-sam during his visit to Moscow last week. President Kim once said that Russian President Yeltsin had expressed support for the imposition of sanctions against North Korea.
