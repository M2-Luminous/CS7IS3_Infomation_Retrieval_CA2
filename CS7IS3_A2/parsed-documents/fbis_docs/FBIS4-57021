Marcos added: "If there is no democracy, a civil war will ensue in Mexico." The government "is making a mistake again by taking a hard-line position," Marcos reiterated. The morning after the meeting between Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, mediator Samuel Ruiz, and EZLN representatives, Subcommander Marcos commented on the meeting and analyzed the situation. First, he said: "We agreed to meet on EZLN territory for security reasons." Subsequently, he mentioned three issues that were discussed. First, each party talked about what each member of the San Cristobal peace talks had done. Second, they discussed the national and regional situations. Third, they reviewed the next steps to take. Marcos summed this up by saying: The EZLN lauded the courage demonstrated by the peace commissioner and the mediator to enter a territory that is not under the federal government's control. Later, the EZLN conceded that the mediator maintained the rapport and cleared the way for the dialogue. The commissioner referred to proposals made by the federal government in the 32-point document and two statements. He has worked hard in seeking a consensus on the proposals and to discuss investment and social programs in the various federal organizations. The EZLN indicated that, in agreement with its latest communique, it has resumed consultations and that in a strict time limit of several weeks, it would be ready to resume the dialogue. In this regard, Marcos believes "it is premature to talk about the dialogue, or to set a location and date. The EZLN, in accordance with its tradition, must consult all of its militants everywhere." In turn, "the committee will issue a statement." Marcos added: It is possible to finish the consultations. I do not see why they should be interrupted again. In the meeting, we reached the conclusion that we must respect and wait for the EZLN to make its decisions. Marcos spoke calmly. Throughout the meeting, Major Mario and Major Moses accompanied him on the same esplanade that witnessed the meeting between peace negotiators in Chiapas yesterday. We are facing that "different" juncture Monsignor Ruiz mentions so often. It is a time that appears to move slowly, but that [words indistinct] speed-up mechanisms themselves. Marcos said: As we speak, consultations are progressing in communities located in the depths of the jungle, and we expect answers some time next week. Marcos also expressed his concern over the national situation. A process of political peace and negotiation does not exist, Marcos stated categorically. Marcos summed it up this way: "The federal Army's efforts to support the process, remain on the sidelines, and avoid doing anything that might hinder negotiations were acknowledged during the meeting." Marcos said: "Both the mediator and the commissioner said the federal Army has withdrawn its troops, and this shows that the sectors involved are continuing the peace process. Subsequently, we talked." Marcos continued by saying: We certainly had a more pessimistic view of the national situation. Regarding the federal Army, we reiterated that there had not been such a withdrawal of troops. More soldiers have been deployed in the state than in January. But the Army's attitude has changed, avoiding provocations that emerged after the dialogue. Both officials and soldiers have showed more understanding vis-a-vis the causes of our uprising, but a reduction in the number of troops certainly has not occurred. Their belligerence has diminished, and we welcomed that change in attitude, but without conceding a reduction in troops because, as far as we know, there has only been a redeployment. Marcos added that, regarding the latest government decisions, EZLN followers told Camacho and Ruiz: The issue is not merely the seeking of peaceful as opposed to violent solutions. From the beginning, we have noticed the government has indicated clearly that it is hard-liners who are imposing their will. According to Marcos, the situation does not seem to be heading "toward a process of political peace and democratization that will eventually become a solution to the EZLN problem, but everything seems to indicate that the government is preparing to resolve this problem by force. Examples of this include: "The government's major administrative and police efforts are being channeled into repressive measures, the purchase of war material, and the creation of this new super-secretariat, headed by Farell, that replaces Cordoba Montoya. All repression has been focused on one person who has stood out in trying to smother the country's most important sector, namely, the labor sector." The Zapatist analysis prompts concern. Here is what Marcos said: If there is no democracy, regardless of the Zapatist Army and its political and military role, there will be a civil war in the country. The government is making a mistake again by taking a hard-line position against the people's demands, as if this were the solution to problems. We mentioned at the meeting that the government was making a mistake in its assessment and that the results would be a civil war in Mexico. We insist that this assessment is wrong. At this point Marcos believes the political road of negotiations should be followed, not the road of force. Marcos said: As opposed to the Zapatist Army, with which one can talk even though it does not have a face, in the case of a civil war there will be no control, security will not count, and there will be no one to talk to. Marcos reiterated that the main problem is the lack of democracy, "and even if the Zapatist Army is wiped out, this will not be the solution, unless it is a revolutionary solution." He added: "We see with concern the threat of civil war. In other words, the Zapatist Army sees this as a disaster [de la chingada]." What is going on in the country "does not convince anyone," he commented. The meeting with Commissioner Manuel Camacho and with Bishop Samuel Ruiz "was brief, lasted only two hours (although officially it was reported to be seven hours long), and reached an agreement to "keep the channels of communication open." Marcos said: "There are provisions to hold meetings such as this one in safe places, and the only safe place for the Zapatist Army is in the territory it controls." Marcos also said: The coming months (May, June, and July) are "months of hunger" in the jungle. Planting has just concluded; there are no crops, no money. Access to assistance and goods has been cut off by the military cordon. It might be good to recall, on this occasion, that the people who are going hungry are also armed. In addition, it has been learned that the majority of the humanitarian aid goes to non-Zapatist communities in the jungle, or it goes to members of organizations such as National Peasant Confederation and Rural Association of Community Interest. No matter what, the people of the region are headed toward "months of hunger" in the wake of the military cordon, which is affecting the life of the community and heightening shortages and isolation. Marco indicated: After holding consultations, there will be a response if there are conditions that will enable the resumption of the dialogue. During the meeting, which was not a dialogue, "rather, it was an exchange of reports," according to Marcos, other matters were discussed. Marcos said: Some things were discussed to help broaden mediation, things that would help maintain the dialogue. One preliminary step is to extend the gray areas to other points, given the provocation caused by the presence of belligerent forces, such as the Altamirano Association of Cattle Breeders. Once again, reference to Morelia came up, the conflicting common land next to the seat of that municipality. If peace is to be established everywhere, this place must also be included. The subcommander's conclusion about the meeting was that the session was ephemeral: Nothing specific was agreed upon because we are waiting for a reply from the consultation. After the interview concluded, the subcommander told reporters "off the record" [previous three words in English] that the PRI candidate is expected to arrive this morning in Chiapas. At the same time, Commissioner Camacho and Bishop Samuel Ruiz would be giving their news conference in San Cristobal. One of Marcos' aides heard this on the radio this morning. The PRI is going to haul off all of the reporters to Tuxtla Gutierrez, Marcos joked. No, they are not going to leave Camacho alone because they still fear him. During the conversation with the subcommander, as in other winds that blow in the southeast, a clear signal can be seen: The presidential campaigns and their results, which will come on 21 August, have no choice but to pass through the state of Chiapas. National solutions must also pass through here.
