Nato officials said this weekend that the presence of a team of US negotiators in Sarajevo could change the nature of the Geneva peace process, now that Washington -- belatedly -- has become actively involved and has thrown its weight behind Nato air strikes on Serb artillery batteries around the Bosnian capital. "The problem with the Geneva negotiations is that they failed to motivate all three sides sufficiently to make them all sign up to a peace agreement," another Nato diplomat said. "The threat of the use of force, which is real for once and other elements on the ground could really move along these talks." The current peace plan drawn up by Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, envisages dividing Bosnia into three ethnic states, nominally within a republic of Bosnia. In practice, it would link Serb and Croat-controlled areas with their respective patron republics, leaving the Bosnian Moslem statelet vulnerable and sandwiched between two hostile states. US officials, however, are unwilling to reveal what plan they will put on the table in Geneva when the talks reconvene at the end of this month. "This process (in Geneva) has made a lot of progress. But it has not been able to bring it to a close, even though the negotiators keep saying the dffferences are very narrow. "If so, why the delay? The Americans will try to stimulate the process in a different way that could get us to the end of the road," a diplomat said. In becoming more engaged at Geneva, the US wants to establish "what is the Bosnian government's bottom line" for accepting peace; work out how to cement, or at least improve relations between Croatia and Bosnia, particularly in western Herzegovina; and establish at what price President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia would make more concessions in order to have sanctions lifted. Nato diplomats believe the Bosnians could accept peace if they knew that the territory they will control will be ethnically homogenous, will have access to the sea, and will be backed by an economic reconstruction programme. "Let's be clear. If the Bosnians are forced to sign, there will be no lasting peace. Also, the US will not twist their arm to accept the present plan. That will not bring a lasting peace," a Nato diplomat said. The Croatians, who before the Bosnia war supported Serbia's carve-up of the republic between Belgrade and Zagreb, are slowly shifting their ground. In Geneva last week Croats and Bosnians discussed securing stability in western Herzegovina, especially in Mostar, the regional capital. The city, which never received the attention that Sarajevo did, is almost rubble in the wake of Croat shelling, while in central Bosnia, also off the main headlines, scores of people are killed each day in clashes between Bosnian and Croat forces. "The Croats know we are approaching the end-game, but this time from the western angle not the Serbian side. We are prepared to slap sanctions on them. They have gotten away with too much," the Nato official said. He added that President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, an ally of Mr Milosevic, is now supporting the Nato strikes. "The Croats are fickle. They back the winning side. They know the US could push for sanctions," he added. Yet the US knows it is Mr Milosevic who can, with the crucial support of some hardliners on the ground in Sarajevo, hold the key to peace. "Milosevic wants those sanctions lifted. The US is here now to motivate all the sides. We don't have a timetable. But one thing is sure. This war cannot be won militarily ... it has got to take advantage of what Nato has done. But to stop the suffering, all of them are going to have to find a negotiated political solution. That's the US message," the diplomat said. But Nato diplomats admit that even if the threat of the Nato ultimatum can put pressure on the Geneva talks to reach an eventual settlement, it will be difficult for the three sides to trust one another, either at the negotiating table or on the ground. "Each side has become so radicalised, and the Bosnians often feel they were being treated the same, as if they were equally to blame for the war at Geneva," a Nato diplomat said. He said the US would "try to promote trust" among the Bosnian delegation, and the other two sides. "It won't be easy," he continued. "But by having having the US on board, all three sides will realise that behind that presence is Nato. That could well speed up the negotiations. But nobody lays hostage to fortune in these talks."
