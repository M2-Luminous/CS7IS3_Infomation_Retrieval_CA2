Minister Granic told reporters that the talks focused on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, particularly in the light of the latest Washington agreements. He informed the Norwegian foreign minister of Croatian activities at the United Nations and the Security Council, as well as of perspectives for future negotiations with the Bosnian Serbs and the local Serbs in the occupied areas in Croatia. The Croatian foreign minister said Norway congratulated Croatia on the [Croat-Muslim] agreement as the foundation for future peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added that Norway believes the problems of the UN-protected areas in Croatia and of Bosnia-Herzegovina will have to be solved simultaneously. Minister Granic said that Norway is interested in developments in the former Yugoslavia and is ready to provide humanitarian aid and lend assistance in the reconstruction. Norway will soon hold a referendum on joining the EU [European Union], and one of Croatia's main aims is to obtain associate membership in the EU, Minister Granic said, adding that this will be discussed further. The two ministers will resume talks over a working lunch when they will discuss mutual relations. An agreement on technical and cultural cooperation, which is soon to be signed, is of special importance, as well as improved economic relations between the two countries.
