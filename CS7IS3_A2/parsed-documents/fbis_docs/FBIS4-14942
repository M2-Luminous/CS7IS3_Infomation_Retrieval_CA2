The Russian deliveries since March ten include a 80 per cent compensation for the terminated supplies of the Turkmen natural gas. Turkmenistan suspended deliveries of natural gas to Ukraine until the latter repays its debt. According to Ukrgazprom, Russia is keeping its word. On April 10, negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will continue to specify the schedule of mutual payments. The leadership of the Russian giant gas supplier Gasprom had set specific terms which have not been disclosed to the public. But ITAR-TASS has learned that the Cabinet of Ministers in Kiev is now considering the possibility of meeting the demands of the chief supplier of natural gas. Although Ukraine receives enough gas to meet its needs at present, Ukrgasprom reports that the consumption of natural gas in the republic has dwindled. This is due not only to the coming of warm spring but also to the measures taken by the government to save energy resources. Nonetheless, the temporary stabilisation of gas deliveries is not durable. The main reason is the lack of money to pay for the already consumed energy resources, and the huge internal debt owed by Ukrainian consumers to the domestic suppliers.
