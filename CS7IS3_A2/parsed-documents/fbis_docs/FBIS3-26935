The program ended at 1130 GMT on this particular day because of a special program series, "Talks on the New Taxation System," which was broadcast from 3 to 6 February. Reception ranged from poor to unmonitorable. The following is a summary of the program: 1. "Today's Hotline" commenced when the program presenter, Wen Tao, gave a brief introduction to today's topic: Management-labor relations within foreign-funded, township and town, private, and other nongovernment-run enterprises. Wen Tao cited a report carried in the 18 January issue of LAODONG BAO [LABOR NEWS], on the resignations of more than 200 employees from the Shanghai Hongxiang Department Store, a Shanghai-Hong Kong joint venture inaugurated only four months ago, over a period of 40 days. The collective resignation, Wen Tao said, was due to poor management-labor relations, and staff members complained that the Hong Kong management personnel had arbitrarily searched their lockers, disregarding their personal dignity. In one case, security guards in the department store illegally detained and publicly beat a young saleswoman from Anhui Province whom they suspected to have stolen some goods. She was detained, interrogated for 24 hours, and later fired. At about 600-700 yuan a month, the salaries of the department store staff are not high, the presenter said. He then invited listeners to call in to express their opinions on this social phenomenon. 2. A Mr. Yang called in to point out that employers and employees are equal, therefore management should not search employees' lockers. According to the law, only public security authorities have the right to do so. Illegally searching employees' lockers constituted a violation of the employees' human dignity. He stressed that a corporation can be run well only if employee enthusiasm is aroused. Wen Tao agreed with what Yang had said and said: Some bosses are good at arousing workers' enthusiasm with moderate measures, but others only attach importance to efficiency. They take ironhanded measures to deal with their workers, and put pressure on them. They fail to respect social ethics, human dignity, and self-respect. 3. A pop song was broadcast during a short break at 1047 GMT. 4. Another listener called in to express his appreciation of overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investors. He said: On the one hand, they want to make money in China. On the other hand, they also want to contribute to the mainland's economic development. Under whatever circumstances, employers and employees have common interests although there may be conflicts between them. Laws and regulations have been set up in our country to protect foreign capital, employers, and laborers. They should be strictly enforced. He urged foreign investors to take the initiative in observing China's laws concerning laborers' rights. 5. Newscast at 1100 GMT. 6. Commercial break. 7. At 1110 GMT "Today's Hotline" continued, but with poor reception. A Mr. Chen called in to invite the labor department and trade union's intervention in this sort of case. Despite reform and opening up, trade unions must still play their role. Labor departments and trade unions must send cadres to give workers lectures on laws, decrees, and regulations protecting their rights, so that they understand their rights. 9. Short commercial break. 10. Another listener pointed out that the department store management's search of its employees' lockers was "inappropriate" and "illegal." It seemed that the boss had violated employees' human rights, he said, adding that workers and staff members are protected by laws in our country. 11. Another listener called in to support the employees. He also complained about insufficient and imperfect laws and regulations in China on protecting workers' rights, which was why foreign-funded enterprises could use this loophole. He stressed that workers' rights and interests must be clearly stated in contracts. 12. A call from a Mr. Wu reminded the employees of the function of laws as a means of struggle against the employer. 13. Another listener stressed that the problem could be solved through peaceful consultation between bosses and trade unions. At the same time, he said, he also felt puzzled at the lack of impulse to stage a strike. Workers should be allowed to resort to a strike, he added. At this point in the program, shortly before 1130 GMT, the presenter cut off the caller and announced that this was the end of the discussion. He also emphasized that views aired by callers were their own personal opinions and did not represent the stance of Guangdong People's Radio Network. 14. The special program series, "Talks on the New Taxation System," began at 1130 GMT after a short news roundup. Tao Fengtan, deputy director of the provincial taxation bureau, was invited to open the program and give the first talk on the reform of the taxation system. He said: At present, the reform of the taxation system is a hot topic for discussion. Our former taxation system had been improved since reform and opening up, but it still could not satisfy the demand of economic development in various fields. There was much room for improvement -- for instance, there were many defects in the old value-added tax -- and it was necessary to reform the old taxation system. A new policy has been formulated for reforming the old system. The nucleus of the taxation reform system is to establish a standardized value-added tax. The new value-added tax is extended to the fields of industrial production, commodity circulation, imports, processing industry, repair and spare parts business, and so on. Tao added: The new income tax will standardize income tax rates and ensure the fair competition of various quarters under the socialist market economy. It will also ensure that various economic sectors start from the same starting line to participate in fair competition. In addition, we have created a new land value-added tax. The purpose in doing so is to further standardize transactions of the land and real estate market, rationally adjust the incomes from value-added land, and protect the rights and interests of the state. Tao stressed: The new taxation system will not increase the burdens of enterprises as a whole, or affect prices of goods. However, the taxes levied on certain products or enterprises may possibly change, and I hope our community will understand this. Tao also explained the reasons for recent price fluctuations and other issues.
