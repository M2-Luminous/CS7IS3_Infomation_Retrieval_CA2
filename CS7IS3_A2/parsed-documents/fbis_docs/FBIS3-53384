They issued a statement, inviting brother Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Presidential Council Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid to a meeting at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad area on 27 Rajab 1414 Hejira [10 January 1994], because they were convinced that the meeting between the brother president and the brother vice president is the first step toward a reconciliation, which would help heal the rift and rid us of the crisis. Because the ulema were concerned about the success of the meeting, they dispatched delegations to the brother president and the brother vice president, inviting them to the meeting, and asking them to be on time. That is why the ulema met at the al-Janad Mosque on 27 Rajab 1414 Hejira. The meeting continued until 30 Rajab 1414 Hejira [13 January], because they were eager to safeguard unity, contain the crisis, and identify the solutions that would spare the people calamities, to relieve them of the sufferings they are experiencing, and to thwart the efforts of Yemen's enemies to fragment it, undermine its unity, and push it into the abyss of the conflict that would confuse the population and the country. Presidential Council Chairman brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih showed up at the agreed upon mosque on schedule. He informed the ulema of the reasons and ramifications of the crisis as he sees them. He also informed them that he is willing to accept the solutions the ulema deem fit. The ulema regret the failure of Presidential Council Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid to show up on schedule. And because the ulema were concerned about his participation in the meeting, they remained in touch with the competent agencies to remind him that the ulema were continuing to wait for his attendance. They continued to await his attendance until the time this statement was issued. The ulema hold the brother Presidential Council vice chairman responsible for the consequences of his failure to attend, for his failure to respond to the ulema's letter, and for his failure to receive the delegation they sent from the al-Janad area. This is regrettable, particularly since the people are being crushed by the crisis, the hellish price hikes, and the decline in the exchange rate of the national currency. The ulema continued their meetings in accordance with the itinerary of their meetings. During these meetings, they addressed the crisis and its repercussions, as well as the security violations and the stifling economic crisis it created. Hence, and inspired by the teachings of our true Islamic religion, which is the nation's creed, its sharia, and its way of life, the ulema underscore adherence to the following constants: First, adherence to Yemeni unity as a religious duty and national necessity that must be safeguarded and defended. It must not be abandoned. [passage omitted] Second, adherence to constitutional and legal legitimacy in all that does not violate the Holy Koran and the prophet's traditions. There should be no efforts to circumvent it or act against its institutions. Third, the Holy Koran and the traditions of Prophet Muhammad, may God's peace be upon him, must be used as arbiters in all disputes and conflicts. [passage omitted] Proposed solutions: Based on all that has been mentioned, and after a study of the manifestations, reasons, and repercussions of the crisis, the ulema view the following as solutions to the crisis: First, the return to Sanaa by Presidential Council Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid in response to the appeal of the House of Representatives so that he may perform his constitutional duties. For, this is the first step toward a resolution of the current crisis. Second, ending the manifestations of fragmentation at all government and popular facilities, and merging the armies, currencies, and aviation corporations, as well as all economic institutions. Third, halting the media and military escalation and returning the camps to where they were before the eruption of the crisis. The Yemeni ulema urge all Armed Forces and Public Security personnel to observe neutrality in the dispute between the two parties to the crisis, and to place Yemeni interests above all partisan and personal interests. Fourth, fighting all kinds of corruption and the corrupt, wherever they may be, as well as their supporters, and not allowing any solutions outside the context of legitimate institutions. Fifth, the efforts made by the House of Representatives, the Yemeni ulema, and domestic and external mediators to contain the ongoing crisis and effect a reconciliation between the two parties to the crisis have failed. There has been a daily escalation in this crisis. Hence, the ulema urge the influential people in the country to convene a general Yemeni congress in which Yemenis of all governorates and sectors will be represented. In this congress, the people must be able to decide their future. The conferees have entrusted His Eminence Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 'Aziz al-Zandani and the religious scholar Judge Muhammad Bin-Isma'il al-Hajji with the task of forming a preparatory committee for the congress. They have also asked them to set a date and a venue for the congress. Sixth, the Yemeni ulema meeting at the al-Janad area have asked the Higher Committee which prepared their meeting to follow up on the implementation of their decisions, and to inform them of new developments. Seventh, the Yemeni ulema urge that the public be made aware of the dangers posed to their unity, security, and stability. Concluding, the Yemeni ulema appeal to all Yemenis to demonstrate vigilance and awareness, and not to allow themselves to be dragged behind the rumors and lies promoted by domestic and foreign media, and to act upon the words of Almighty God: O Ye who believe! If a wicked person comes to you with any news, ascertain the truth, lest ye harm people unwittingly, and afterwards become full of repentance for what ye have done.
