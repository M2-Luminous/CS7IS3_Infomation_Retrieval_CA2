N. Fomenko; place and date of interview not given: ``The First Facilities Will Begin Working as Early as in March''] [Text] The problem of organizing low-volume regional operations producing microbiological preparations within the state agricultural service is now being broadly discussed among specialists. We asked V. P. Filatov, chief of the biological methods subdivision of the Russian Agricultural Production Ministry's Plant Protection Administration, to describe the means by which this administration plans to solve the problem. FomenkoVladimir Petrovich, what compelled the Plant Protection Administration to address the idea of organizing low-volume regional production operations? FilatovTwenty-five biological agents can now be used to protect agricultural crops in greenhouses--12 useful insects and 12-15 biopreparations. New, highly effective developments exist which require extensive testing under production conditions. Possessing such a huge potential, we could significantly increase the role played by the biological method on open and especially on sheltered ground. However, our high-volume ``giants''--the plants of microbiological industry--are extremely sluggish. Their production continues to revolve around a few bacterial preparations coming in imperfect preparative forms. The plants never did get into producing fungal preparations. Nor are they willing to produce small, so-called low-volume lots--that would be unprofitable. To make matters worse, the plants supply their products to agriculture in the third and fourth quarters, forcing the farms to store biopreparations locally until the following summer. All of this brings out uneasiness and a mistrust of the manufacturer, the preparations and the biological method as a whole. Considering the many years of practical work with the plants, and their slowness in making use of scientific developments, we were forced to create biofactories and biolaboratories within the plant protection system, which began producing a broader assortment of biological resources in direct proximity to the consumer. Life has confirmed the correctness of the selected path. All that has been done to introduce the biological method in recent years is a credit to it. However, time is marching on, and laboratory procedures remain at a primitive level--jars, rockers, cans, etc. As an example, production of baktorodentsid requires ``babying'' it manually 10-15 times. The quality of the products is unstable. Nor are the biolaboratories always able to produce the needed volume, especially if the preparation is new and effective, and if the demand for it is snowballing. There is but one solution--we need to have our own low-volume production operations, ones established on the basis of equipment similar to that used in industry. FomenkoWhat has been done already in this direction? FilatovThe Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production has allocated the money, and it has found a certain defense industry enterprise to manufacture the needed equipment. We went there in August 1992 together with specialists--process engineers and microbiologists--and contracted for the creation of five facilities producing bacterial and fungal preparations in the form of pastes rather than dry powders. First of all, pastes have a shelf life of up to 6 months, which is fully sufficient considering the mobility of production and its proximity to the client. Second, this form is applied more easily--it doesn't create dust, and it doesn't clog sprayers. Third, paste preparations will be 40 percent cheaper than dry ones. Moreover their effectiveness is usually 10-15 percent higher. FomenkoWhat does the set of equipment possessed by such facilities include? FilatovA steam generator, a compressor, coarse and fine cleaning filters, 10, 100 and 1,000 liter fermenters, a separator and a filtering unit to concentrate the product. FomenkoWhat preparations have you decided to produce in the first stage? FilatovWe have an extremely great need for aktinin to control the spider mite, ampelomitsin, boverin of various strains, trichodermin of various strains, nematofagin, mikoafidin, piromorfin, fitolavin and rizoplan. The last preparation, by the way, is needed in large volumes, and one of our facilities will be able to produce up to 700 kg of rizoplan daily. We will also produce pentofag and baktorodentsid. We plan to introduce the procedures of producing lepidotsid, bitoksibatsillin, gomelin and dendrobatsillin in paste form. FomenkoWhen will these facilities be ready? FilatovThe manufacturing plant is to turn them over fully ready for use in March 1993. It will provide guaranteed repairs and service for a year. FomenkoWhere are they to be located? FilatovIn the most ``needy'' places: in the health resort zone of the city of Bolshiye Sochi, and in Krasnodar, Voronezh, Kirov and Yoshkar-Ola, to perfect the procedures and debug the equipment. FomenkoWill specially adapted premises and buildings be needed for them? FilatovThe set of equipment can be located in an area of 30 m[.sup]2[/], and its height will not exceed 2 meters. Suitable space will probably be found at the plant protection stations. There is only one important condition that must be observed: A supply of up to 100 kW of electric power. FomenkoWho will work at these plants, where are you going to get the specialists? FilatovThere are microbiologists in our service that could take on this job. Moreover we have reached agreement with workers of the Omutninsk Plant to organize courses for our specialists in which they could learn the procedures of working with the new facilities. FomenkoHow will the production volume and assortment of preparations be determined? FilatovThe low-volume production operations need to seek customers themselves. Anyway, in this stage they won't need to seek them--they are already known. First, we have greenhouse complexes, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, commercial farms, and storehouses in which products are processed before storage. Also, we are doing little to satisfy the demand of clients in the private sector, the army of which is growing, and which has always been and will always be interested in ecologically clean products and safe plant protection resources. That is, the range of our customers is very wide. Unfortunately we are doing little to provide publicity and information on biopreparations. Agronomists need to know, for example, that the Colorado beetle could be fought not only with the preparation detsis, but also bitoksibatsillin, and the effective preparation detsimid; there are plans for carrying out field tests with the new preparation Colorado. If we sit down and think about it, we already have five effective microbiological resources for controlling these pests that are in no way inferior to chemical ones. Once they learn about them, the demand will doubtlessly grow. FomenkoVladimir Petrovich, considering the known demand for biopreparations, how do you feel, how many facilities will be needed, in an oblast for example? FilatovA single facility wouldn't of course solve the problem in some southern oblasts, two or three would be needed. Moreover in our planning work we foresaw the possibility of increasing their productivity by 2-3 times. This ``reserve'' is present in all of the machine units--in those delivering steam and air, and in filtering units. Just add another fermenter, and the possibilities will widen significantly. FomenkoThe first five facilities will be practically given away to Krasnodar, Sochi, Kirov and other cities. What if other oblasts would want to have the same kind of equipment? Will they have to buy it? FilatovYes, they will have to buy it. FomenkoHow much does one such set cost? FilatovIt's no secret: We signed a contract with manufacturing plant for five facilities for a total of 32 million rubles. FomenkoWill clients have to apply directly to the plant, or would it be more advantageous to work through the Plant Protection Administration? FilatovI wouldn't want this to be done directly through the plant. Here is why. It would of course be profitable for the plant, because it is looking for work. But we would like to perfect the production operation, to teach people, to check out everything and achieve maximum reliability ourselves for the time being, within the plant protection service, with our own specialists. After all, the equipment has to work without interruption for more than just a single year. The plant is not going to become involved in training personnel and tailoring the instruments to each client. After we get all of the bugs out, let potential clients visit us, see the facilities in operation, and they can decide for themselves whether they want to acquire the equipment. FomenkoIf everything goes according to plan, will high-volume microbiological production operations become unnecessary? FilatovNo. Plants of microbiological industry will continue to produce large of lots of preparations--over 500 tonnes. They won't lose any clients if the quality of their products is high and if they are convenient to use. All the more so because microbiological resources are now becoming competitive with chemical ones both in price and in effectiveness, while in terms of ecological safety they are far superior. FomenkoWhat is your attitude toward the numerous cooperatives and small enterprises outside the plant protection service that have now begun producing microbiological preparations? FilatovIt is fully positive, though at the same time cautious. Because production and use of biopreparations by nonspecialists who violate the procedures may result in woeful consequences. The Russian Ministry of Agricultural Production and the Ministry of Health have even prepared a special document calling for the prohibition of unregulated production of fungal and bacterial resources. Please understand me correctly: We do not fear competition with any other producers. The more preparations that are produced, the better. The only thing is that the producer must have all of the necessary documents, the technical conditions and regulations must be observed, and emblems of quality and guarantees must be present. Then there wouldn't be any problems. COPYRIGHT: ``Kolos'', ``Zashchita Rasteniy'', 1993
