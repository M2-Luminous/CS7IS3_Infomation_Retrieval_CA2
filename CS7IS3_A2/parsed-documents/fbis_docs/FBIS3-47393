The court will oversee cases concerning violations of intellectual property rights in both the criminal and civil courts. It will also help to speed up judiciary proceedings as it will rule on cases within one week of receiving testimony. The entire process will take six months. The establishment of the new court under the Justice Ministry now only needs ministerial approval. Among ways to speed up the judicial process in the proposed court are: -- Sending a court notice through the post, which will be 20 days faster than by handing it over by a limited team of messengers. -- The court will have witnesses testifying every day instead of postponing cases. The committee working on the new court is at present studying the process and the types of cases to come under the new court's jurisdiction. The qualifications of the judges are also being considered. The Justice Ministry has already created a new division to oversee intellectual property rights cases.
