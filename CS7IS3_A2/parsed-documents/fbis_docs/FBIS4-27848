FBIS4-27848 "dreas108_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 North Korea Ulchi Focus Lens Announcement Termed `Challenge' Ulchi Focus Lens Announcement Termed `Challenge' SK0406062994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0451 GMT 4 Jun 94 SK0406062994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Dangerous Military Move" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The United States and the South Korean puppet clique reportedly announced on June 1 that they would stage Ulchi Focus Lens with far larger forces than last year for two weeks from August 22 this year. The announcement came at a time when the wicked forces are kicking up a hysterical clamour for pressure and "sanctions" against the DPRK following the "presidential statement" of the U.N. Security Council a few days ago, which contained an unreasonable argument against the DPRK. This is an open challenge to the DPRK and a very ill-boding military move to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. This arouses our due vigilance. The U.S. hardline conservatives including Defense Secretary William Perry have openly called for "policy of physical strength." The traitor Kim Yong-sam "inspected" the combat preparedness of puppet Army units, inciting a war fever. The Rimpac joint military maneuvers simulating a military attack on the DPRK are being staged. These facts show that the military move of the United States and the South Korean puppet clique to carry into practice new operation plan 5027 for a war against the North is entering into a very grave stage. The United States and the South Korean puppet clique must refrain from rash acts, clearly mindful of the grave consequences that may arise from their adventurous military action.
