A letter from Bosnia-Herzegovina Defense Minister Hamdija Hadzihasanovic to General Briquemont, commander in chief of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, says five people staying in the hospital were seriously wounded and one was killed in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. Given the 500 direct artillery hits in 1992 and the 15 in 1993, it seems, if the current rate of shelling is anything to go by, that this year's shelling will exceed the level achieved in the first year of war. Mr. General, you know well that the state hospital in Sarajevo is a civilian facility and you are also aware of its importance. This is why we lodge once again our sharpest protest over this crime by the Serbian aggressor, which you are quietly observing and logging. The Bosnia-Herzegovina defense minister ends his letter by saying: I call on you to react to such attacks in an adequate manner.
