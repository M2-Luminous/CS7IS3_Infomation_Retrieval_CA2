Papandreou said he hopes solutions will be found soon to smooth Athens-Skopje relations. In his address, the deputy foreign minister said the Turkish Cypriot community should have pursued Cyprus' accession to the EU. Referring to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], Papandreou said it must be understood that it is in Greece's national interest that Skopje survives. He added, however, that Skopje must stop violating the CSCE principles. Chamber of Deputies President Apostolos Kaklamanis opened the conference and stressed: The continuing bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia is another great challenge for all of us. He specifically stressed the dangers facing the Balkans and greater Europe. Kaklamanis concluded: You realize the additional reasons that have caused concern for the Greek people and the intense interest in restoring peace.
