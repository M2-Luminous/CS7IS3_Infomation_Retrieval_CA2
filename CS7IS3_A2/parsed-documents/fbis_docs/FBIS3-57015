The more sustained fighting was going on in Mardakert Rayon in the direction of the settlement of Magavuz. According to Nagorno-Karabakh's press department, Karabakh subunits managed to hold back the enemy pressure by the close of 19 January, inflicting on it appreciable losses in personnel -- up to 100 killed -- and materiel. The Azeri Air Force at the same time once again tried to bomb Stepanakert but was chased away by antiaircraft artillery fire. On the morning of 19 January, Karabakh fighters witnessed a more than two-hour battle between two Azeri battalions outside the population center of Karakhanbeyli. It is still not clear whether that was a shoot-out between two rival commanders, or whether the Azeris simply had mistaken each other for the enemy. Military experts believe that despite the extremely difficult situation, the Karabakh Army is capable of holding the front whereas possible Azeri successes may at this stage be of only local nature and should not result in appreciable changes in the sides' positions. The active participation of Russian and Ukrainian mercenaries is not so far producing the expected impact upon the overall situation, although, as commanders certify, some battalions formed from the "Slavic" contingent are fighting very vigorously, and it is hard to withstand their pressure. In particular, the encirclement of Armenian units near the settlement of Magavuz had been organized by two such battalions. The conviction taking shape in Armenia is that the offensive efforts by the Azeri Army have been caused exclusively by political expediency. Before the meeting in Moscow of the leaders of the two Transcaucasus states and Russia, the men in Baku would very likely want the talks to begin in a different military-political situation. The men in Moscow would possibly want the same: The gamble is that should the Azeri side manage to inflict a major defeat on the Karabakhis, Yerevan's and Stepanakert's stance at the talks according to the plan suggested by Russia may be much softer. At any rate, Azerbaijan is continuing its offensive regardless of losses. The latter, meanwhile, have reached unprecedented proportions. In little more than a month, the Azeri Army lost some 5,000 men. In Baku, this circumstance sparked internal political tensions because casualties sustained so far are not measuring up in any way to success at the front.
