FR941110-0-00131 FR941110-0-00016 Response: We believe that every investigation does seek to identify facility practices which led to the resident neglect or abuse, or misappropriation of resident property and this is evidenced by the guidance currently provided to the States in manual instructions. These guidelines include the general procedures for conducting complaint investigations and stipulate that, if significant problems are identified during an initial assessment or other observations, the scope of the review is expanded as necessary. The procedures also specify that when the team is investigating allegations of substandard care, they are to evaluate not only the care of the individuals involved in the allegation, but also to evaluate the facility's patterns of related care. Also, noncompliance identified during the survey is recorded on the Statement of Deficiencies and Plan of Correction (HCFA&hyph;2567) and a plan of correction is requested. When the facility is not in substantial compliance as a result of the deficiencies identified, enforcement actions could include the imposition of alternative remedies or termination of a facility's provider agreement. Comment: A few commenters suggested that in those cases where neglect was found and determined to be caused by factors beyond the control of the individual, the State agency must impose sanctions upon the facility or document why such sanctions are inappropriate. Response: We do not accept this suggestion to add a regulatory requirement that obligates HCFA or the State to impose sanctions where resident neglect was found and determined to be caused by factors beyond the control of the individual. Regardless of the cause of the noncompliance, a facility is not relieved of its responsibility to correct its deficiencies. This responsibility assures that residents consistently receive quality health care in a safe environment and it exists whether or not a remedy is imposed. However, there are instances in which a remedy will be imposed due to the egregious nature of the deficiency and to encourage prompt compliance. Conversely, there are situations in which a remedy might not be necessary because the facility corrected the practice which led to the abuse. For example, firing an employee who neglects a resident or residents could immediately correct that deficiency. We do not accept the suggestion to incorporate into the regulation a provision that would require documentation for those cases in which a remedy is not imposed. We are not required by the Act to document why sanctions are not imposed and to require this through regulations would impose a significant workload burden because, as stated above, there are many cases in which deficiencies are corrected and remedies are not imposed. Redesignation of Subpart F As noted earlier, a new Subpart D of part 488, consisting of §§488.201&hyph;488.211, became effective on August 31, 1992, shortly after this proposed rule was published on August 28. Consequently, we must designate Subpart F, which was to consist of §§488.200&hyph;488.240, with subsequent numbers. To assist the reader, we are publishing the new table of contents for Subpart F, with designations of the proposed rule shown in parenthesis. In the following discussions, we refer to the sections as renumbered, with the proposal's identification included only if distinction is necessary. Sec. 488.400␣Statutory basis.
