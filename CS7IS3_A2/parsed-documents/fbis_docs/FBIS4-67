In a statement, DP Natal leader Roger Burrows said the emergency regulations should make specific reference to the human rights situation of likely detainees and indemnity for acts committed by security forces during the state of emergency should be specific and limited in extent. Mr Burrows said the DP awaited the specific gazetted regulations before reacting further. The DP had always been opposed to the imposition of a state of emergency, but was giving its conditional support to the present one in view of the extremely grave situation in kwaZulu/Natal. The support was dependent on the emergency being aimed only at the cessation and prevention of violence and the promotion of free political activity in kwaZulu/Natal. Normal political activity had to continue unhindered, Mr Burrows said.
