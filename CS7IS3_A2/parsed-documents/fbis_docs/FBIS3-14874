We have won the first round, but we are starting to lose the second round. And if we do not display boldness and initiative, we will lose the whole game. But in that case, those to blame for the failure will have to be sought not only in Brussels and Washington, but also in Moscow. Having a fairly good knowledge of NATO and of the process of how a decision is adopted in the alliance, I do not believe that its expansion may significantly increase the almost nonexistent military threat from the West. Although, of course, as a result of the NATO and Russian borders being brought closer together, the positions of people who are used to seeing each other as potential adversariess will be strengthened, and mutual suspicion will grow. But the main negative consequences will be of a political and even economic nature. Russian positions will be weakened in the bargaining over access to Western markets and the acquisition of investments. But the most important thing of all is that Russia's isolation will increase. We have no chance, in the foreseeable future, of joining the European Community, whose members will soon comprise the majority of European states. Even joining the free trade zone around the EC may even prove problematic for Russia -- not only because of the possible opposition of the West, fearing for its markets, but also because of protectionist trends in Russian policy. Protectionism is inevitable in political terms, and is even partially necessary in order to boost our nation's industry, but, given the principle of reciprocity in opening markets, it will make access to West European markets more difficult for us. The CSCE -- the only major political organization in Europe where Russia is fully represented -- is becoming relatively weakering and most likely will not be able to become the nucleus of a European security system. The expansion of NATO will weaken the CSCE still further. But the main thing is that the most promising channel of our cooperation with the West for the next few years -- the security sphere -- will be sealed off to a considerable extent. No matter what "compensation" -- for the expansion of the alliance -- our NATO neighbors may propose for us, they will most likely not be able to avert the reinforcement of Russian's military-political and political isolation. Russia will find itself to a significant extent "sealed up," and forced to expend forces and resources to break loose from the disadvantageous position, it will be doomed to be the disturber of European peace. Europe as well as Russia will suffer the damage. In September-October of last year, it seemed that it would not p]rove possible to halt the mechanism of the admittance of four central and East European countries to NATO. But in the end, Russia's cooperation with forces in NATO countries which do not want the alliance to be expanded seems to have averted the inevitable. NATO adopted the idea of "Partnership for Peace." Moscow welcomed it. The "Partnership for Peace" sets forth four sometimes contradictory elements. First of all, there is NATO's attempt to gain time, look around, and conceal its lack of a long-term strategy. Second, the desire to satisfy both Russia on the one hand, and the countries of central and East Europe on the other hand, at the same time. Third, the attempt to block the entry of countries into NATO, placing them for an indefinite time in the "political antechamber." Fourth, there is a possible way of slowly assimilating these countries in NATO by establishing close cooperation between their military structures [voyennyye mashiny]. Russia has three options for responsible [otvetstvennyy] actions. The first is not to join. The second is to formally join, but in reality not to display any special initiative. There are a lot of arguments in favor of the first and second options: We cannot tune our military organizational development to NATO standards, and "partnership" will restrict our freedom of action. But it must be clearly understood that our neighbors in central and East Europe will force their way through this door. Plans for cooperation are already being drawn up there and resources are being found. And if we remain apart, then in a year or two we will simply not have any arguments left for opposition. They will say to us: You have been given the chance. You have not taken it. So you have simply not made any effort toward common European military-political integration. Do not hinder those who are striving for it, and after about four years, NATO will be expanded. But there is also a third option -- the only one which can block the expansion of the bloc. Russia should state: The expansion of the bloc may be a way of creating a collective security system in Europe, and, if its organizational development follows this path, it makes it its aim to join NATO ahead of the countries of central and East Europe. At the same time, Russia must put forward a military and military-political cooperation program which would enable us, and not our Western partners, to speak of insufficient will for cooperation. Only then will we have real and weighty arguments to counteract the expansion of NATO without Russia. I foresee the counterarguments: Cooperation is costly, and conditions will be imposed on us. That is true, but the country is faced with the strategic threat of political and military-political isolation, and such cooperation is the most effective way of averting it. Tens of billions of rubles spent now would save tens of billions of dollars in the very near future. There is another counterargument: What if NATO accepts the challenge and says -- join! I would answer: This is impossible in practical terms, but if it does happen, this means that Russia will achieve one of is basic foreign policy aims, and a collective security system will start being built in Europe.
