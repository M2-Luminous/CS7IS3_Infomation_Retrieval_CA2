The question of dissolving the two chambers is now in the hands of the Quirinale [office of the president of the Republic]. Rome--Carlo Azeglio Ciampi is satisfied with what his government has accomplished in these eight months, especially on the economic front, where it has succeeded in regaining the confidence of the international markets. He is more than cautious, however, with regard to the possible political developments of the next few days, all of which will involve the procedures for dissolving the two houses of Parliament pursuant to the motions of no confidence introduced by Marco Pannella and others. The political statements made by the prime minister during the traditional year-end press conference serve above all to confirm several things. First, the parliamentary debate will take place and the government is resigned to it, as has already been explained in the statement made by the Quirinale and published following Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's summit with the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate; and second, at the meetings already scheduled for 4 and 5 January with the parliamentary groups, Ciampi will seek to clarify the general orientation of these groups, especially because many members of Parliament--who have supported the government and say they will continue to evaluate its action--have chosen the option of the no-confidence motion. Before taking its next steps, Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister] is waiting for 12 January, the date already set for the parliamentary debate. For his part, Ciampi confirmed that the government--having performed its function--is ready to relinquish power immediately, but then insisted several times during the press conference that "it is not the task of this administration to decide if--and for how long--this legislature should continue," explaining that for this reason he is not yet in a position to know "whether it should end immediately or continue until the next legislature." In short, we learned from Ciampi's statements that everything will depend on what develops in the course of the parliamentary debate, and--in particular--we learned that any decision concerning the date of the elections will depend on the assessment that the president of the Republic will make of these developments. And concerning his own political future, Ciampi was particularly reserved. He offered only one certainty: he will not participate in the election campaign. "If it is needed, however," he explained, "I shall be happy if I am able to offer my counsel," inasmuch as he has spent a lifetime in the civil service. The prime minister did not, however, dodge those questions that were in some way connected with Silvio Berlusconi's entry into politics, and made two firm points. The first point was that if he remains in Palazzo Chigi during the election campaign, the principal task of his administration will be to "guarantee the par condicio [equal treatment before the law] to everyone." The second point--which he expounded with a touch of irony in response to a question by a sports reporter--was that "no one can have a copyright on the motto, Forza Italia." The prime minister will accordingly continue to root for the National Team even before the elections, and of course afterward. Ciampi--who also expressed appreciation for the pope's words concerning the unity of our country--did not conceal the fact that he twice was tempted to throw in the sponge and leave Palazzo Chigi: first, when it appeared that the agreement on the cost of labor would not be successfully concluded, and again following the simultaneous terrorist attacks in Rome and Milan on the night of 27-28 July of this year. The prime minister also dealt with economic topics, especially in his introductory statement at the press conference. He emphasized the renewed confidence that Italy, Inc., has regained on the international markets and also the positive result of a current inflation rate of 4 percent, which makes the objective of an eventual reduction to 2.5 percent a realistic one. These results were also--and above all--achieved thanks to the agreement on the cost of labor. There remains, unfortunately, the "distress" over the high unemployment, the causes of which--Ciampi said--can be removed "if Italy will construct its future development on new foundations." Marco Pannella, sponsor of the motion of no confidence, offered a favorable assessment of Ciampi's statements. "The press conference," Pannella said, "demonstrates that a strong Ciampi administration is necessary and that we must hold the elections to render a judgment as between the political coalition that has supported Ciampi, on the one hand, and the opposition."
