Has There Ever Been?"] [Text] We are, for all that, an amazing people. We were constantly complaining that the factor of the absence of statehood had over many centuries so strongly influenced our minds that we harbored toward all authorities, if not a scornful, then at least not exactly a respectful, attitude. Gevorg Emin once wrote a poem on this subject: You need to operate with care in our parts, he said, because each Armenian is a tsar. Not potential. In the literal sense. He meant, possibly, our historical past, when there were always too many pretenders for the royal throne, and their number would grow with menacing speed. And so we lived, lived, and finally lived to see the day when there are once again very many potential tsars, but the social consciousness sees just one on the throne. At all street corners the talk is the same. "Yes, Levon Ter-Petrosyan has not justified the trust. But who, pray, could be put in his place?" And after an agonizing search and mental thumbing through of all the possible candidates, the conclusion is: There is no alternative! To explain this phenomenon by poverty of intellect and a servile devotion to a created idol and the traces of the totalitarian consciousness is to say nothing, even if the older generation of those alive today, which sobbed bitterly the day Stalin died, is, of course, very directly related to all these phenomena of social behavior. Nonetheless, even they, who were once capable of thinking in all seriousness of personal assistance to the revolutionary movement of the peoples of Africa, could not be lured into a revolution now. And, then, what kind of revolution or radical transformations or restoration of social justice could be dreamed of by a people, 70 percent of whom plainly state, as a sociological survey showed, their desire to leave their homeland? And people should not be reprimanded for a lack of patriotic spirit here. Armenians are leaving not Armenia but Levon Ter-Petrosyan and his hapless team, who have made the blessed motherland a segment of the seventh circle of hell. Reproaching the emigres would mean antedating a curse on ancestors who in the past abandoned Ani, which was sold, incidentally, initially to the Byzantines, and then, to the Seljuks. Of what alternative could a people which, if they do not steal and do not profiteer, have earnings equal to the cost of two eggs be thinking? And as for a search for the truth, when the voracious survival instinct has begun to speak at the top of its voice? Our mentality is such that we seek a possible alternative merely among those who have had or who now have at least some relationship to power. The earlier ones are out of the question: If there are, indeed, potential saviors among them, they are so thoroughly concealed that scraping away the camouflage would take too much time, which, incidentally, neither we nor they have. The president is dispatching the present ones, however, with savage economy: Four premiers in less than three years are obvious testimony to this. Not to mention all the others who come and go, but who never mature to the level of real alternative to the president. And real power, meanwhile, is concentrated in the hands of people who would never ascend to the highest rung of the state hierarchy other than by way of a military or police coup. And the more the popular wave undermines their reputation, the dearer they become to the president's heart. There is nothing new in the leader's attitude toward his immediate entourage here, of course. All has been well known, unfortunately, since ancient times, in which our country has experts enough. As a result an ideology of futility, which is harmful for all except those who are assiduously feeding this ideology by their actions, is engendered. Thanks to them, we have had no alternative in any period of our life, virtually. I shall not list by name all the former leaders of Armenia in past decades but the older generation would, most likely, confirm that not one of them formerly was, seemingly, an alternative, but as soon as a new one appeared, the heavens did not open and the grass continued to grow, and if there was no bread in the stores, it was only for several days. There is, however we all may be fooled in this connection, an alternative, even when there is no choice.
