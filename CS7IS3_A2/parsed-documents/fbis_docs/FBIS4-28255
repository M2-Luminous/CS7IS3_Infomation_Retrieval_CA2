A joint communique referring to fiscal and monetary measures signals "strong expectations" by OECD member countries, especially the United States, for early economic recovery in Japan and Europe, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister, told a press conference. But that does not mean they must do something specific, Kumano said. The communique issued Wednesday at the end the two-day Paris gathering said, "where recovery is not yet sustained, eased monetary policy should be maintained...Where possible, consistent with the medium-term policy objective of budget consolidation, fiscal measures will be implemented as necessary to ensure sustained noninflationary growth led by strong domestic demand." The wording shows the "well-balanced position" of the OECD, Kumano said. But he did not elaborate. During the ministerial discussion, the U.S. has reportedly pressed for stronger wording to be used regarding requests to Japan and Europe.
