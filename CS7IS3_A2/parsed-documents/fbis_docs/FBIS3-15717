This accounts for the great attention which has been paid to the development of modern multiple-target SAM missile systems. Right now it is possible to claim with confidence that the Russian military-industrial complex is a world leader in this sphere. Take for instance this multichannel SAM missile system, the S-300 PMO-1, which is in the Russian Army's arsenal. It is designed to destroy modern combat aircraft and cruise and ballistic missiles. Essentially, this system ensures 100 percent destruction of aerodynamic targets within a range of 150 km, and of ballistic missiles and their warheads within a range of 40 km. Minimum target altitude is 10 meters, and maximum altitude is the service ceiling of modern combat aircraft. What is more, the speed of the target is of no consequence. It is possible to hit six targets simultaneously, targeting them with up to 12 missiles. The S-300 PMO-1 SAM missile system is highly mobile. Either self-propelled or transported by rail or military transport aircraft, it can be moved to any region in a short space of time. And it takes only five minutes to deploy. Its foreign counterpart is the U.S. Patriot system, which received wide publicity following operation Desert Storm.
