FR940512-1-00073 FR940512-1-00010 Subpart D_Grants to Centers in States in Which State Funding Equals or Exceeds Federal Funding Determining Whether State Funding Equals or Exceeds Federal Funding §366.29 When may the Director of the designated State unit (DSU) award grants to centers? (a) The Director of the DSU (Director) may award grants under section 723 of the Act and this subpart to centers in a State in a fiscal year if_ (1) The Director submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an application to award grants for that fiscal year under section 723 of the Act and §366.32 (a) and (b); and (2) The Secretary determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by the State to support the general operation of centers meeting the requirements of Part C of Chapter 1 of Title VII of the Act in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or Part B of Title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28, 1992) for that preceding fiscal year. (b) For purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act and this subpart, the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program is considered the ``preceding fiscal year.'' Example : If FY 1995 is the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under this subpart, FY 1993 is the ``preceding fiscal year.'' In determining the ``preceding fiscal year'' under this subpart, the Secretary makes any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's multi-year funding cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide with the Federal fiscal year. (Authority: 29 U.S.C. 796f&hyph;2(a)(3)) §366.30 What are earmarked funds? (a) For purposes of this subpart, the amount of State funds that were earmarked by a State to support the general operation of centers does not include_ (1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers; (2) State funds used to purchase services from a center, including State funds used for grants or contracts for personal assistance or skills training; (3) State attendant care funds; or (4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds. (b) For purposes of this subpart, ``earmarked funds'' means funds appropriated by the State and expressly or clearly identified as State expenditures in the relevant fiscal year for the sole purpose of funding the general operation of centers. (Authority: 29 U.S.C. 711(c) and 796f&hyph;2(a)(1)(A)) §366.31 What happens if the amount of earmarked funds does not equal or exceed the amount of Federal funds for a preceding fiscal year? If the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under section 723 of the Act and this subpart for a fiscal year, but did not earmark the amount of State funds required by §366.29(a)(2) in the preceding fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants under section 723 of the Act and this subpart after the end of the fiscal year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and for each succeeding fiscal year. Example: A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1994. It also meets this requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the State's application to administer the CIL program in FY 1998, the Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking requirement in FY 1996. The State may continue to award grants in FY 1997 but may not do so in FY 1998 and succeeding fiscal years. (Authority: 29 U.S.C. 796f&hyph;2(a)(1)(B)) Awarding Grants §366.32 Under what circumstances may the DSU make grants? (a) To be eligible to award grants under this subpart and to carry out section 723 of the Act for a fiscal year, the Director must submit to the Secretary for approval an application at the time and in the manner that the Secretary may require and that includes, at a minimum_
