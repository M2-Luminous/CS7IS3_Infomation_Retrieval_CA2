The situation in the northern central town crammed with around 40,000 inhabitants and refugees was getting desperate, Janowski said, adding that no convoys had reached the town since October 25. Four U.S. planes dropped supplies over the town overnight Wednesday, UNPROFOR said. The UNHCR convoy, which is carrying flour, sugar and medicine, is blocked at Novi Seher, around 10 kilometres (six miles) southwest of Maglaj, Janowski said. The town is surrounded on three sides by Bosnian Serb forces and on the fourth by HVO troops. UNHCR official Larry Hollingworth was trying Thursday morning to negotiate a passage for the convoy with local HVO commanders. Bosnian Serb authorities had allowed the convoy to pass without hindrance, Janowski added. The spokesman added that the hold-up had persuaded the UNHCR to delay the departure of another convoy destined for the Croat enclave of Zepce around 15 kilometres (nine miles) south of Maglaj.
