Our correspondent talked with its chief -- Igor Chekmezov, chief state grain inspector of the Russian Federation. [Khomitskiy] Igor Mefodyevich, why was the grain inspectorate created specifically under the government? For there was previously a similar organization under the former Committee for Grain Products of the Russian Federation Ministry of Trade and Material Resources, was there not? [Chekmezov] Yes, there was. Throughout the 70 years of its existence this was a departmental service. But in August 1992, in accordance with a presidential edict, the state system of grain products started to be eliminated, shares in grain-reception, milling, and groat and mixed-feed enterprises were floated, and the committee which you mentioned was reorganized as the "Roskhleboprodukt" Joint-Stock Company, which, as a commercial structure, lost the functions of state control. Therefore the Russian Federation Law "On Grain" of 14 May 1993 provided for the creation of the Roskhlebinspektsiya under the government. [Khomitskiy] What will be the main functions of the inspectorate which you head? [Chekmezov] It is no secret that 15-20 percent of the grain is lost on the way from the field to the consumer's table. Therefore our main concern today is to do the utmost to help reduce and prevent these losses by means of control over production quality and the rational utilization both of the grain itself and of the products of its processing. At all stages. Of course, we also will not lose sight of the transportation and storage of grain and oil seeds. It has to be said that at the present time many organizations which have the money to get their laboratories accredited have secured the right to determine the quality of grain and of the products of its processing. It goes without saying that discrepancies in issuing descriptions of the selfsame consignments of grain by different structures are simply inevitable. A government decree has laid down that certificates and conclusions by the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya and its organs locally are obligatory for all legal and physical persons. I wish to emphasize especially that we will carry out compulsory state inspections of the quality of grain, the products of its processing, and oil seeds being supplied for export, to regions of the Far North, and to military consumers and consumers equated with them, as well as of those being imported, with the appropriate certificates being issued. At the same time we alone will be exclusively responsible for inspecting the grain being exported. One of our service's most important tasks in the future will be to elaborate proposals for shaping state policy in respect of grain and also to draw up the rules of a civilized grain market. [Khomitskiy] How will your inspectorate be represented in the provinces? Who will finance it? [Chekmezov] Territorial organs of the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya are being created in all the national formations, krays, and oblasts where there is commodity production of grain. The cost of maintaining them will be met out of the federal budget and from nonbudget sources. What is meant by the latter is our organs' rendering of paid services -- on a contract basis -- to all commercial structures conducting grain transactions. [Khomitskiy] Peasant labor accounts for most of the labor in a grain product. But as for remuneration, the present so-called "market" leaves rural folk with not even a share but a tiny share of the proceeds from sales of grain or grain products. Does the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya intend somehow to promote the removal of this injustice? [Chekmezov] Of course! In connection with the liberalization of the grain market various commercial organizations and private persons, who frequently seek to deceive the commodity producer, have begun making grain purchases. Therefore, at the request of the grain producer and on its own initiative, the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya will monitor the correct determination of the quality of grain in trade deals. Incidentally, we also intend to do the same when grain is delivered to elevators and grain-reception centers. [Khomitskiy] Harvest time is not far off and, like the sowing campaign, it will require considerable energy sources. Does the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya intend to give the commodity producer any assistance in upholding the idea of parity for the prices of fuel and lubricants and of grain? [Chekmezov] You know, it is my conviction that this would be fair. As for real assistance for peasants on our part, in this case, again, I see it as the task of our organs locally not to allow businessmen (but it would be more accurate to say rogues, who frequently hide behind this fashionable word) to cheat the rural commodity producer in barter deals (fuel and lubricants for grain) by means of artificially understating the quality and, accordingly, the price of the latter. [Khomitskiy] In conclusion I will ask you to say a few words about yourself. [Chekmezov] About myself.... To be brief, I will say this. After graduating from an agricultural institute, I traveled the path from agronomist to chief of a rayon agricultural administration, working on farms in Rostov Oblast's Morozovskiy and Milyutinskiy Rayons. From 1975 I worked in the system of the USSR Ministry of Grain Products, becoming deputy director and then director of the Morozovsk Elevator, again in Rostov Oblast. In 1987 I was invited to work on the central apparatus of the USSR Ministry of Grain Products, and two years later I headed the State Grain Inspectorate under the USSR Council of Ministers State Commission for Foodstuffs and Purchases. For the past two years I led the Administration for Purchases of Grain and Oil Seeds of the Grain Products Committee of the Russian Federation Ministry of Trade and Material Resources and headed the "Zerno" Firm of the "Roskhleboprodukt" Federal Contract Corporation. [Khomitskiy] Well, in that case you are the right man for the job, as they say. I thank you for the conversation and wish you success!
