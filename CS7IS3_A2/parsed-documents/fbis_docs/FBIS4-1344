FBIS4-1344 "drafr080_cs94002" FBIS-AFR-94-080-S Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA General Elections Begin With `Special' Voting General Elections Begin With `Special' Voting First-Day Atmosphere Described MB2604140194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1256 GMT 26 Apr 94 MB2604140194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Raphael Banda] [Text] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Voting got off to a slow start on Tuesday [26 April] in South Africa's first all-race elections, overshadowed by a spate of bombings aimed at scuttling the process but appeared only to harden black voters' resolve to usher in a new era of non-racialism. The handicapped, ill, infirm, pensioners and pregnant women cast their votes in hospitals and other centres on the first of the three-day national and provincial elections marking the end of apartheid rule. Members of the security forces, South Africans resident overeas, and some categories of prisoners also cast special votes on Tuesday. South Africa's financial markets improved as the country started voting, with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's overall index gaining 117 points by early afternoon and the Industrial Index soaring 155 points. The all gold index rose 45 points. People arrived at polling stations as early as 4AM, but voting began with hitches following delays in delivery of ballot boxes, papers and other paraphernalia. Voting picked up by mid-morning. Voters went to the polls on crutches and in wheelchairs, with many escorted by children and grandchildren. Black voters' enthusiasm for the historic elections appeared undiminished by the bombing spree which killed 21 people and wounded more than 150 since sunday. Police said a bomb exploded at a goldmine near Klerksdorp, Western Transvaal on Tuesday, but no injuries were reported. "Bombs and intimidation won't stop us. This is the new South Africa," said Catherine Makgongwana, 55, who arrived to vote outside Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. In spite of the terror campaign, about 6,000 exuberant voters who did not qualify for special voting streamed to a polling station in Klerksdorp's Jourberton township. Police battled to convince the voters they could vote only on Wednesday and Thursday. In Ciskei several voting stations opened for normal voters a day early and were ordered to close by IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] officials. Among the elderly casting their votes on Tuesday, was President F W de Klerk's 89-year-old mother Corrie de Klerk, who was escorted to a Pretoria polling station by the president. Mr de Klerk said technical hitches experienced at some polling stations earlier had been ironed out. Special voting at most Northern Transvaal stations failed to get off the ground when electoral officials did not turn up with voting material. Only one polling station opened in Pietersburg for a steady flow of voters to cast their ballots. An Independent Electoral Commission situation report after noon said two vehicles carrying ballot papers had been burnt in Katlehong on the East Rand, but this had not affected voting. The IEC said that by 10AM, a total of 246 incidents had been reported countrywide by IEC monitors, 175 of them concerning problems with receipt of voting materials. The problems had been dealt with. The IEC said its investigators had reported a serious and widespread problem in the issuing of temporary voting cards. In KwaZulu/Natal, the IEC said voting was delayed because of late changes to the ballot paper and logistical problems, especially transport. Some voting material had also arrived late from Johannesburg. IEC spokesman Glenn McDougall said no serious disruptions had been reported in the region by 10AM. In Soweto, long queues formed because Inkatha Freedom Party stickers had not been stuck to the ballot papers. The IEC had been looking into the hitch. Electoral officials also reported two ballot boxes were tampered with at Evander, but they said it was not known if ballot papers were removed. Faulty or missing voting materials and the non-arrival of party officials delayed polling in parts of Bloemfontein's black and coloured townships. Some polling stations in the town reported faulty ultra-violet lights for the checking of invisible ink on voters' hands and were awaiting replacements from Johannesburg, the IEC said. Meanwhile, reports that khaki-clad rightwing militants had occupied the voting station at Settlers in the Northern Transvaal, vowing that nobody in the area would vote, were denied by police. The IEC said later the building which had been occupied was not one designated by the IEC as a voting station. An IEC office in the Eastern Cape was evacuated following a bomb scare. The SA Defence Force and SA Police destroyed a suitcase they suspected was a bomb. Only clothes were found in the suitcase. Delays in voting irked some voters, who had to wait for at least two hours before ballot boxes and papers were ferried to stations. "This is Mr de Klerk's strategy. He doesn't want us to vote," fumed one old man who had been waiting to cast his vote since dawn at mdantsane's Cecilia Makiwane Hospital. The voting equipment arrived at 9.30AM. "It's something which is very irregular. Our people are getting confused. Some have decided to go home," said a business leader in Mdantsane. By mid-morning, voting picked up. In the Eastern Transvaal, for example, voting was reported to be going smoothly and patients at most hospitals in the area had already voted by early afternoon. Despite the technical hitches and slow start, hundreds of voters were reported to be arriving at polling stations across the country, enthusiastic to cast their special votes and help determine the future. Handicapped Miss Nokuzola Gxarisa arrived at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital at 5.30AM and told a SAPA reporter she did not mind waiting for the ballot boxes and papers. I think it's worth it. I want to vote. I think there's going to be a change in everything," she said. "It feels very nice to be voting for the first time," said Mrs Martha Molosewoe, 65, a pensioner wrapped in a heavy blanket against the early morning chill as she waited for polling to start in a township in Bloemfontein. "It's a special day," said a 76-year-old who was proud to be older than her candidate of choice. "I want a new life and a new future." One-legged Abel Lephoo has just turned 60 and had a simple sentiment about his historic first vote. "It feels good," he said, limping to join the queue he would probably have to endure for much of the day. South Africans living overseas also voted on Tuesday with the niece of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela the first to cast her vote in New Zealand. The IEC said voting stations in eastern Australia had closed, with just under 5,000 people having cast their ballots. Detailed breakdowns would be released later. Prisoners convicted of lesser crimes as stipulated in the Electoral Act, also voted. Voting at Robben Island Prison was delayed when the boat carrying electoral officials broke down after leaving Cape Town harbour. Officials were processing about 80 prisoners an hour, the IEC said. About 2,500 prisoners ready to vote since dawn at Leeuwkop prison, north of Johannesburg, were told voting would begin after 2PM when electoral officers would arrive.
