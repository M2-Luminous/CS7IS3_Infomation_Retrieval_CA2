Even now many printed publications in Azerbaijan come out very late, and some have ceased to exist altogether. Editorial offices are in dire need of capital to buy metallic plates which are essential in the printing process, the price of paper rises every day, and many press organs are unable to handle these problems on their own. In S. Rustamkhanly's opinion, there is only one solution to the situation which has developed--financial support of publications, including independent ones, from the government. He emphasized that slightly more than a million dollars a year are needed to buy everything necessary. "The leadership of Azerbaijan must be clearly aware that a normally operating `fourth estate' is an enormous help in the cause of state construction," S. Rustamkhanly stated in conclusion.
