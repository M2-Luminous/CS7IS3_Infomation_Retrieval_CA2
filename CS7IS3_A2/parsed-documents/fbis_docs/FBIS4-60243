FBIS4-60243 "drnes099_l_94010" FBIS-NES-94-099 Daily Report 22 May 1994 ISRAEL Cabinet Hears Difficulties Palestinian Police Face Cabinet Hears Difficulties Palestinian Police Face TA2205155894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 1500 GMT 22 May 94 TA2205155894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] The cabinet was given a detailed report on the commando operation [to abduct Mustafa al-Dirani], the reasons for it, and its planning. Speaking on behalf of the cabinet, Prime Minister Rabin praised the defense forces and the chief of staff. On another issue, security officials told the cabinet the Palestinian police force and administration face serious problems in establishing their authority. Jack Katzenell reports: [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Now that the euphoria surrounding the arrival of the Palestinian police is over, the new leadership has to cope with the drab reality of raising funds to pay salaries, a security official told the cabinet. There is a shortage of trained personnel, weapons, food, vehicles, and above all money to pay the salaries, the official said. Nabil Sha'th brought a few hundred thousands dollars when he made a brief visit to the Gaza Strip last week. Arab mayors have been holding fund-raising drives, and Israel is paying the salaries of 37,000 Civil Administration employees up to the end of this month. But Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the money contributed so far by the donor countries is much less than what they promised. In the ruling council for the autonomy, portfolios have not yet been distributed, and this is making it more difficult to organize the new administration. The Palestinian police have called on the population not to carry arms in the streets. In some parts of the Gaza Strip the police have begun planning the collection of weapons from the population. But Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has warned that it will not hand in its weapons, and the Popular Front of George Habash says it will not give up its weapons so long as Israeli soldiers or settlers are present anywhere in the territories. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin again warned that Israel expects the Palestinian police to make sure that armed terrorists do not enter Israel. So long as the security problem is not solved the total closure of the Gaza Strip will continue, Rabin warned. Minister of Commerce and Industry Mikha Harish said clearly the PLO has an interest in showing that it can impose order in Gaza and Jericho, and Israel is prepared to wait for a while: [Harish] This process will be tested in a few weeks. If there is going to be a serious progress in a few weeks then we know that we are in the right track. [Katzenell] If not? [Harish] If not, then the agreement is collapsing, and they are aware of that. [Katzenell] The cabinet was told that the Fatah Hawks and other local Palestinians who were on the wanted list are disappointed, because they have not been incorporated in the new police force or administration. Former policemen who resigned at the beginning of the intifadah have not been reenlisted, and feel they have been discriminated against relative to the newcomers from the diaspora. [end recording]
