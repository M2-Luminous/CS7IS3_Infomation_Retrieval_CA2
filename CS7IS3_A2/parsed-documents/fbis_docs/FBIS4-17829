At the negotiations in Sevastopol, the Ukrainian delegation proceeded first of all from the Ukrainian interests, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Bizhan said at the briefing. During this meeting, he said, it was planned that a draft of a relevant agreement would be put together and ratified. However, the Russian delegation refused to discuss our proposals and failed to show up in the negotiation room on 22 April. Over the past two and a half years, Ivan Bizhan noted, there were five agreements concluded on the Black Sea Fleet. Of those, only one provision was actually implemented, the one on appointing the commander in chief, even though Ukraine repeatedly came up with specific proposals. It is pointless to accuse us of having torpedoed the Sevastopol meeting, he emphasized. We were ready for constructive talks.
