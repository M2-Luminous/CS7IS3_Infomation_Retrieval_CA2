FBIS4-54068 "dreas101_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-101 Daily Report 25 May 1994 North Korea ROK Unification Minister's Remarks Criticized ROK Unification Minister's Remarks Criticized SK2505055894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0430 GMT 25 May 94 SK2505055894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Nuclear Criminal Declares Joint Declaration on Denuclearisation Invalid" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- South Korean puppet Unification Board Minister Yi Hong-ku, taking issue with the North over its "nuclear issue", reportedly told the "Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of the National Assembly" on May 23 that the "North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation has virtually become invalid". Announcing the joint declaration on denuclearisation null and void, he ascribed this to the North's "nuclear issue". This is the height of folly. The South Korean puppet clique which has stockpiled spent nuclear fuel containing more than 10 tons of plutonium now is hell bent on the development of nuclear weapons, developing a fast breeder reactor to abstract a larger amount of plutonium. This tells that the South Korean puppet clique is entirely to blame for reducing the joint declaration on denuclearisation to a mere empty sheet of paper and for rendering the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula impossible. The South Korean puppet clique's acceleration of the development of its own nuclear weapons is an intolerable anti-national, anti- peace criminal act of increasing the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. Facts eloquently tell that the South Korean puppet clique is a clique of nuclear fanatics who are not interested at all in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but desperately stepping up their own nuclear armament under the nuclear umbrella of the United States in a bid to ignite a nuclear war and plunge the nation into a holocaust of nuclear war.
