The nation's flagship carrier formally placed a $47 million order yesterday with Canada for three full-flight simulators that replicate conditions for Boeing 747s, 737s, 767s and 757s. The deal was inked in Beijing between heads of the airline, CAE Electronics of Canada and China Aviation Supplies Corporation (CASC) which will handle imports. "This is telling evidence of Air China's resolve not only to be the leader of civil aviation in China and one of the leaders in the world, but also keep up with the advanced levels in flight training," said airline president Yin Wenlong. "We already have a safety record of 39 years, and we have the determination to continue that record," he stressed. Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and the Canadian Ambassador Fred Bild were present at the signing ceremony. The three most sophisticated simulators, confirmed by Federal Aviation Administration of U.S. as highest grade, will be set up at Air China's new training centre near Beijing Capital Airport. The 130,000-square-metre centre, under intense construction since last August, will be the most advanced pilot training base when it opens in July 1995. This will enable Air China to train its pilots almost exclusively at home, said an Air China training official. Because the airline operates 63 jets -- led by 14 Boeing 747s, 8 767s and 19 737s -- it spends more than $1 million a year sending pilots to the U.S., Australia and other countries for training. The imported simulators will foster pilot talent and slash costs, the trainer said. He said Air China, though boasting almost 1,000 pilots, needs to add nearly 60 pilots a year to meet growing demand for air travel. Other domestic carriers will be permitted to rent the facilities for their pilots. "CAE is very proud to supply the world's best flight simulators to Air China, said Rusi Master, president of the Canadian firm. "The first and immediate benefit is to the users -- the pilots," he continued. The second benefit would be to the society as a whole by making air travel safety with good training devices." [sentence as published] The simulators can imitate all kinds of air conditions, including different weather, helping train the pilots to cope with emergencies. "We sincerely hope that CAE and us will fully honour the contract and make concerted efforts to make the world-class Beijing Flight Training Centre a reality," said Yin Wenlong. "That is a guarantee of our future fruitful co-operation and a blessing for the health of civil aviation in China," he added. Under the deal, the Canadian side is charged with installment and on-the-spot service of the simulators, the first of which will be delivered in August 1995. As the largest carrier in China, Air China runs 33 international routes and 57 domestic trunk routes, making Beijing the centre of a transport web.
