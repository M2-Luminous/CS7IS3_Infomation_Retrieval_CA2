Aksenoka's explanations followed to a note from the Russian Embassy in Riga to the Latvian Foreign Ministry. The note said the publications in the national radical ATMATA and PAVALSTNIEKS papers endanger the mentioned servicemen and complicate relations between Latvia and Russia. The note describes as provocative headlines "They are Occupants" and "Under their Feet the Land Moans" and says Russian diplomats hope that Latvian authorities will take legal steps to prevent further incidents. The Prosecutor's Office, however, can only bring charges for misinformation. So far, it has received no claims that the published information was not true, said Deputy Prosecutor General Edvins Ziedins. If there is enough evidence to prove that the publications called for violence, the papers may face adequate charges with a prospect of being closed, said Aksenoka.
