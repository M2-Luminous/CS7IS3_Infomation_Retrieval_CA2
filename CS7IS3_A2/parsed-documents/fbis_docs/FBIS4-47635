FBIS TRENDS-23MAY94-KOREA North Accuses South of 'Kidnapping' Loggers North Accuses South of 'Kidnapping' Loggers Protesting Seoul's role in the recent escape of a group of North Korean lumberjacks from a Siberian logging camp to South Korea, Pyongyang is demanding the "unconditional and prompt" return of the "kidnapped" loggers to the North, warning that the South will "pay dearly" should it reject the North Korean demand. In a "telephone message" conveyed to the South through the North-South Liaison Office at Panmunjom on 21 May, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) called the "kidnapping" of the six loggers a "shameless, inhuman, and barbaric act" that cannot be "tolerated" (KCNA). The message by the CPRF, a quasi-official organization Pyongyang often uses to register its position on inter-Korean issues, also signaled Pyongyang's concern about possible future defections by warning of unspecified "grave consequences" in "North-South relations as a whole," if the South "continues kidnapping" North Korean loggers. Against the backdrop of increasing South Korean reporting of sensational accounts of the "inhuman" treatment of North Korean loggers in Siberia, some of whom had allegedly fled the camp and were seeking asylum in South Korea, Pyongyang, in recent months, has repeatedly accused Seoul of attempting to "kidnap" its workers. A Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on 9 April, for example, warned of an "immediate" and "decisive countermeasure" should the South abduct North Korean workers (KCNA). Subsequently, as South Korean reporting about the alleged plight of North Korean loggers continued, another Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on 11 May indirectly warned of the adverse effect on DPRK-Russian ties should the Russian authorities allow the South Koreans to carry out their "kidnapping plot" (KCNA). Reflecting the Pyongyang regime's sensitivity to the possible domestic repercussion of the loggers' defection, monitored Pyongyang domestic media have not reported or commented on the issue.
