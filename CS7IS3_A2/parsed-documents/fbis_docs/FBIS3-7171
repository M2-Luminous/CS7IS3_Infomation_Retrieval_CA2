Prince Norodom Sirivut, speaking after his return from Beijing, where he visited the king, said Sihanouk was "in fine form" as he recovered from prostate cancer surgery in the Chinese capital. King Sihanouk is "in good health," said Prince Sirivut. Government sources said the king has seen his cancer reduced "95.5 percent." As for the Khmer Rouge, the prince said "We should not close (?the door) on them. We have to give them the chance to return to the international community" and Cambodia should avoid "putting their backs to the wall," the prince said. "We have tried the policy of the carrot, of the open door and then that of the stick, but now we have to allow the Khmer Rouge the opportunity to come forward to talk," he added, describing his discussions with the king. He said Sihanouk was "a little worried" about the government offensive launched on the Khmer Rouge base at Pailin, in northwest Cambodia, earlier this month, and particularly about the ability of Phnom Penh to keep control of the area. "His concern is justified, and I therefore have messages" for co- Prime-Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh "about His Majesty's thoughts on Pailin," Sirivut added. He said China, an ally of the Khmer Rouge from 1970 until the Paris peace accord of 1991, "thinks it is not at all appropriate to involve itself in a little war" against the rebel movement. The dialogue between Cambodia's government and the Khmer Rouges has all but broken down, as the guerrillas refuse to lay down their arms and allow access to territory under their control as called for under the peace pact. The offensive on Pailin follows last month's battle for another major guerrilla stronghold, the northern town of Anlung Veng, in which the government suffered a major defeat. King Sihanouk is expected to return to Phnom Penh on April 8 after visiting his long-standing friend, North Korean leader Kim Il-song in Pyongyang, where he arrives on April 4 to celebrate Kim's birthday. Sirivut added that the king had reiterated his support for Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi, who also visited the monarch in Beijing. Rangsi's clean-up of the economy and the friction it caused, particularly with Thai investors, resulted in rumours that he may lose his post.
