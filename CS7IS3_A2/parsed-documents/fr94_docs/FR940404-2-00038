Take notice that on March 24, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet, with an effective date of January 1, 1994: Substitute 1st Revised Sheet No. 5E(viii) Substitute 13th Revised Sheet No. 90A On March 9, 1994, the Commission issued an Order Rejecting Amended Tariff Sheet and Rejecting Compliance Filing (Order). This Order rejects the following two filings made by Transwestern. On January 14, 1994, Transwestern filed a tariff sheet in order to comply with a Commission order issued December 30, 1993 in Docket No. RP94&hyph;60&hyph;000, which accepted and suspended, subject to refund and conditions, Transwestern's November 30, 1993 take-or-pay filing. On February 7, 1994, Transwestern filed a revised tariff sheet to correct the total amortization amount contained in the November 30, 1993 filing in compliance with the Commission's Order. Transwestern is clarifying certain aspects of the above-mentioned filings and is also submitting corrected tariff sheets. Transwestern is also filing tariff sheets to adhere to the Commission's Order which rejected the tariff language on Sheet 90A that described the exit point methodology. Revised Sheet 90A describes the computation of the surcharge as it is actually calculated. Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions, and all parties to this proceeding. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before April 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
