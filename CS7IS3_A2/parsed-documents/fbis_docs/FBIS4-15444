Commenting on the Russian president's recent decree, Landsbergis said "Russia's intention to create military bases in neighboring countries is a new imperialistic defiance of the international community and civilized norms accepted in it," Landsbergis said in a statement circulated Thursday [7 April]. The opposition leader expressed regret that the Russian president has to assent to demands of the military. "Latvia's ascription to a group of states where Russia acts as if at home is very dangerous to the international law."
