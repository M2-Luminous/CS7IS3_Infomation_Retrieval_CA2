A Zionist settler was killed and four others were wounded in the attack. A statement by the movement obtained by our radio says: 'Ali al-'Amawi, an Islamic Jihad member from the al-Shati' camp in Gaza, acting alone, attacked a group of armed Zionist settlers in Ashdod this morning, killing one and seriously wounding four others. The mujahid was martyred by Israeli occupation forces' gunfire during the attack. In a telephone contact with him a short time ago, Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad in Palestine, stressed the continuation of jihad and military operations against the occupation forces and the Zionist settlers. He condemned UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the president of the Security Council for rushing to condemn the martyrdom-seeking operation in 'Afula, north of occupied Palestine, yesterday. He said this proves that the United Nations and the Security Council are controlled by the American will. Asked about the Islamic Jihad in Palestine's operation today, he said: [Begin al-Shiqaqi recording] The operations will continue. They reflect our people's protest against and rejection of the alleged and [word indistinct] peace agreement between the PLO and the Israelis. They stress that our people's option is to continue jihad and fight despite all attempts by the United States, the Zionist enemy, and the official Palestinian side to implement the Oslo agreement, which, again, I stress, makes peace for no one but gives another reason for war.
