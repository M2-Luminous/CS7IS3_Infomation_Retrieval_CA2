Lentransgas Director General Radionov announced this to journalists today. He was a member of the delegation from the Rossiyskiy Gaz joint-stock company which has just completed a trip to the Baltics. As its participants noted, the disagreements which arose last year between Russia on the one hand and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia on the other because of irregular payments for gas consumption have completely disappeared. Having received credits from the West, the Baltic countries have covered all their debts. Lithuania is the exception and has undertaken to remit $5 million by 15 March. The price of gas is set according to average European prices, which is about $80 per thousand cubic meters. The agreement on gas supplies which has been signed means a significant influx of hard curency to the budgets of St. Petersburg and the oblast, over the territory of which the gas is transported to the Baltic.
