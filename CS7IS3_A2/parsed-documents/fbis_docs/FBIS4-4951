As Korea committed itself to levying no tariffs on specific products or harmonizing its tariff system with those of the GATT members at the Uruguay Round, the overall overhaul of the existing tariff rate structures is needed, MOF officials said. Furthermore, Korea needs to come out with the new tariff rate programs as its second five-year tariff rate reduction program will be due this year, it said. Under the five-year plan, Korea's average tariff rate will fall to 7.9 percent by the end of this year, from 12.7 percent in 1989. The average tariff rate was 7.1 percent for industrial products and 17.8 percent for agricultural products at the end of last year, compared with 11.2 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively, in 1989. Despite foreign "satisfaction" over Korea's "low" tariff rates, there has been some criticism in the Korean business community that the government lowered the tariff rate too rapidly, without full taking into consideration the nation's economic status. The MOF yesterday held a first working-level conference to reform the tariff rate structures. The new plan will become effective from next year following a formal endorsement from the National Assembly this fall, the MOF said. In the reform, the government will institute a system of levying customs duties on agriculture, fisheries and light industrial products on the basis of the imported quantity, not the imported value. This is designed to protect domestic industries from an influx of cheap foreign goods, it said. The government will also retain the right to levy tariffs on these agricultural products and light industrial goods either on the basis of imported volume or imported value, it said. The reform will be made in such a way as to strengthen the international competitiveness of domestic industries through customs duties adjustment, it said. Existing imbalance of tariff rates on different industrial sectors will be adjusted. Instead of frequently levying "emergency or adjustment tariff rates," the government will made a realistic adjustment on customs duties on specific products, it said.
