The word "reopen" is not the correct word because the problem has been constantly open since November 1989. Certain incorrigible optimists, lulled by the Partnership for Peace bait, have realized the urgency of the problem in view of these statements. Not only they have realized it. The most recent Russian "offensive" in the Balkans has shown to us that the Russian position as a world power is beginning to assume a giant dimension once again. The countries of Central Europe are afraid, understandably, and will probably seek a protective wing in Western institutions. They will use the Partnership for Peace as a shield (has anyone in Prague tried to find out why Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev is so happy about the project?) and will speak about common values and sovereignty, which no one can allegedly violate. They still see NATO as the principal prospective defender of their security and sovereignty. However, the situation in the Balkans has shown us NATO with its pants down, weak, and rusty. Greece, a full NATO member, has not used its right to veto the "warning air strikes," but it refused to participate in any of the Alliance's actions. Moreover, it has conducted policy that has supported Russia rather than Brussels. We cannot have any objections--if Greece's temporary break with NATO is worth it, Athens must have a good reason for its behavior. (Or they may believe that they have such a reason, with is even more important.) This reason is national, or state interests. The same applies to Turkey, which threatened to leave the pact if the air strikes were not launched. What can we infer from that? The state interests of individual countries are above the interests of the Alliance itself. Not only in the Balkans' case. On the basis of that example, we can surmise that other member countries could behave in a similar way if a potential conflict applied to them as the Balkans' conflict applies to Greece and Turkey. The old common enemy has disappeared, and a new one is still to appear inasmuch as the neoimperialist Russia is definitely not an enemy to the West. The interests of the NATO members, mainly of the United States as NATO's main driving force, are aimed at cooperating with Moscow. In the West, they are happy that Moscow can secure peace and order in Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, and that it will stop the dangerous disintegration of the immense space of the former Soviet Union. The state interests of the United States itself were shifted to Southeast Asia a long time ago. Here, in that region, Washington is very concerned about becoming a direct ally of Moscow. It is definitely not in NATO's interest to confront Russia, much less on behalf of Central Europe. The Czech Republic wants to get under "NATO's protective umbrella" as protection against the threat from the East. What follows from that? It is a simple and, for us, an unpleasant fact. The Czech Republic's and NATO's interests are outright disparate. This is one additional reason why it would be naive to think about joining NATO at this very moment. However, not all of the Czech and Western interests are so incompatible, but this is not enough to help us become a member in the Western security structures. The Czech Republic has common interests also with its neighbors and quasi-neighbors, who are more affected by the Russian threat than Paris or Amsterdam, for instance. We must quickly abandon our illusions, the old cliches. We must analyze the new situation with a cool head and respond to it appropriately. We do not have much time, but it may not be too late, either--let us hope.
