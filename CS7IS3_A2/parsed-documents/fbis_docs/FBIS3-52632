Mr. Gill was talking to newsmen at the Border Security Force outpost of Rossay where he said that the Pakistan agency had also promised arms training and financial help to these youth for achieving their goal. Mr. Gill said that for this purpose a few training camps had been started by the ISI alongside the Afghanistan border. He also disclosed that all those Punjabi youths who had gone abroad on fake papers had been contacted by the Pakistani agency and these people were being motivated in the name of Khalistan. Mr. Gill disclosed that nearly five hundred youth living in Europe have fallen prey to this trap of the ISI and the agency was now trying to bring them to Pak for training purposes. Replying to a question the DGP said that about ten group leaders of the militants, including Pritam Singh Sekhon, Lakhbir Singh Rode and Wassan Singh Zaffarwal were still living in Pakistan. The DGP also announced that special recruitment drive would be launched in the border districts from next month to recruit youth to the Punjab police. He assured that the youth fulfilling the required qualification and physical fitness test would be recruited. The DGP also expressed happiness over holding of the rural sports in the area, which was once known as hotbed of militantcy. The DGP, while commenting on the operation clean up in the department, said that more than six deputy superintendent of police and over thirty lower ranking policemen had been sacked for their involvement in various cases of corruption. When asked to comment that banning of dharnas [sit-in strike] and demonstrations of the Akalis amounted to infringement of their democratic rights as they were the recognised political parties, the DGP said that dharnas, demonstrations would be allowed in the State, provided militancy is completely wiped out. Responding to another question, he said that though all the companies of CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force], which were sent to other States on the eve of recent Assembly elections had returned to the State "but they have not been pressed into service." Speaking on the occasion, the IGP [Inspector General of Police] (border range), Mr. D.R. Bhatti, dwelt on the new role that the State police had undertaken in the service of humanity, including promotion of sports and cultural activities. The SSP [Senior Superintendent of Police] of Batala police district, Mr. Rohit Chaudhary, said that a number of steps had been taken to improve police interaction with the people and thus in the process shoulder a greater social responsibility of shaping a cleaner and stronger society. A youth cell headed by the SP [Superintendent of Police] (Operations), he said, has been formed for implementing schemes for guiding the youths in matters calling for specific attention. The members of this cell are leading industrialists, college teachers and social workers. Camps at border towns to guide the youths on physical efficiency tests in the para-military forces and the police forces would be organised. The first camp will be held at Dera Baba Nanak on 7 Jan. to be followed by at Fatehgarh Churian on 16 Jan. and at Kalanaur on 25 Jan.
