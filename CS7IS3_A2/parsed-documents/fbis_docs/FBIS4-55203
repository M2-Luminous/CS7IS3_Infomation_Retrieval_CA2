Judit Laszlo reports. [Laszlo] There are SZDSZ and Fidesz politicians among the first three candidates in 11 individual parliamentary constituencies. According to the liberal cooperation agreement signed before the first round of the elections, the following decision was taken at the talks today. SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar briefed the press about it. [Begin Magyar recording] There were five constituencies where candidates stepped back automatically in favor of another liberal candidate. In four cases it happened in favor of an SZDSZ candidate and in one case in favor of a Fidesz candidate. There were six constituencies where the difference between the votes cast for the SZDSZ and Fidesz was less than 4 percent, but SZDSZ candidates were ahead of the others there. The Fidesz has expressed its intention to appeal to its candidates there to step back, so that SZDSZ candidates can compete as the only liberal candidates. We have also offered in one constituency that the SZDSZ candidate, Andras Szelier, who won the second largest number of votes, would step back in favor of [Fidesz Chairman] Viktor Orban in Szekesfehervar, but the Fidesz has explicitly asked the SZDSZ candidate to continue to compete. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Laszlo] The liberal agreement concerns the Agrarian Alliance only in one case. The party's parliamentary candidate will step back in favor of a better performing SZDSZ candidate in Edeleny of county Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen, campaign chief Lajos Buzasi said. Tamas Nagy, chairman of the Agrarian Alliance, who is still in competition, will be supported by the liberal parties in the second round as well. The same applies to Peter Zwack, chairman of the Entrepreneurs Party, who was a joint candidate of the four liberal parties even in the first round.
