Criminal terror, even if it is not aimed at a specific person, can affect anyone with a stray bullet or shock wave. The crime situation has reached a dangerous limit which requires urgent measures to be taken. Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin offered his vision for a way out of the crime crisis in his 14 June edict "on urgent measures to protect the population against gangsterism and other manifestations of organized crime." We shall not recount its content, it is known. But it is no secret either that this edict has generated a far from homogenous reaction among Russia's political circles. Virtually all factions of the State Duma unanimously denounced the president's scenario for urgent measures to fight crime. Why? Here are the opinions of representatives of various factions and deputies' groups. "It seems to me," believes V. Sheynis ("Russia's Choice") "that there is a very dangerous game involving political slogans under way. Both the president's team and the State Duma members are taking part in it. The situation which is taking shape around the struggle against crime is reminiscent of the one which occurred last summer with the sovereignization of former autonomous regions. At the time both the president and the Supreme Soviet were seeking to win the support of the autonomous regions and rushed to surrender their positions quickly. There was a game of give-away. "Something similar is happening now. But something more dangerous. Indeed, the situation regarding the rampage of crime perturbs and affects everyone. But how to fight it? Through fly-swatting, that is by adopting widely publicized acts, including acts connected with the violation of constitutionally guaranteed human rights, or by waging a hard struggle against crime? "The main problem here is by no means the lack of a legislative base, as many people believe. Even the base which exists is adequate. That the organs which must engage in this and their cadres, orientation, and conduct are not appropriate to the situation which has now taken shape is another matter. In my view that is the main problem where the main efforts should be made. "As for the president's edict itself, it would be far more appropriate for it to be submitted to the duma as a draft law." The viewpoint of A. Lezdinsh ("12 December" deputies' group) is virtually the same as what V. Sheynis said. He also believes that with the existing legislative base the law enforcement organs are quite able to struggle against organized crime. Especially since as a result of protracted talks on this subject the technical equipping and quantitative composition of the internal affairs organs staffers has nonetheless increased. The edict signed by the president, in A. Lezdinsh's opinion, if it is fulfilled will return Russia to a time over 50 years ago, to an era when the qualitative borders between legality and tyranny were eroded. The edict, A. Lezdinsh believes, will not lead to the stepping up of the struggle against crime but on the contrary could very well serve as the fuse for large-scale conflicts with the participation of large groups of the population. And at the same time a lever to the transfer of the state's management to a totalitarian regime. This edict, the deputy believes, must be repealed as regards the section which contradicts the Constitution and we must return to the package of draft laws on the struggle against crime which the president and government promised three months ago to submit to the Duma. While in no way casting doubt on the right of the country's president to issue edicts regulating relations in society, V. Zorkaltsev (Russian Federation Communist Party faction) also voiced his negative attitude toward the question. The document, which affects the interests of the overwhelming majority of people and makes it possible to defend their interests by invading their private lives must be drawn up only in the form of a law, whose draft could very well be submitted by the president. Provisions like detention for 30 days, the checking of private accounts, the virtual abolition of concepts like commercial and banking secrets -- this is all absolutely intolerable. Unfortunately the edict does not even provide for measures of liability for militia staffers for the actions they perform. But there is one phenomenon which already as it were stands outside the framework of this edict and which cannot fail to alarm us. I am sure, V. Zorkaltsev believes, that it was received with approval by the overwhelming mass of Russians. But you only have to recall a newsreel of the thirties. In that newsreel citizens were also going to show trials carrying placards reading "Shoot the enemies of the people!" They walked with confidence. This situation must not be repeated today. Because in the ordinary people's consciousness the idea still lives that the only important thing is for order to be introduced, even if it is with an "iron hand." But that "order" will be a screen for settling accounts and winning political stability, the deputy is convinced. Because what is needed is not en edict but a law on the struggle against crime adopted by the Duma, approved by the Federation Council, and signed by the president, he believes. V. Isakov (Russian Agrarian Party) is now less sharp in his description of this Russian president's edict. He believes that this document abolishes fundamental guarantees of law and order and legality stating that citizens' rights and freedoms can be restricted only by the law. The very fact of the edict's publication violates the norms of the Constitution and of the criminal procedure code. It is not even a case of how serious the restrictions envisaged by the edict are, the deputy believes. Ultimately the supreme measure is not envisaged in them. But the very fact that the president is invading this sphere is evidence that he may reach it in the future since the norms and restrictions envisaged by the Constitution no longer exist. To a lawyer it is obvious, V. Isakov continues, that the edict has no mechanism of implementation. The constitutional principle of the law's supremacy has not been repealed by anyone. And in court, when a law and an edict clash, lawyers will be obliged to apply the law. Thus the result of the edict is in fact not to step up the struggle against crime but to weaken and disorganize that struggle. The deputy is convinced that the struggle against crime must be waged on the basis of the existing legislative system. Undoubtedly, by improving it, in the sphere of monitoring incomes, for instance, and of the liability of state employees and special protection for witnesses.... Actually, there are also different viewpoints in the Duma. In the opinion of Democratic Party of Russia leader N. Travkin we can no longer deal with crime by civilized methods and we must not argue with the edict but rapidly adopt laws which make it possible to wage a real struggle against crime. Deputy V. Lipitskiy also advocates extraordinary measures, believing that the president's edict has merely defined measures which the Duma should have adopted.
