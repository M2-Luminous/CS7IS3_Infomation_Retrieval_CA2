The Constitutional Bill was approved by 115 votes to 33, while the Electoral Bill was approved by 170 votes to 28. Dissenting parties to the Constitutional Bill in the House of Assembly were the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], the Conservative Party [CP] and Independent MP's aligned to the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front -- AVF]. The CP reiterated its rejection of the amendments saying they had been inspired by communists. CP leader, Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg, said that the constitution provided for a unitary state and that none of the amendments changed this. The National Party [NP] and the Democratic Party [DP] supported the bill saying the Freedom Alliance had received everything it had asked for. The amendments, among other things, grant further regional powers, introduced the principle of a volkstaat [homeland], and permit a double ballot. The five IFP members in the house joined the NP, DP, and ANC [African National Congress] in voting for the Electoral Bill. It was opposed by members of the CP caucus and independent MP's aligned to the AVF. Parliament also approved a resolution empowering the state president to extend the operation of the 1990 Indemnity Act for a further year until 17 May 1995.
