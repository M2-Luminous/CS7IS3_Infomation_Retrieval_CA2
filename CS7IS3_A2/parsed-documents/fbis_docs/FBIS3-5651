However, Morgan Bengtson [name as published], president of Ericsson Japan (located in Xinato Ward, Tokyo) said: "With regard to cellular phones, the Japanese market is open. The highest priorities should be given to technological capabilities and prices in an open, competitive system. It is not good that (the market principle) is twisted by political pressures." His remarks can be seen as "coming to Japan's rescue." Bengtson also said: "A trade imbalance surely exists between Japan and the United States. However, there is a possibility that U.S. policies (on the cellular phone issue) will work against the free trade system. It is not desirable for American companies to have an advantage in the Japanese market because of such policies." He questioned the U.S. strategy of demanding numerical targets by threatening the possibility of sanctions against Japan. Ericsson Japan is a subsidiary of the major Swedish electrical manufacturer Ericsson Company. Ericsson Japan has succeeded in receiving orders for radio base stations for cellular phones worth about 40 billion yen from NTT Mobile Communications Network Company and Tokyo Digital Phone Company (located in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo; president, Susumu Ochiai). Thus, it is believed that Ericsson cannot remain indifferent to this Japan-U.S. friction.
