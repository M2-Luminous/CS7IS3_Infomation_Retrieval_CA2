Deng Xiaoping stayed at the Shanghai Xijiao Hotel and, because the hotel was heavily guarded, ordinary people did not know that the "revered Mr. Deng" had arrived, the informed source pointed out. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin inspected Shanghai from 26 April to 6 May, during which time Deng Xiaoping was in Shanghai. A XINHUA report said that Jiang Zemin went to Shanghai to carry out investigations and study in grass-roots units on reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability. Obviously, this had something to do with Deng Xiaoping's tour of Shanghai. While in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin stressed that the CPC Central Committee's policy of supporting Pudong's opening up and development would not change. When inspecting Guangdong from mid to late June, he also expressed important views on special economic zones' economic development. Shanghai and special economic zones in Guangdong are the focus of economic development in south China, to which Deng Xiaoping pays much attention. The "revered Mr. Deng," we believe, fully supports Jiang Zemin's speech which represents the central policy.
