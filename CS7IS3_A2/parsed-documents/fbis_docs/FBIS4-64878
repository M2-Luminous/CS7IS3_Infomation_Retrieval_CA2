Both countries said they were particularly interested in contributing to the peacekeeping and search-and-rescue function of the Partnership, which was launched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in January. Finnish Prime Minister Heikki Haavisto stressed that Helsinki was not abandoning its neutral stance. "Through participation in Partnership activities, Finland is not seeking a new defence solution. Finland pursues a policy of military nonalliance and independent defence," he said. Swedish Foreign Minister Baroness Margaretha af Ugglas said the Partnership would promote "political stability through cooperation and a gradual convergence of attitudes and behaviour." Both ministers stressed the role of the Partnership in strengthening the peacekeeping abilities of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Welcoming the two ministers, NATO deputy director-general Sergio Balanzino said Finland and Sweden would also set an example through their "longstanding tradition of democratic control of their defence forces." The Partnership for Peace is a flexible programme ranging from the simple sharing of military training techniques to participation in full-scale military manoeuvres and peacekeeping exercises. But it stops short of offering full NATO membership any time soon. The programme also seeks to restore civilian democratic control over the armed forces of the former communist dictatorships. Sweden and Finland, the first non-NATO members on the Western side of the old Iron Curtain, bring the total number of non-NATO participants to 17. The others, in order of joining, are Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Albania, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Georgia, Slovenia and Azerbaijan. Russia is expected to join the Partnership soon, but is still quibbling over details.
