The move will help Laos to integrate with the world economy. To this end, a bilateral payments agreement has been signed. The pact will facilitate increased two-way economic and investment linkages. At the same time the agreement reinforces the investment guarantee agreement signed in 1992. The visit is also significant for it demonstrates Malaysia's commitment to the economic development of Laos in the context of South-South cooperation. With this, more Malaysian investors will be encouraged to invest in Laos. Malaysia is not contented with enhancing only bilateral links with the Indochinese nation. It wants Laos to be an important part of Southeast Asia, thereby positioning itself to contribute significantly to ASEAN. To this end, Malaysia will do its utmost best to facilitate its entry into the six-member grouping. By being a member, it will be able to participate in regional development projects. For example, the Growth Triangle concept could be extended to this part of Southeast Asia. In addition, ASEAN could emerge as a stronger grouping. This is why Laos, along with other Indochinese countries, must strive for economic development. Even more vital is that these countries must resolve whatever problems they have in a peaceful manner. They only know too well the destruction and untold misery of war. It is a new era for ASEAN and Laos must be part of this economic prosperity and the great need to preserve understanding, the sentiment of goodwill and nurture cooperation in view of the global changes and development. Therefore, ASEAN has the ability to go forth in development -- to be more effective with the full membership of ten countries including Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar [Burma]. With this, Dr. Mahathir's visit to Laos is all the more significant. Although Malaysians have gone into logging, road construction, and hotel renovation, there is much potential for expansion. Malaysia has lots to offer in terms of expertise in areas such as mining, timber extraction, plantation management, and downstream processing of agriculture and mineral resources. Other areas include finance, engineering consultancy, infrastructure, and tourism. Since Laos has given priority to developing its energy needs, Malaysian companies should look to exploiting this potential. It is important that businessmen of both countries have greater contacts. For Laos, it will help in transforming its national economy to one based on market forces. Malaysians can gain in terms of new markets as well as through reversed investments by taking advantage of cheaper costs in Laos. The shortcomings and bottlenecks faced in Laos indeed provide opportunities which can be exploited by Malaysians. Currently, Malaysia's investments in Laos is not substantial. But this could be a thing of the past if Laos' economic potential is truly exploited for mutual benefit. In this way, Malaysia would have done its part in assisting a fellow Southeast Asian country in taking its rightful place as an important part of the region.
