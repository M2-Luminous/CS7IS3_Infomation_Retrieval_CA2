NPC Deputy and Hunan Governor Chen Bangzhu said: Hunan is working on a new framework for agriculture to meet China's and the world's needs. Over the past few years, Hunan, a province with more than 50 million peasants, has made gratifying achievements in reform and opening up. It made major strides in reforming the agricultural structure, expanded acreage of top quality rice, increased production of cash crops by a wide margin, and made a breakthrough in developing breeding of special aquatic products. For the first time, Hunan's total output of agricultural production topped 50 billion yuan. The proportion of non-grain crops in the total agricultural output increased from 38.3 percent to 40 percent; the proportion of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in total agricultural output increased from 47.4 percent to 48.6 percent; and in the total social output value of rural areas, the output of non-agricultural sectors increased from 47.9 percent to 56 percent. Every year, Hunan exports more than 2 billion jin of grains and more than 5 million hogs to support other regions. In Hong Kong, one-quarter of the hogs on the market come from Hunan. Although Hunan has made such brilliant progress, Chen Bangzhu is still not satisfied with its agricultural development. He believes it is unacceptable for Hunan not to make progress under the new situation. Chen Bangzhu arranged a new "blueprint" for this reporter on the tea table using an ashtray, tea cups, and document pouches to explain his plan. Chen Bangzhu said: "We should gear science and technology toward agriculture." He continued: We need science and technology to guide us on the road of seeking high yields, and improving product quality and farming efficiency. Beginning this year, we will focus on tackling problems in agrotechnology, and developing science and technology in all agricultural fields. We will pay close attention to 40 counties in which commodity grain bases were established, 15 high-quality cotton bases, and three special model areas known for their high-yield, high-quality, and efficient agriculture. Hunan will quicken the popularization and establishment of a science and technology service system, especially the construction of agrotechnology education centers in towns and townships. We will set up agrotechnology education centers extensively, to broaden the scale of scientific and technological popularization, and increase projects in this field in a bid to carry out the strategy of comprehensively supporting, systematically developing, and wide- rangingly popularizing agrotechology. Chen Bangzhu said: We must make efforts in agricultural development. We must integrate resource exploration with market demands and comprehensive development of mountain areas with the scheme of helping the poor. Hunan is blessed with rich natural resources. It has more than 0.2 billion mu of mountainous land, 20 million mu of water areas, 4 million mu of vegetable plots, and more than 5 million mu scattered pieces of land, showing great development potential. Since last year, Hunan has begun to quicken development. It has increased 0.2 million mu of cotton filed; 0.355 million mu of improved tea-oil tree plots; 16,000 mu of newly- developed water areas; 26,000 mu of shoaly land; 40,000 mu of model bases of high-quality economic forests; new production bases for cows, sheep, rabbits, and aquatic products; and gardens for high- quality fruits. We have opened up the road of development and will continue to make major strides in the future. Chen Bangzhu said: "Exchange-earning export of agricultural products is a pillar of our new agricultural framework." Last year, Hunan earned $210 million from exporting agricultural and sideline products. However, the production of finely processed products is still insufficient. We need to make efforts to increase the added value of our farm products. We must develop some leading products and gradually set up production areas and operate them on a large scale. "People in Hunan should pay attention to both domestic and foreign markets. A new chapter will definitely be added to Hunan's agriculture," said Chen Bangzhu confidently.
