Not only the parties and their candidates, but also democracy will face a test on 8 May. The lines are delineated more and more spectacularly on the political palette. The parties "squeezed" between the right and the left, parties that call themselves liberal, have also "shaken up." As for their chances, we asked the head of one of the parties forming the group of four -- the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ], the Agrarian Alliance, and the Entrepreneurs' Party -- namely Agrarian Alliance Chairman Tamas Nagy. [Nagy] The Agrarian Alliance caused a positive surprise, because it has 134 individual candidates. Our forces are proportionally divided all over the country, and our strongest group is in western Hungary. This is very important for us. This is a tremendous change compared with 1990, because we were weak in this area at that time. Although I count on a close struggle, if we do well in the campaign, we will be able to participate in Parliament as a government party. [Gaspar] In the opposition or in the coalition? [Nagy] I think a coalition should be formed on the basis of the programs. The essence of the four-party agreement signed recently was to make our group work stronger and work out a joint action program that we can present to the voters: If the voters show confidence in this group, or a party within this group, we will take a stand in favor of such a concept. [Gaspar] One hears that you also discussed the possibility of getting in touch with the socialists or rejecting this. [Nagy] No, this is not correct. We were laughing at the fact that we said it for the fifth time that only elections were coming up, and everyone tells his alliance preferences during elections. The aforementioned four parties are together. We also said that we do not exclude the possibility that we can show a considerable force. From this moment on, the question is who will arrive in our group, and not with whom will the SZDSZ, the FIDESZ, or the Agrarian Alliance go. [Gaspar] In other words, all for one, and one for all. [Nagy] We are trying to take a common stand. We will probably sign a contract on this. If we succeed in coming to an agreement on a coalition, this group will attract someone. It is possible that we will not be successful in the elections, but we will nevertheless try to take a common stand. We would like to get enough votes to determine the coalition talks. This bloc received close to 1 million nomination slips. [Gapsar] In your view, what is the cooperation between the parties like? [Nagy] My opinion is that there is always a possibility for cooperation between democratic parties. The Agrarian Alliance will conduct a policy that leads to a strong and capable government. I do not think it is wise to exclude democratic parties, parties that accept the rules of the game and act accordingly. It is another matter what Viktor Orban, Ivan Peto, or Tamas Nagy feel personally.... Because none of these parties is made up of one person, but bodies that make decisions and approve the results of coalition talks. Politicians allow themselves a lot of things, but not hysterics or personal gossip! This is our position and this is also stipulated by our coalition guidelines.
