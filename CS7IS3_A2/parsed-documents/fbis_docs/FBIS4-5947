FBIS4-5947 "dreas073_i_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 SOUTHEAST ASIA Cambodia Press Reports on Fighting in Pailin Continue Press Reports on Fighting in Pailin Continue Ranariddh: Fall of Pailin Untrue BK1504092194 Bangkok SIAM POST in Thai 15 Apr 94 pp 1, 16 BK1504092194 Bangkok SIAM POST Thai BFN [Text] Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, commenting on the failure of the suppression of the Khmer Rouge, said his patience in dealing with Thailand was wearing thin. He noted that the report carried by the Thai newspapers on the recapture of Pailin town by the Khmer Rouge was untrue, adding that such a report was an indication of Thailand's backing for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas. Earlier Prince Ranariddh said, in a rather aggressive tone, that the three tanks used by the Khmer Rouge during an ambush against the Phnom Penh troops came from Thai soil and claimed that two of them were destroyed by the Phnom Penh government troops. As of the time of this report, there has not been any reaction from the Thai Government leaders because the Thais are celebrating their traditional new year, Songkran, from 12-14 April. However, Thai officials including the foreign minister clearly announced that Thailand had noting to do with nor did it provide any support for the Khmer Rouge. They asserted that Thailand wants to see genuine peace restored in Cambodia because peace in Cambodia will also mean safety for the Thai people along the border with that country. Stray artillery shells from the fighting in Cambodia frequently landed on Thai soil, forcing border villagers to run to safe places. Prince Ranariddh has reportedly been implementing an aggressive foreign policy toward Thailand. Recently, he accused Thailand of helping Pol Pot flee Pailin into Thailand as the Phnom Penh troops were launching offensives against the town. Several foreign news agencies reported his accusation against Thailand worldwide. After the Thai Government openly voiced its discontent over Prince Norodom Ranariddh's groundless accusation, the prince simply denied his own statement on Pol Pot seeking refuge in Thailand, saying what he meant was that the Khmer Rouge or Pol Potists were the ones who fled to Thailand. An analyst who has long observed the Cambodian situation noted that Prince Norodom Ranariddh has been making attempts to reduce Thailand's influence over his country, especially in the economic field. The Thai baht currency is widely accepted and influential in Cambodia. The Cambodians prefer baht to Cambodia's reil currency because the latter's value is nothing more than plain paper. Moreover, the listing of the baht currency as one of the world's 20 strongest currencies by international monetary institutions has further fanning up the anti-Thai sentiments in Cambodia. The analyst also warned that Cambodia will try to project more accusations against Thailand onto the international arena in a bid to use the hands of the world community to push Thailand out of its economic circles. He noted that some countries might be waiting for an opportunity to replace Thailand in Cambodia's economy.
