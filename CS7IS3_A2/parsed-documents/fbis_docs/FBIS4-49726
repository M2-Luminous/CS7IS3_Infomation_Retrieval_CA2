In 1993, the radio broadcasting coverage rate rose to 76.3 percent from 68.9 percent in 1989 and became higher than the nation's average for the first time. In the same five-year period, the television coverage rate rose 18 percent from 61.8 percent to 79.8 percent. In Ningxia and particularly in its southern mountainous region where information and transportation facilities are poor, people learn of new policies and information and acquire science and technology knowledge mainly through radio broadcasts and television. In the five years, the autonomous region and various cities and counties themselves invested a total of 80 million yuan in radio and television facilities, in addition to obtaining 4 million yuan in state assistance. Thus, the development of radio broadcasting and the television service was accelerated. The region spent more than 20 million yuan on updating radio broadcasting equipment and on repairing circuits. Twelve county-level FM radio stations have been set up, and the FM broadcasts cover more than 60 cities, counties, and townships in the region. The region's radio broadcasting as a whole, with a total transmission power of 268 kw, covers 89.3 percent of townships and towns and 57.16 percent of villages. The Luoshan FM station, with a transmission power of 6 kw and which will cost more than 1 million yuan to build, will be completed this year. After it begins operating, the radio broadcasting coverage rate in the southern mountainous region will increase to 78 percent. As of 1993, there were five television stations and more than 10 television relay stations in Ningxia. The Central Television Program One Network covers 74.26 percent of Ningxia, and the programs of Ningxia's own television stations cover 75.46 percent of the region. All counties in the southern mountainous region receive television programs from more than three stations.
