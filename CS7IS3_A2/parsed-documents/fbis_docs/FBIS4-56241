The U.S. President sent him the invitation with Howard Glicken, who arrived in Cordoba on 26 April aboard a private plane to meet with Angeloz. Glicken, a U.S. Democratic Party leader, played a major role in the organization of Clinton's presidential election campaign. The invitation was extended by the U.S. politician during a luncheon Angeloz gave at his home of Las Tejas. After this meeting, Glicken returned to Buenos Aires City aboard his plane. The presence of the U.S. visitor was much discussed in the corridors of power in Cordoba. The invitation was interpreted as stemming from Angeloz's position as the possible Radical Civic Union presidential candidate for the 1995 elections, and also as an acknowledgement of his leadership within his province.
