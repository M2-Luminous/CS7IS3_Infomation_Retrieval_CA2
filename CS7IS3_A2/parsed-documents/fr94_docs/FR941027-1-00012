FR941027-1-00012 FR941027-1-00003 FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION 11 CFR Part 1 [Notice 1994&hyph;15] Privacy Act; Implementation AGENCY: Federal Election Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Federal Election Commission (``Commission'' or ``FEC'') is establishing a new system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974, ``Inspector General Investigative Files (FEC 12)'', to consist of the investigatory files of the Commission's Office of the Inspector General (``OIG''). The Commission proposes to exempt this new system of records from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (``Act''). DATES: Comments must be received on or before November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments must be in writing and addressed to: Ms. Susan E. Propper, Assistant General Counsel, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Susan E. Propper, Assistant General Counsel, 999 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463, (202) 219&hyph;3690 or (800) 424&hyph;9530. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the Commission is publishing a notice to establish a proposed system notice to establish a new system of records, FEC 12, ``Office of Inspector General Investigative Files,'' under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. The following proposed amendment of the Commission's Privacy Act regulations at 11 CFR 1.14 is necessary to exempt the new system of records from certain provisions of that Act. The Privacy Act and the implementing regulations require, among other things, that the Commission provide notice when collecting information, account for certain disclosures, permit individuals access to their records, and allow them to request that the records be amended. These provisions could interfere with the conduct of OIG investigations if applied to the OIG's maintenance of the proposed system of records. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to exempt FEC 12 from these requirements under sections (j)(2) and (k)(2) of the Act. Section (j)(2), 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), exempts a system of records maintained by ``the agency or component thereof which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to enforcement of criminal laws *␣*␣*.'' Section (k)(2), 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), exempts a system of records consisting of ``investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes,'' where such materials are not within the scope of the (j)(2) exemption pertaining to criminal law enforcement. The proposed system of records consists of information covered by the (j)(2) and (k)(2) exemptions. the OIG investigatory files are maintained pursuant to official investigational and law enforcement functions of the Commission's Office of Inspector General under authority of the 1988 amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978. See Public Law 100&hyph;504, amending Public Law 95&hyph;452, 5 U.S.C. app. The OIG is an office within the Commission that performs as one of its principal functions activities relating to the enforcement of criminal laws. In addition, the OIG is responsible for investigating a wide range of non-criminal law enforcement matters, including civil, administrative, or regulatory violations and similar wrongdoing. Access by subject individuals and others to this system of records could substantially compromise the effectiveness of OIG investigations, and thus impede the apprehension and successful prosecution or discipline of persons engaged in fraud or other illegal activity. For these reasons, the Commission is proposing to exempt proposed FEC 12 under exemptions (j)(2) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, by adding a new paragraph (b) to 11 CFR 1.14, the section in which the Commission specifies its systems of records that are exempt under the Act. Where applicable, section (j)(2) may be invoked to exempt a system of records from any Privacy Act provision except: 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) (conditions of disclosure); (c) (1) and (2) (accounting of disclosures and retention of accounting, respectively); (e)(4) (A) through (F) (system notice requirements); (e) (6), (7), (8), (10) and (11) (certain agency requirements relating to system maintenance); and (i) (criminal penalties). Section (k)(2) may be invoked to exempt a system of records from: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) (making accounting of disclosures available to the subject individual); (d) (access to records); (e)(1) (maintaining only relevant and necessary information; (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I) (notice of certain procedures), and (f) (promulgation of certain Privacy Act rules). The proposed language notes these specific exceptions and exemptions. The Commission welcomes comments on any aspect of this proposed rule. Certification of No Effect Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (Regulatory Flexibility Act) The Commission certifies that the proposed rules will not, if adopted, have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The basis for this certification is that the Privacy Act applies only to ``individuals,'' and individuals are not ``small entities'' within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
