"If we announce that we are going to cut our oil exports, and if Russia demonstrates her desire to participate in that action, then she should, of course, do the same", Subroto told ITAR-TASS in an interview. "Or else there is no sense in cooperation, really, it would simply be harmful", Subroto continued, commenting on the information released by the Moscow-based World Energy Market Analytic and Forecasting Group (WEMAFG), headed by a famous Russian expert, Professor Yevgeniy Khartukov. Despite the decline in oil production in Russia, she continues to annually increase the amount of "black gold" exported beyond the limits of the former socialist bloc, declared Khartukov, who also teaches in the Moscow State Institute of International Relations and holds a senior post in the American East-West Center (based in Honolulu). While the Russian Federation daily exported an average of 1.81 million barrels of oil beyond the Soviet Union in 1991, the corresponding figure for 1993 was 2.29 [as received] barrels. The price of oil is hovering around an all-time low since OPEC was created, about 13 to 15 U.S. dollars per barrel, compared to 28 dollars a barrel just ten years ago. According to Subroto, representatives of the OPEC member countries intend to meet in Geneva on March 25 to discuss a five per cent lowering of export quotas for their respective governments. If they agree to take this step, then the same suggestion will be made to Russia and other large oil producers. "We alone cannot continually lower our exports" the secretary- general explained. "This 'cheating', by which some countries make profits off of OPEC policies but do not support the organisation on the world market, cannot continue forever", he declared. Subroto, who was taking part in an international forum on attracting foreign investment into the development of China's oil resources, which was held in the Beijing hotel "China World", also reported that OPEC countries produce a combined 24.52 million barrels of oil every day. Russia, whose representatives have repeatedly expressed their desire to cooperate with OPEC in coordinating their policies on the world market, produces about 3.5 times less than that. "If we want to improve the price situation, let's work together, through the combined efforts of OPEC, Russia, and other major oil producers, including China", the OPEC secretary-general said.
