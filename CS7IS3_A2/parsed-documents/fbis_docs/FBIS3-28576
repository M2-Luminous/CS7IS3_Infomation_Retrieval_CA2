The official stressed that North Korea has been very patient with the nuclear issue but that North Korea will not shrink but be resolute [turyoum opsi tangdanghage taehalkosirago] because its existence is at stake. The official from the North Korean UN mission, however, warned that if a war should break out, it will not be a repetition of the Gulf war situation in which Iraq suffered. In connection with the UN sanctions, the official said that although North Korea is having difficulties [pirok oryopkinun hana], it has been living without help from the United States, Japan, and Russia, and warned that even a worm resists when trampled upon. He did not make a negative statement about China, supporting the speculation that North Korea has had close contacts with Beijing over the nuclear issue. The official said that he has no knowledge of the reported possibility of a behind-the-scenes contact between the United States and North Korea this week prior to the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors meeting.
