They, partisans from the outset of an accord between all the center and center-right parties, now fear being crushed in the "mortal embrace" between Berlusconi and Bossi. And they fear that the exclusion of Fini's National Alliance from the electoral pact could prevent the victory of their lineup. Here are the doubts of Pier Ferdinando Casini and Clemente Mastella, the CCD's leaders in the North and South respectively. [Di Caro] Mr. Casini, what risks do you see in the League-Berlusconi alliance? [Casini] I view as positive the go-ahead which the League's congress has given to the possibility of a liberal-democratic grouping, but the difficulty is coming now, as one attempts to put together varying political formulations. I want to find out what space exists in this grouping for liberal Catholics. And I want it to be clear that this is not a problem of names, of candidates. In this field, obviously, it is numbers which count. Nobody wants to deny the weight of the League in the North. But the problem lies elsewhere: We are not ready to accept political annexation. We were the first to enter the game because we want to build a political project. [Di Caro] What concerns you in particular? [Casino] I would premise my comments by stating that Bossi has a colorful language, and in what he says one has to distinguish between folklore and political substance. But I am having a hard time coming to terms with a tired antifascism, within a constitutional set-up which is being served up over again and which does not make sense today. Something has shifted to the right, and today a prejudiced "no" to an electoral grouping with the National Alliance is not acceptable. And then, naturally, one will have to evaluate what changing an electoral agreement into a political agreement to govern will eventually involve. One can win only by resolving these problems. [Di Caro] Mr. Mastella, are you frightened by the League-Berlusconi embrace? [Mastella] Certainly, if the alliance fails to respect our Catholic identity, or if a desire for hegemony emerges, then there will be problems. Our negotiations with the other representatives of the moderate pole remain open, and we are not forced to be part of a pact at any cost. But I would recall a single fact: According to the polls, the moderate pole has 35 percent, and we have 4 percent. It is not so easy to do without the CCD. [Di Caro] Whom do you fear more, Bossi or Berlusconi? [Mastella] The danger certainly comes from the League. It is true that we are strongly rooted in the south, but we are a national party; that is why we wish to have a fair weight in the alliance. If, however, anyone raises his voice and in particular asks too much, also on the question of candidates, there will be serious problems. [Di Caro] Bossi has closed the door on the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. [Mastella] It is important to end the era of an excluding democracy, but also that of nostalgia, as it seems to me the National Alliance is doing. I believe that, in the electoral field, it is necessary to seek accords with this political force wherever it is possible. In the political field, in any case, one cannot deny that differences still exist between us and Fini.
