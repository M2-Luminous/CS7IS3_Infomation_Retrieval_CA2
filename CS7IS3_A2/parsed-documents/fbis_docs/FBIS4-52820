Moscow is welcoming such a remark by stating that the ROK Government has now started to have a correct understanding of the situation. It was pointed out that various reports in Seoul on the North Korean loggers were quite different from the actual situation in Siberia. Seoul's reports quoting ROK policy-makers that 'there are signs of collapse in North Korea,' and that hundreds of North Korean loggers earnestly desire to defect to the ROK, have left ROK diplomats in Moscow and correspondents, who have examined the loggers' issue for over three years, very bewildered. These reports were formulated as if all of the escapees wanted to defect to the ROK and that the motive for their defection was due to the desire for freedom and disillusion of the Kim Il-song regime. This is greatly different from the actual situation. Without considering the other side's situation, the ROK Government dealt with this complicated diplomatic issue as if it was a domestic issue, and gave the impression that the ROK Government had decided to accept the North Korean loggers. This was brought about due to the misunderstanding of the actual situation. Three years ago ROK media reported on the human rights issue regarding the North Korean loggers. In 1993 this issue was presented to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva. This resulted in Russia including an article on human rights in the agreement on North Korean loggers. At that time the escapees appealed for help at the ROK Embassy in Moscow, various companies, and churches, and some of them married 'Koreans' living in Moscow or Russian women to obtain certificates of residence. Some other escapees were successful in escaping to the ROK. A total of 170 North Korean loggers went to the ROK diplomatic missions in Moscow, Vladivostok, and Almaty to seek help. Officials of these diplomatic missions, however, estimate that many loggers made repeat visits. It is also being argued that among the 170 loggers there are a considerable amount of people who are working as 'foreign currency money earners' roaming throughout the former Soviet Union after conspiring with the agents of the North Korean logging sites. The Russian daily (SIBODNYA) made an in-depth study of the North Korean loggers issue and supported such an argument. (SIBODNYA) reports that the foreign currency money earners work and receive daily wages by working in plants and cooperative farms in the Khavarovsk region run by Russians because it is far easier to earn money than by working in the logging camps. They even ignore the date for their return to the logging camps and run away to the back country in Russia and marry Russian women to guarantee their status. ROK Embassy officials analyze that except for a minimum number of escapees, most of them want to remain in Russia and work as businessmen if their status is guaranteed because they fear the fatal blow their families in North Korea may face. Some of the escapees appeared in ROK media and appealed through tears for their situation. It is a fact, however, that some of them still exchange letters with their families in the North. This shows that there are loggers who are unclear about their status and purpose. Therefore, officials in Russia point out that if the government truly has the intention of resolving this issue, they must not hold the view that "even just a few of the escapees must be taken to the ROK" before President Kim visits Russia. Rather, voices are being raised that a measure must be established, after a more thorough investigation of the situation is carried out, so that it will not become a difficult issue which will make it hard to hold dialogue with North Korea.
