[Al-Tall] It is truly regrettable to see the sons of the one homeland fighting one another. This must be solved by dialogue, which helps people reach full and final solutions to their problems. Taking up arms to resolve their problems is rejected, regretted, and unacceptable at the national Yemeni and pan-Arab levels. Moreover, Jordan fully believes that Arab problems should be handled within the Arab family. Hence, Arab efforts should be consolidated as soon as possible to tackle the Yemeni issue to avoid any chance of intervention by non-Arab parties, which would further complicate the problem. Therefore, I appeal to our brother Yemenis to stop fighting at once and to return to dialogue to solve their problems. There is no problem in the world that cannot be solved through dialogue as long as the collective goal of all parties is the higher national Yemeni interest. We appeal to Arab states to quickly make the necessary efforts to resolve the existing problem in Yemen as soon as possible. [Abu-al-Majd] You hosted a meeting with Yemeni leaders in Amman to sign the Pledge and Accord Document. Are you prepared to invite these leaders to Jordan again to solve the problem? [Al-Tall] Jordan spares no effort to help any Arab state solve its problems. However, I believe that Jordan has already done all it can. I believe that the problem has deteriorated so much that now a collective Arab effort is needed. I think that the Arab Republic of Egypt, the major state in the Arab world, can play a role in finding a solution. Jordan will spare no effort to cooperate with its big sister Egypt. All other Arab states must assist in this matter. They have to stop the infighting among brother Yemenis as soon as possible. [Abu-al-Majd] Egypt has proposed an urgent meeting of the Arab League to discuss the Yemeni developments. The League has responded and the permanent delegates will be meeting at the League headquarters today. Does Jordan have any specific proposals to submit to this meeting in coordination with Egypt to resolve the crisis? [Al-Tall] Actually Jordan's previously announced proposals are clear and frank. Jordan has stated that the Yemeni brothers should solve their issues through dialogue and end their problems so that this predicament which has gripped fraternal Yemen for the past few months will disappear. Of course the Arab League's meeting at the delegate level is a positive step in this regard, but I hope the meeting will be quickly followed by other meetings, coordination, and contacts at a higher level to resolve this problem as quickly as possible. The issue has regrettably developed regrettably to a serious point and there is fear, God forbid, that it might escalate and forces from outside the Arab region might intervene. Jordan firmly believes Arab issues should be handled by the Arab nation itself without intervention by any force from outside the region. [Abu-al-Majd] Do we understand from your statement that you are demanding, for example, a summit meeting or at least one at the level of foreign ministers to resolve this issue? [Al-Tall] When the Arab League meets at a higher level, it will mean there is interest in the issue. I believe that the issue is of a magnitude that requires a meeting at the highest level and as soon as possible. I believe that if the mediation efforts are concerted, Arab efforts are rallied, and leaders of all Arab countries agree on a certain decision on Yemen, the Yemeni brothers will respond. [Abu-al-Majd] There is a proposal to send Arab forces to disengage the forces. If the measure is agreed upon do you believe it will contribute to resolving the crisis? [Al-Tall] I believe that an Arab meeting at the highest level would discuss all alternatives. If such a proposal has been submitted, why shouldn't it be implemented? However, I believe there still are some options that might prompt the Yemeni brothers to end the fighting and resume a dialogue. [Abu-al-Majd] What options? [Al-Tall] A joint Arab effort, led by Egypt.
