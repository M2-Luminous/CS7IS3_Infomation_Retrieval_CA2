FKI, which was commissioned by the government to form a single consortium for the multibillion-dollar project by next month, had decided Friday to oblige all aspiring companies to form their own consortia by Saturday to be screened for their eligibility, a FKI spokesman said. It made major headway in its responsibility after the Sunkyong Group, chaired by FKI Chairman Choe Chong-hyon, announced it was dropping out of the project and would instead bid for control of the state-run cellular monopoly, Korea Mobile Telecom, earlier in the week. The Ssangyong Group followed suit to ease the traffic by giving up its bid for leading shareholder of the second cellular network. Remaining competitors among the six consortia that vied until Sunkyong won in August 1992, but returned the license over alleged political favoritism, are Pohang Iron and Steel Co., Kolon Group, Dongbu group, and Tongyang Group. With Sunkyong and Ssangyong giving up, the competition for the leading role in the second mobile project narrows down to Sinsegi Mobile of Posco and Second Mobile of Kolon. Making all applicants form a new consortium was the best way to solve the complicated problem of allowing just the four companies in the project or randomly giving stakes to any company that wants them, the spokesman said. Under the decision, the four companies that have long prepared for the business stand in a very advantageous position and other firms that wish to have a stake in the new cellular network will have to join one of the four. FKI will decide and announce the screening criteria on Monday.
