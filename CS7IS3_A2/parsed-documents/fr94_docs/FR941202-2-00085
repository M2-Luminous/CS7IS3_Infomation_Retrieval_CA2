ACTION: Notice of request for extension of OMB approval. SUMMARY: This notice advises the public that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has requested extension of approval by the Office of Management and Budget for a currently approved collection of information (1212&hyph;0035) contained in its regulation on Allocating Unfunded Vested Benefits (29 CFR Part 2642). Current approval of the collection of information expires on December 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: All written comments should be addressed to: Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1212&hyph;0035), Washington, DC 20503. The request for extension will be available for public inspection at the PBGC Communications and Public Affairs Department, Suite 240, 1200 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Deborah C. Murphy, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Suite 340, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This collection of information is contained in the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (``PBGC's'') regulation on Allocating Unfunded Vested Benefits (29 CFR Part 2642). Section 4211(c)(5)(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'') requires the PBGC to prescribe by regulation a procedure whereby multiemployer pension plans can change the way they allocate unfunded vested benefits to withdrawing employers, subject to PBGC approval. Approval of a change is to be based on a determination that the change will not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants or the PBGC. The regulation on Allocating Unfunded Vested Benefits is issued pursuant to this statutory requirement. Section 2642.12 of the regulation prescribes the information that must be submitted to the PBGC under the regulation by a plan seeking PBGC approval for an amendment to its allocation method. This information is used by the PBGC to determine whether the proposed amendment satisfies the statutory standard. The PBGC estimates that 10 multiemployer plans per year submit information under the regulation and that it takes 3 hours to prepare a submission, for a total annual burden of 30 hours. Issued at Washington, D.C., this 23rd day of November 1994. Martin Slate, Executive Director, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
