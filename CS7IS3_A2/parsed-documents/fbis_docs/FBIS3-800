Witnesses say a man in a bakkie [pickup] began firing on groups of ANC supporters. A short while later he was stabbed to death and his vehicle was set alight. The incident began when hundreds of IFP supporters occupied the stadium this morning ahead of a planned ANC rally there. The ANC contingent, who were turned away earlier by police using tear smoke, has regrouped and is heading for the stadium. The ANC says it is to lay charges against IFP members for contravention of the Electoral Act, and said that IFP supporters had flouted the terms of last month's agreement between Mr. Mandela and Dr. Buthelezi which guaranteed free political activity.
