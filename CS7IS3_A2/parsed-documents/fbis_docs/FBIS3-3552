When the retained water is discharged from the reservoir in the dry seasons the extra flow will wash pollutants downstream. Experts on water resources protection came to this conclusion after three years of on-the-spot investigation. They said the effect is apparent in the section from the reservoir site near Yichang to Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei Province. They started the research in 1990 in four selected sections along the Chang Jiang, focusing on water quality changes with water level fluctuations. The reservoir, expected to be built over the next 15 years, will have a normal water level of 175 m [meters] and a total storage capacity of 39.3 billion cu [cubic] m.
