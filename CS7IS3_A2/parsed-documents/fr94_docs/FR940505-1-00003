The authority citation for Part 1980 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 1989; 42 U.S.C. 1480; 5 U.S.C. 301; 7 CFR 2.23 and 2.70. Subpart A_General 2. Section 1980.69 is added to read as follows: §1980.69 Future collections. After a loan or an account has been liquidated, and the final loss claim has been paid, FmHA will continue to maintain the borrower account in an active status for 3 fiscal years, following the fiscal year in which liquidation was completed or until the account is paid in full, the borrower and all guarantors have been released from liability, and/or the account is otherwise satisfied. A lender may, with FmHA's concurrence, release a borrower and/or cosigner from liability only when adequate compensation/consideration is received. The servicing official will continue to monitor the collection efforts of the lender during the 3 fiscal years following the fiscal year in which the final loss claim was paid. The servicing official will send FmHA Form Letter 1980&hyph;A&hyph;1 along with Form FmHA 1980&hyph;26, ``Report on Collection Activities on Liquidated Accounts,'' by October 31st of each year, to each lender that has an FmHA guaranteed loan account which remains unsatisfied after the payment of the final loss claim. The loan servicing official will establish a follow-up system to assure each lender returns the appropriately completed Form FmHA 1980&hyph;26, by November 30th. Appropriate follow-up will be initiated for those lenders not providing adequate information as a result of the servicing official's request. The servicing official will forward these reports by program to the State Director by December 15th. The State Director will consolidate the reports by program and report the results to the Administrator by December 31st of each year. The FmHA servicing official will ensure that any funds received by the lender after the payment of the final loss claim will be prorated between FmHA and the lender in accordance with the Lender's Agreement. The lender will promptly transmit to FmHA such amounts recovered in proportion to the percentage of the guaranteed portion of the loan by using Form FmHA 1980&hyph;43, ``Lender's Guaranteed Loan Payment to FmHA,'' and the lender will retain such amount in proportion to the percentage of the unguaranteed portion of the loan.
