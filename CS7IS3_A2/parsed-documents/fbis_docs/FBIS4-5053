The officials said Fujii and Paye, secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, exchanged views on the economic situation. The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been under pressure to implement tax cuts on a continuing basis to stimulate domestic demand, thereby increasing market potential for imports. Fujii told Paye the government is considering full-scale tax cuts in fiscal 1995 and onward, the officials said. Legislation for a 20 percent reduction in income and residential taxes for this year has already cleared the Diet. Fujii was quoted as telling Paye the government considers it necessary to raise the 3.0 percent consumption tax rate to help ease the tax burden on middle-class wage earners, the officials said. Paye, on a regular visit to Japan for consultations with Japanese leaders, expressed hope that tax cuts will help stimulate consumer spending in Japan and expand domestic demand, they said.
