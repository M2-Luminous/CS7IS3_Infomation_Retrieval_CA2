Each district will elect one deputy. (In October 1992, when Georgia-wide parliamentary elections were held, they did not take place in these areas owing to a complicated sociopolitical situation. At that time the districts were controlled by armed supporters of Zviad Gamsakhurdia). Among the six deputies running for one seat in the Zugdidi district is Georgian Prime Minister Otari Patsatsiya. Born in Zugdidi, he held responsible economic and state posts in the district for several years. Many observers believe that Otari Patsatsiya will win these elections in the Zugdidi district, where his efforts to stabilize the situation in November 1993 are well remembered. On 12 June, elections will also take place in the city of Rustavi in eastern Georgia. Zhiuli Shartava, Georgian parliament deputy from this city, was assassinated on 27 September 1993 by Abkhaz militants during the storming of Sukhumi. At the time he was chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic. Generally, the issue of elections in Georgia is very acute. Some political parties propose that early parliamentary elections be held, considering it important to renew the parliament composition. Other parties believe that there is no need to hold elections to the Georgian parliament until Georgia's jurisdiction has been established over the territory of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
