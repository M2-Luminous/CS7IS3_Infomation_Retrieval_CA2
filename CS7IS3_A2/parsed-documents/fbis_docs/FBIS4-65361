Philippe Lemaitre, LE MONDE correspondent in Brussels, writes in the 30 April edition of that Paris daily that attention is focused on Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commission vice president in charge of foreign economic relations, Ruud Lubbers, the Netherlands prime minister, and Jean-Luc Dehaene, his Belgian counterpart. Brittan, while "brilliant and efficient...has little support in France," Lemaitre contends. Brittan succeeded during the GATT negotiations in not antagonizing the French. However, the suspicion of partiality that resulted from some of his positions--notably his refusal to allow the French Aerospatiale firm to purchase the Canadian De Havilland company--still lingers. Brittan's concept of Europe does not dovetail with France's, Lemaitre continues, citing an observer as saying that "for Brittan, the Union is merely a free-trade zone with a single currency." This approach may prove untenable, as the next president's most important task may well be the 1996 intergovernmental conference aimed at the political integration of Europe. As for Ruud Lubbers, Lemaitre notes, he was long considered the "obvious" candidate, benefiting from the support of "socialist heavyweights" Delors and Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister. A federalist, Lubbers might achieve the needed balance in a Union threatened by division. However, Germany did not appreciate his "reticence" at the time of German unification, and both President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl were reportedly "irked" by Lubbers' "tolerance" of British Prime Minister John Major's demands during the Maastricht negotiations. If repeated, this stance could "paralyze" the 1996 political-institutional debate, Lemaitre contends. However, Lubbers' chances are good, especially if the British, convinced that a Brittan candidacy could not succeed, grant him their support. Both France and Germany, Lemaitre continues, would prefer Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose behavior is unanimously praised. A "well-mannered Christian Democrat," Dehaene is appreciated in Paris for his knowledge of the issues and the directness with which he would conduct--"more fluently in French than in English"--the efforts necessary to achieve progress in European construction. According to Lemaitre, the impression is that Dehaene would defend political union "without dogmatism but with determination." Dehaene, Lemaitre contends, represents a "familiar and reassuring Europe" at a time of impending enlargement. He would not meet with total British opposition, even if Paris and Bonn "are banking on his resoluteness to counter, if necessary, London's penchant for a European space without political consistency." If the constraints of Belgian domestic politics were to block Dehaene's candidacy, an "outsider" like Etienne Davignon, president of the Societe Generale de Belgique and a former commissioner of proven efficiency, might be considered a "perfectably acceptable Belgian alternative," Lemaitre writes. Another candidate may be Peter Sutherland, the Irishman recently appointed secretary general of the GATT. France's desire to preserve intact its place in the next Commission might not be easy, given Delors' long presidency. The French tradition mandating the appointment of one commissioner from the ranks of the governing majority and another from the opposition will probably be maintained, Lemaitre predicts. A possible French "ticket" composed of former Prime Minister Edith Cresson--who would enjoy Mitterrand's support--and Rally for the Republic (RPR) deputy Jean-Bernard Raymond would illustrate the government's wish to send to Brussels political figures rather than "distrusted technocrats." On the Left, other candidates might be former European Affairs Minister Elisabeth Guigou and former Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet. On the Right, Balladur's adviser on European affairs, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, whose talent is generally acknowledged, is sometimes mentioned despite his lack of political experience. Another possible candidate mentioned is Eurodeputy Jean-Louis Bourlanges, "one of the few French Europarliamentarians to have succeeded in escaping anonymity," Lemaitre concludes. Marie-Martine Buckens also discusses the succession in the 30 April Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. While her report essentially agrees with Lemaitre's, she adds that the fact Sir Leon Brittan is British presents a "double disadvantage." First, he belongs to a "big" country, and tradition mandates that the next president ought to come from a "small" country. Second, Brittan must convince his partners of his "loyalty" on social policy and monetary union, two priority issues from which Great Britain has distanced itself. As for Jean-Luc Dehaene, Buckens comments that he is reportedly the favorite of the "Franco-German axis," a factor of "decisive" importance. Fulfilling the "small" country condition, Dehaene, endowed with "a gift of compromise, pragmatism, and directness," deserved his partners' unanimous praise for the way the 1993 Belgian EU presidency was conducted.
