Travel agencies were the first to bear the brunt of the boycott, following the announcement of a boycott of package tours to Mainland China as of 1 May by the Taipei Association of Travel Agencies. As of now, cross-strait economic exchanges and trade remain brisk and are unstoppable, while the travel agencies which play a leading role in the boycott have suffered misfortune and incurred heavy losses. The boycott of mainland-bound travel has inflicted heavy economic losses on travel agencies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China, with the losses suffered by those in Taiwan especially heavy. Travel agencies who organize mainland-bound tours represent a sizable proportion of all travel agencies in Taiwan. In Taipei City alone, there are up to 100 travel agencies that operate mainland-bound tours. It is estimated that Taiwan's travel agencies incurred 200-300 million yuan in losses as a result of suspending mainland-bound package tours in April. Every year, the months of April through June are the peak season for mainland-bound travel. Boycott-induced losses incurred by travel agencies this year are inestimable. The boycott of mainland-bound tours is against the will of the majority of travel agencies. Travel agencies raised strong objections when the boycott injunction was first issued on 13 April. They noted that the Association of Travel Agencies had not consulted the organizations representing travel agencies when it announced the boycott. They also complained that the MAC should not use their business as a political bargaining chip. The Qiandao Lake incident has been resolved. At the invitation of Mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, officials of the Straits Exchange Foundation, the victims' families, and relevant experts traveled to Hangzhou on 8 May to deal with post-incident matters. It is believed that efforts of relevant departments will lead to a reasonable resolution of matters arising from the Qiandao Lake incident. The Association of Travel Agencies recently asked MAC to call off the boycott, citing the heavy losses suffered by travel agencies, the prospect of closure facing travel agencies, and attendant social problems. The MAC, however, asked travel agencies to continue the boycott on the grounds that Mainland China had not met three requests -- investigating the actual state of affairs, paying compensation in the aftermath of the incident, and determining who is to blame. This practice, which is driven by self-interest without regard to the interests of travel agencies, has compounded the woes of the latter who are already in deep trouble. Problems of one kind or another are inevitable in the ever-expanding exchanges and contacts across the Taiwan Straits. What matters is how the relevant departments on both sides of the Taiwan Straits confront or resolve those problems. The Taiwan authorities have played up the Qiandao Lake incident, which is purely a criminal case, in order to politicize the incident and to use the incident as a bargaining chip to strengthen their political leverage with Mainland China. Such actions will only hurt, not benefit, the sound development of cross-strait relations. The boycott of mainland-bound travel has inflicted unnecessary losses on travel agencies on the both sides of the Taiwan Straits. However, people should heighten their vigilance and prevent the boycott from snowballing and causing more problems of a greater magnitude.
