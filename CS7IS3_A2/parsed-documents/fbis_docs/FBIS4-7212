"Japan's economic growth seems to have stopped weakening," the central bank said in its quarterly economic outlook. The "prospect of a gentle recovery is possible" during the fiscal year that began this month, a central bank official said, but added that "we cannot make an immediate decision" about the connection between the halt to declines and a turnaround. Uncertainties remain, the report says, citing corporate and financial balance-sheet adjustments, the effects of jobs cuts and other streamlining and foreign exchange movements. It notes that the first quarters of 1992 and 1993 also showed bright signs that did not pan out, but says that this time, "indicators of personal consumption picked up and machinery orders, a leading indicator of business investment, began to show signs of bottoming out." Personal consumption, a major engine of the economy, will likely grow gradually this quarter, the report says. Money supply growth will remain sluggish in the quarter, between 1 percent and 2 percent above year-earlier levels, the report says. The official said that while such tepid growth is not good for recovery, money supply alone is not enough to put a drag on the economy. Japan's corporate capital spending will continue to fall, keeping downward pressure on the economy, but the extent of declines should narrow, the BOJ report says. It notes that production and shipments have risen at Japan's mines and factories but cautions that some of the effect could be from fiscal year-end sales promotions. Production and shipments could weaken again in the April-June quarter, it says. "Any momentum for production recovery will remain weak, as household income and corporate profits will be low," the report says. Total domestic demand should recover gradually, with consumption helped by this year's income tax cuts and continued stable prices, it says. The central bank found "lesser weakness in final demand," citing continued strong housing investment, higher consumption of such items as appliances, a halt to the fall in machinery orders and a pickup in exports due to recovering overseas demand. That rise in exports, the report says, has boosted Japan's trade surplus. "Labor conditions continue to ease," it says, but no "drastic" further adjustments are expected. The BOJ official said some firms must continue restructuring efforts but that the process need not be completed nationwide for recovery to occur. Noting recent rises in long-term money market rates, the report says overseas rises and expectations of fresh bond supply may have played a part but that the trend "also seems to have reflected market expectations for economic recovery and upturns in corporate profits."
