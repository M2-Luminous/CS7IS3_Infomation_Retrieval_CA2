Questions Put to Press Secretary and His Replies"] [Text] [Kuchkina] What does the press secretary's job entail: dispelling rumors, telling the truth as it is, shaping the president's image, or to some extent adjusting policy? [Kostikov] This job is relatively new in our political setup, and there are no hard-and-fast rules. When I had my first conversation with B.N. [Yeltsin] he set me no tasks, evidently based on my sound reputation as a democratic journalist. So the press service and the press secretary have been shaped by me myself depending on my level of political culture and, of course, society's level of political development. [Kuchkina] What is the mechanism for your statements? At the president's request? Your own initiative, when you have picked something out? Do you make a statement autonomously or do you agree everything with the president? [Kostikov] It depends on the specific case. If what is needed is an official reaction on a complex question with political or economic consequences, everything is agreed. [Kuchkina] Even including the wording? [Kostikov] As a rule the president sets the political tone. He says two or three key phrases which provide the opportunity to formulate something in the context of the situation that has arisen. There are various forms depending on the weight we want to impart to the statement. For instance, sometimes I say: I am authorized to state -- then it is clearly coming from the president. Whether [a statement is made] on the president's or the press secretary's initiative, it is always with the president's consent. But the press secretary has no pretensions to pass everything off as the president's opinion. [Kuchkina] What if B.N. reacts to something by saying: Why did you do that? [Kostikov] That has not happened. I may be mistaken as to a particular detail, but the president is too broad-minded a man and too big a statesman to react to minor mistakes. [Kuchkina] I had thought about your job and wanted to ask certain questions when I saw and heard on television something the whole country saw and heard, once and then a second time, namely that on Saturdays Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy apparently goes to the bathhouse with the president and plays checkers with him, and that he is generally pleased that everything is proceeding correctly; Gaydar and Fedorov have already departed and Kozyrev and Chubays are next in line; that is, it is as if he gives the orders and the president executes them obediently, which amounts to a public backslapping of the president. It is apparently the press secretary's job to give society some explanation regarding this, and I waited for you to do so. You kept silent. Why? Is it an oversight or did you have nothing to object to since the foregoing is the truth? [Kostikov] I will explain why I did not react. Naturally it is utter nonsense: Zhirinovskiy has not once met with the president tete-a-tete, he was invited to the Kremlin only once for a meeting with B.N. as one of a number of faction leaders on the threshold of the elections and referendum. [Kuchkina] That is, no personal meetings? [Kostikov] None. The president did not go to the bathhouse with him, did not walk along snowy paths, did not drink cognac, and did not sit down at the same table. It is typical loudmouth mendacity on Zhirinovskiy's part. Which, incidentally, is not characteristic of him alone. It is a level of nonsense to which the press secretary should not react. [Kuchkina] I cannot agree with you. What is obvious to you is completely unobvious to the mass of people who, having swallowed some piece of information, draw their own conclusions. Not about Zhirinovskiy as a loudmouth liar who takes people in but who does not have a hand laid on him, but about a turnaround by Yeltsin and about a possible secret pact with Zhirinovskiy, about which certain politicians and newspapermen both here and in the West are readily spreading rumors. I think these things do great harm to the president and his policies. A mass attack is in progress. Several times I have been sent local newspapers, most of which are in the hands of the democrats' opponents, let us call them that, and they print the most brazen lies, the most blatant antidemocratic, antipresidential propaganda, and in the provinces people simply read the local press and believe it. Especially when the voice of denial does not reach them from here. Up to now television has been a kind of government channel and if Zhirinovskiy says something on it, that means it is true. The democrats' arrogance has already played its fateful role. Why repeat the same mistakes? Why not issue a press release one day saying that this, this, and this are lies? In any form, even a witty one. In my view one simply has to "lower oneself." Not to political intrigues but to people who are interested to know whether the Liberal Democratic Party leader is in fact so powerful. [Kostikov] I think the press has fallen down on the job here. If a journalist, an agency, or a newspaper had called me the next day and asked, I would have responded. I dream of giving weekly briefings for journalists. The organizational difficulty is that to hold them without a preliminary conversation between the press secretary and the president would be of no interest to journalists, and B.N. has a very hectic schedule. But I had a conversation with B.N. on this subject and he agreed that before every briefing we would have a quiet half-hour together. I hope that he has now recovered, God grant him health.... [Kuchkina] Let us talk about health. The well-known story of the telephone conversation that never took place, when one president could not find the other, or the other could not wait long by the telephone -- here you expressed yourself in the same way as you did regarding items in the press associated with the subject of health. True, rather mutedly. I rarely frequent "society," but every time I do I hear "totally accurate" information "received from competent sources" that the president has a tumor in this or that place, that he is not long for this world, that soon everything will be over. I live near the White House: In September-October these rumors were being persistently spread among the crowd there. They have now spread to official offices, to ceremonial launches, and everyone declares that he knows all about this. I would like to hear information from you because I know how disinformation is circulated, including that with a political aim. [Kostikov] You have partly answered the question yourself. As regards the telephone: When communications are set up, and that means interpreters and technical services enter the conversation -- both presidents have to be near the telephone. Our president was at the telephone twice. He waited a decent time but Clinton was either not in the vicinity or was late. Indeed, when Clinton was here we saw that he was tardy for every event. [Kuchkina] Did Yavlinskiy not tell journalists that Clinton could not get through to Yeltsin but his American acquaintance got through to him at night, saying: Grisha, if you have the only telephone in Russia on which it is possible to converse, why do you and not the president have it? [Kostikov] Well, that is halfway to being a joke among friends. As regards ill health. The press and society are entitled to monitor the president's health and demand reports on it, but only when this is done normally and with good intentions, whereas when political speculation begins.... That is why I said God grant him health. When you work long enough in a particular team a element of family feeling arises. I say this as I used to say God grant health to Vasiliy Semenovich, my father, when he was alive. Or like I say this to my mother. It is natural human warmth. But on the other hand, you realize that the president's health is national capital, especially in our case, when the level of political stability in the country depends directly on Yeltsin. Therefore we all suffer when B.N. becomes run-down or catches a cold, like now, or, like six months ago, when his radiculitis became exacerbated. As regards speculation, I have noticed that this wave usually begins abroad, and in a few days safely completes the migration to our press. There is nothing accidental here, the president is a major political figure who stands in many people's way. Just watch which newspapers this appears in -- the attentive reader or analyst will see everything clearly. [Kuchkina] That just applies to an analyst. While I, I repeat, am talking about society, which does not consist wholly of analysts, and this massive barrage of rumors is doing its destructive work. [Kostikov] My position is that it is still necessary to take account of people's psychology. For 70 years it has not been the done thing in this country to talk about the health of supreme great leaders [vozhd] and other leaders [lider]. Just like before those 70 years. In churches prayers were said every day for the health of the sovereign emperor, but that is as far as it went. In the people's opinion the leader is somewhere high up there and there are things about which it is not done to speak. Unlike the West, where a leader's every step and every gesture is on view, and the leaders themselves encourage this. B.N.'s health is entirely normal for a man of his age. His mother died recently at a ripe old age, all his relatives have lived a very long time, and he comes from very vigorous genetic stock. [Kuchkina] So everything I mentioned is lies? [Kostikov] Even dishonorable lies. [Kuchkina] What about the rumor that he is completely incapable of working, not up to the job, insane?... [Kostikov] The situation is completely the reverse. The president is doing a great deal of work. He is a workaholic. He virtually works a 24-hour day. [Kuchkina] I think you are incorrect in saying that in the people's opinion a leader is somewhere high up and remote. We have managed to get used to Yeltsin as a democratic leader, as one of us, which is why the people followed him as a person who is close to them. But lately he has somehow kept aloof at inaccessible heights, he has shut himself away. It is the accepted thing to gossip about his aloofness at crucial and noncrucial moments. This particularly applies to the night of 3 October -- why he did not address television viewers? In this case I personally know why. Because at that time he was tackling a task of immense importance and he had to solve it before appearing on the screen and addressing the people. But why is he absent now? Notwithstanding the fact that he is terribly busy he must return to contacts with society in one form or another. [Kostikov] I quite agree with you, and the letters we are receiving contain the refrain: Return our president of old to us, we want to see him on a truck with a megaphone, in a crowd, among us.... [Kuchkina] No, I do not buy that, I subscribe to a completely different view. A change of tasks has occurred. [Kostikov] Yes. Previously it was necessary to win power in order to protect democracy, power is now in his hands. An enormous country and an enormous burden of power. [Kuchkina] I am not talking about going on walkabouts among the people or about video clips. I am talking about necessary appearances and the manifestation of his presidential will now, when the social situation is so complex. [Kostikov] The situation is in fact alarming. The state of the Federal Assembly, especially the State Duma, causes the greatest concern. There were hopes that the Duma would be different, more professional, and wiser, but we can see that leaders of factions are not at all concerned that Russia needs judicial reform, laws which would indicate the parameters of a market economy. So much time has passed but the Duma has still not gotten down to its legislative work. Many leaders went there to make political capital, to flex their political biceps. [Kuchkina] You are emphasizing the Duma at a time when a considerable amount of criticism has been concentrated on the government, and it can be seen that changing its course involves danger, as does changing the president's course. But I want to draw your attention to Kronid Lyubarskiy's sensational NOVOYE VREMYA article entitled "Falsification." Apart from describing cases of blatant substitution [?of ballot rigging] [podstanovka] and sharp practice, the author resorts to scientific mathematical models and shows that if there is a constant electorate in cities of 70 percent for reforms, 20 percent against, and 10 percent neither for nor against, that is, Zhirinovskiy's former electorate, and scientifically speaking it is impossible to have such a change of correlations as occurred 12 December. The falsifiers were convinced that a thief is not a thief unless he is caught in the act. But mathematics is a crafty thing, it reveals deceit even in places where it has apparently been well concealed. In this context the author talks of the "poorly heard voice of the majority," in adapting to which the president and government have started adjusting their policy, and that is their dramatic mistake. [Kostikov] First, summaries of, so to speak, states of mind, sentiments, and expectations are regularly put on the president's desk. He is aware of all this. Second, I do not know of a single step by the president which would attest to a change in his democratic orientation. If you listen to his Message to the Federal Assembly, all guidelines for democratic reforms are clearly stipulated there. There is no retreat. [Kuchkina] What about the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov? [Kostikov] It was they who departed. The president did not instigate their departure in any way. On the contrary, as far as I know he devoted a great deal of effort to get Gaydar, Pamfilova, and Fedorov to stay. [Kuchkina] People say that the president is powerless in relation to the premier? [Kostikov] There is no powerlessness of any kind. The president and the premier each have their own set of powers. B.N. does not want to violate this setup and interfere in all the actions of another plenipotentiary figure. At the end of the day economic policy is entrusted to the premier. The president determines the broad course. But the government implements it. The president can dismiss the entire government, but first it must have a chance to carry out the president's wishes, implementing them by the methods which it thinks best. I personally think that Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin himself does not realize the full extent of the seriousness of the aspirations of those who are acting behind his back. [Kuchkina] What about his consultations with Starodubtsev? [Kostikov] You know, I would very much like B.N. to ask the premier this question in a personal conversation. Does Starodubtsev have such a wealth of experience in forming the agricultural economy's structures that in the reform process they will ultimately be able to start feeding Russia? In this sense has the experience of the State Committee for the State of Emergency been devalued? Generally the president and premier have good personal contacts. In addition, while highly appraising Gaydar's acts on the night of 3-4 October, when he went out into the square in front of Moscow City Soviet, I cannot fail to give due credit to Chernomyrdin's chivalrous -- in the full sense of the word -- conduct on the same and the preceding days, when he adopted a pro-presidential position without hesitation and did not deviate from it. [Kuchkina] That is correct. But what can you say about Chernomyrdin's defense of Gerashchenko? The democratic press has been full of criticism of Gerashchenko's autonomous policy associated with the "illegal cash office," whereby prior to the October days "under-the-counter" trillions disappeared goodness knows where, that is, it is known where -- on support for the Supreme Soviet; with monetary reform in the summer; and with the unification of finances with Belarus, for which Russians will pay dearly, and a clear position on the restoration of the Soviet empire can be discerned behind everything. [Kostikov] Oh, how I would love to obtain answers to all these questions! But allow me to confine myself to saying that. [Kuchkina] Which of the president's reactions do you recall as being the strongest? [Kostikov] Like every Russian man he is very emotional inside and restrained outwardly. Maybe one moment has remained the most striking for me. When his mother died. For the first and only time I saw him weep. And again when people were preparing to impeach him and he went out onto the congress platform without preparation and delivered himself of a very powerful emotional performance. [Kuchkina] Do you happen to know why the president said in a conversation with Ryazanov that he never thinks about death? Is he not afraid of dying? [Kostikov] I think...because he has already done something for Russia. Who is afraid of dying? He who has done nothing, accomplished nothing, and not fulfilled himself. B.N. is doing something to which he devotes his whole self as a moral person.
