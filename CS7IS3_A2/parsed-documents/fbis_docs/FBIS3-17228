[Meshkov] Yes, on 27 March. [KURIER] But President Kravchuk has vetoed it.... [Meshkov] We are aware of that. [KURIER] What would happen if Kravchuk were to impose a state of emergency after the vote? [Meshkov] Then I would have to feel sorry for the work of his unprofessional advisers. I abide by the Crimean constitution and what goes beyond it -- namely the desire of the citizens. [KURIER] What do you think of Zhirinovskiy? [Meshkov] Zhirinovskiy is a highly talented man. He is much more serious than one would gather from his behavior toward the press. He is the only person in the Duma who expresses the needs of this huge people. [KURIER] What help do you expect from Russia? [Meshkov] No state can survive without outside help. We want to overcome isolation. If this is the only way out then we will opt for it. Russia has never tried to avoid supporting us -- which used to be normal, while now this support has been artificially restricted. [KURIER] Why do you want to integrate the Crimea into the ruble zone? [Meshkov] It is my duty to do the best for the Crimea. It is not the fault of the Ukrainian laws that we have been maneuvered into this disastrous situation. We must protect ourselves against Ukrainian inflation destroying the economy of the Crimea. [KURIER] Will there be war in the Crimea as in the former Yugoslavia? [Meshkov] You cannot compare them. Here there are no nationality or religious conflicts. We have always been part of the Russian people -- and we are part of it today.
