Under the contract between the two cities, China will be responsible for construction and profits are to be divided equally, trade and shipping industry sources here said Tuesday. China has promised to put up 65 million U.S. dollars while guaranteeing to supply North Korea with 10 freight cars, one 3-ton truck, one 16-passenger bus, two 44-passenger buses, one jeep and 1,000 tons of wheat flour. North Korea, in return, will lease out a 10,000-square-meter storage site at 90 cents per square meter a year. The contract also states that North Korea will open Chongjin port to all foreign vessels and allow enterpot [as received] freight transporation regardless of the cargo's origin. Trade officials said mutual interest brought about the contract since Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture wanted to use the North Korean port to cut the transport distance for 400 South Korean manufacturers in the region on the current route from Dalian, while the North Koreans were in need of foreign currency. They confirmed that Chongjin-Hoeryong road construction is under way from their Chinese trade partners. Shipping industry sources said it has been easy to transport South Korean goods on vessels from other nations, but it would still be difficult for South Korean flagged-ships to enter the North Korean port directly due to complicated procedures at home.
