Kuo and Y.C. Tsai] [Text] Bangkok, April 29 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Thailand will hold another round of tariff reduction talks under the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in late June, a ranking Taiwan official said Friday [29 April]. Lin Yi-fu, deputy director-general of Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade, made the statement following the conclusion of the first round of negotiations here. Lin led a 13-member Taiwan delegation at the GATT tariff consultations, while Thailand was represented by Puangrat Asavaphisisth, assistant director-general of business economy at the Ministry of Commerce. During the one-day talks, Lin said, both sides agreed on tariff cuts for 40 items among the 38 agricultural goods and 20 industrial products under discussions. Taiwan agreed to lower import duties on the 40 items an average of 24 percent, Lin said. Those items pending agreement include fruits such as mango, papaya, mangosteen, and rambutan as well as rice products, for which Thailand is seeking significant tariff reductions, he added. Lin and his delegation, who earlier visited Manila, the Philippines and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for similar tariff talks, will return to Taipei Saturday. Taiwan has held similar talks with the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South Korea, and Hungary. Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulating body. Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.
