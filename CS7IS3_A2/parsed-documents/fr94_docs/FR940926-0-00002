Price adjustments apply to subscriptions and to single issues. On September 1, 1992, the Administrative Committee announced that it was adopting a policy of full cost recovery to ensure that revenues from subscriptions and single issue sales would keep pace with increased costs attributable to printing and labor expenses at the Government Printing Office (GPO) plant and prior postal rate increases (57 FR 40024). The Administrative Committee resolved to adjust prices over a period of several years and to conduct an annual review to determine the rate of increase necessary to gradually bring prices into alignment with costs. On December 10, 1993, the Administrative Committee further adjusted prices of Federal Register publications pursuant to the annual pricing review (58 FR 64871). After reviewing the Government Printing Office's most current analysis of its production and distribution costs, the Administrative Committee has determined that further incremental increases in the prices to be charged for the paper editions of Federal Register publications are necessary to achieve full cost recovery. The increased prices reflected in this final rule are primarily attributable to labor charges, equipment costs and prospective postal rate increases for second class mail. Changes to prices of the microfiche editions of the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) are also included in this final rule. Production of the microfiche editions of these publications is subject to a competitive bidding process that determines the prices to be charged. While overall subscription prices for microfiche copies have increased, prices of individual copies have decreased or remained the same. The following rates are effective as of October 26, 1994. The annual subscription rates for the Federal Register paper edition are increased to $494, or $544 for a combined Federal Register , Federal Register Index and LSA (List of CFR Section Affected) subscription. The annual subscription price of the microfiche edition of the Federal Register , including the Federal Register Index and LSA, is increased to $433. The price for single copies of the daily Federal Register is increased to $8 for the paper edition. The annual subscription price for the Federal Register Index is increased to $24. The annual subscription price for the monthly LSA is increased to $26. The annual subscription rates for the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents are increased to $75 by non-priority mail, or $132 by first-class mail. The price of an individual copy is increased to $3. As of January 1, 1994, the annual subscription rates for a full set of the Code of Federal Regulations are increased to $883 for the paper edition and $264 for the microfiche edition. The price of a single volume in microfiche form is reduced to $1.
