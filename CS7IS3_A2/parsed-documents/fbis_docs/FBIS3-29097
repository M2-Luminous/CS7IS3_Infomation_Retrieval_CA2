Recalling that the United States, instead of seeking a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, has unilaterally broken up dialogue and even sent an ultimatum to the DPRK threatening it with "sanctions," the statement said it is a scheme to stifle the socialist system of the DPRK and destroy its independent national economy. Noting that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused by the United States' deployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea, it strongly urged the United States to immediately withdraw its nuclear weapons from South Korea. The statement called upon the Indian and world peaceloving people to lift up louder voices of justice for thwarting the moves of the U.S. warmaniacs against the DPRK.
