FR941103-2-00058 FR941103-2-00031 Response: Western was provided a draft work-in-progress depletion schedule by UCRC representatives in April 1994. This latest unofficial schedule demonstrated a reduced and delayed schedule for development of Upper Basin projects. However, the schedule had yet to be approved by the Basin States and, once received by Reclamation, would still have required considerable work by Reclamation staff to modify depletion (demand) data used by the CRSM. In addition, subsequent analysis by Western's power resources and rates staff would have taken considerable time and effort before new information could be verified and supported for inclusion in any revised PRS for this proposed rate process. For example, the final PRS used for the April 1994 rate brochure was created in March of 1994. Its power projections were the end result of several months of work by Western and Reclamation resources staff. An official depletion schedule ready for use in July of 1994 would have delayed the public process for the current rate adjustment by several additional months. Western is responsible for seeing that the Integrated Projects earn sufficient revenues to pay all of their obligations on time. Such a lengthy delay in implementing the rate adjustment would have resulted in increased interest cost to customers, lost revenues, and, as a result, higher firm power rates. Western has assured UCRC that when official depletion information is available, has been incorporated into Reclamation's CRSM data files, and there is a common understanding of the reasonable certainty of future water projects, the associated generation effects will be weighed and a decision made by Western regarding their inclusion in any future PRS. i. Comment: The attorney for a customer stated: .␣.␣. the treatment of depletions in this rate case has nothing to do with the water rights of the Upper Basin States. Nor does it have anything to do with how those rights will be exercised in the future. Western has no power over the water rights of the Upper Basin States. Conversely, the power users should not be punished because of delays in Upper Basin water use development and fears of Upper Basin water users that such development may ultimately not occur. Response: Western agrees with this comment. 2. Purchased Power Expense Four large customer organizations all commented extensively on purchased power expense: a. Comment: A customer organization stated: The assumed lower prices for surplus energy sales are, in fact, at odds with recent experience for the SLCA/IP. It is clear that experience does not support Western's pricing assumptions, which were based on combining various pricing and cost data in an inconsistent and somewhat arbitrary fashion. (The commentor) recommends that Western modify its pricing assumptions by setting prices for surplus sales at the same levels as those used for purchases. Response: Western agrees, in part, with comments that assumed nonfirm surplus sales pricing in the estimation of future-year net purchased power expenses does not reflect an extension of historic pricing trends. This fact is supported in documentation prepared by Western on the methodology and assumptions developed in previous rate proceedings and consistently applied again in this proposed rate adjustment. The imposed restrictions at Glen Canyon Dam have caused Western to sell off-peak surplus energy. The impact of these sales is based upon the market conditions. Western has explained that the basis for assumptions of future surplus sales pricing is based upon consideration of the potential market conditions. Western assumes that there will be a need to dispose of limited onpeak surpluses in southern markets, which will mean competing against low-cost sales from the Navajo Generating Station. Western will also try to sell significant surpluses in northern markets, competing against low-cost sales from regional northern utilities. Certain general conclusions may be drawn: (1) average nonfirm surplus energy prices, both offpeak and onpeak, will be less than historic conditions, this also implies that period pricing (onpeak or offpeak) will be less than recent experience, (2) historic pricing differentials, onpeak versus offpeak, winter versus summer season, will continue, and (3) Western's hourly modeling of constrained operations at Glen Canyon is reasonable. Though the method developed is believed to be a reasonable tool for forecasting future surplus sales pricing, Western acknowledges that some merit exists in comments that suggest a closer link to recent historic trends is reasonable. Western will continue to refine the methods for forecasting future market conditions, both purchases and surplus sales, and will continue to give greater weight to recent historic pricing trends in future pricing projections.
