FR940208-2-00143 FR940208-2-00092 Rule 38 Rule 38, which provides for the applicable periods in joint panel reviews, has been amended to account for the removal of rule 36, to clarify the event triggering the time period fixed for joint panel review pursuant to rule 37 and to provide, on motion, for the possibility of alternative time periods for final antidumping or countervailing duty determinations subject to joint panel review. Subrule 38(1) provides that in a joint panel review pursuant to rule 37, the time period fixed for review of the final negative injury determination applies to both panel reviews. This subrule has been amended to specify that the time period fixed for a joint panel review commences with the date fixed for filing briefs under rule 60. Subrule 38(2) now incorporates the substance of former subrule 38(3) and provides that in a joint panel review, the decision on the final negative injury determination will be issued first, unless the panel orders a different timetable. Subrule 38(2) also provides that where there is a Determination on Remand and where that Determination on Remand is affirmative, the panel will then issue its decision on the final antidumping or countervailing duty determination. Subrule 38(3) has been added to allow participants to bring a motion requesting that alternate time periods be fixed for review of the final antidumping or countervailing duty determination. Subrule 38(4) has been added to specify the time period fixed for filing such a motion. Subrule 38(5) has been added to provide that where a panel has not issued a ruling on such a motion within 30 days or has not otherwise ordered, the motion is deemed denied and the timing set out in subrules 38(1) and (2) applies. Rule 39 Subrule 39(1) has been amended to require that, in addition to filing the Complaint with the responsible Secretary, the complainant is now required serve the Complaint on the investigating authority and on all persons listed on the service list. Subrule (4) has been amended to indicate that the time period for filing an amended Complaint is mandatory. The substance of subrule (5) has been split into subrules (5) and (6) for greater clarity. Subrule (5) addresses the period within which an amended Complaint may be filed out of time. Subrule (6) sets out the procedure for seeking leave to file an amended Complaint. Rule 40 Subrule 40(1)(c) has been amended to clarify the reasons for which a Notice of Appearance may be filed. Subrule (2) has been amended to reflect the amendments made consequentially to subrule (1)(c). Rule 41 Rule 41 has been amended to streamline the procedures for filing and service of the record for review. Subrule (1) has been amended to remove the requirement that a Designation of Record be filed and to extend the time period for filing an Index to 15 days after the deadline for filing Notices of Appearance. Consequently, the investigating authority is now required to file the following documents with the responsible Secretariat within 15 days after the expiration of the time period fixed for filing a Notice of Appearance: nine copies of the final determination, two copies of an Index, and two copies of the administrative record. As well, the investigating authority is now required to serve a copy of the Index on all participants. New subrule (4) addresses the filing of privileged information and has been amended to provide that the investigating authority may waive its privilege and voluntarily file privileged information in a panel review. Rule 43 Rule 43 has been amended consequentially to the amendments to rule 41. Rule 43, which addressed the filing of a portion of the administrative record, has been removed because rule 41 now requires that two complete copies of the record are to be filed with the responsible Secretary. Rule 45 Rule 45 has been amended to clarify that assistants to panelists are covered by the Code of Conduct and to specify that a participant is required to notify the responsible Secretary, not the Parties, of an alleged violation of the Code of Conduct by a panelist or an assistant. The responsible Secretary is now required to notify the other Secretary and the Parties of the allegations. This reflects procedures developed by the governments for appropriate handling of such allegations. Rule 48 Subrule 48(b) has been amended to limit filings of Disclosure Undertakings and Protective Order Applications with the Secretary to one original and any additional copies that the investigating authority requires. Because the definitions of Disclosure Undertaking and Protective Order Application have been revised to indicate that the forms are available from the investigating authority, there is no longer a need for Schedules A or B. Rule 51 Subrule 51(2) has been amended to clarify that the panel may consider not only whether the terms of a Disclosure Order or Protective Order should be modified, but also whether they should be amended. Subrule 51(3) has been amended to clarify the powers of a panel where a final determination is made in the United States and the competent investigating authority fails to comply with a panel notification to issue or modify a Disclosure Order or Protective Order. If the panel disagrees with the investigating authority's handling of a Disclosure Undertaking or Protective Order Application, the only sanction it can take is against the investigating authority. The sanction cannot be detrimental to the interests of the other participants in the panel review.
