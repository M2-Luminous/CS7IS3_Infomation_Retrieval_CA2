By expanding its air space and planning to acquire the long-awaited status of a joint enterprise, TV-6, together with the Turner International company, wants to make itself known on the whole territory of Russia and in neighboring countries. A discussion will be held today at the board of the Council of Mayors of the Cities of Northwestern Russia on the idea of establishing a regional television studio on the basis of a TV-6 affiliate in Novgorod. The condition of distressful expectation for TV-6 has been going on for more than a year now. However, in the words of Aleksandr Ponomarev, the general director of Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corporation (MNVK), the prolonged process of registering the Telecompany TV-6 joint enterprise can be concluded this very month. According to the contract, MNVK and Ted Turner Corporation (equal partners underscored by equal shares) are the founding parties. The Americans retain management, since they obviously have had more success in the business sphere than the Russian businessmen. However, the Russian side will establish program policy in that it is more familiar with the predilections of the viewing audience. Advertising policy remains as before; therefore, it is unlikely that large commercial breaks will disappear from the air. But there is also pleasant news--Eduard Sagalayev will head the board of directors, and he will have the last word in all debatable situations. Stuart Loory, now a CNN vice president, will hold the post of general director. Mr. Ponomarev expressed the Russian position: "We are creating a Russian telecompany with the participation of Americans." For a long time, TV-6's problem was the imperfection of its technical equipment, as a result of which the reception of programs on the channel was poor, even in Moscow. This question finally will be resolved in the near future, inasmuch as, starting on 1 April, TV-6 will lease a communications satellite that will cover the entire territory of the former Soviet Union ((FSU)). After being transformed in this way from a local channel to an international one, TV-6 will spread out its television network from Vilnius to Almaty (and by the end of the year, to Vladivostok as well). For this, MNVK is concluding a contract with regional nonstate companies concerning the organization of ground-based receiving stations. (Already now a three-hour bloc of the television channel is being received in 20 cities, and the satellite will help increase the number of broadcasting hours up to 10.) A new transmitter of the platinum series by the famous American company Harris Allied, which will begin to operate on the Ostankino tower starting on 20 April, will finally improve the reception of programs in Moscow and nearby rayons. The work is not limited to technical improvements. The managers of TV-6 also promised that by this autumn viewers will see several new Russian production programs on the air. Changes are also expected in the showing of movies--not only American films, but also European films should appear on TV-6. But the best feature, documentary, and television films produced by the leading American film companies will be shown on the screens of Russian movie theaters a day before they are shown on TV-6. At a news conference in the Cinema Center, representatives of TV-6 Moscow told critics and journalists about the first such project--the film series "History Through Hollywood's Eyes." In the words of Michael Pippi, a member of the board of directors of Turner International, famous American films were used in the project that portray difficult times and major battles--"Watch on the Rhine," "Mutiny on the Bounty" (with young Marlon Brando), "Doctor Zhivago," and "Ben Hur." The film series will be opened by the Moscow premiers of the four-hour film "Gettysburg," adapted from the book of Pulitzer Prize laureate Michael Shaar "Angels of Death." The premiers will be held in the Motion Picture Center (30 April) and in the Amerikom Theater (1 May). Ted Turner himself played in the picture about the war between the North and the South: He heroically perished on the screen for three minutes, and he did this, in his own words, absolutely free of charge. Fears were expressed at the news conference regarding the rental fate "of the picture that is splendid both in content and in performance," but "which will hardly do well in a videofilm market that is filled with fair films." Mr. Pippi noted that the American side sees this danger. However, Turner International Corporation is not betting on commercial success in Russia, but on the opportunity to "tell the Russians as much as possible about the history of America and Americans."
