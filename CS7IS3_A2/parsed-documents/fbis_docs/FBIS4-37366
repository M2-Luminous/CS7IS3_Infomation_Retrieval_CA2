This is the reason 'Arafat is delaying his arrival in Jericho, as prior to the Saudis' issuing their warning, 'Arafat had stated on several occasions that after visiting Jericho, he would undertake a prayer pilgrimage to the Muslim holy sites on the Temple Mount. This declaration alarmed the Saudi authorities, who feared that 'Arafat would try to create "facts on the ground," and consequently they decided to put him in his place. [passage omitted]
