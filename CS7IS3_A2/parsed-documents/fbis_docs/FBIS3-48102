In the New Year address, he designated this year as the year of revolutionary turn when socialist construction in our country will enter a new development stage, and as the year of rewarding struggle for the entire party, the whole country and all people to effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts by fully mobilizing themselves. Seeing the spirit of struggle of party members and working people, who have risen in the rewarding struggle to effect a new, great upsurge, we again realize that the great Chollima upsurge, which the great leader personally initiated, has been led to a constant upsurge thanks to the energetic leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We recall these proud annals of our revolution with emotion. Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our party and people, has indicated: We should effect a great upsurge and a great leap in socialist construction by upholding the revolutionary banner of the chuche idea--the red banner of revolution. Thus, we should resolutely break the spearhead of the enemy's attack which is directed at us and should fully demonstrate the true nature of chuche Korea and the might of socialism. When we look back upon the history of great upsurges in socialist construction, we come to recall, first of all, the great Chollima upsurge. Initiated under the wise leadership of the great leader, the consistently carried out great Chollima march brought about great reform, in cataclysmic change, by compressing time, and opened a great era of prosperity and development. The dear comrade leader said during his visit to the land of Kangson during the initial stages of the great Chollima upsurge, that he was greatly encouraged by all that he had heard about the resolution of the working class, and that he firmly believes that the working class in Kangson will repay the great leader's lofty trust and expectations without fail. While assisting the leadership of the great leader who constantly gave on-the-spot guidance, the dear comrade leader was keenly aware of the loyalty of the working class to the party throughout the country and of the boundless creative power of the popular masses. Thus, he consolidated the will to constantly succeed with the history of great upsurge on this land. The will cherished by the dear comrade leader when the tradition of great revolutionary upsurge was provided in our country has been embodied as refined leadership from the late 1960's to the present. As a result, great upsurges were constantly created in the history of socialist construction in our country. To cope with the extremely strained situation in the later part of the 1960's, the great leader put forward the line of simultaneously advancing economic construction and national defense construction. During that time, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong- il wisely led the struggle to effect a new great revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction. While meeting with functionaries of science and education department of the party Central Committee in June 1967, the dear comrade leader gave scientific answers to theoretical and practical problems raised in socialist economic construction in a statement on correctly comprehending political and moral stimulation [chaguk] and material stimulation. The dear comrade leader gave the scientific explanation that in a socialist society, priority should be given to political and moral stimulation, that this stimulation should be supported by material stimulation, and that in socialist society, importance should be attached to speed above all else, so that speed is regarded as the basic factor. As a result, an ideological and theoretical guideline enabling us to effect a new great revolutionary upsurge in all domains of economic construction and national defense construction was provided. In July 1967, the dear comrade leader expounded upon the direction of ideological work to inspire all people to the great upsurge. He emphasized that all functionaries and workers should highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle, vigorously wage the technological revolution by producing to the maximum and saving to the maximum, and more actively carry out the Chollima workteam movement. In July 1967, while giving guidance to the work of Kangson steel plant, dear comrade leader became aware of the lofty revolutionary zeal of the working class. As soon as he returned to the party Central Committee that day, he prepared militant slogans, including "Let us effect a great revolutionary upsurge once again by continuously accelerating the great Chollima march," and encouraged functionaries of the party Central Committee to go down to the lower echelons to carry out political work with these slogans. Visiting the working class in Yongsong in August 1967, dear comrade leader concretely explained the essence and significance of the party's new policy for effecting a great revolutionary upsurge. He encouraged and inspired the working class in Yongsong to advance at the van of the great revolutionary upsurge by proudly cherishing deep trust by the great leader. Thanks to the wise leadership of dear comrade leader, the flames of the great revolutionary upsurge, which were set ablaze by the great leader among the working class in Yongsong, became more fiercely aflame across the country, and a new great upsurge was effected on all fronts of economic construction and national defense construction. Our revolution, facing a new period in the 1970's, was raised onto a high stage when the slogan on remodeling the entire society on the chuche idea was put forward and implemented and socialist construction was developed into a great majestic battle. This reality urgently raised the demand not only for firmly maintaining the already accomplished revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction, but also for enhancing it to an even higher stage. With uncommon wisdom and scientific insight, dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il keenly realized the matured demand of revolutionary development and revolutionary aspirations of the popular masses. By putting forward a unique and outstanding idea on the speed battle, he vigorously inspired the entire party, the whole country, and all the people to the march of the speed battle -- a new general march for victory in the great socialist construction battle. The speed battle is a basic combat formula to push ahead with all works in a lightning manner and is a revolutionary principle for implementation of work. The basic demand of the speed battle is to push for work with maximum speed by mobilizing all forces and to ensure the high-quality of the work. The basic method for vigorously carrying out the speed battle is to push ahead vigorously with the ideological and technological revolution and to support organizational guidance work. Let us all rise in the speed battle. Since ideas and theories pertaining to the speed battle and the party's slogans containing such ideas and theories were put forward, the history of the great upsurge in socialist construction in our country, which proudly decorated the fifties and the sixties with the great Chollima march, became more brilliant in the seventies with the majestic march of the speed battle. The march of the speed battle was a new march of our people who accelerated socialist construction by pushing ahead with all work in a lightning manner and with incomparable speed, which was more speedy than the hurricane-like speed of the era of great Chollima upsurge. This march was a great all-people march, which advanced with uncommon speed and with the spirit of adding the speed battle to Chollima. With the beginning of the majestic march of the speed battle, our socialist construction effected a new upsurge. The flames of the speed battle enabled us to create a new Chollima speed, such as the speed of 70-day battle, and to register a miracle of accomplishing the six-year national economic plan far ahead of schedule. The flames of the speed battle fiercely blazed in the eighties, and enabled us to build on this land everlasting monumental creations throughout the country, including a 10,000-ton press in Yongsong, a large-size oxygen separator in Nagwon, the Tower of Chuche Idea, the Gate of Triumph, the Great People's Study Hall, Changgwang Street, Samchong Square in Komdok, and Sohae Lockgate. The policy of the speed battle, whose might has already been displayed through practice, is demonstrating greater vitality every day. The bugle sound of the speed battle has become a powerful force of pushing for the struggle to achieve the party's revolutionary economic strategy. The great revolutionary upsurge, which our people should effect to achieve brilliantly the party's revolutionary economic strategy; and the great revolutionary upsurge, which our people should create anew with the might of the single-hearted unity and with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, is the optimistic and trustworthy revolutionary upsurge due to the iron-clad will and refined leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is a genius of revolution and construction. Just as our people effected the great Chollima upsurge by upholding the lofty intention and wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a new great revolutionary upsurge will be effected on this land without fail, because of the might of the people who are firmly united with the dear comrade leader. Thus, we will smash antisocialist maneuvers of the enemy and will demonstrate to the entire world once again the firmness and might of popular mass-centered socialism of our own style.
