Alvaro Ayala has the report. [Begin recording] [Ayala] The prosecutor general has officially announced the withdrawal of security that was provided by his personnel to the Escobar Henao family. He explained that the Army and police are the government agencies now responsible for this service. [De Greiff] I understand that the protection was withdrawn as of today. That protection had been reduced gradually, and, as of today, it has been withdrawn completely. [Ayala] Why did no one cooperate, and who should assume this responsibility? [De Greiff] That is what happens to Colombia. They want us to supply all of the corpses and make all of the efforts, while other countries do not help at all.
