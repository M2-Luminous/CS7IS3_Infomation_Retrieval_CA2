This Can be Discussed'"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Guiglia] How does it feel to be allied with the person who, in the north, has gone into alliance with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi? [Fini] The agreements on the antiprogressive front are on two levels: first on an electoral basis, like the one we have entered into just now with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, and then on the level of policy, like the one signed between Forza Italia and the Northern League. The National Alliance will be putting up its own candidates throughout the north because it does not share the League's social egotism and intends to offer an alternative to Italians who are against the left and who are tired of the fantasies of the center. [Guiglia] According to MSI's [Italian Social Movement] Tremaglia, Forza Italia cannot stand on an "anti-Italy" ticket. Is he right or wrong? [Fini] The big success which we and Berlusconi will achieve in the center-south will be the best guarantee of national unity and will make any separatist whims impossible. The agreement which Bossi has been forced to make with Forza Italia is a "defensive" pact. Without Berlusconi's aid, the League would have lost many of its votes. [Guiglia] Would it not have been better to convince Berlusconi to present himself in competition, rather than in alliance with the League? [Fini] The conditions were not right for this to happen. On the other hand, in the proportional vote in the north we will each be present in our own candidates: National Alliance, Forza Italia, and the League. We will then know who is growing and who is getting smaller. [Guiglia] And if by running in the north you contribute to a progressive victory, by withholding from Berlusconi and Bossi the votes which are decisive for success? [Fini] The Alliance is a national movement, not a southern league. Renouncing the possibility of winning in any part of Italy would be to betray ourselves. Moreover, Bossi is untrustworthy, in particular when it comes to solidarity. [Guiglia] Communists or federalists, who today are the main enemies of the right? [Fini] Enemy number one is the old power system, which is still in existence, in part masked by a progressive front, and in part by the centrist re-edition of Martinazzoli [Italian Popular Party, PPI], Segni [Pact for Italy], La Malfa [Italian Republican Party], and Amato [Pact for Italy]. A strong National Alliance presence in parliament will thwart the danger of terminating the silent and nonviolent revolution of recent months. [Guiglia] According to Foreign Minister Andreatta, Berlusconi risks a "Zhirinovskiy effect" by entering into alliance with Fini. When will you march on Istria and Dalmatia? [Fini] My judgment on Zhirinovskiy is worse than Andreatta's: a dangerous madman who is wandering around Europe demanding what cannot be demanded, including our Alto Adige region. The Alliance's position on the Italian character of places like Istria is one of principle and does not present any threat to the balance of foreign politics. We are calling for a review, by pacific means, of an unjust treaty, which has penalized all other borders and rights of the Italian community, which has been rooted in these areas for centuries. Do you want to make a comparison between the way German-language citizens live in Bolzano and Italian ones in Istria? No marches to Rome, not even small ones. This is how Andreatta can function in Piazza del Gesu [PPI headquarters]. When a foreign minister obeys party rather than national interests and dignity, he is not a good foreign minister. Berlusconi anyhow does not come into the picture here: With him we have an electoral agreement, not an agreement on policy. [Guiglia] With Forza Italia you have candidates and even symbols in common. Is it not a little hypocritical to talk only of an "electoral" entente? [Fini] I do not deny that we share certain commonalities. I am referring to the objective of discomforting the left, our objection to excess taxation, and the socialism which still pollutes public administration. With Forza Italia there is the issue of institutions which we could look into in greater depth: That is the idea of "macrocommunes" launched by Professor Antonio Martino. We also believe that excess centralism is not beaten with Bossi's federalism, but with "unitarian" decentralization. We need an intermediate body between local councils and parliament. Certainly not bankrupt and "party-ruled" regions. Could this be the "macrocommunes" which Forza Italia has defined? I believe that we can discuss this very seriously. [Guiglia] Segni is not excluding the possibility of an "institutional" government. And if the Alliance returned to the ghetto after 27 March? [Fini] It is the voters who have brought us out of isolation. It is true that there is the risk of a new clash with the progressives. We are already saying no. The League has committed itself to an equally clear no. And who can swear that it will not be Segni who moves toward the center-right after changing positions for the umpteenth time?
