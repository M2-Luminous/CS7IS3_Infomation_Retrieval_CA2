In the article the author wrote that the reality in which socialism has suffered a setback and capitalism revived in some countries in recent years gave the serious lesson that of paramount importance in smashing challenges of the imperialist allied forces and steadily advancing the cause of socialism is to correctly solve the question of succeeding to the revolutionary cause, the question of succeeding to leadership. Stating that he has read many famous works of Comrade Kim Chong- il including "The Historical Lesson in Building Socialism and the General Line of Our Party", "On the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building" and "Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable" and visited Korea on several occasions and made a deep analysis of the reality, he said he deeply realized in this course that the question of succeeding to leadership is not only the basic factor of the advance of the socialist cause in Korea but the main point decisive of the rise or fall of the international communist movement. The socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of chuche which was started and has been developed by Comrade Kim Il-song is being successfully carried forward by the heir to him, Comrade Kim Chong-il, to accomplishment, the author wrote, and went on: Characteristic of the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il for carrying forward the cause of socialism to accomplishment is that he is accelerating the cause of socialism at faster pace not only by defending and succeeding to the outstanding ideological and theoretical activities and immortal exploits of Comrade Kim Il-song but also by developing and enriching them in conformity with the requirements of the development of the times and with the aspirations of the people. In carrying forward the cause of socialism, the revolutionary cause of chuche, to accomplishment Comrade Kim Chong-il has effected new innovations in the revolution and construction as a whole, always set bold goals and attained them successfully. As a result, fundamental changes have taken place in all fields including the party and state affairs, economic and cultural construction and the building of revolutionary Armed Forces. The expansion in scope and development of the cause of socialism, the revolutionary cause of chuche pioneered by Comrade Kim Il-song in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, fully show the great personality of Comrade Kim Chong-il as an outstanding and tested leader. What I must stress in particular among the victories and successes made by Comrade Kim Chong-il in carrying forward and developing the cause of socialism is the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses. In Korea today the whole party, the entire Army and all the people are unfailingly loyal to their leader, devotedly upholding his cause and firmly united ideologically and purposefully and In- moral obligations. All the people regard Comrade Kim Chong-il, an illustrious leader, as their father and are united behind him in one mind. Herein lie the source of the invincibility and durability of the Korean-style socialism. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is shattering to pieces the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of the imperialists, defending the security of the country and the dignity of the nation and safeguarding and developing the socialist system with its invincible revolutionary Armed Forces and with the might of singlehearted unity. Conclusions drawn from the present realities of the DPRK, now a socialist bastion, and of the international communist movement which is undergoing ordeals in face of all challenges bespeak that the cause of socialism will be firmly defended and accomplished if leadership over the revolution and construction is carried forward by an outstanding leader, but, otherwise it will play into the hands of the renegades of socialism and end in failure. The DPRK where the question of succeeding to leadership has been solved successfully by Comrade Kim Chong-il, a genuine people's leader, serves as a model of world socialism, as a beacon of hope for the people who are fighting for socialism and communism. Political and public figures and progressive people of many countries in the world look up to and revere Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people, as the outstanding leader of the present times and are rising in the struggle to defend and develop the cause of socialism. Socialism, the ideal and aspiration of mankind, is sure to be crowned with victory.
