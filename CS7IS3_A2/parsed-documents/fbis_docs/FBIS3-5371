Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said if the UN decided to send peacekeeping troops to the West Bank, Malaysia would consider participating since it already had such commitments in other countries. Until now, the government has not received any official proposal from the UN and if there is any it will be channelled through the UN office, he told reporters in the northern Penang state Sunday. However, he said, the decision to send Malaysian soldiers to serve under the UN would be up to Defence Minister Najib Razak and the cabinet.
