FR941222-2-00074 FR941222-2-00063 [Docket No. AB&hyph;103 (Sub-No. 9X)] The Kansas City Southern Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Jasper County, MO and Cherokee County, KS The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_ Exempt Abandonments to abandon two rail branch lines as follows: (1) The Baxter Springs Branch from milepost 139.01 L at the connection with the KCS main line to the end of the line at milepost 148.51 L near Crestline, KS, a distance of 9.50 miles, in Jasper County, MO and Cherokee County, KS; and (2) the Waco Branch from milepost W 139.80 at the connection with the KCS main line to the end of the line at milepost W 142.9, in Waco, MO, a distance of 2.69 miles, in Jasper County, MO. KCS has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic has been rerouted; and (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance has been received, this exemption will be effective on January 21, 1995 (unless stayed pending reconsideration). Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 1 formal expressions of intent to file offers of financial assistance under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 2 and trail use/rail banking statements under 49 CFR 1152.29 must be filed by January 3, 1995. 3 Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by January 11, 1995, with: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. 1 The Commission will grant a stay if an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission in its independent investigation) cannot be made before the exemption's effective date. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any request for a stay should be filed as soon as possible so that the Commission may take appropriate action before the exemption's effective date. 2 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 3 The Commission will accept late-filed trail use requests so long as the abandonment has not been consummated and the abandoning railroad is willing to negotiate an agreement. A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Jay M. Nadlman, 114 West Eleventh Street, Kansas City, MO 64105. If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, use of the exemption is void ab initio . The Rails to Trails Conservancy (RTC) supports the abandonment and seeks issuance of a notice of interim trail use/rail banking (NITU) under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) covering the involved lines. RTC has submitted a statement of willingness to assume financial responsibility for the trail in compliance with 49 CFR 1152.29. KCS consents to this request and is willing to negotiate with RTC. While expressions of interest in interim trail use need not be filed until 10 days after the date the notice of exemption is published in the Federal Register [49 CFR 1152.29(b)(2)], the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) (Trails Act) are applicable, and all of the criteria for imposing trail use/rail banking have been met. Accordingly, based on KCS' willingness to enter into negotiations with RTC, a NITU will be issued. The parties may negotiate an agreement during the 180-day period prescribed below. If a mutually acceptable final agreement is reached, further Commission approval is not necessary. If no agreement is reached within 180 days, KCS may fully abandon the lines. See 49 CFR 1152.29(d)(1). Issuance of this NITU does not preclude other parties from filing interim trail use/rail banking requests. Nor does it preclude KCS from negotiating with other parties in addition to RTC during the NITU negotiating period. If additional trail use requests are filed, KCS is directed to respond to them. Use of the rights-of-way for trail purposes is subject to restoration for railroad purposes. The parties should note that operation of the trail use procedures could be delayed, or even foreclosed, by the financial assistance process under 49 U.S.C. 10905. As stated in Rail Abandonments_Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails, 2 I.C.C.2d 591 (1986) (Trails), offers of financial assistance (OFA) to acquire rail lines for continued rail service or to subsidize rail operations take priority over interim trail use conditions. 4 Accordingly, if a formal expression of intent to file an OFA is timely filed under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), the effective date of this notice will be postponed 10 days beyond the effective date indicated here. In addition, the effective date may be further postponed at later stages in the OFA process. See 49 CFR 1152.27(e)(2) and (f). Finally, if the line is sold under the OFA procedures, the notice for abandonment exemption will be dismissed and trail use precluded. Alternatively, if a sale under the OFA procedures does not occur, trail use may proceed. 4 The statement in Trails that section 10905 does not apply to abandonment or discontinuance exemptions has since been superseded by our adoption of rules allowing OFAs in these exemption proceedings. See 49 CFR 1152.27. KCS has filed an environmental report addressing the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by December 27, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser at (202) 927&hyph;6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public.
