Luis Tornes, who took part in the foiled Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, admitted that the use of arms against Cuba is useless and said that Washington must realize that Cuba is not a U.S. territory. Attorney Magda Montiel said the conference marks the beginning of a stage that shows Washington that there are Cubans willing to hold a dialogue, but it cannot be only one way. Patricia Gutierrez told the press that regardless of differences, it is clear that the welfare of the fatherland is the objective. Patricia is the daughter of Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, who was imprisoned for 22 years in Cuba for his counterrevolutionary activities. Gutierrez Menoyo later went to the United States. Manolo Hidalgo, the 24-year-old son of Cuban emigres who left the country in 1961, said that many Cuban-Americans his age would like to help solve the Cuban crisis, regardless of any intimidation intended to stop them.
