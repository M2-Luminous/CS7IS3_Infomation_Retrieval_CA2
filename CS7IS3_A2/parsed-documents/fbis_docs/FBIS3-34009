The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said in a statement sent to AFP that it would have to retaliate against the "massacre" of seven of its members late Tuesday by police in Cairo. The statement rejected the official version that the militants died in a shoot-out, saying that they had been "killed in cold blood." The group has targeted tourists in its campaign against President Husni Mubarak's secular government which has left almost 200 people dead in the past two years.
