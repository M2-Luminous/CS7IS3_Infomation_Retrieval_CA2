The "Committee To Study LPG Handling Procedures," a private advisory organ of the Environmental Protection and Industrial Location Bureau, will be established soon and will be charged with the mission of formulating detailed deregulating plans by this fall. If all goes well, the "Law Regulating the Maintenance and Marketing of LPG" will be revised in fiscal year 1995. The study committee will revise standards for establishing LPG replenishment stations that will become wholesalers of LPG and retail outlets and will provide for tanks which are larger than those allowed in the past. It will also study relaxation of the approval standards for domestic gas appliances. In its International Economic Reform Outline completed at the end of March, the government announced that it would partially relax the maintenance regulations concerning dispensing equipment used by LPG sales firms. The government has decided to expand the scope of deregulation in that the number of LPG-related accidents has trended downward to 115 cases per year in the past three years. As many as 35,000 retail outlets handle sales to households and they consist primarily of small and midsized firms, reflecting slow progress in the consolidation of sales and distribution outlets. Thus, it appears the study will be designed to relax pertinent regulations, promote lower prices, and encourage the reorganization of the LPG industry. Domestic LPG demand for fiscal year 1995 will be about 19.42 million tons, about 5 percent of primary energy consumption. The view is expanding that LPG companies and city gas companies will be engaging in a fierce price war because the Gas Business Law revision pending in the Diet will relax regulations which control entry into large-scale gas businesses.
