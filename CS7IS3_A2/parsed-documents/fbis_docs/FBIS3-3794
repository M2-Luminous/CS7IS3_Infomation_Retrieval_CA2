Lu Ping of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office made the remarks to Hong Kong deputies at the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He set out a rough schedule for the early months of the first Special Administrative Region government and legislature. There would be no "through-train" arrangement for legislators elected in 1995 to stay on, and the first SAR legislature would be set up at the end of 1997 as preparation for the elections and polling would take about six months. Members of Legco and district organisations elected in 1994/95 would probably be excluded by China's version of the Election Committee to return 10 legislators. Their places would be taken up by the delegates to the NPC and CPPCC. The single-seat, single-vote election method was not preferred, as it was a "backward step" in democracy. The Preliminary Working Committee would have no say in the selection of candidates for the first chief executive, as the group was only helping with preparations. Neither the NPC Standing Committee nor the chief executive would impose legislation on the SAR. The Chinese proposal on the composition of the Election Committee was in stark contrast to Britain's position during the failed Sino-British talks and the electoral bill being considered by the Legislative Council. Britain had asked that NPC and CPPCC delegates who were not elected by the people of Hong Kong, be excluded from the committee. The electoral bill tabled earlier this month proposed an Election Committee consisting entirely of directly elected members of the district boards. China has yet to fix the size of the committee, but its proposal would mean that the pro-China figures would have at least a quarter of the votes in the committee, which is to return 10 legislators in 1997. Beijing has proposed that the committee be modelled along the lines of the 800 strong committee stipulated in Annex I of the Basic Law for the selection of the first chief executive. Thus, the committee would consist of an equal number of members from the industrial, commercial and financial sectors; professionals, labour, social services, religious and other sectors, as well as the members of the Legislative Council, representatives from the district-based organisations and deputies to the NPC and CPPCC. Due to the collapse of the talks, the last sector would called "former politicians", including mainly local delegates to the NPC and CPPCC, Mr Lu said. Mr Lu said the single-seat, single-vote election method would reduce the size of the constituency as the SAR legislature heads for more directly elected seats. "This is not (a method) to promote democracy, it is a backward step," he said. "Imagine when such a small area as Hong Kong is divided into 60 geographical constituencies, the size (of the constituency) will get smaller and smaller while the number of voters will become fewer and fewer." Hong Kong people had proposed the "double-seat, single-vote" method, and proportional representation, both of which would be considered carefully, he said. Mr Lu made no specific reference to the Government's fourth financing plan for the new airport, but cited three sets of funding proposals which contained billions in debt. "They must be kidding. They just cannot act like a child. It doesn't make sense," he said. "We are not barring any discussion on the level of debts (that exceeds the five billion ceiling). But that cannot be too large. We thought that every thing would be fine after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). You [the British side] can go ahead if you can stick to the agreement. But later they told us the financing package has greatly exceeded the provisions in the MOU. At first it was HK$70 billion. Are they kidding? You (the British side) are not a child. How can we accept it? How can you raise loans from banks if the future government has no liability for the debts. Will you give them loans, Huang?" Mr Lu jokingly asked Huang Diyan, head of the Bank of China in Hong Kong. "That's creating trouble again." Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang yesterday dropped a strong hint that Britain was ready to make further concessions on the airport financing package. Although Britain had already addressed all the Chinese concerns with the latest financing proposal, Mrs Chan said, they were still happy to address new Chinese concerns to pave the way for an early meeting to strike a deal. "And it seems sensible to me that the sooner we can sit down to talk about this and try to address them (their concerns), the better it is for everyone. We do need to move ahead quickly on this airport," she said. "I am not quite sure what Mr Lu means when he refers to a gap," she said.
