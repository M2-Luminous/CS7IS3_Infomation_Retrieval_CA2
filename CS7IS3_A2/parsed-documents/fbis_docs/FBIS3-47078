Hiraiwa said at a press conference the yen's further drop will help stimulate Japan's economy, pointing out that the United States has hoped that Japan's economic recovery would also benefit the U.S. economy. His remark was made following a comment by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen last week warning Tokyo against relying on a weaker yen. "Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of recession for Japan," Bentsen said. The dollar closed in Tokyo on Monday at 111.73 yen, down 0.75 yen from last Friday.
