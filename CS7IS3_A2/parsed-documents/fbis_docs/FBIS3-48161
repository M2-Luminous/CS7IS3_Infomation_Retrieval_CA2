Efforts must be made to strengthen and improve state-run business establishments to help them effectively carry out their activities so as to take an active role in the economy. This is a very important and urgent task because it will help to encourage and support other economic sectors in their development while accelerating rapid and long-lasting economic growth. It is an apparatus with material strength that will help the state to regulate and lead the market economy to develop further in accordance with the socialist orientations. It is necessary for us to be able to distinguish the nature of state ownership from that of state-run business. We must realize that assets and capital belonging to the state are used in various forms to ensure strong socioeconomic results and to enhance the state capability in accelerating and controlling economic activities. Investment in state-run business should include enterprises set up with a 100-percent state capital and those with the majority shares held by the state so as to allow the state to effectively control these establishments. Efforts must be made to allocate land and forest areas to the people on a long-term basis, to give leases or provide concessions for exploiting mineral mines, to enter into joint business ventures, and to buy shares from enterprises of other sectors. We must integrate efforts to strengthen state-run business in various sectors, areas, and socioeconomic infrastructure projects; in the financial, banking, and insurance establishments; and in a number of key production and service units so as to help the national economy develop strongly. It is necessary to encourage other economic components to participate in these tasks in different forms and degrees. In carrying out these tasks, we can reduce the number of inessential state-run business establishments while consolidating, expanding, and building new essential state-run enterprises. We must strive to strengthen and develop state-run business in agriculture, forestry, and fishery in the direction of joining and cooperating with other business branches to build industrial and service centers -- especially for the processing industry -- scientific-technological centers, and cultural and social centers in localities throughout the country. We must strive to strengthen and improve the state-run trade system, to firmly control the export-import business and trading of essential materials, to regulate the wholesale and retail trades, and together with other sectors to stabilize and develop the local markets. Efforts must be made to ensure a smooth transportation of goods, to serve and accelerate production development, to protect the interest of producers and consumers, and to make fundamental changes in the organization and management mechanism of state-run business in order to ensure the autonomous operation of business establishments in the market economic system while ensuring effective control by the state. The fundamental factors leading to ineffective operations, negative practices, and waste at many state-run business establishments are due to the fact that we do not have certain people who act as direct owners of state assets and who take responsibility for and protect the interests of state properties. We have no attractive and firm motives to encourage personnel and workers at various state-run enterprises to devote their energies to the development of their establishments. We still lack the material and organizational strength to decisively define various working methods of curbing corruption and acts which cause losses to public properties. We must find ways of overcoming these shortcomings. To attract more capital, create a driving force to curb negativism, and accelerate the profitability of state-run business, we must introduce various forms of shareholding enterprises in line with our production and business system, and with the majority shares held by the state. We must step by step apply the method of selling shares to personnel and workers who work at enterprises. Efforts must be made to distribute profits to personnel and workers, based on their base salary and the numbers of their shares. We should conduct a pilot project to sell a number of shares of state-run business establishments to private organizations and individuals. On the introduction of a share holding enterprise system, we will stipulate the organization of management boards comprising representatives of state shareholders, workers shareholders, and other shareholders. Regulations and selection criteria to help management boards select managing directors should be set up. Work contracts in various forms with workers should be applied in a widespread manner and be perfected continuously within state enterprises. The state will support and encourage the implementation, in accordance with the development needs of the economy, and renovation of enterprise unions and general corporations into the organization of business conglomerates, thus avoiding intermediary administrative authorities. The system of managing ministries, managing administration authorities, and the distinction between centrally-managed enterprises and locally- managed enterprises will be gradually discarded. State authorities at all levels and sectors should take care of and assist state enterprises in their businesses, especially in matters relating to capital, technology, marketing, and cadre training and deployment. For enterprises which serve socioeconomic public benefits which suffer low income or loss, the state will have a reasonable relief policy which discourages reliability. The state will have clear regulations on the state's inspection authority and stop the inspection and control work in an ad hoc style which is inconvenient to the businesses. For state enterprises doing business in non-essential areas who suffer extended losses and lack the capacity to overcome these losses, the resolute measures pointed out at the second plenum of the seventh Central Committee should be applied. We will continue to renovate the economic establishment of cooperatives and develop the independent role of cooperative members. The state supports, assists, and guides the development of all cooperative economic establishments in various economic sectors on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis. Management of the cooperatives should be democratic and encourage combining the strength of the cooperative with the strength of each household member. The renovation of cooperatives and other cooperative economic establishments should be carried out in all sectors of agriculture, forestry, and fishery in accordance with the resolutions of the seventh Central Committee's fifth plenum. Strict measures will be applied in handling the sluggish cooperatives and experimental renovation in all forms of cooperative economic establishments in handicrafts, financial credit, trading, and service and should be continued. Cooperatives can function on a larger scale, performing various branches of business and are not restricted within any administrative boundaries. Besides the capital contributed by members and the assets of the cooperatives, capital and labor from outsiders should be motivated. Members of cooperatives receive incomes which are subjected to contributed labor and shares. Cooperatives can exercise any of the various levels of collectivity of production supplies in accordance with business necessity, aspirations, and benefit of the members. The individual and small business economic sector, which comprises mostly family business establishments, is speedily growing and possesses tremendous potential to become an important element of the economy. We must have a policy to help this sector in terms of capital, technology, market information, and so forth in order to help their businesses become effective, thus creating more employment and more opportunities for individuals to contribute to the national construction. We must also guide and encourage individual business establishments to gradually join cooperative economic establishments on a voluntary basis. The private capital economic sector, both overseas and domestic, is growing fast and contributing positively to the national construction. The state continues to encourage private capital economic activities in sectors and areas allowed by law. The state also protects legal rights and benefits of private businessmen, joins development and investment funds with these businessmen on the basis of consensus, and encourages them to sell prioritized shares to their workers. The state helps and guides them to overcome difficulties and do business in accordance with state laws and regulations. Concrete regulations will be promulgated to stipulate the state management role towards business establishments with capital invested directly by outsiders. In combination with inspection and control functions of the state, we need to develop the grassroots organizations of the party, trade unions, and politico-social mass organizations within the private business enterprises and joint business enterprises either domestically or with overseas partners. These grassroots organizations will contribute to productivity, protect legal benefits of workers, and prevent illegal deeds. We should create conditions and a legal environment for lawful competition activities and for developing collective businesses on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, regardless of the disparity between these businesses in a sector or locality. Using the major state enterprises as the bases, we will form business corporations with a significant ability to compete in the domestic as well as international markets.
