The author bases his article on a report by Deputy Jose Dirceu based on Congressional Investigating Committee, CPI, and Federal Police investigations of the Paulo Cesar, PC, Farias and budget corruption schemes. The author says the creation of "air taxi companies has become one of the most lucrative ways to launder money earned irregularly. Most large construction companies involved in the PC and budget scandals have planes registered as air taxis, which are used by legislators and public company executives in exchange for favors and in order to evade taxes." The author says most companies use the legal benefits of current legislation granting tax exemptions to air taxi companies and facilitating the remittal of dollars abroad through leasing operations. The author says: "Dozens of people open ghost companies abroad in the name of figureheads to purchase planes in the international market. Jose Dirceu says that once this is done the local company makes a contract with `the foreign company' for a rental operation (leasing) and starts legally remitting large sums of money abroad." The author says an additional advantage is that the law allows companies to deduct the amount paid for renting the planes from their tax reports. The author says: "Civil Aviation Department, DAC, rules that regulate the operation of these planes are not respected and transgressors go unpunished because of the lack of supervision. There is no control over the millions of dollars sent abroad through false plane leasing operations." The author says that "besides the famous cases of Brasil Jet and Mundial Aerotaxi owned by Paulo Cesar Farias," Deputy Jose Dirceu mentions the Taming company owned by Mendes Junior Construction Company, Aerotaxi Pampulha owned by Andrade Gutierrez Construction Company, Wanair owned by Cowan Company, the plane fleet owned by Tratex Construction Company, Crasa Taxi owned by CR Almeida Company, Morro Vermello owned by Camargo Correa Construction Company, Embrataxi owned by former Minas Gerais Governor Newton Cardoso, and the Plata company owned by economist Jose Carlos Alves doe Santos.
