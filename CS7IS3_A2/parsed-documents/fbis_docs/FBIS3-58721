The German Defense Ministry confirmed that a projectile hit the wing of a Luftwaffe Transall as it was approaching to land in the Bosnian capital. The aircraft then immediately regained altitude and returned to Falconara in Italy. The crew were unhurt. A ministry spokesman said the incident occurred at 1145. The Transall, with which the Luftwaffe is supporting UN aid flights between Falconara and Sarajevo, was been hit in the starboard wing near the engine. The five-man crew immediately turned around and landed safely back in Falconara shortly after 1300. [passage omitted] The spokesman added that the UN airdrop has not been officially suspended. There will be no German aid flights for the next two days, however. A decision will be made on further German participation as soon as a replacement aircraft arrive in Falconara. A German Transall first came under fire about a year ago, when a projectile tore off parts of a propeller and penetrated the fuselage. The aircraft's chief loader sustained serious shrapnel injuries.
