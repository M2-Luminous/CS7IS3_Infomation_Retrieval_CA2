How do you assess Arab reaction to this initiative? Note that the initiative was proposed during a visit of an Arab League delegation to Sanaa, so what was the Arab League's reaction to this initiative? [Muhammad] Arab and world media have reflected complete sympathy with the stand of our party and leadership toward this peaceful initiative, whether before or during the war. We are now defending our honor, property, homes, cities, and villages. We have not been on the offensive yet. We are against war. We support dialogue. We have exercised a policy of self-restraint, because over the past three years we had seen many practices, such as assassinations and liquidations of our party's leaders. All this did not make us lose patience or lose our mind. We have worked, and we are still calling for dialogue as the only language between the parties that have a different view of the complex Yemeni situation. [passage omitted] [Karkuti] To say that the current crisis, which is tearing Yemen apart, is the result of foreign intervention is extremely doubtful. However, the tragic developments of the crisis make us reconsider the validity of this view. What is your personal opinion? If there are foreign and behind-the-scene forces working to ignite the crisis, who are these forces and what do they want? [Muhammad] Yemen is not an isolated island. As you know, it is part of the Arabian Peninsula and the Arab world. What is happening now proceeds from two plans: a tribal plan, supported by an international fundamentalist movement, which is now trying to establish its state in Yemen; and another plan to establish an Arab Islamic state in this region that will have ideal and natural relations with Saudi Arabia, Oman, and the other Gulf states and the world. This plan will seek to develop Yemen according to the mentality of the late twentieth century and the beginning of the next century. There are people who waver between these two stands. This is why Yemen is today at a crossroads. Therefore, it is not strange that Sudan should be supporting this latter scheme. Also, the religious fundamentalist movement is involved in supporting this trend and in removing all obstacles that arose as a result of unity and democracy to pave the way for this plan. Alliances will therefore depend on who supports and who allows this plan and who supports the other plan. As for the statements and attempts to win the favor of this or that party, they are all propaganda as a result of the hot military and political battle. [Karkuti] Is it true that Iraq is playing a role in Yemen? [Muhammad] The supplies we saw in the battles were originally there in preparation for the recent Gulf war. We had expected this. This also was clear in the weapons the northern troops have. Iraqi delegations came before and during the war. This is also clear in the training and expertise. Consider also Iraq's attitude at the Arab League, which gives a true picture that Iraq, which should abandon this policy, is involved in supporting the military option in Yemen. It is enough to note the Iraqi Ba'th Party National Command statement that reflects its support for the military option that seeks war. [Karkuti] How true are the reports that there are Iraqis with the northern forces? [Muhammad] Yes, there are Iraqi experts with the Republican Guard. There are also Iraqi experts with the northern brigades. [passage omitted] [Karkuti] What about the victims of the war. Do you have any figures? [Muhammad] They are very huge and terrifying figures. They try to hide the figures from the public and the outside world. Entire brigades have been destroyed. Since they are attacking, then they must have sustained major losses, but they are hiding these facts. There are also huge losses among civilians, whether in al-Dali', Kirsh, Abyan, Mukayras, and also huge losses in Sanaa and 'Imran. There are social and economic damages known only to God alone. [passage omitted] [Karkuti] What is the military situation now on the battlefield? [Muhammad] The situation keeps changing. They are attacking in the Kirsh region and their attacks are being repulsed. There are also fierce battles in al-Dali'. They started another battle in Bayhan in Shabwah. This is in addition to the battles in Abyan. [passage omitted]
