TACIS is by far the largest donor in the world working with the new independent states to improve nuclear safety. TACIS has recently launched a number of new projects in nuclear safety within the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Some of these projects build on initial work carried out under earlier TACIS projects, and prepare the way for continued TACIS support. At the Kalinin NPP [nuclear power plant], for instance, TACIS experts have been working for some time with the operators of the plant to supervise the purchase of urgently needed safety-related equipment. The Kalinin NPP will receive laboratory analysis equipment within the coming weeks. A second phase of the programme has recently been launched to install and test the equipment and to train the relevant personnel in its operation. In addition, TACIS experts will remain on-site for the next 18 months to work with the plant operators on all aspects of operation and maintenance and prepare technical specifications for the purchase of additional safety equipment. Russian experts will also travel to the EU member states to study the operation of EU NPPs. At the Kola NPP, TACIS experts are working to prepare for the installation of the new digital system to control the reactor core. This system will significantly improve the safety level of the reactor. The work of the TACIS experts involves defining the current system, producing a detailed technical specification and financial proposal for upgrading the system and an implementation and testing schedule. Tube cleaning and debris filter equipment for the Balakovo NPP is being constructed, and will be sent to the plant in August 1994. The on-site component will be continued and widened with the inclusion of a ninth site, the Zaporozhe NPP in Ukraine. Projects will be carried out at the site, with equipment needs met for up to 40 percent of the budget. Urgently needed spare parts in large quantities are also being delivered to other Ukrainian NPPs (Rovno and South Ukraine). In another project, TACIS experts are making a detailed study of the degradation of the irradiated areas of reactor pressure vessels. This study will provide an important insight into the current state of irradiated vessels and the effectiveness of maintenance procedures adopted to date. Studies Some feasibility studies are already available, including those for a vver-230 simulator and for an early warning system (Ukraine and Belarus). The results of the latter are currently being applied in a pilot project. A team of training personnel at the main training centre in Russia is exchanging know-how with the beneficiary, and a number of studies carried out at various Russian NPPs cover subjects such as accident analysis, vessel embrittlement, and quality assurance. At the Chernobyl NPP in Ukraine, European Union experts have carried out fire protection training and a decontamination project for plant personnel. There is a separate decontamination project for the area 30 km around Chernobyl, plus a regional programme to provide social and economic assistance to those who have suffered from the fall-out in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. The EU's Ukraine nuclear safety programme has committed over 80 Mecu from 1992 to 1994 to Ukraine. Safety Authorities The enhancement of regulatory regimes responsible for the safety of national nuclear installations was identified as a priority under the TACIS nuclear safety programme. Assisstance efforts aim to support the development of independent, legally and technically competent regulatory authorities. After several exploratory missions, two large projects were launched in December 1993, for the benefit of Russian and Ukrainian regulators. EU safety authorities have established a detailed programme to assist in the development of a strong legal and technical basis for the national regulators and their support organisations. This includes the transfer of codes, guidelines, and licensing procedures. The EU is also procuring the infrastructure of the equipment, to be delivered in the coming months, to improve the infrastructure of the regulators, including the vital link between headquarters, regional offices, and inspection centres. At the Rovno NPP, Ukraine, a large-scale safety evaluation of vver-type reactors is currently nearing completion. Nuclear Safety Account The EU has committed 20 Mecu to the nuclear safety account fund, which will finance actions concentrating on urgent upgrading for the least safe reactors in the CIS (rbmk and vver-230). The decision has been taken so far to finance upgrading projects at NPPs in Bulgaria and Lithuania, and projects are being prepared to be carried out in Russia and Ukraine. International Science and Technology Centre (ISTC) The union has committed 20 Mecu to the ISTC, designed to develop and finance specific projects which aim to redirect the skills of NIS weapons specialists towards civilian sectors and therefore to reduce the risk of proliferation. The centre became operational in March 1994, and a large series of nuclear-related projects has been launched.
