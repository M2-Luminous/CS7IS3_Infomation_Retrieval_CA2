According to Lavrov, these problems, above all issues connected with the destiny of nuclear arms and the Black Sea Fleet, must not be dramatized. "We must not forget that a vast country with an enormous infrastructure disintegrated," he said. "As soon as the two major problems are resolved, onward movement will begin in all areas of relations between Russia and Ukraine." Preconditions for resolving these problems were ensured when the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk met in Massandra. According to Interfax's interviewee, there are not only "sore" but also "healthy spots" in the Russian-Ukrainian relationship. At their meeting in Odessa held at the end of last year Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his Ukrainian counterpart Anatoliy Zlenko agreed to cooperate in resolving problems connected with the further development of Eastern and Central Europe. "The Ukrainian side assured us that Kiev's initiatives on the ways to promote cooperation between local countries provide for Russia's participation, not exclusion," Lavrov said. According to him, Russia is interested in cooperating with Ukraine and other CIS countries in international organizations. At the latest UN General Assembly session the 12 CIS states advanced, for the first time ever, joint initiatives concerning the ways to combat drug trafficking, terrorism and environmental pollution. "It is noteworthy that the resolution on monitoring environmental protection from space submitted by the CIS countries was adopted by consensus," Lavrov said. Interfax's interviewee drew attention to the circumstance that participants at the Ashgabat summit held at the end of last year decided to jointly request the UN to grant the CIS the status of observer of the kind enjoyed by, say, the European Union or the Organization of African Unity. As Lavrov said, this decision was taken unanimously. Ukraine alone stood aside. "Ukraine abstained. Kiev voiced doubts as to the CIS being an "organization." But this is a purely terminological dispute," Lavrov noted. "There should be no fears that the CIS is turning into some "supranational mechanism." From the point of view of international law the term "organization" does not reflect "supranationalism."
