FR941011-1-00026 FR941011-1-00012 (i) Compensation to sole proprietors, partners or persons who are contractually entitled to acquire a partnership interest in a contractor enterprise, persons who own 10 percent or more of an incorporated contractor's stock, persons who are contractually entitled to acquire at least 10 percent of an incorporated contractor's stock, persons who are officers or directors of an incorporated contractor, or persons who otherwise have a substantial financial interest in the contractor's enterprise. To be allowable, compensation of each such person or member of their family must be reasonable for the personal services rendered. Such employees are assumed to have influence over their own compensation and the compensation of their family members. (A) The reasonableness of the compensation of each such employee or family member must be separately supported for the cost to be allowable. The determination of reasonableness for each such individual will be based on the application of the provisions of this cost principle to the individual with no offsets allowed from any other employee, job class of employees, or other jobs within a job grade. (B) If a contractor seeks to justify compensation for such individuals in excess of the average compensation paid by comparable firms (the reasonable compensation for the services rendered), it must be based upon superior performance demonstrated by quantifiable performance measurements which use comparisons with firms of similar size and industry, consistently applied from year to year. (C) Severance payments (see 31.205&hyph;6(g)) paid to such individuals or to members of their families are not allowable in excess of the payments otherwise allowable and paid in accordance with the provisions of the contractor's severance policy in effect for the majority of the contractor's employees for the three year period prior to the individual's dismissal. However, severance payments are not allowable if paid to sole proprietors, partners (or persons contractually entitled to acquire a partnership interest in the contractor), or persons who hold (or are contractually entitled to acquire) at least 10 percent of a corporate contractor's stock. (D) Early retirement incentive payments (see 31.205&hyph;6(j)(7)) paid to such individuals or to members of their families are not allowable unless the payments are otherwise allowable, paid in accordance with the provisions of a contractor early retirement incentive plan made available to all other employees with similar eligibility. If the total paid to all such individuals and members of their families exceeds 10 percent of the plan's cost, the excess over the 10 percent is not allowable cost. However, early retirement incentive payments are not allowable if paid to sold proprietors, partners (or persons contractually entitled to acquire a partnership interest in the contractor), or persons who hold (or are contractually entitled to acquire) at least 10 percent of a corporate contractor's stock. (E) Payment in lieu of salary for services rendered by partners and sole proprietors is allowable as compensation to the extent that it would otherwise be allowable and reasonable as compensation for the same personal services if those services had been rendered by an employee of the contractor. (ii) Substantially increased compensation resulting from a change in a contractor's compensation policy or system, particularly when it is concurrent with an increase in the ratio of Government contracts to other business, or any change in the treatment of allowability of specific types of compensation related to changes in Government policy. Contracting officers or their representatives should question such increased costs unless the contractor presents supporting data to show to the contracting officer's satisfaction that the changed compensation plan or system produces reasonable costs to the Government (see also 31.201&hyph;3 and 31.205&hyph;6(a)(4)). (iii) The contractor's business is such that its compensation levels are not subject to the restraints that normally occur in the conduct of competitive business.
