A high-ranking Russian diplomat made these comments in his interview with Interfax regarding the rumors about attacks against employees of the Russian Embassy in Pyongyang due to the recent arrest of three North-Korean diplomats in Moscow. According to the Federal Counterintelligence Service Director Sergey Stepashin, the diplomats were caught red-handed trying to buy advanced Russian technologies. Interfax interlocutor underlined that Moscow would demonstrate adequate reaction in case of "unfriendly actions" with respect to Russian diplomats in the DPRK. At the same time he believes that first of all it is necessary to investigate the incident with the employees of the Korean Embassy. "Given the fact that a tense situation has established on the Korean peninsular and Russia is participating in its settlement, nobody needs any espionage scandal," said the Russian diplomat.
