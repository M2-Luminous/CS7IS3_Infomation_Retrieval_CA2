Proponents of the plan to restructure the Police Commission said the rejection underlined the need to curb the power of active and retired police officers on the panel and bring the police force under the interior minister's control. "I have done my best. I tried to make members of the Police Commission understand. The Police Department has suffered enough. Everybody should be working together instead of causing more confusion," Gen Chawalit said after the commission meeting. Chawalit said the commission had ignored his plea for an open discussion and vote to decide the nomination for the top police job. The commission instead chose to vote by secret ballot. The interior minister acknowledged that the commission was legally empowered to reject the nomination, but said he believed the decision went against public opinion, which wanted a new police chief appointed as soon as possible. He would decide before the month is out whether to resubmit Prathin's name or to make a new nomination to the commission. Chawalit said he had told Prathin, currently acting police chief, to perform his duty to the best of his ability. The interior minister said he would definitely push for the restructuring of the Police Commission when the time was right. Current members would be consulted. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, speaking to reporters at Government House yesterday evening, described the commission decision as "unusual", but said he believed it would not in any way affect Prathin's authority as acting police chief. "The interior minister will do whatever he sees fit. He may want to resubmit the nomination when he chooses to," Chuan said. The prime minister also stressed the need to restructure the Police Commission to achieve a balance of power between the interior minister and the police governing body, but only after current problems at the Police Department had been resolved. Prathin told reporters after meeting Chawalit yesterday afternoon that he had anticipated the commission would reject his appointment. "The Police Commission decided not to approve my nomination. That's okay with me. I'm not disheartened. I had expected this," the acting police chief said. "I will carry on with my duty as long as I receive assignments from Gen Chawalit." He said the commission had not bothered to give any reasons why he should not be appointed director general. Later in the evening, after meeting the prime minister at Government House, Prathin said he may have to serve as acting police chief until his retirement in September this year. "I have the feeling that I may have to continue to serve as acting police chief," he said. "As an acting police chief I have the full authority of a police director general." [passage omitted]
