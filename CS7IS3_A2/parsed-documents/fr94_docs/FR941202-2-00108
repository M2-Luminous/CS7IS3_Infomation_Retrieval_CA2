FR941202-2-00108 FR941202-2-00070 11. Is There a Minimum Age for Applicants for Registration Under the DV&hyph;96 Program? There is NO minimum age for submission of an application for registration, but the requirement of a high school education or work experience for each principal applicant at the time of visa issuance will effectively disqualify most persons who are under age 18. 12. Will There be Any Special Fee for Registration in the DV&hyph;96 Category? There is NO FEE FOR SUBMITTING A REQUEST FOR REGISTRATION, and NO FEE should be included with the letter sent to the post office box indicated above. Furthermore, there is no special fee for applicants who come to be registered through the lottery. Registered applicants who pursue applications for immigrant visas will, however, be required to pay all normal immigrant visa fees. 13. Are There Any Countries That Were Eligible to Participate in the DV&hyph;1 Visa Lottery That Are not Eligible to Participate in the DV&hyph;96 Visa Lottery? Yes, Colombia has been added to the list of countries ineligible to participate in the DV&hyph;96 visa lottery. With the addition of Colombia there are now thirteen countries excluded from participation in the diversity visa lottery due to high admissions of immigrants in the preceding 5 years. 14. Are DV&hyph;96 Applicants Exempted From Any of the Grounds of Visa Ineligibility? No. Applicants are subject to all grounds of ineligibility specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act and there is no special provision for the waiver of any grounds of visa ineligibility other than those provided for in the Act. 15. May Applicants Who Are Already Registered for an Immigrant Visa in Another Category Apply in This Registration for the DV&hyph;96 Category? Yes, such persons may seek DV&hyph;96 status through this registration as well. 16. How Long do Applicants Who Are Registered on the Basis of This Application Period Remain Entitled to Apply for Visas in the DV&hyph;96 Category? Under the law, persons registered following this DV&hyph;96 application period are entitled to apply for visa issuance ONLY DURING Fiscal Year 1996 i.e., from October 1995 through September 1996. There is no carry-over of benefit into another year for persons who are registered but who do not obtain visas during FY&hyph;1996. There is absolutely no advantage to mailing early, or mailing from any particular locale. Every application received during the mail-in period will have an equal chance of being selected at random within its region. However more than one application from a person will disqualify the person from registration. Also, failure to include the applicant's native country and full name and address on the envelope will disqualify the application.
