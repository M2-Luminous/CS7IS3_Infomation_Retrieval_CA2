According to a Gallup poll for ABC, only 30 Spanish people out of 100 now approve of his political conduct, as against 35 in August 1993. The loss of popularity is confirmed by the increase in the number of Spanish people disapproving of his conduct, which rises from 37 percent last year to 45 percent. These figures put him at the lowest level of popularity since he took office. The figures obtained in the Gallup poll for this newspaper on people's assessment of the main political leaders show that only 30 out of every 100 Spanish people approve of Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez' political conduct. These figures confirm an appreciable decline in the head of government's popularity with respect to last August's figures, when approval stood at 35 percent, and disapproval was much less than at present, with 37 percent in 1993. This decline in popularity can be seen in the fact that 45 percent of Spanish people now disapprove of his conduct. On the other hand, these results are very similar to those obtained in December 1992, when Gonzalez' popularity stood at the lowest level since he had taken office. Critical assessments of Felipe Gonzalez' role are made with a significantly higher percentage by men and individuals under the age of 35, belonging to the upper middle class, with higher education, and living in large cities. Less Critical On the other hand, support for his conduct comes from the group of people characterized in the sample as older than 54, having incomplete primary education, and living in medium-sized cities. These interviewees place themselves as lower middle or lower class. As far as People's Party leader Jose Maria Aznar is concerned, the percentage of approval of his work in opposition is 25 percent, while the disapproval figure is 45 percent. When these figures concerning the political performance of the opposition's chief representative are compared with those of a year ago, a slight fall in the percentages is seen, with the number of those disapproving of his conduct being lower. The profiles of those supporting and criticizing Jose Maria Aznar's performance cannot be defined in terms of an absolutely clear tendency. At most, it can be said that the most critical assessment of his conduct comes from citizens placing themselves in the lower middle and lower class. As far as United Left Coordinator General Julio Anguita is concerned, it must be emphasized that, according to the Gallup figures, he is the politician with the least bad rating among those subjected to this assessment. Proof of this is the fact that the percentage of those assessing his conduct favorably is 33 percent, while this figure was just 30 percent only a year ago. These figures represent an appreciable improvement in the Spanish people's perception of the United Left leader. Moreover, those who now disapprove of his political conduct are 35 percent, as against the 40 percent who did so in 1993. For Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra, 21 percent is the figure of those approving of his political activity, while those disapproving of it total 40 percent. According to the poll figures, the trend in the Spanish people's political assessment of Serra in the course of the past year should be deemed slightly negative, since at the beginning of last year 25 percent of citizens approved of his performance and 41 percent disapproved of it. Negative Ratings The politician who receives the highest percentage of negative ratings of his conduct is Alfonso Guerra, with 53 percent of citizens as a whole. On the other hand, the favorable ratings stand at 17 percent. There is a marked rise in unpopularity for People's Party politician Rodrigo Rato. Today, 12 percent of the interviewees assess his conduct favorably, as against the 10 percent who did so at the beginning of 1993. Those who disapprove of it have risen from 18 percent a year ago to 32 percent at present. In addition, it is important to point out that these assessments are completely different from those made by the various parties' voters. Thus it must be emphasized that 88 percent of United Left voters approve of Julio Anguita's conduct. Among People's Party voters, approval of Jose Maria Aznar stands at 71 percent. But Felipe Gonzalez secures the approval of only 59 percent of those who voted for the Socialist Party in June 1993. In addition, the ranking order of the best known politicians is headed by Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Maria Aznar, who both have 95 percent. Immediately after them come Julio Anguita and Alfonso Guerra, with 94 percent, respectively. A little further behind in the classification come Narcis Serra with 89 percent, and Rodrigo Rato with 65 percent.
