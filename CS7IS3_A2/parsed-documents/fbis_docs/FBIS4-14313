The brother president expressed his sympathy and deep regret and sorrow over this incident, which was planned and carried out by irresponsible elements. These elements want to achieve their wicked objectives with the aim of pushing the sons of the one homeland toward conflict and fighting in order to destroy the homeland and return the Yemeni homeland to the situation that prevailed before 22 May 1990. These elements are doing so to satisfy their whims and narrow interests, pursuant to the objectives of forces hostile to the revolution and democracy. The brother president also expressed his heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and innocent victims of the regrettable incident, noting that all are the sons of the one Yemeni homeland, whose souls and chaste blood are dear to us. He stressed that the sons of the Armed Forces are comrades-in-arms and comrades-in-struggle who stand in one trench to defend the revolution, the republic, homeland, and unity. He said that they will never turn into tools or lackeys of those elements with egocentric inclinations and destructive desires who are forcing the sons of the Armed Forces to pay dearly from their souls and blood for the sake of their destructive inclinations. He noted that the sons of the Armed Forces and security forces are our sons and brothers and we are proud of their sacrifices for the sake of the homeland. He said: They are the sons of this great people; they are faithful to this people's struggle, principles, and sacrifices. They will never allow any tampering with the security, stability, and achievements of the homeland. The brother president said: The forces that are pushing toward war and fighting and toward igniting the military situation for selfish purposes and personal interests are, in fact, punishing the sons of our people and the members of the valiant Armed Forces by exposing them to death and pushing them toward danger for no reason except to satisfy the whims of these forces, which are being paid for all this. He said: As the people expect, the sons of the Armed Forces will be the vanguards of the ranks and will form the frontlines that will protect the homeland against all dangers and foil the sick dreams and desperate attempts to redivide the country and impose separation. He added: Any separatist act will be faced with decisiveness and with more coherence among Yemeni unionists. The brother president praised the high morale and readiness of the injured to sacrifice their souls in defense of unity. He noted that this criminal act, in which the sons of our Armed Forces were dragged into confrontation against each other, falls within the framework of the criminal series of acts that began on 20 February 1993, on the eve of the signing of the accord document in Amman, with the aim of bypassing it and obstructing the accord document's implementation in order to peddle the scheme of separation. He said that this series began with the aggravation of the situation against the al-'Amaliqah Brigade in the Ibyan Governorate and the incidents in Harth Sufyan, Shabwah and Dhamar, when the separatist forces intended to ignite the military situation and mobilize people with to create estrangement and conflicts among the sons of the Armed Forces and to push them toward fighting. The brother president warned these separatist elements, which planned these criminal acts, against continuing these acts and playing with fire. He called on these elements to turn to reason, wisdom, and peaceful dialogue to resolve all issues, as well as to respect the will of the people and their constitutional institutions. He expressed hope that the tragedy of the 'Imran garrison will be the last tragedy in this beloved homeland in this delicate phase of its history. He also called for a mobilization of all national efforts within the framework of a large-scale national agreement to implement the accord document without hesitation or procrastination to reinforce national unity and strengthen our democratic unifying march. The brother president urged the military committee to expeditiously present a detailed report on this regrettable incident, its circumstances, and those who stand behind it so that the people will be aware of all the facts. The brother president instructed officials in the Defense Ministry, the Armed Forces General Staff, and the military hospital to take good care of the wounded. He also instructed that the serious cases, which cannot be treated in hospitals inside the country, be transferred for treatment abroad. The president was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar, Planning and Development Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutwakkil, and Sanaa Mayor Husayn al-Miswari.
