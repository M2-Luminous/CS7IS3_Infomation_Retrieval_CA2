"The change in meeting schedule is not expected to delay Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)," Sheu noted. Taiwan applied to join the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body in 1990 as a separate custom territory. The GATT working party has already met four times to discuss Taiwan's membership bid. Sheu said as Taiwan has not yet completed bilateral trade consultations with many GATT contracting parties, the postponement of the working party's fifth meeting will not have an adverse impact on Taiwan's GATT admission. Taiwan is scheduled to hold bilateral tariff-reduction talks with six GATT contracting parties -- South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hungary, Chile and Turkey -- in Geneva starting March 21. Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign Trade will act as chief negotiator for the talks.
