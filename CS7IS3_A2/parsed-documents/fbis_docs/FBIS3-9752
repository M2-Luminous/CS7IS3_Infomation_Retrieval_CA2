The groupings, the "Centric Bloc" consists of "dissidents" from former Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and Slovak National Party (SNS): the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR), led by former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko, the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DUS) of current Premier Jozef Moravcik and Cernak's NDS-NA. The centrists, who have seven posts in Moravcik's eighteen-member cabinet, are holding a constituent congress on Saturday [26 March]. "The NDS-NA's place will be right of center of the political spectrum; it should head towards the European Democratic Union," said Cernak, former SNS chairman. The latest poll gives 1.3 percent for Cernak's party, while the AD SR would receive 1.2 percent of votes.
