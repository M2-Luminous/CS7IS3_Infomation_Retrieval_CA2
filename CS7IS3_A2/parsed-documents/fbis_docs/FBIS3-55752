"Clinton ought to think about the fact that Ukrainian nuclear missiles are a guarantor of peace worldwide, rather than just for Ukraine, as well as for Europe and America itself," said the SelDPU chairman. "If Zhirinovskiy does come to power, he will not be fastidious in either utterances or actions, which is why there must be a deterrent, which is what Ukraine's nuclear weapons are. After a considerable section of Russians have followed Zhirinovskiy, having opted for fascism, to make such statements as that by Clinton is quite outrageous," SelDPU Chairman Plachynda pointed out.
