In Tokyo for a two-day quarterly meeting, regional central bank leaders said recent stock market gains were just reviving the spirits of corporate managers when Tokyo shares took their worst dive in two and a half years. "I'm concerned about the impact on corporate sentiment, which had improved a bit recently as the yen stopped its appreciation and stock prices staged a rally in heavy volume," Osaka branch manager Tatsuya Tamura told a news conference. The benchmark Nikkei stock average plummeted about 950 points, or 5 percent, Monday to 18,353.24 in the wake of Friday's defeat of the political reform bills that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had staked his government on. Some areas, such as export-heavy central Japan that watch currency rates more than stock prices, are encouraged that the yen's declines from earlier peaks may improve profits, said Nagoya Branch Manager Eiichiro Kinoshita. But on the downside, he said, managers in his area have seen demand weaken relative to supply. Overall, economic recovery will likely take time, Central Bank Governor Yasushi Mieno said in opening the managers' meeting, but he gave no hint of changing his policy stance, repeating that he will watch the effects of past fiscal and monetary actions. The managers of 33 domestic branches, plus representative offices in New York, London and Hong Kong, opened their two-day meeting with reports that the economy remains mired in a slump with no signs of recovery visible. Their reports, written before the political turmoil was unleashed Friday, said further setbacks are unlikely, as the economy is supported by reviving personal spending in some areas and improving corporate posture. Osaka Branch Chief Tamura said his region's report may have to be revised, including its suggestion to monitor the effects of past monetary measures. Mieno, unavailable to spell out his views on the political turmoil, is to meet the press Wednesday to wrap up the meeting. The Osaka and Nagoya branch managers said in separate press conferences that corporate sentiment was brightening, with Kinoshita saying other managers expressed similar views. But both said the economic picture was a mix of bright and dark spots. "The chances of the economy falling through the bottom have lessened," Tamura said. "The corporate mind is recovering." Smaller companies are starting to "take a positive stance independently" instead of nervously waiting for an economic recovery predicted by the government, and companies are making "forward- looking" capital investment in such promising strategic businesses as multimedia, he said. Mieno noted the importance of business sentiment, citing a drag on recovery from caution among companies and financial institutions, stemming from their stubborn problems in clearing losses incurred during the asset deflation after the collapse of the speculative "bubble" of the late 1980s. Tamura stressed that "dark factors" have grown, expressing concern that companies are increasingly shifting production overseas, and saying more time is needed for companies to improve their balance sheets through restructuring. Business conditions remain tough for financial institutions as fund demand stays weak despite low interest rates. But although economists and business leaders have called for a cut in the Bank of Japan's already record low official discount rate of 1.75 percent a year, Kinoshita said fewer people in his area are now calling for a rate cut, perhaps reflecting the concerns of people on fixed incomes. Among the problems around Nagoya, "a setback in the supply-demand area stands out," as consumer and capital spending lag. But "the corporate mind is settling down" with a more bearable exchange rate, he said. A higher yen hurts Japanese exporters by making their products more expensive in foreign-currency terms. The yen, which soared last year to a postwar record 100.40 to the dollar in August, closed Friday at 112.10 to the dollar.
