Liu Baisong, president of the Northeast Asia Railway and Port Corporation, Ltd. of Jilin, China, came to the ROK on 20 January to discuss this matter. He said on 23 January: "The Najin Port development project is supposed to be jointly promoted by China and North Korea, and North Korea has expressed its position that it does not oppose ROK participation in the project in a joint venture with China." He also said that he had sounded out ROK enterprises like Daewoo and Samsung on their intention to participate in the project during his visit to the ROK and that they "had expressed their intent to actively participate." China is also asking ROK companies to make joint investments in the construction of a 5 km-long borderline railway connecting China's Hunchun and North Korea's Hunyung. The project of enlarging the No. 3 and No. 4 Piers of Najin Port and equipping them with modern facilities requires a total amount of $60 million, and China wants the ROK to invest approximately $30 million in the project. North Korea hopes to begin construction in April, and China plans to start in June after confirming ROK participation.
