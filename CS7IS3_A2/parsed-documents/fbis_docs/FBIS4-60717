It was conveyed by U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Lebanon Vincent Battle. It deals with the outcome of Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent talks in the Middle East on reactivating the Syrian-Israeli negotiation track. Buwayz said that "the Syrian-Israeli-U.S. talks are still remote from the possibility of quickly reaching points of agreement, even though they are serious and broaching fundamental issues." He expected "further rounds of talks to be held before a call for resuming the negotiations crystallizes." He described the "view that settling the Syrian file is bound to reflect positively on the Lebanese and Jordanian file as realistic." He stressed that contacts are continuing between Beirut and Damascus, "and we are closely following what is happening with regard to the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. And if necessary, direct meetings (between Lebanon and Syria) are not difficult to hold." [passage omitted]
