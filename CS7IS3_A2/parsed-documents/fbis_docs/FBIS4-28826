The advisory panel to the chief of the ministry's securities bureau discussed the draft report at a meeting Friday and asked for minor changes and the issuance of a final report as early as June 22, a ministry official said. The official, requesting anonymity, said the draft prepared by the ministry group aims at "investor protection and self-responsibility principles," and points out that the current law enacted in 1951 has failed to "sufficiently" meet changes in market environment. Disclosure covers details of investment and portfolio strategies and periodic reports on performance to meet complaints that the current system is "insufficient" for investor understanding, the official said. As for investment performance, the report calls for a "benchmark" to facilitate investor understanding and to spur competition among trust firms that manage funds and among securities firms that sell such funds to investors. The report also seeks a review of the current law and adoption of "fair-trading" rules to revive the functions of investment trusts that are not at present working, to maintain stability and to vitalize market activities. The group has been discussing the reform of Japan's investment trust business since last November amid waning investor interest in trusts after the collapse of the "bubble" speculation boom in the late 1980s. With stock prices tumbling, investors faced the prospect of their stock investment funds falling below their initial values and various problems surfaced such as complaints that brokerage houses had failed to make clear to investors that they could also lose money. The official said the report makes it clear that the panel remains mixed on many other issues, including the adoption of U.S.- style mutual funds.
