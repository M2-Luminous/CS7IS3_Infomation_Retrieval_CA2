"I'm very pleased to return to my home country, which I've long dreamed of," he said upon descending down from a Korean Air plane. Kim went to Brazil via India in 1954 and was imprisoned in 1963 for stabbing a Japanese-Brazilian to death in a quarrel with fellow Japanese-Brazilians over their contempt for him as a Korean. A Korean church in Sao Paulo helped him get out of prison in 1975, but he killed a Chinese-Brazilian in 1979 and was then placed in a mental hospital. Aided by a campaign for his release by the Korean community in Brazil, he was freed on Feb. 4. His return to Seoul was arranged by Father Kim Tong-ok of the Korean Catholic Church and the Korean Consulate-General in Sao Paulo. Kim was the second of the 55 North Korean POWs living in Brazil to come to Seoul, following Yim In-ho's return last year. He will spend the rest of his life in a Catholic nursing home in Eumsong, North Chungchong Province. Born in Kosong, Kangwon Province, in 1933 and forced to join the North Korean Army while attending high school in Wonsan during the Korean War, Kim said, "I'd like to spend the rest of my life doing something meaningful to me, though I'm old and feeble." Meeting him at Kimpo International Airport was Kim Chun-cha, who said he might be the brother she parted with in North Korea during the war. He failed to recognize her, however.
