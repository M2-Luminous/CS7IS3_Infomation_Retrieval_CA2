For example, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs disseminated the statement by FRG Foreign Minister K. Kinkel to the effect that the Federal Government is following the recent events on the Crimean Peninsula with concern. Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence are essential for stability and peaceful relations in Europe and cannot be subject to any doubt. The Federal Government hopes, continues the statement by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that all interested political forces realize the significance of the fundamental obligations within the framework of the CSCE and the unconditional need to adhere to them. The head of the Finnish external political department, H. Haavisto, stated that he hoped that the problems that had arisen after the well-known decision by the Crimean Supreme Council would be resolved as soon as possible through negotiations and assured that Ukraine's position and concern would be brought to the attention of the state's top-level leadership. During the meeting of Ukrainian Ambassador in the Moldovan Republic V. Boyko with Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs N. Osmoquescu [as published], the Moldovan side assured the ambassador that the content of the letter would be brought to the attention of President M. Snegur and leadership of the Moldovan parliament. Moldova, which has suffered from the policy of separatism, pointed out the head of the Moldovan external political department, is fully aware of the danger that the actions of the Crimean power structures are fraught with, fully supports the Ukrainian leadership, and condemns the separatists.
