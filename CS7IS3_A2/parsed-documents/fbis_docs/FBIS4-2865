FBIS4-2865 "drchi072_n_94008" FBIS-CHI-94-072 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural Inspection System Improves Product Quality Inspection System Improves Product Quality HK1404062094 Beijing CHINA DAILY in English 14 Apr 94 p 1 HK1404062094 Beijing CHINA DAILY English BFN [By Ma Zhiping: "Inspections Improving Product Quality"] [Text] Intensified government supervision has effectively improved product quality in the market, inspection officials said yesterday. Briefing reporters on product quality inspection work, the State Bureau for Technical Supervision confirmed that China has already established a comprehensive quality inspection system. First initiated in 1985, the system covers inspection of product design, sampling, data collection, specialist analysis, publishing inspection results, and advising producers on quality problems to improve and reexamination of products. The inspection system now comprises 233 State-level quality centres, more than 700 ministerial-level inspection centres, in addition to 1,700 provincial or regional stations. The centres and stations are responsible for regular and irregular inspection, and have played a vital role in improving product quality and protecting the legal interests of both the consumers and producers, the bureau said. Results have indicated that State inspections have produced positive results in improving Chinese product quality. Among the products checked in the last quarterly inspection of 1993, 49 which were inspected before had better records than 21 products checked for the first time. The average satisfactory rate of phosphate fertilizer improved from 66 percent in 1989 to 81.9 percent last year, while the average satisfactory rate of fire engines and drainage pipes rose from 63 and 5 percent in 1991 to 80 and 82 percent. Another typical example was the rapid improvement of disposable infusion syringes, whose poor quality brought many public complaints over past years. In 1992, the satisfactory rate of these syringes was only 42 percent but last year it rose to 83 percent, thanks to intensified quality inspection and improved production management.
