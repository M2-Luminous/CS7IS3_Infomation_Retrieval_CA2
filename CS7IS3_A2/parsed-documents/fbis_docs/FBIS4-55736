UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman Rob Annink said the Bosnian Army was strengthening its positions on both the eastern and western fronts in central Bosnia and "feels ready to launch an attack" against Serb forces. He said the heaviest fighting Thursday was around Brgule, Olovo and Kladanj, towns located between Sarajevo and the northern city of Tuzla, where UN military observers counted up to 200 explosions Wednesday. The UNPROFOR has not been allowed to visit the combat zone, Annink said. He said the larger Bosnian Army has an advantage over the Serbs along the eastern front because the hilly terrain favors ground troops over the Serbs' stronger artillery. "The Bosnian Army is an infantry army while the Bosnian Serbs have mostly artillery," Annink said. He said the army would have a tougher time along the western front where the Serbs control the high ground overlooking the town of Turbe. But, he added, the army has managed to concentrate its troops in the region thanks to the federation plan signed in February between the country's Moslems and their former Bosnian Croat enemies. The pact has allowed the government army to redeploy troops from previous zones of conflict with the Croats. The upsurge in fighting came as Britain and Spain joined France in raising the possibility they will pull their peacekeeping troops out of Bosnia in the absence of progress toward peace. British Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg said the Bosnian Moslems "have to recognize military defeat when it stares them in the face... "I recognize this is extraordinarily unpalatable," he told a private group Wednesday night in remarks reported Thursday. "Time is running out," he said. "We have eight weeks or so" to see positive developments in the peace process. A Foreign Office spokesman stressed that Hogg was not referring to a withdrawal of troops within any set time limit. Spanish Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas meanwhile said in Madrid that it was "probable in the coming months we may consider reducing our troops in Bosnia... The UN peacekeepers cannot stay on a mission forever." French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday that France "cannot leave our UN peacekeepers indefinitely (in Bosnia) if the people they are trying to help have governments that don't want peace." Juppe said Thursday in Paris that the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and five Western European countries may hold a meeting on Bosnia-Herzegovina June 13. He said the meeting may be decisive in terms of future French policy in Bosnia. France has warned in recent days that it would consider pulling out its 6,800 troops stationed in the former Yugoslavia unless there was a breakthrough in the peace process within six months. Britain has about 3,000 troops stationed in ex-Yugoslavia while Spain has 1,487. [passage omitted]
