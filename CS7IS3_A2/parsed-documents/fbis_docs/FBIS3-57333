V. Rayfikesht cited personal reasons as the main motive but refused to comment on it. Furthermore, he considers it impossible for him to continue work at the post of kray governor owing to the inconsistent reform course pursed by the government. Rayfikesht blamed the latter for the economic crisis and the colossal outflow of hard currency funds and raw materials from Russia. At the same time, Rayfikesht stressed that "although the government composition is bad, another would have been 100 times worse." In Rayfikesht's opinion, Yeltsin can no longer enjoy the entirety of his powers. The former governor stressed that the Russian president displayed weakness when after the elections to the Federal Assembly he failed to consolidate the reformist wing in the government. Hence the resignation of Gaydar and Fedorov, which only aggravated the situation. Summing up his performance in the kray, Rayfikesht stated that he is leaving with a clear conscience. First, the kray has not become "a preserve of socialism." Second, market structures have been put in place. Rayfikesht stressed that the incumbent administration is not responsible for the production decline in the kray, since that was largely conditioned by the financial and credit policy pursued by the government.
