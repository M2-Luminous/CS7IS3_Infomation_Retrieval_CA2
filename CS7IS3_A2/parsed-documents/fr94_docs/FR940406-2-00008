FR940406-2-00008 FR940406-2-00001 •Develop uniform loss adjustment standards that clearly specify the requirements for accurate determinations. •Continue research to improve loss adjustment methods, such as yield appraisal methods and techniques for unharvested crops, and measurement techniques for stored production. •Strengthen the quality adjustment provisions of crop insurance contracts and develop standards to prevent abuse of production determinations when quality losses are claimed. The contributions of these factors to achieve the 1.10 target loss ratio will be measured by a reduction in improper amounts paid on claims and a reduced error rate. The potential impact of these actions is difficult to quantify since the initiatives to improve underwriting also affect this area. These actions are ongoing. Loss adjustment standards for major crops and changes to the quality adjustment provisions are targeted for the 1995 crop year. K. Marketing Crop Insurance FCIC marketing efforts for 1994 will be directed by a strategic marketing plan based on information and data received from market research compiled across the country. The plan's main objectives will be to inform members of the farming community about changes in the program and to educate farmers about risk management, emphasizing the value of crop insurance to farming operations. FCIC will conduct a year-long media campaign targeted at publications and broadcast markets with an agricultural audience. Also, emphasis on outreach to minority farmers, traditionally under-represented in the program, will be coordinated through a Minority Outreach Marketing Plan that specifically identifies minority farmers in each of the 10 FCIC Regional Service Offices. L. Expand Participation by Introducing New Products Numerous ideas for products that will enhance the quality and acceptance of the crop insurance program have been suggested. These include cost of production coverage (several different concepts), dollar denominated coverage, revenue insurance, replacement cost insurance, and others. FCIC currently has contracts with the Economic Research Service to evaluate several alternatives in the context of public policy contributions, availability of data to support the concepts, assessments of producer acceptance, and other factors. FCIC proposes to continue such research and seeks comments about additional concepts that may be appropriate. Implementation of a pilot test of the best alternatives will be pursued. M. Improve Accuracy of Other Program Variables This section includes items that impact the program but are not easily categorized under a previous heading. These are: •Unit division. A unit is a tract of land used to establish the amount of insurance and any indemnity. For example, the crop insurance policy defines a unit as all land in a county that is owned by the farmer or rented for cash and planted to the insured crop. This unit may be subdivided under certain conditions, including payment of additional premium. Generally, insured persons favor a program that gives them great flexibility and freedom for establishing a unit. Some research indicates that size of a unit may affect losses, i.e., a unit consisting of 10 acres may have a great loss (in relative terms) than a unit consisting of 100 acres. This research, if verified, suggests that a surcharge may be needed for small acreage units regardless of how these are formed (by dividing larger units or because this is all the land planted to the crop). FCIC will examine the research and determine if this surcharge is appropriate, both actuarially and as a public policy initiative. FCIC also will explore the potential to provide greater flexibility of unit determinations as a tool to enhance program acceptance by customers. The pricing needed to support greater flexibility must be determined before it can be implemented. Implementation of changes will be targeted for the 1996 crop year. •Program dates. Program dates include sales closing, acreage reporting, cancellation, and others. Several of these dates may directly affect the actuarial soundness of the program. For example, neither the farmer nor the insurer should be able to predict the potential for loss on the sales closing date. However, a study by one university indicates that farmers may achieve better than a 50&hyph;50 probability of predicting a loss with the current sales closing date of April 15 in the Midwest. Arguments in favor of having a sales closing date as late as possible generally focus on the need to maximize sales opportunities; i.e., that interest in purchasing crop insurance is greatest as planting time approaches. In a draft report, the GAO has encouraged FCIC to close sales earlier. FCIC proposes to close sales for the 1995 crop year by 15&hyph;30 days earlier than the present dates. FCIC requests comments regarding other actions with regard to program dates that will facilitate achievement of the targeted 1.10 loss ratio. •Staged guarantees. Staged guarantees reduce the amount of insurance when a crop is lost before harvest. For example, a farmer who abandons a crop within 30 days of planting might be paid only 40 percent of the amount of insurance. The concept underlying staged guarantees is investment costs; the farmer's investment is less than the total needed to produce and harvest the crop. Some believe this approach will reduce outlays for indemnities and help achieve actuarial soundness. However, in the long run its efforts could be to reduce premium rates from levels otherwise needed. The impact of staged guarantees upon customer acceptance of crop insurance may be the valid measure of this concept. FCIC specifically requests comments on this feature and assessments of its potential contribution to achieving the targeted 1.10 loss ratio. •De minimis yields. This term denotes a yield below which any production is disregarded for the purpose of determining the amount of indemnity. The concept is advanced by interested parties as an equity issue_that it costs the farmer more to harvest the crop than it is worth in the market. If allowed by the program, indemnities will increase compared to the present provisions of the crop policies, which, in turn, requires higher premium rates to achieve the goal. Readers are encouraged to comment on the desirability of increasing premium rates by an amount needed to permit this feature to be included in crop insurance policies. •Suspension and debarment. Inappropriate determinations and poor administration of the crop insurance program is alleged about agents, loss adjusters, and others who are involved with delivery of crop insurance. The SSN/EIN database is intended to help FCIC monitor the conduct of these persons. However, monitoring in and of itself is insufficient if there are no penalties for violations of program rules. FCIC proposes to develop clear and concise suspension and debarment procedures for agents, loss adjusters, reinsured companies and others who fail to observe the highest standards of performance in program delivery and administration. •Price Elections. The GAO recommended in a 1991 report that for the major crops, FCIC set its price elections equal to the forecasts issued by the World Agricultural Outlook Board in its semi-annual estimates. These estimates correspond to the cycle used to prepare the annual budget of the United States Government. These estimates are available only twice each year. Based on a sampling of a few years, GAO stated that overall losses would be reduced if this recommendation were adopted. FCIC is committed to offering a price election that complies fully with the requirements of the law. In addition, the offer must be meaningful to farmers. FCIC requests comments regarding this recommendation and assessments by readers of its likelihood of contributing to reduced loss ratios and improved participation. Readers are requested to identify additional issues that they believe are relevant and important to assist FCIC in its actions to manage the program to achieve the target loss ratio while maintaining or increasing participation levels. III. Management Actions If Section II Are Not Successful The actions identified in Section II of this document represent a continuation of current management initiatives that have been and continue to be important for the effective administration of a public program. FCIC believes that successful completion of these actions will meet the objective of achieving actuarial soundness as required by OBRA 93. Several years must elapse before it will be possible to observe FCIC's achievement of the objective. In the interim, attainment must be measured by realistic models of risk that adequately represent the crop insurance program. Flexibility in managing the program to attain the objective while simultaneously achieving other important policy objectives must be stressed. Few options that do not adversely affect participation in a material manner are available in the event the actions described in this blueprint are determined to be inadequate. One option is to focus better on defining the risk that is included in the premium rates charged to current insureds. Extreme crop disasters (such as the 1993 flooding and cold, wet growing season) tend to be widespread and occur infrequently. Crop insurance is not actuarially sound in a commercial sense because the private sector cannot manage the magnitude of these risks or arrange the financing over the long periods of time needed to accumulate reserves for a major disaster. This characteristic of crop disasters argues that actuarial soundness perhaps should be measured on a basis that separates normally expected conditions from the extreme disasters. This would serve to more precisely define the risk included in the premium rates for current insureds, and the risk that should be amortized over longer time periods. If the above is not acceptable, another action would be to limit the liability of crop insurance to specific areas and crops. This limitation could take the form of complete withdrawal of insurance in some cases, or limitations on the volume of business that would be accepted in a year for a crop or area. Commercial insurers use this process to manage their exposure to avoid concentrations geographically or by product line. Crop insurance may need the same management of its exposures rather than accepting any and all risk whenever farmers decide to enter and exit the program. This extreme action would indicate that the program was unable to completely fulfill its social and public policy responsibilities, and must be regarded as an initiative of last resort. IV. Management Actions If Actions in Section II Are More Successful Than Needed The greatest impediment to increased program participation will be high premium rates that might result from the actions defined in this plan. Moderation of premium rate increases will be a priority if more stringent program administration reduces the loss ratio below the target. If this occurs, experience should be examined to identify losses paid that no longer should be expected. Once the impact of those losses is eliminated from the experience, some improvement in premium rates would be anticipated. FCIC believes that the remaining management actions that have improved administration of the program or that have better defined the coverage provided to U.S. agriculture should not be relaxed because these generally represent good administration of public policy.
