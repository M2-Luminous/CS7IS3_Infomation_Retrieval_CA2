Only Lanovyy and Babych seem to be similar to each other; Plyushch, Kuchma, Moroz, Talanchuk, and, of course, the current president can be easily distinguished one from another. It is impossible to analyze the candidates' chances of being elected for the highest state office without reviewing the latest steps taken by our heroes. Leonid Kravchuk Obviously, he has recently met with misfortune. There was a time when Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] lived in three dimensions -- simultaneously, he would state that it is impossible for him to personally participate in the presidential race, insist on the need to postpone the presidential elections, and collect signatures as a presidential candidate -- which is the elementary behavior of a politician for whom power is above everything. Since the elections will be held anyway, even after numerous "appeals by company staffs" and during "the battle for crops" and "the winter-summer period of production," Leonid Makarovych has begun to "flex his muscles," and, undoubtedly, he will offer citizens a whole range of diplomatic successes and market-oriented speeches, award farm workers, disclose some unlucky Mafioso, stigmatize separatists, publish a book about fertile blacklands and colorful placards with his autographs, and, in general, he will do a lot of pleasing things which are so characteristic of him. Currently, there is a "time of work" for Kravchuk, and his victory is not as obvious as it was in 1990, since the following man has become a destabilizer in his triumphant march: Ivan Plyushch Even though the two men still shake hands publicly, the straightforward Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] has recently stated that he had "a secular" conversation with Leonid Makarovych, explaining that, as he understands the word, "secularism" is when one says what should be said, but not what one thinks. Plyushch is currently trying to outmaneuver the president in everything, since after the defeat of the faithful-to-him Durdynets [former Supreme Council deputy chairman], he is running the risk of losing his hard-earned influence. The conflict between the "ideologists" and the "economists" within the nomenklatura has reached its apogee, which, on the other hand, shows that the nomenklatura has definitely been nationalized -- it also has two hetmans now. Plyushch has undergone some unusual metamorphoses: While taking advantage of his image of economic leader, Ivan Stepanovych does not forget to react to political junctures in time, having temporarily mutated into a federalist. His latest statements, including the one in which he said that he is ready to personally head the government in the event of his victory, show that Ivan Stepanovych has bet everything on the presidential office, which suggests that he has probably done his "homework" on the eve of elections. Although Plyushch does not forget about his voters (the majority of whom live in Galicia and rural areas), due to the activeness of Oleksandr Moroz, his successor in parliament, the main battle will take place on Leonid Kuchma's territory. Oleksandr Moroz Every day, he increases his chances in the presidential battle, and the main question is whether he will manage to win enough popularity, during the short time remaining, to be elected. His election as Supreme Council speaker increased his chances in the battle for deputy seat. For people who are secretly longing for "the good old times," he is attractive, because he is promising to base his position on "creatively modified" Marxism, and he does not repel all the others, since, after all, he supports independence and speaks in Ukrainian. Moroz has a pretty good chance to lure voters who have not yet defined their positions, and who like the new speaker's manners. Moroz has yet another advantage. Unlike all the other candidates, he does not complain, but proposes. A whimpering image is represented by another candidate: Leonid Kuchma The former prime minister has significantly "marked down" his pro-Russian stance, and he is consistently trying to straddle the line between "independence" and "healthy pragmatism," which is not a very easy thing to do, since people want to obtain unequivocal answers to unequivocal questions. Apparently, Kuchma is the only one who is not working to alter his image, stubbornly sticking to the line of sad economist, who was rejected by "someone" wrong. Due to the campaign against Kuchma, conducted by all of his foes, Kuchma may lose some of his votes. As everybody knows, concerned over this campaign, Kuchma has met with the Rukh leadership, and as one of the participants in this meeting claims, he has even promised Rukh certain key positions in the future government. After the defeat of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms in the elections and refusal to recognize the deputy powers of Volodymyr Hrynyov, Leonid Kuchma is in need of new partners. However, due to the peculiarities of his nature, Kuchma has a gift to lose political allies without gaining new friends. For many of his potential voters, he still remains a man who "promised a lot, but did not do anything," and for those who still try to think independently, the following man is much more attractive: Volodymyr Lanovyy No matter what the real reason behind Lanovyy's joining the presidential race, one thing is obvious: In any case, Volodymyr Tymofiyovych is winning popularity all over Ukraine, which can become a starting block for quite another "jerk." Lanovyy's main weakness is his youth, and the main weakness of his presidential campaign is that his rivals are still emphasizing his "academicism," forgetting about his experience in the sphere of production. Although the majority of Kiev residents will most likely vote for Lanovyy, he does not have many chances for victory, nor does his rival Babych. Petro Talanchuk and Valeriy Babych The education minister has the worst chances among all the candidates. It is possible that his campaign will end by withdrawing his candidacy in favor of someone stronger -- Kravchuk or Plyushch. Valeriy Babych, who is still trying to continue an independent game, is in a better situation. Babych, former Komsomol leader, is currently exploiting the image of businessman descending from the people, who "became somebody" only thanks to his determination and willpower. Babych's propaganda is a mixture of Lanovyy's market proposals and Kuchma's "pro-Russian attitude." Yet, Babych is not particularly active in the electoral battle, properly believing that he cannot count on victory too much. Apparently, after the defeat of several "businessmen" in the parliamentary elections, more and more businessmen begin to understand that money does not resolve everything in politics. Chances and Prospects The closer to 26 June, the more precise candidates' political positions. Kravchuk "is urging reforms" and threatening political Philistines with "a leftist parliament." Plyushch has become a federalist, and he wants to head the government. Kuchma is dodging clear answers to questions concerning relations with Russia, and he is demonstrating his discontent with [Crimean President] Meshkov. Moroz is surprised when he hears that "the leftists are against the market," and has suspended his membership in the Socialist Party. The general harmony has been joined by newspapers supporting their own candidates. According to a survey of the press, conducted by the "Rivnist Mozhlyvostey" [equality of opportunities] committee between 23 and 29 May, newspapers published at the expense of Ukrainian taxpayers have already clarified their positions: HOLOS UKRAYINY devoted most of its space to candidate Kravchuk, UKRAYINA MOLODA -- to candidate Moroz, ROBITNYCHA HAZETA -- to candidate Kuchma. Kravchuk, Plyushch, Moroz, and Kuchma have the best chances. In a situation when the risk level is the same for all candidates, Kravchuk and Kuchma have the greatest chances of advancing to the second round, which means that Leonid Kravchuk will be reelected. The situation is being complicated by the fact that Ukrainian legislation does not define the ethical conduct of someone who already holds an official post and repeatedly runs in the elections. In other words, our society is not insured against certain official's -- such as the speaker or president -- using the entire arsenal at his disposal to influence, for instance, the television or special services against his opponents. It cannot be said, however, that this is currently taking place in Ukraine, but this still means that one can manipulate our society.
