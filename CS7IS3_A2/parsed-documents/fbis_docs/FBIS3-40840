When talking about national issues, his openness has hurt him in his political life. Be it the issue of the emergency, Punjab, Ram Janambhumi-Babri Masjid, or Mandal, Chandra Shekhar's opinion was always different and far from the beaten path. During the emergency, even though he was in the Congress Party, he supported JP [Jay Prakash Narayan]. On the issue of swadeshi, he did not hesitate in supporting the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]. He is as worried about the religious politics of the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] as he is about Kanshi Ram and Mulayam Singh Yadav's caste politics. We are giving excerpts from an interview on political and social issues with Ram Bahadur recently. [Question] Before the election, you announced that both the Congress and the BJP are dangerous to the nation. Regardless of which one wins, in your opinion, what is the danger now? Do you see a third danger? [Chandra Shekhar] The results of this election have given us two kinds of hints. One is that the danger of the BJP has been pushed back some. But this danger is not totally gone. The BJP defeat in Uttar Pradesh [UP] is being given too much importance; however, the narrow slogans that it used to win the elections of the past were stolen by the people who defeated it. As dangerous as using religion in politics to win a government is, encouraging caste feelings for this purpose is no less dangerous. Narrow politics always takes us into blind alleys. I do not want the situation to become any worse; however, the preliminary indicators tell us that the situation is taking a dangerous turn. Another thing is that if regional political parties form governments in different places, then the unity of our nation will be jeopardized. I believe that regional parties should come into power in the federal system of a government. However, the indecisiveness of the central government about these challenges worries me. The recent elections have made it clear that the power of regional parties will continue to increase. At the same time, it is clear that the present government at the Center cannot make a clear decision in any difficult situation. Running a country and running a government are two very different things. Our present prime minister is expert in running the government; however, it is clear that he lacks the ability to make decisions in running the country. If the Congress Party breaks up, then there will be a danger similar to the emergence of regional parties. I am not a supporter of the Congress Party; however, disintegration of the Congress Party will directly benefit the BJP at the national level. It is true that the danger from the BJP will come after some time. However, in a country like India, with so much diversity, the BJP will be unable to maintain unity. Gaining power through the use of blind religious feelings will make a party autocratic. It is impossible to run this country through an autocratic system. It has not happened in the past, nor will it happen in the future. As for the third power, I have tried for it. But the people who were so eager for unity suddenly retreated. This makes clear one more aspect: that we consider politics only as a timely success. Politics is a long-range pursuit. It is a kind of hard work in which a person, after failing many times, gives a new message and strength to the future generations. But the present leaders consider it only as an ideal. They say that only unsuccessful and failed people talk like that. The results of the recent elections clearly indicate that many leaders lose everything with one bump. The people who, until yesterday, claimed to write a new history are seeing their castles of hope destroyed like a house of cards. If they do not have enough power to even oppose consistently, then they cannot talk about writing history. They cannot even take a preliminary step in politics. [Question] If we forget the caste equation from the recent U.P. election results, will the major part played by the backward people there strengthen Indian democracy? [Chandra Shekhar] I would be happy if this happened now. But judging from some incidents in Uttar Pradesh, it is clear that this will not happen. The slogans that were used for uniting the backward groups could result in a caste struggle because of voices raised by the higher-caste people. In this struggle, only the poor will suffer. It is important to pay attention to the fact that the slogans used to get the support of the poor can arouse some special emotions. If emotions are aroused on caste hatred and not on the rich and poor equation, then it would not be very difficult to change this to an economic war. We are successful in efforts for which we try hard. The question of a revolution is a separate one. I believe that we are looking at this problem within the framework of parliamentary democracy, and therefore, we do not see any danger here. It is easy to arouse emotions, but it is hard to direct them for productive work. This is clear from our political experience over the last few hundred years. [Question] Keeping in mind the character of the middle class during the last 50 years, or the kind of people that have been becoming the leaders in government, do you consider them the reason for their failure to keep their promises? [Chandra Shekhar] The kind of society we create will result in the same kind of people emerging into our social, political, and economic life. Therefore, what is important is the kind of society we create. The leaders in various regions are surrounded by their narrow spheres. We have spread the limits around ourselves. We have to start this work somewhere. I believe that beginnings should take place where decisions about India's future are made. There are two great qualities that our country has. First, our people are not ignorant. If we disregard religious history and tradition, we will find that the people are very flexible about creating a society. If we explain to them the interests and negative aspects of our country, then they accept our argument after some hesitation--that is, if those who understand it realize these facts during their lifetime. The sadhus and saints get thousands of disciples. Some of these are of bad character; however, that is our country's greatest strength. This has been our tradition for thousands of years. We have to give the right direction to this strength, so that it benefits our country. The second quality is that we have the tendency to be satisfied with very little. In no other country are laborers willing to work so hard for so little as in India. They have to understand that their hard work will benefit the children of the future. However, we could not use both these qualities. Neither did we present examples to the people, nor could we give the right direction to our country's energy and its inherent strengths. [22 Jan pp 1, 5] [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar is not disappointed, even in this disheartening atmosphere. He feels that our country is in the process of change. This period, instead of disappointing him like it does other people, also gives him hope. He has faith in the inherent powers of the Indian society. The government has opened the door to world powers to let them play openly here. Still, the society will rise against the new challenges. This is the second part of Chandra Shekhar's talk with Ram Bahadur Rai. [Question] Those who lead India during this time of change do not care about long-range results. Do not you think that this is a period of change for our country? [Chandra Shekhar] I believe it is a period of change. I also believe that some people are trying to give a specific direction to history, which is not permanent. However, we cannot isolate ourselves to make a decision, because the world has become very complex. Other countries are trying to influence our political character. In this context, we remember Mrs. Indira Gandhi. You are aware that I strongly criticized her policies, but she should be praised for two things. First, she did not tolerate even the slightest interference of another country in our national politics. Second, she did not allow the Center to become weak. It has become clear during the last few years that our prime ministers have failed on both these fronts. It is also clear that in any country where foreign interference was increased in internal politics, the government could not be saved. It has not been long since the Soviet Union fell. Not only did the government fall there, but the people also lost their prestige, glory, and self-respect. [Question] Do you mean that regional politics will cause foreign interference, and that this will cause the fall of our nation? [Chandra Shekhar] It is imperative to encourage regional politics in order to increase foreign interference. All this will not happen suddenly. These tendencies have been encouraged over the last few years. They were encouraged to flourish in various ways. Now, with all the variance here, with people living in luxury on one side and a society living in poverty on the other, it is difficult to feel the pulse of the society with only one slogan. In such a time, the government's role becomes very important. Our constitution was written with all this in mind. The efforts made to encourage regional powers during the last few years are not hidden from anyone. Many people in the Indian government know this well. Buta Singh, home minister during Rajiv Gandhi's government, told me many things as the home minister. I cannot share those with you without his permission. I did not say anything at that time, because that would have weakened the central government, and would only have encouraged those elements that were giving importance to such tendencies. [Question] The truth is that we have a society with open democratic values inherent in it. The social inequities are part of it. We have opened all kinds of doors to the world. This is giving an opportunity to all world powers to interfere in our internal affairs. Those powers are inciting our people's desires, and are taking advantage of them. There are some dangerous signs. No other country has ever opened itself to our side interference like we have during the period of infancy of democracy that we are in. You are talking about the inherent powers of the Indian society. But what will the opposing forces in our society do to confront these developments? [Chandra Shekhar] I have visited many universities over the last few days. I feel that our youth are very much aware of this. They understand the problems in our country. They have the courage to understand and solve these difficult problems and the situation. I have seen the appropriate feelings among them. Unfortunately, the real issues are not being brought into focus. We are neither bringing these issues to the people, nor are we talking about them at their level. These questions are not discussed in Parliament or in the media. These are the platforms on which the youth are educated about the legislatures. I am sure that the time will come when the people will realize the dangerous results and rise up in opposition. Today's situation is not as disappointing as that of the 1920s, when Gandhi was towering over the Indian political horizon. Even in that disappointing situation, a new power emerged that had risen to protect the nation's pride and respect. When the people feel that the pride and glory of our nation is in danger, then they will react strongly. The people will not remain silent. The binds of caste and religion will be broken then. This is our only hope. This process can be accelerated and made effective. All we need is to do something about it. If we try, then this process of opposition will start soon. The people will rise up against this opportunist tendency in our Indian politics. [Question] Do you see any time lines? [Chandra Shekhar] This work is done through the inherent power of the people. No one can say how much time it will take. For example, look at 1975. When an emergency rule was imposed on the country, the people outside said that democracy had been ended in India for good. Elections, however, were announced in 1977, when the emergency was still in force. At that time, many leaders were still in jail. Except for two or three persons, everyone thought that they would not take part in the elections. No one wanted to run against Indira Gandhi. They felt that the election would not be free and unbiased. The Jan Sangh, Samajwadis, and many other parties even passed resolutions about it, and issued important statements. I do not want to take the credit that only two or three people, including Morarji Desai and I, believed that people would finally run for election. When elections were announced, a reaction surfaced within one week. The more serious the problem, the faster and more powerful the reaction. A time will come when the people will say that they will not go with the politics of slogans. They will demand the politics of real and basic issues. [Question] You have said correctly that people were hurt during the emergency. That was one reason for their rising. However, the hunger for self-respect of the backward classes is hidden behind the caste slogans. Their efforts to come into government is an expression of their self-respect. For what reason could they believe that some people are cashing in on their hunger for self-respect, using some slogans about castes? [Chandra Shekhar] This is a very sensitive question. Our caste system is very complex. No caste or group of castes can unite everyone using the slogan of self-respect. Let us look at the SP-BSP [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] government in Uttar Pradesh. The struggles that started soon after its emergence were between the higher and lower castes. It also started between the lower castes and the Dalits. Thus, slogans about castes have a hole in them for uniting everyone. [Question] You are talking about a struggle in the people's everyday life. The politics of elections gives them the opportunity to express their feelings about castes. Can the contradictions of daily life get their political echo? [Chandra Shekhar] Let us look at it with a liberal point of view. People do not live on caste slogans. They are tired of such a voting system. Let us look at the other forces that were in the arena of elections. One was the BJP, which floated all kinds of communal slogans. Let us look at the party within the Janata Dal of which I was the member. We also raised the same one-sided slogans. We kept kicking social justice again and again. We did not focus on industrial policy, economic policy, and unemployment. When, in an opportunist type of politics, there is an open competition, the people will lean toward the louder slogans. I have told some of my BJP friends that if they can use slogans of dividing people over religion, then in some regions and at some other time, the slogans of caste could be more effective. In an election, everyone is competing in raising slogans. In this situation, the poor people had only one option: to pick the louder slogan. [Question] Did animal feelings erupt in this competitive situation? [Chandra Shekhar] This time around, in this political opportunist atmosphere, the vote went to animal feelings. I will not say that I was the first in this area; however, these slogans will not remove illiteracy, unemployment, and hunger. Let us think: Imagine you are a Dalit, you are enjoying all the luxuries of life, and economic prosperity. On the other side is a high-caste person who is dying of hunger. Now, who is getting privileges and benefits? Since you are enjoying all the luxuries, cannot we say that you are getting unique treatment? [Question] At one time, you said that the youth, the RSS, and the bureaucracy are the three institutions on which the country can depend. What is your opinion of these three now? Let us talk about the bureaucracy first. My opinion about it has been clear from the beginning. In 1971, a Yugoslavian professor came to see me. He asked me about our bureaucracy. I told him that the bureaucracy in our country is the best in the world. He was surprised; however, he also felt the same. He said that over 10 million refugees had come to India from Bangladesh, and an equal number had gone back. All this was done very efficiently by our administrative service officers within six weeks. He had just returned from there. He told me that no other leader had said this about our bureaucracy. When I was in the government for six months, I did not have any experience to indicate that these people delay cases. After all, there are always one or two persons everywhere who make problems. Before we get their opinion, we should consider two things. First, we must let them know that we cannot punish them for what they are saying. Second, we should not made decisions before even asking their advice on it. We have to assure them that if we have ignored any opinion, then it will not be considered their crime. If we pay attention to this, I do not think there would be a better bureaucracy than we have. I am very proud of the achievement of our bureaucracy in some difficult situations. As for the youth's power here, everyone says that after independence, our youths lost the patriotism and ability to make sacrifices they once had. They are moving toward a life of comfort. They cannot follow ideals in a crisis. But I believe differently. Between 1947 and 1993, we saw a number of youth sacrificing themselves for their ideals. Their number is greater than what we had during our struggle for independence. We may not agree with their talk or their viewpoints; their path may be very different than ours. But this does not mean that their inherent ability is any less. Many people were killed in the Naxalite rebellion. How many people were killed in the uprisings in Punjab and Kashmir? Many of them may have been deceived by others; however, we have to understand one thing. They were sacrificing their lives for other people. It does not matter how much one may curse me about it. We just cannot ignore their inner feelings and energy. I am opposed to the way the RSS thinks, but some of the ideas this organization has--for example, the nationalism and swadeshi issues--are things they will always follow. I do not agree with their definition of nationalism, but if the country needs anything, they will never hesitate to do it for the nation. There is a small faction within the RSS that does not think that becoming an MP [member of Parliament] or an MLA [member Legislative Assembly] is necessary. During our struggle for independence, there was a group which sewed hand-spun cotton all its life, or spent its life herding cows or working with the Harijans. Similarly, there is a group within the RSS that will always raise its voice on these questions. I have criticized the RSS a lot, and it does have many flaws. However, wherever there is power in our society, we cannot ignore it. In this critical situation, we are not using all of nation's energy to protect our society. Therefore, I have to say that it will be the RSS that will become a problem for the BJP in the future. Advani or Atal Behari Bajpayee can openly support the present economic policies. But a man like Murli Manohar Joshi can still shut them up over the swadeshi issue because of the RSS policies. The joy with which Mr. Advani during his travel in the United States supported the economic policy was emulated by Atal Behari Bajpayee, when he said that should Narasimha Rao resign and he were to form government, he would follow the same policies. The RSS people are traveling around the country and propagating the kinds of policies put forth by Bala Sahab Deoras and Murli Manohar Joshi. While I disagree with other policies of the RSS, you cannot ignore their effort to bring feelings of swadeshi to every person in the country. If you ignore it, then you are not using the power of our people appropriately. This is the main support system in a democracy, and it is necessary for any national campaign to use as much power and support as it can get. We have to reach our goal, and it does not mean that everyone else will reach their goal. However, we have to take people with us; it does not matter how many steps they take with us. Perhaps it was Marx who said it; maybe it was Lenin, or it could be Mahatma Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi was an idealist, but you cannot say that from among his supporters there were no people who drank or ate meat. You cannot even say that Mr. Gandhi did not know that there were people in his party who lied without hesitation. Still, Gandhi used whatever support and strength he got from them. However, he never compromised with various tendencies. We do not have to compromise with the RSS tendencies. But we should use their competence. [23 Jan pp 1, 7] [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar does not consider himself capable of playing the role of Gandhi or Jay Prakash Narayan. However, he considers it important to learn from their mistakes. He spoke openly about the Bihar campaign, and analyzed its strengths and weaknesses after two decades. He threw some light on it for the first time. He never joined a cabinet headed by another prime minister. He did not discuss why Jay Prakash Narayan made a historical mistake by appointing Morarji Desai prime minister in 1977. This is the third installment of Chandra Shekhar's interview with Ram Bahadur Ray. [Question] It appears that the bureaucracy, the youth, and the RSS all feel helpless now. Can the influence of these three still be used to help our country? [Chandra Shekhar] No. I do not believe that they consider themselves helpless. I am sure that you and I have both felt that people do not listen to what they are saying. One should not worry about this, because it happens in every critical situation. When problems increase extremely, they also open the path for a new solution. As the saying goes, too much pain becomes a medicine in itself. There is another strange thing. In our country, when we have political differences, we do not want to have any personal relationships. I do not believe that I am washed in milk [flawless]. But because of some mutual misunderstanding, insulting someone else is not something I consider a part of politics. I have never compromised my beliefs. Therefore, I will take anyone as far as he can walk with me. I want to say that if some people had not tried to make accusations against the RSS in 1977, then the RSS of today would not be what it is now. Some people tried to accuse it, and some did succeed. The leaders wanted to accuse the RSS, and the RSS leaders retracted their accusation. The reason for this is those "good" powers that I failed give proper political direction even after cooperating with them. [Question] The people had similar hopes for the 1977 change in government as they had with the 1947 change. It was also believed that the change in government would lead to a change in the system. But during the Janata Party rule, this did not happen within the party or the government's administration. This disappointment gave birth to the present crisis. If you get another opportunity, would you take a lesson from those failures? [Chandra Shekhar] I have some experience that is very difficult for me to share publicly. I will have to talk with some of the people who were running the government at the time. This is a very painful issue. What you people know is not enough. What happened was that the 1975-77 emergency era was very short. People were in jail for 18 months. Later, anyone who emerged in the political arena had arrived there after winning the election. When they won, they not only became MP or MLA, they even became ministers. They understood neither the struggle nor the society, nor did the understand the complexity of the problems. They did not even understand the goal of the movement about which you are talking now. [Question] Before that movement, I told Jay Prakash: "Keeping in mind the people's opinion, if you are thinking that the people will join the movement, Indira Gandhi will send you to jail, public rallies will be held, there will be a tumult in the Lok Sabha, the Rajah Sabha, and the Vidhan Sabha; and public opinion will be formed, then you are wrong. This will not happen. Your voice will be muted. The opposition that is following the whole movement now, for the most part, has nothing to do with the campaign itself. They have no respect for the feeling inherent in this campaign. These people want to get into government on your coattails. They may be successful in their goal, but you will only be disappointed." I told this to Jay Prakash Narayan not alone, but in the presence of 10 other people. I also wrote letters to Jay Prakash and Indira Gandhi. I wrote to Indira Gandhi that the communist leaders were trying to have her and Jay Prakash clash with each other, and that they were conspiring to enter the government through the back door. I also wrote that her clash with Jay Prakash would be fatal to our country. Jay Prakash was not fighting to get into government; therefore, he could not be pressured with the power of government. If Jay Prakash is ready to die by himself, I told her, she still could not save the government. Therefore, it would be best that she stopped the confrontation with him. Her government's power and Jay Prakash's moral strength could save the nation. I wrote another letter to Jay Prakash. I told him that his followers wanted government, and not a total revolution. Therefore, he should talk to Indira Gandhi. He did not listen to me. Both of them are not here now, and I am talking about them now. I was a bit successful in my efforts. This success was limited to Indira Gandhi writing a letter to Jay Prakash. But their followers increased the tension between them. The leadership of both those people depended on the continuing fight between Indira Gandhi and Jay Prakash. Later, when the emergency was implemented, I also went to jail. There was another problem. You cannot name even two dozen such young people who walked with the feeling of revolution. I remember that after 18 months, 52 young people from the student movement applied for election tickets. I obtained tickets for 45-48 of them after talking with Karpuri Thakur. Some of them won elections and even became cabinet members. After my government was formed, I went to Patna as the president of the Janta Party. We had a meeting at night there. In one of the speeches, someone said that the right people were not elected to the government. After half an hour, I said that I became a legislator in 1962, and have not even been able to become a deputy minister in 15 years. I said that I did not have the skill to become a minister, and that they could ask about this of anyone. I was very disappointed that day. One boy, who had gone to jail while attending college, had become an MP after 18 months, and wanted to become a minister immediately. He had forgotten sacrifices, Jay Prakash Narayan, and the whole movement. We have to admit that this was the greatest weakness of the whole campaign. Second, there was no one in the Janata Party that considered himself equal to another. Everyone thought himself superior to others. It is useless to say anything about Morarji. Talking about Charan Singh is also useless. The Jan Sangh people had come as a power group. The idealism of the socialists had gotten to their heads. What could be done in that situation? When I remember those incidents, I wonder: How did the government last for 28 months? I can remember, based on those experiences, that running a government in a country like India, in today's situation, requires a lot of courage and clear thinking. We have to prepare ourselves for the fact that we may have to leave the government tomorrow. The way we have to run the government today is a separate issue. There was one great benefit from that movement, however. That was the world's agreement that democracy had died in India, and that it would never thrive there. In this situation, return of the democracy could be considered the greatest gain of our campaign. The 18-month emergency, followed by the return of democracy, is not a gain that we can ignore. I told Jay Prakash not to advise anyone anymore. I told him, "You achieved everything in the twilight of your life, even things that Gandhi did not attain. Therefore, please keep yourself separate from everyone. Both Sardar Patel and Pundit Nehru rejected Gandhi, and today's leaders will not accept him. Your health is not good, either." [Question] There are dozens of people in the next row of this movement who did not go to any leaders to ask for any party's ticket for election, who were devoted to the cause during the whole period of this campaign. Still, it is a fact that this flow stopped after the Janata government was formed. Who do you blame for this? [Chandra Shekhar] Listen, there are two things. Please forget that all of this happened because of the Janata Party government. The ambiguity that was rampant in the movement was the reason for it. To those who ask me to play the roles of Gandhi and Jay Prakash, I say that I do not agree, and people think I am striving to get into power. I have been a student of political science and have had open discussions with Jay Prakash many times. I do not understand impartial politics. There can be social reformers, but there cannot be political workers who are impartial. You were right in what you said about the young people. It is not that they were disappointed in no time. Some young people worked for a long time. However, after that, they stopped. Let us look at Jay Prakash's example. He opposed the politics of parties. But when we had to change the government, he had to depend on the parties that he had opposed strongly. Therefore, the greatest weakness of this movement was that we said all the negative things, but did not clarify the positive aspects. There were many young men in this movement who were intelligent. But where did they go from there? Some of them had worked for 12 years, staying hungry. I have met people like that. They stopped after reaching a specific point, because they were taught not to follow the politics of parties. Had they continued, and were they still working now, then some new politics could be started. You say that there is such a large force; however, new youths are not joining us. And if they do join, then they do not have contact with us. We have taught the young people who worked with us in old times that the politics of parties is a bad thing. However, politics has to run with them. If a house is dirty, then someone has to clean it. Standing outside and saying that the house is dirty will not clean the house. [Question] Two decades have passed since your movement. What is your evaluation of the movement? [Chandra Shekhar] Before we understand this movement, we have to first understand JP, and many people have misunderstood him. There were two sides to his personality. In the area of philosophy, he always worked like an investigator. Therefore, his thoughts always changed. JP had to change his philosophy, starting with Marx, to Vinoba Bhave, until this movement. Therefore, many times, people said that he was ambiguous. He understood that there was no limit to thinking, and that there was no finite thought. One must look for new ideas and philosophy according to the situation. This was his unique quality. His decision in the area of action was unbreakable. For example, in 1942, he put forth the slogan of "do or die." While other Congress leaders thought this was just another Gandhian slogan, JP followed it all his life. His jumping the walls of Hazaribagh jail was an example of putting the "do or die" slogan into practice. I wrote in an article that Jay Prakash's idea could change, but when he would jump into the arena of action, no power in the world could shake him. Therefore, these people in government could never understand the real meaning of what he said. Jay Prakash's movement depended on these two aspects. There was always a lot of action in the area of philosophy. He talked a lot and wrote a lot about the total revolution. This was a result of his profound thinking, which he had taken to a logical conclusion. One main reason was his ill health. But he moved this revolution very rapidly. One reason was the situation, and the second was his own personality. Therefore, if anyone evaluates this revolution after 20, 50, or even 100 years, then that person must conclude that one must be willing to accept new ideas and changes, and must not hesitate in following one's determination and decisive ideas. Therefore, the Jay Prakash revolution was unique in itself. Had the emergency stayed for six months or a year more, then perhaps there would have been more logical results. [Question] JP played a major role in selecting a prime minister in 1977. Do you feel that he selected the wrong person for this position? [Chandra Shekhar] Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai is our respected politician. What can I say about him? I changed my opinion at that time. You may remember that I was asked to become a cabinet member. When I declined, Jay Prakash asked me why I did that. I told him that he knew my opinion. I did not want to be a member of that cabinet. It was wrong that I wanted to join the cabinet to straighten out the prime minister, because remaining a cabinet member depends on the wishes of the prime minister. If you do not agree with the prime minister, to be able to run the government according to his wishes, then it is neither moral nor honest to be a member of such a cabinet. I want to tell you one more thing. People say that Chandra Shekhar had his eye on the chair of the prime minister; therefore, he never became a minister. This is not true. I believe that if you go into government and do not change the government system, it will be difficult to change society. I believe that I should not join the cabinet of a prime minister whose philosophy I do not agree with. One after another, whether it was Indira Gandhi, Morarji Desai, or V. P. Singh, none of them had the same philosophy that I did. I was not willing to work with them. I do not believe that I should work against the person in whose cabinet I am a member. Therefore, if some minister says that he had joined the cabinet to change the government, I will not believe him. It is not possible in a parliamentary democracy. Therefore, I did not join any cabinet, and it was not because of sacrifice or unselfishness. I never even dreamed that I would become a prime minister by following this path. I became prime minister for six months. That is another story. [24 Jan pp 1, 10] [Text] Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar has had the experience of running the government. His period was short; however, he had experienced many new things. His experience with the bureaucracy and the army, especially amazes people. During this interview, he talked about two positive forces which, if used appropriately, could accelerate the change. He also shed some light on their weakness. We often think negatively of our bureaucracy. A lot has been said about the negative aspects of the RSS. Chandra Shekhar has the ability to look at this from a different perspective. This is his specialty. This is the fourth installment of Chandra Shekhar's interview with Ram Bahadur Ray. [Question] What possibilities do you see, looking at the social, economic, and political character of the RSS, the bureaucracy, and our youth? [Chandra Shekhar] These three forces are organized separately. The RSS and the bureaucracy, of course, are organized. The young people are also organized in a small way. These are not the only three powers. The farmers and the laborers have their own power. They also have some organization, borne out of their own pains. There are different possibilities with each of these forces. Let us talk about the bureaucracy first. Its greatest quality is its ability to solve various problems. It can combine the experience of the world with its own experience. The bureaucrats understand the principles that are important to this country. These three things make them a very positive force for us. However, there are some weak elements. When a person gets a job, he has a great desire to serve the people. Slowly and gradually, however, as they get promotions, the greed for luxuries increases their tendency to become yes men. They cannot tell the truth, even when they know what is right and what is wrong. Therefore, if we want to use them appropriately, then the political leaders must assure them that if they give an opinion, it should not affect their jobs. The politicians lack this quality. We want to run them according to our own wishes. We do not let them do their duties according to their wishes. If we discipline ourselves, then the bureaucracy will also be disciplined. It is clear that the faster the politicians change themselves, the more effective the bureaucracy will be. They will also change. Now that the character of politicians has fallen at a large scale, this will naturally influence the bureaucracy. [Question] Mr. Trilok Singh was a very effective bureaucrat, and he worked around the clock. Can we reform our bureaucracy by imposing the Trilok Singh model? You said that the bureaucracy can be reformed by reducing political pressure. Can we run a model here like the one in France? [Chandra Shekhar] First of all, it took a long time to establish a bureaucracy like this in France. Then, there are many differences between India and France. They do not have inconsistencies and diversity like we have here. As for Trilok Singh or L. P. Singh, they have high standards. Despite all the weaknesses, the level of the politician was very high at that time. On one side there was Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Pundit Nehru, and Keshav Dev Malviya. There was also Morarji Desai, whom I consider in the same class. What did Lal Bahadur Shastri not do to protect the image of the cabinet? Let us look at the attitude of this government a few weeks ago. There is no meaning in comparing the leaders of that time and of today. That time was very different. There are many good people in the bureaucracy now. But because of pressure, they cannot write their honest opinion on the files. We should not expect the bureaucracy alone to make all the changes. The degeneration of character is common now; if hemp has been mixed in water of the well itself, how can the bureaucracy be left unaffected? Therefore, efforts to change should be made at every level. If the people at the top do not feel the need for change, then it will not be effective. Because of the internationalization of our economic system, our bureaucracy is coming into contact with the whole world. But the people they are coming in contact with are mostly ignorant about the problems of our country. If we ignore some exceptions, I do not think that those people working for multinational companies and international organizations are fully aware of the problems of our country. They do not use the perspective necessary to look at our country's problems. This will have bad results. We used to say that we would make social progress through hard work, according to our resources, and by being simple and frugal. The slogan has changed now. The world is changing very fast. We have joined the race for luxury goods. The work to change mentalities is starting there, and a small group will get all the luxuries. It is said that liberalization will give freedom to everyone. But what exactly will happen is that those who are rich will have more freedom to hoard wealth, and those who are dying of hunger will have the freedom to die suffering of hunger. It would be wrong to believe that the bureaucracy will be unaffected by this change. Therefore, I believe that those connected with international organizations are not aware of our backward nature and poverty. That is why there is some distortions in setting our policies. [Question] This makes one believe that the bureaucracy is working for three percent (upper class) of the people. It is not worried about the remaining 97 percent. [Chandra Shekhar] The bureaucracy cannot provide any leadership. It does what we tell it to do. The bureaucracy implements the plans that we assign it. Therefore, when we ask it to lead, we are ignoring our responsibility. [Question] You are warned us of the danger of the new political culture that is thriving. You have told us how to change that at the intellectual level? What methods will be necessary to change it at the political level? [Chandra Shekhar] After joining the bureaucracy, people become part of a circle. They try to do their duty as well as they can. This is not a personal weakness; it is the weakness of the whole system. The bureaucracy has its own limitations for making sacrifices for the future. It cannot go any farther than that. The young people have to prepare themselves mentally for a long time to face the challenges. This is their helplessness. For them, the life of tomorrow is not the only important thing. They have to think about their own lives. The politician who has earned respect today will be satisfied by doing some work for immediate gratification. But young people who understand the future will not hesitate to make sacrifices to make the future more productive and stable. There is no dearth of such young people in our country. Many young people made sacrifices during the last 46-47 years. We can trust them even today. No society falls at once. The Indian society, after all, will collapse only after great crises. This is clear after the history of the last 5,000 years. Let us forget the era of Rama and Krishna. History clearly shows us that our society cannot break down. There can, of course, be some ups and downs. The third issue is the RSS. It has its own beliefs. We cannot ignore their positive aspects. I have also tried to understand the RSS from the beginning. They are told that they should not hanker for higher positions, and should not be involved in day-to-day politics. They are not involved in blind competition, allowing them to finish their work and become MPs or MLAs. We have to admit that this approach of self-control is better for a long-range struggle. Therefore, it is not wrong to expect these people to do something for the society. Their other quality is their strong feeling for the glories of our past. Any country that does not campaign for its achievements of the past cannot build a better future. There were some bad things in our 5,000 years of history. But there were many positive aspects also. We should not ignore those. The attitude we had about the human race in the past has affected these people somewhere--for example, the question of swadeshi. I do not believe that the RSS is looking at swadeshi and self-dependence with the same kind of political perspective the BJP is using. This is clear from the mentality of these two groups. The RSS people are very disciplined in their daily work. This discipline benefits them in a positive way and also hurts them. We can use their discipline in a positive way to build the future of our nation. Therefore, we should not ignore their strengths. There are some negative aspects about the RSS. For example, their viewpoint about the religion. It is not clear to me what basis they are making it on. I know that this does not agree with our traditional humanistic viewpoint. The narrow description of religion that the BJP is giving is wrong. I said once in Parliament that I am proud to be a Hindu, because it is the only religion that does not condemn other religions. We have adopted every aspect that shows humanity the right path. While we have considered it important to recognize God, we also worship Gautama Buddha, who did not believe in God. We also worship Charvak as a saint, although he was against then-Hindu beliefs. Perhaps you remember the question of suttee. People believed in different things. The suttee, on one side, believed in forcibly burning the widow. On the other hand, there was the belief to burn themselves of their own desire. I do not say it is appropriate to commit suttee if God wants you to. But if Chandra Shekhar Azad shoots himself instead of being caught by the British, we worship him. Will we condemn Padmini because she burns herself before she is caught by the enemy? There is a big difference between the traditions of johar and suttee. The Hindu religion never endorses the suttee tradition. But if some woman commits suttee on her own, we worship her. We also worship a woman who gives birth to a great son. That is why, in the Hindu religion, we also worship the five holy girls in addition to the suttees. In other words, the Hindu religion worships steadfastness. We worship the power to sacrifice one's life for the good of the society. It is unfortunate that the liberal nature of the Hindu religion is not brought to the public. I do not know what the founder of the RSS thought about it. The weakness of the present spokesmen for the RSS today is they look down upon other religions. There is a lot of difference between the opinion of Balasahab Deoras and Mr. Advani over national issues. This weakness of the RSS is its greatest flaw. That is why a large majority of our population views the RSS suspiciously. Because of this suspicious atmosphere, the capability of the RSS is reduced, and at the same time, the possibilities of it emerging as a national force also become minimal. [Question] Does the RSS divert its philosophy about the Hindu religion when it talks about nationalism? [Chandra Shekhar] There has been a very liberal description of Hinduism, and its humanist image has been presented to the society. The RSS cannot be successful in changing that image. There may be some distortion for a short time; however, the RSS does not have the capability to change the humanistic viewpoint of Hinduism. I told Mr. Advani once that he would not rise above Yagvalkaya. The idea of world Hindutva came to India first. It did not exist anywhere in the world before. It was also said that there was only one God, and that there were many paths to meeting him. This is what teaches us to respect other religions. We consider eating meat and fish a sin. But we also worshiped those who ate meat and fish and managed to meet God. In this country, where we worship Tukaram, Madhwacharya Ramanujam, and Gynashwar, and at the same time worship Kinaram, it is important to understand the Hindu religion methodically. Human nature is so varied and diversified that all cannot be covered within one system. The people here understood this a long time ago. Doing good for another person is considered religion in our society. Tulsi Das defined religion as "doing good to another." That is the summary of our definition of religion. Those who give new definitions to religion do not understand that. [Question] The RSS has tried to tell us that religion is a part of society. You say that the RSS has tried to join the philosophy of Hinduism with the country's politics. They want everything to be done for religion. Are the definitions of nationalism and religion given by the RSS distorted? [Chandra Shekhar] The RSS people always say that they have nothing to do with plain politics. We are speaking based on this aspect. They also talk about the aspect that tells us that they have good intentions. We have opposed the RSS strongly at the political level. After all, there is no one in the world who is fully a saint or a devil. There is a portion of saintliness and devilishness in everyone. Some have more of one than the other. We want to look for the good in every person in this society so that they can be helpful in bad days. [Question] The stand of the RSS in Ayodhya-- [Chandra Shekhar] Ayodhya is not the result of RSS actions. It happened because of an indecisive and weak government's mentality. Religion is a path to reaching God. We have the full right to believe in and follow any religion. But when it influences politics, it becomes dangerous. Therefore, the government was created. The invention of a government is based on the cooperation of people and their helplessness. We expect that when a person tries to hurt other people, the government should intervene. It is not just a question of punishing someone. If people knew that the government is determined to do its duty, then this destruction would not have happened in Ayodhya. When I was in the government, no one challenged our authority. What happened in Ayodhya on 6 December is, in my opinion, the responsibility of the government. I have said the same thing to the prime minister. The government and the state were established because in one or the other place there could be ill feelings in society. Therefore, the government did not do its basic duty in the Babri Masjid fiasco. [Question] That was the problem of the organizing-- [Chandra Shekhar] The problem was not of organization; it was of indecisiveness. If we consider it a problem of organization, we will have a difficult time doing so, because we can have problems over the border also. The leadership was fully responsible for it. [Question] What kind of action could be taken at that time? If they had started firing, it would have resulted in blood-- [Chandra Shekhar] When there is such a crisis, one has to shoot. The government spends billions of rupees on the armed forces and defense. This is not done for the wearing of flower garlands. Firing bullets is necessary if there is a need, and you do not start shooting out of cowardice and irresponsibility to the people. [Question] The government is defensive in a democracy. Are not there any limitations when it is involved in a campaign like the one in Ayodhya? [Chandra Shekhar] It should be defensive, but it does not happen that way. Many times, we cannot take defensive steps. We had to do something at the time. During my government, we never had to shoot at any one. [Question] Was not it necessary to stop half a million people from going there? [Chandra Shekhar] Yes, it was wrong to let them go there. That is why I asked the government to stop it when there were demonstrations in Delhi, and said that if necessary, they should start shooting. When a BJP friend said that I responded by saying that if Advani was arrested without reason, that I would go to his house; if Advani tried to spread restlessness without any reason, I could stop him. [Question] Problems arise if positive policies are not implemented by a government in a democracy. This leads to more violence. [Chandra Shekhar] When a government does not take positive steps, then it creates anarchy. In such a situation, there are only two options--either controlling these forces or letting the society break down. [Question] Both negative and positive aspects of the RSS emanate from its philosophy. The energy that the RSS is crating by combining religious and politics.... [Chandra Shekhar] I have nothing to do with that energy. I do not consider it energy. I do not even want to know their definition of religion, which spreads hatred and enmity toward other people. I do not know much about the RSS perspective of the world; however, the liberal viewpoint of Hinduism is one that no one has been able to duplicate. Neither the Vishwa Hindu Parishad nor the people who call themselves humanists have arrived there. I am against those people who consider themselves progressive because they negate everything that happened in our past. This is not progress; this is deception. Similarly, distorting the past for some political gain and using religion to create energy are not acts to help society; it is changing the energy to fire and burning the society in it.
