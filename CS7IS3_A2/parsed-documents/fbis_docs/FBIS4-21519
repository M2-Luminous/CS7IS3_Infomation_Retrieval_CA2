The report, commissioned by local authorities potentially in the path of the radioactive plume, says that the risk of catastrophe may be remote but the effects would be huge -- potentially at least 10 times more than Chernobyl. Sellafield's 1,400 cubic metres of heat-producing waste is kept in 21 tanks by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL). Both the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, which polices safety at Sellafield, and BNFL said yesterday they were confident that a series of fail-safe devices would prevent the kind of disaster warned of in the report. Its author is Dr. Peter Taylor, a nuclear researcher who has served on a government committee on the sea disposal of nuclear waste and advised the Department of Environment. The European Commission made available to him computer equipment on which an accident could be modelled. It showed that a major release from a single tank could require evacuation and decontamination of populations out to 1,000 kilometres (625 miles) from the site, and relocation of large numbers of people for periods up to a year. Depending on wind direction and whether it was raining (which increases contamination), between 2 million and 28 million people faced evacuation. Glasgow, Strathclyde, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and Liverpool could all be under the plume, depending on the prevailing wind. All these cities contributed to the cost of the report. Technology exists to make the tanks safer, says the report. Its cost would be about equal to the 500 million pound profits from the first 10 years of the new Thorp reprocessing plant. BNFL said in a statement that the report assumed a series of events that was unlikely in the extreme. "It appears to be nothing more than scaremongering, in order to get cheap headlines." Dr. Sam Harbison, of the nuclear inspectorate, said: "The probability of an accident is small, even if the consequences are large."
