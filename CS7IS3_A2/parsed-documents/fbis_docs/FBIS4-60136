It is well known that the reactionary and imperialist forces, with the blatant hostility they harbor for Arab unity, have put a veto on the unity of the Arab nation and any unionist achievement between any two or more Arab countries. Our contemporary history is full of recent living examples, the abortion of the union between Egypt and Syria in 1958, embodied in the Arab united republic. Reactionary and imperialist schemes were behind the collapse of this union after only three years of its foundation. These schemes have also aborted the experience of the Arab-African union between Libya and Morocco; and there they are today carrying out their scheme against Yemen's union and is held responsible for the collapse of this four-year old union.
