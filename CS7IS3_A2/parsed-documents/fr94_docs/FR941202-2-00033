SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 3, 1994 notice was published in the Federal Register (49 FR 22822) that the ARPA, in cooperation with the NMFS, intended to prepare an EIS, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), on an application for a scientific research permit to allow harassment of marine mammals and sea turtles by a low frequency sound source associated with the ATOC program in California waters, and to monitor the effects thereof. The ATOC project is a basin scale research effort to determine long-term ocean climate changes by using acoustic sound paths in the sea's deep ``sound channel'' to precisely measure average ocean temperatures. A two-year research program is proposed to be carried out to study any potential effects of the ATOC sound transmissions on marine mammals and sea turtles. Two sound sources are currently proposed; one offshore California near Point Sur (which is the subject of this Draft EIS/EIR) and the other off the north shore of Kauai, Hawaii (the subject of a separate draft EIS).
