FR940819-0-00058 FR940819-0-00017 Section 82.156(a)(2)(ii) establishes an exception to the evacuation requirements for appliances undergoing maintenance, service, or repair. The paragraph reads: If, due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the levels in Table 1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate the refrigerant being recovered, persons opening the appliance must: (A) Isolate leaking from non-leaking components wherever possible; (B) Evacuate non-leaking components to be opened to the levels specified in Table 1; and (C) Evacuate leaking components to be opened to the lowest level that can be attained without substantially contaminating the refrigerant. In no case shall this level exceed 0 psig. Through an accidental omission, the requirements in §82.156(a)(3) for evacuating appliances at disposal contain no exception for leaky appliances, although the rationale for such an exception at disposal is identical to the rationale for the exception at maintenance, service, or repair. That is, leaks in the appliance may permit air to enter the appliance as the internal pressure of the appliance is lowered, contaminating the refrigerant being recovered and making it impossible to attain the required vacuum. EPA is therefore adding an exception for leaky appliances to the evacuation requirements at disposal. This exception is identical to that at maintenance, service, and repair. 2. Use of Nitrogen to Pressurize &hyph;113 Appliances for Non-Major Repairs Section 82.156(a)(2)(B) prohibits the use of nitrogen to pressurize low-pressure appliances for non-major repairs. In including this prohibition in the rule, EPA intended to encourage the use of pressurization methods that do not require subsequent purging, such as heating of the evaporator and/or condenser. However, while heat can be safely used to pressurize appliances utilizing CFC&hyph;11 and HCFC&hyph;123 to atmospheric pressure, heat alone is not a practical or safe method for pressurizing appliances utilizing CFC&hyph;113 because the temperatures required to raise the pressure of CFC&hyph;113 to atmospheric pressure are quite high (117.6 ○F for CFC&hyph;113 vs. 74.7 ○F for CFC&hyph;11). Thus, for refrigerants with boiling points above 85 ○F, EPA is now requiring that heat be used to raise the internal pressure of the appliance as much as possible, but is permitting nitrogen to be introduced to meet the remaining pressure requirements. Contrary to popular perception, EPA has never prohibited the use of nitrogen to pressurize systems for purposes of a leak check (because leak checking does not involve ``opening'' of the appliance), although the Agency encourages the use of heat, rather than nitrogen, to pressurize systems whenever possible. Thus, it has been and remains acceptable to introduce nitrogen into an appliance utilizing CFC&hyph;113 for purposes of a leak check. EPA recommends that heat be the primary method used to raise the internal pressure of appliances containing CFC&hyph;113 as much as possible for checking leaks, and that nitrogen be introduced to meet the remaining pressure requirements. 3. Requirements for Recovery Using New Recovery Technologies In §82.158(b)(2), EPA provided for the certification of recycling and recovery equipment whose recovery efficiency cannot be tested according to the procedures in ARI 740&hyph;1993, which measure levels of evacuation. The rule states that this new equipment may be certified if an approved third-party testing organization adopts and performs a test that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the recovery efficiency of the new equipment is equal to or better than that of equipment that: (i) Is intended for use with the same type of appliance; and (ii) achieves the level of evacuation in Table 2 of the rule. As discussed in the preamble to the final rule (58 FR 28689), EPA's goal in including this provision was to avoid unnecessary delay in the certification, marketing, and use of new recovery technologies that do not operate by drawing vacuums. However, EPA inadvertently neglected to include a provision in the required practices section (82.156) that would permit the use of recovery technologies that do not operate by drawing vacuums. EPA is therefore adding a provision, §82.156(a)(2)(iii), that permits the use of equipment certified pursuant to §82.158(b)(2), as long as users of this equipment follow the manufacturer's directions for achieving the required recovery efficiencies. EPA will make the development of and compliance with such directions part of the process for certifying new recovery technologies under §82.158(b)(2). 4. Availability of Certified Recycling and Recovery Equipment to Persons Disposing of MVACs and MVAC-Like Appliances Section 82.156(b) currently requires that: All persons opening appliances except for small appliances and MVACs for maintenance, service, or repair and all persons disposing of appliances except for small appliances must have at least one piece of certified, self-contained recovery equipment available at their place of business. EPA inadvertently omitted three items from this paragraph. First, certified, self-contained recycling equipment should have been listed along with certified, self-contained recovery equipment as equipment that would meet this requirement. In all other sections of the rule, recycling and recovery equipment are treated identically, and EPA did not intend to treat them differently here. Therefore, EPA is inserting ``or recycling'' between ``recovery'' and ``equipment'' in §82.156(b). Second, persons disposing of MVACs and MVAC-like appliances should have been excluded along with persons disposing of small appliances from the requirement to have one piece of certified, self-contained recovery or recycling equipment available at their place of business. EPA clearly intended to exclude these persons from this requirement because it excludes recovery and recycling equipment used to dispose MVACs and MVAC-like equipment from third-party certification requirements. (See the final rule preamble at 58 FR 28705, §§82.158(a) and 82.158(l).) Therefore, EPA is inserting ``MVACs, or MVAC-like appliances'' after ``all persons disposing of appliances except for small appliances,'' excluding all three groups from the requirement to have certified recovery or recycling equipment available at their place of business. Third, EPA intended to exempt persons who own appliances containing pump-out units and who maintain, service, repair, or dispose of only these appliances from the above requirement. The requirement was intended to ensure that persons who used small, portable system-dependent recovery equipment to service appliances also had self-contained equipment available in the event the appliance compressor was not operational. In general, such small, self-contained recovery equipment is not prohibitively expensive, particularly if it is to be used for a large number of jobs. However, the requirement may also affect owners of chillers, which are frequently equipped with built-in pump-out units that are used for the recovery of large quantities of refrigerant. Because system compressors may be used to move the refrigerant into the pump-out unit in some cases, these units may be considered ``system-dependent'' in those cases. 5 While small self-contained recovery devices are relatively inexpensive, larger self-contained recovery devices may be prohibitively costly for persons who own and service a limited number of chillers. Moreover, instead of purchasing large recovery devices, owners of chillers may contract out the recovery procedure if the built-in unit is not capable of meeting the applicable evacuation requirements. EPA did not intend to require such owners to purchase expensive equipment when this less costly remedy exists. Thus, EPA is adding a sentence to make this exemption explicit. However, persons exempted from §82.156(b) are still required to meet the other applicable requirements of §82.156 (e.g., evacuation requirements). 5 EPA understands that in general, pump-out units on chillers are equipped with their own pumps or compressors, which are not used during the operation of the appliance. Pump-out units equipped with their own compressors would not be considered system-dependent recovery equipment. On the other hand, system receivers, which are not equipped with their own compressors, would not be considered recovery equipment at all because they are an integral part of the appliance.
