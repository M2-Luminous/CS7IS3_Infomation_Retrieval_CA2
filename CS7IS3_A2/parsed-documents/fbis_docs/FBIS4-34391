We did this with an unprecedented democratic spirit and with a turnout that far exceeded that recorded during the first round on 29 May. Voter turnout surpassed 7.3 million; that is, we registered the highest turnout in the country's history. As president of the Republic, I am moved by the fact that we fulfilled our democratic duty peacefully, and I therefore want to congratulate each and every one of the millions of Colombians who voted today to work toward a better future for this country that we love so much. First I want to congratulate the victor, who by the Colombians' decision will be president of the Republic on 7 August. I want to congratulate and express my admiration for Ernesto Samper Pizano and Jaquin [Samper's wife] and to voice my most ardent and sincere wishes that his government will be successful in the search for peace, well-being, and social justice for Colombians. As a partner in the Liberal struggles for many years and as an important member of this administration, Ernesto Samper was a victim of the blind violence that has brought so much suffering to this nation. Nevertheless, his experience strengthened his determination, and he will dedicate the second chance life granted him to advancing his ideals for a better country; a tolerant, pluralist country that respects human rights. He will create new jobs. I know these things will happen because he undoubtedly has all the qualities needed to achieve these goals. Humberto de la Calle will be a loyal partner at the vice presidency, and from there he will always contribute his intelligence, good judgment, and valuable experiences to strengthening our democracy. I also want to congratulate Andres Pastrana Arango. I owe him my thanks for his generous support for my government in difficult times. The campaign he has conducted and his human and professional capabilities have won him immense support from the citizens. Both he and his running mate, former Labor Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez, were worthy candidates for this electoral debate. I applaud the patriotic gesture by Andres Pastrana a few moments ago when he recognized the results of this election. The National Civil Registry has once again earned the applause of all Colombians. As president of the Republic, I wish to congratulate the registrar and each official of that institution. The high turnout in today's elections shows the democratic maturity of the Colombian people. There is no doubt that we have restored our faith in our potential, in our ability to face adversity, and in the fine qualities of our people. It is also a demonstration of the benefits of the ballot, of the second round as established by the Constitution, and of the spirit of democratic participation as established by the 1991 Constitution. It is a demonstration of the desire for peace of a vast majority of the Colombian people. Without a doubt, we have made progress in the construction of a better future for our children and for new generations of Colombians. Colombians; there are times in a nation's life when the courage of its people is tested. Today we have shown once again that nothing can stop this country on its road to a better future. Nothing in the world is capable of stopping the firm convictions of a united people who have confidence in their ability to take the reins of their future in their own hands. Thank you very much and good night.
