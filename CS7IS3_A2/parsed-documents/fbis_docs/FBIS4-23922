ANC sources said party secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa held a staff meeting yesterday -- the second in two weeks -- at which he spelt out the situation. Documents leaked to WEEKEND STAR show that the decision to reorganise the party's head office, which employs more than 1,000 people, was taken on Tuesday by the ANC's national working committee. The committee decided that voluntary retrenchment, at the discretion of the organisation, would be effected on July 1. Retrenchment packages of four months' salary plus an amount for each year of service would be offered. Staff who did not opt for voluntary retrenchment and were not appointed to new positions would be retrenched on October 1 with two months' salary plus an amount for each year of service. Employees at the ANC's headquarters said yesterday that they were saddened by the development. Most had hoped to be integrated into the public service. Ramaphosa would not comment yesterday. A news briefing would be organised next week to outline the reorganisation, he said.
