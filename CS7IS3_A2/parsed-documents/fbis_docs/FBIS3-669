On the line is Andrew Trench in Grahamstown. Andrew, can you confirm this? [Trench] Yes. What I've heard is that in fact it is not a coup that has taken place, but that there has been a mutiny at one Ciskei Battalion in Bisho. What people are saying is that 450 soldiers there went on strike this morning, demanding that they be paid their pensions. I've also been told that senior officers that went to negotiate with them were taken hostage and that the officers and the soldiers there are demanding that [Ciskei leader] Brigadier Gqozo come to the base and negotiate with them. [O'Donnell] So, how have the authorities been handling this? [Trench] It seems as though they have tried the negotiation route. The second in command of the CDF [Ciskei Defense Force], Commandant (Matjila), went to negotiate with the soldiers earlier, and it seems from military people that I've spoken to that he was taken hostage when he did that. The line from the Ciskei government at the moment is that they are going to attempt to carry on negotiating whth them, although I've also been told that they will, if necessary, go to the supreme court for an interdict against the strikers. [O'Donnell] Have there been any incidents? [Trench] That we do not know yet. All I've been told at the moment is, the only incident to report is that senior officers have been taken hostage and that the soldiers have armed themselves. [O'Donnell] And you'll be keeping an eye on what's going on there and you'll let us know during the program? [Trench] That's right. Some information that we've just got in now is that Brigadier Gqozo is at the base now and he is negotiating with them, we understand. [O'Donnell] Right. That's Andrew Trench.
