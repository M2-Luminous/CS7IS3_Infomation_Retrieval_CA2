FR941110-1-00027 FR941110-1-00006 General Nonattainment NSR Requirements The statutory requirements for nonattainment NSR review permitting SIPs are found at sections 172, 173 and 182&hyph;189 of the Act. It is on this basis that EPA is making its decision today. The Act requires all states to have submitted the following nonattainment NSR requirements to EPA by November 15, 1992: 1. Provisions to ensure that the construction bans imposed by EPA may be lifted by states. New Jersey had no such bans because it had an approved nonattainment NSR regulation in place. This provision, therefore, does not apply to New Jersey. 2. Provisions to assure that calculation of emissions offsets, as required by section 173(a)(1)(A) of the Act, are based on the same emissions baseline used in the demonstration of reasonable further progress. New Jersey's emissions baseline for offsets calculation is an inventory based on actual 1990 emissions. This provision meets federal requirements and is, therefore, approvable. 3. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(c)(1) of the Act, to allow offsets to be obtained in another nonattainment area, if the area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification and emissions from the other nonattainment area contribute to a NAAQS violation in the area in which the source would construct. New Jersey has chosen not to allow offsets from other nonattainment areas. This approach is more restrictive than the federal requirement and is, therefore, approvable. 4. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(c)(1) of the Act, to assure that any emissions offsets obtained in conjunction with the issuance of a permit to a new or modified source must be in effect and enforceable by the time the new or modified source commences operation. New Jersey has included a provision requiring such a demonstration from all permit applicants. However subchapter 18 does not contain definitions of ``initiation of construction or operation.'' In addition New Jersey's rule does not specify that changes to existing permits from sources which are to provide offsets must be in place by the time of permit issuance to the new or altered source. New Jersey's rule must be clarified accordingly. Therefore, these deficiencies are a basis for disapproval. 5. Provisions to assure that emissions increases from new or modified major stationary sources are offset by real reductions in actual emissions as required by section 173(c)(1) of the Act. New Jersey has defined reductions to be used as offsets as actual reductions in emissions that must be federally enforceable. This definition also applies to the use of banked emission reductions. This definition meets federal requirements and is, therefore, approvable. 6. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(c)(2) of the Act, to prevent emissions reductions otherwise required by the Act from being credited for purposes of satisfying the part D offset requirements. New Jersey has defined reductions used as offsets as reductions not otherwise required pursuant to any federal or state law, rule, order, permit, or other legal document. In addition, its definition states that emission reductions to be used as offsets cannot have been relied upon to demonstrate attainment, maintenance of reasonable further progress or of a NAAQS. This definition satisfies the requirements of the Act and is, therefore, approvable. 7. Provisions, in accordance with sections 172(c)(4) and 173(a)(1)(B) of the Act, that reflect changes in the use of growth allowances. Though New Jersey has no growth allowance program in place, it does have a program for banking emissions reductions to be used as offsets. This program incorporates pre-1990 reductions which have been incorporated into the emission inventory as future growth. This approach is consistent with the requirements for the achievement of reasonable further progress. This provision meets the requirement of section 172(c)(4) of the Act and is, therefore, approvable.
