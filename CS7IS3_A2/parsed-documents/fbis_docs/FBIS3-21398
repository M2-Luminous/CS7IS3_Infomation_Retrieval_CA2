The danger of armed fighting and bloodshed between government supporters and the opposition is increasing. Patriotic circles are very concerned about this situation. This kind of tug-of-war for power in a democratic parliamentary system is deplorable. What will be the result of all this? Professor Ghafur Ahmed, the vice chairperson of Jamaat-i Islami Pakistan, has expressed serious concern about the deteriorating political situation and the fighting in Sarhad, saying that this time, there will be no martial law, but a bloody revolution. While addressing a crowded press conference in Azad Kashmir's capital of Muzaffarabad, he said, "It is the opposition's constitutional right to introduce a no-confidence motion; however, horse-trading is not a constitutional right." Professor Ahmed warned that if, by ending the government in Sarhad, bricks from the wall of democracy are removed, then the wall would crumble and fall right on Benazir Bhutto, and democracy would be endangered. Professor Ghafur Ahmed also criticized opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, saying that the action of the opposition leader was not laudable, and that he opposes for the sake of opposing. Professor Ghafur Ahmed is considered one of the most serious and far-sighted political leaders in the nation. He warned the government and the opposition at the right time and appropriately. We cannot praise all the actions that Sahibzada Sabir Shah's government in Sarhad has done. He made some mistakes that the opposition should have identified. In a democratic parliamentary system, the purpose of the opposition is to identify the government's mistakes and suggest ways to improve the situation. Instead of following this positive democratic process, though, efforts are being made to remove Sabir Shah's government and, in order to make the no-confidence campaign against him successful, they have started horse-trading. Since the PPP has governments in the two largest states of the country and at the Center and the president also belongs to this party, it is commonly believed that Madam Benazir Bhutto is doing all this to establish her own party's government in the remaining two states.
