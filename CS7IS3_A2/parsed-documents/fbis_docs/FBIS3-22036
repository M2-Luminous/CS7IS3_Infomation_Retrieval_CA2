In spite of the fact he has turned out to be quite controversial, the presidential candidates do not dare touch that office. [Begin recording] [Liberal Party Candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano] I would reform the administrative aspect, but under no circumstances would I lessen the authority of the prosecutor as the top official for investigating crimes. [Conservative Party Candidate Andres Pastrana] The important thing is to give the Prosecutor General's Office resources so we can have true justice in Colombia. I would not modify it. If we have not been able to completely organize that office, the important thing is to provide it with the resources so we can have a real Prosecutor General's Office. We must not try to modify something that has not yet been implemented. [General Miguel Maza, National Civic Consensus] The Prosecutor General's Office needs regulations. Why not increase its coverage? It has become deadlocked in the narcotics problem and in the voluntary surrender policy. [Antonio Navarro Wolff, 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance] The prosecutor general deserves the powers he has. He is using them, albeit controversially. Nevertheless, he is undoubtedly making use of his powers, and that is good. He is a person who firmly believes in his convictions. [end recording]
