FR941102-0-00012 FR941102-0-00004 The OCC agrees with the commenters that the underwriter requirement is unnecessary. The underwriter requirement imposes additional costs on banks and limits their flexibility without necessarily improving the quality of the disclosure materials provided to investors. The final rule therefore does not require that the debt be offered and sold by an underwriter, not affiliated with the bank, as part of an underwritten offering. In addition, the OCC has determined that it is unnecessary to require that the insured depository subsidiaries of a registered bank holding company constitute at least 80% of the bank holding company's assets. This asset-based requirement does not ensure that the holding company's Exchange Act filings would be more meaningful to investors than the filings would be without the requirement. Accordingly, it has been eliminated from the final rule. Further, the final rule requires that the debt be sold in minimum denominations of $250,000, rather than more than $100,000, in order to provide additional protections to purchasers of debt. Requiring larger denomination notes, and preventing them from being broken into smaller denominations, helps ensure that the purchasers of the notes are sophisticated, high net worth individuals or entities, for whom abbreviated disclosure is appropriate. The final rule also takes into account the special circumstances of federal branches of foreign banks. Because foreign banks and their holding companies generally are not reporting companies under the Exchange Act, federal branches and agencies often would be unable to comply fully with the requirements on Exchange Act filings in the abbreviated registration system. Federal branches and agencies usually do not have securities registered under the Exchange Act and are not subsidiaries of holding companies registered under the Exchange Act. Therefore, federal branches and agencies also cannot incorporate Exchange Act filings into offering documents. Accordingly, the final rule provides that federal branches and agencies of foreign banks need not have securities registered under the Exchange Act or be subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered under the Exchange Act to take advantage of the abbreviated registration system. Instead, these entities may make information about themselves available to purchasers by filing with the OCC the information specified in SEC Rule 12g3&hyph;2(b) (17 CFR 240.12g3&hyph;2(b)) and providing purchasers with the information specified in SEC Rule 144A(d)(4)(i) (17 CFR 230.144A(d)(4)(i)). The OCC believes that this information is adequate for the sophisticated purchasers who are eligible investors under the abbreviated disclosure system. Such purchasers also are able to determine whether they have sufficient information to make informed investment decisions, and if they do not, can request additional information. Nonpublic Offerings (Section 16.7) The proposal permitted offers and sales without compliance with the registration statement and prospectus requirements of ยง16.3 if the offers and sales were made in accordance with SEC Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 through 230.508) and the purchasers were either accredited investors or ``sophisticated'' investors. SEC Regulation D sets forth rules governing the limited offer and sale of securities without registration under the Securities Act and provides a safe harbor for compliance with sections 3(b) and 4(2) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(b) and 77d(2)). SEC Regulation D does not require that in all circumstances purchasers be sophisticated.
