FR941202-0-00041 FR941202-0-00003 Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter states that PW JT8D-Std series turbofan engines installed in Boeing 727 series aircraft should be exempt from the requirements of the AD based on the absence of uncontained engine failures over the last 16 years for those engines. The FAA concurs. The FAA has determined that the risk of uncontained engine failures on PW JT8D-Std series turbofan engines installed in Boeing 727 series aircraft has been reducing as newer model engines with improved containment capability have been accumulating an increasing percentage of fleet operating hours. Based on this determination, the FAA has concluded that a mandatory requirement to install the temperature indicators on these engines cannot be justified. Therefore, this final rule has been revised to remove from the applicability PW JT8D-Std series engines. One commenter states that the repetitive inspections and associated record keeping should be incorporated into the operators' FAA-approved maintenance program. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has determined that it is necessary to keep the repetitive inspections under the AD and separate from the routine-approved maintenance program to distinguish this activity as being critical to flight safety. In addition, this AD represents an interim program until installation of the HPT containment hardware in PW JT8D&hyph;200 series turbofan engines has been accomplished in accordance with AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;10. Two commenters state that the temp tab installation requirement should be extended beyond the current 90 days. The FAA does not concur. The FAA has provided ample notice of this requirement and extension of the installation grace period will increase the probability of a No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment fire and possible shaft fracture. In addition, this 90 day grace period represents an increase from 65 days proposed in the NPRM. Two commenters state that the repetitive inspection interval should be changed from 65 hours time in service (TIS) to a longer interval or an interval based on calendar time. The FAA does not concur. Extension of this interval will increase the probability of a No. 4 and 5 compartment fire to an unacceptable level. This interval represents a maximum limit, and shorter intervals can be selected to be consistent with calendar time maintenance schedules. One commenter states that temp tabs are unreliable and are subject to oil contamination and false indications, and that the program should be delayed until a new indicating method is developed. The FAA does not concur. The temp tab configuration specified in this rule and associated PW SB represent an improved version that incorporates a sealant which is applied over the indicator and prevents oil saturation. In addition, a procedure to determine if oil saturation has occurred is included in the associated PW SB. PW has developed a more costly mechanical pop-up indicator that is resistant to oil contamination. Introduction of this indicator is currently under evaluation and it may be available as an alternate means of compliance at a future date.
