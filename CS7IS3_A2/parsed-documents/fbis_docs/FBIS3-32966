Copaz President Hector Rosada Granados has explained publicly the opposition among various sectors within the Army to include this topic in the talks; therefore, it will be left pending for a future opportunity. Deputy Clodoveo Dominguez, a retired military officer, stated this comment this morning. [Begin Domiguez recording] The Truth Commission is a commission that, if it were to be formed, should be more within the legal framework rather than a political framework. The political framework will only serve to stir things up and seek confrontation between the various political trends and sectors; thus, none of the sectors or the Guatemalan people have anything to gain from such a strong confrontation, as was seen in the past in Argentina and more recently in El Salvador. If the Truth Commission really serves to heal wounds and identify, within the framework of the law, those who in the past have harmed the country, then the commission is correct. If what is sought instead are ways to reopen wounds and cause the Guatemalan people to shed blood again, we must be very careful. [end recording]
