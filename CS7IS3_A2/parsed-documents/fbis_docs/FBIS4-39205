The parliamentary deputies who are members of Shevardnadze's party, which is called the Union of Citizens of Georgia, have come under sharp criticism from retired Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua, who has accused Shevardnadze of abusing his official position for political ends, stating that "it is immoral for someone in the leadership to create his own political force." Sigua said that he has documents which show that the head of the Georgian state apparatus is taking part in the creation of regional sections of the Union of Citizens. In response, Shevardnadze called the former premier a liar, stating that if "the protocols of the elders of the Union of Citizens confirm the apparatus' involvement in setting up regional party organizations, the head of the republic will have sufficient conscience not to enter parliament again." Meanwhile, Sigua's accusations have been borne out in part, as it is not Shevardnadze's actual signature but a facsimile which figures at the bottom of one of the December protocols of proceedings where the creation of regional party branches is indeed entrusted to the deputy head of Shevardnadze's apparatus. The head of state should be given his due -- he raised the question of setting up a parliamentary commission with extensive opposition representation which will study all the circumstances of the affair and then deliver its verdict. The decision on the makeup of the commission will be made at an emergency session of parliament. A furor is thus shaping up. The setting up of a parliamentary commission is, as Shevardnadze asserts, essential if the participation of the apparatus of the state leader in purely party affairs is not to set a precedent in Georgia for the future. One parliamentary opposition leader who enjoys great respect, the Republican Ivlian Khaindrava, has dubbed the event the "Georgian Watergate."
