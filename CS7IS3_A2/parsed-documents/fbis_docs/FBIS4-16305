He said that budget revenues were planned to reach 120.7 trillion roubles. The deficit will be 62.4 trillion roubles and the spendings will amount to 183.1 trillion. Inflation continues to be "enemy No. 1", he continued. Now it is planned to remain on the level of 10 per cent a month and will be brought down to 7 per cent by the end of the year. Budget deficit for 1994 is planned to be 8 to 9 per cent of the gross domestic product. Part of the deficit -- about 6 per cent of the gross domestic product -- will be covered with the help of credits of the Central Bank. Speaking about budget revenues, Dubinin pointed out that a dramatic increase in tax collecting can hardly be expected. Last year taxes accounted to 10 per cent of the gross domestic product for the federal budget and 14 per cent for regional budgets, while this year tax collecting is going to amount to 12 per cent of gross domestic product. The speaker stressed that tough measures against tax evaders are expected to be taken. There is one more complicated problem: In what way should the money, that came from privatization, be spent? The government is facing a difficult choice: Should it channel the privatization money to the federal budget, or should it leave it with the enterprises, so that they will be able to invest it? A final decision on that problem has not yet been taken. According to Dubinin, discussion is going on over the problem of what part of the federal budget should be channelled to subjects of the Federation. Now 22 per cent of the value added tax will be spent for that purpose. Speaking about the distribution of budget spendings, Dubinin said that 48.5 trillion roubles would be spent on defence and law-enforcement agencies, 48.1 trillion -- on state support for individual branches of the national economy, 24.5 trillion -- on assistance to the regions, 16.8 trillion -- on the federal debt servicing and 12.2 trillion -- on social programmes.
