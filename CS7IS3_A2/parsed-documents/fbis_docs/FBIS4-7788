In his interview, Mr. Gligorov speaks extensively also of the Greek embargo, pointing out that its aim is for Macedonia to accept the conditions given by Athens, which leads to identity loss of a nation and to destabilization of the region. He rejects the thesis that the Americans want Macedonian military bases to be given up to them in compensation for $1 million. He also decidedly rejects the thesis that Washington requests Macedonia to join any of the state creation that are being formed on the territory of former Yugoslavia.
