The figures indicated that the rate of growth exceeded 7 percent in the dehydrated and canned food industries and amounted to 8 percent in the paper industry. It was 11 percent in construction materials, 16 percent in tobacco and beverages, and between 3 and 5 percent in the remaining conversion industries. An official at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry & Privatization in Rabat told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that approximately 351,000 workers are now employed as permanent workers in the conversion industries, and 86,000 workers are employed in those industries on a seasonal basis. The total number of workers, which is 437,000, represents about a 3-percent increase over the total number of employed workers last year. The ministry official said that total investments in the conversion industries rose by about 14 percent to DH9 billion. He added that a worker's average rate of productivity stands now at DH103,000. The industries with the highest returns are the tobacco and beverage industries where average worker production stood at DH980,000. In the pharmaceutical, food, and chemical industries, average productivity in those industries stood at DH339,000. The ministry official said that production at the government's industrial firms now amounts to about 27 percent of total industrial production. He added that firms engaged in the production of food, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals produce about three-quarters of the total output produced by the government's industrial firms. The ministry official [also] said that the value of industrial exports rose by 4 percent to about DH29 billion. That is equal to about 63 percent of industrial imports. He said that the most important export industries were the chemical and pharmaceutical industries (24 percent of the total), the textile industry (23 percent), and the food processing industry (19 percent). The ministry official added that the number of exporting firms stands at 1,600, a figure which represents about 28 percent of the total number of industrial firms.

Investment by foreign capital in the conversion industries amounts to about 15 percent of total investment in those industries. The value added to conversion industries stands at about DH36 billion. That is about 15 percent of the total domestic added value.
