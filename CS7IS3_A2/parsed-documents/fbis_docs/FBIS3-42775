At that time, the parable was interpreted absolutely unequivocally: During 40 years of wandering in the sands, the last Hebrew born in Egyptian bondage was to give his soul back to God. So also over the decades we were directed to squeeze "homo sovieticus," or simply "sovok" (Soviet man) out of ourselves drop by drop, destroying everything old that was keenly reminiscent of the long spiritual bondage. Some ill-natured minds, of course, preferred the interpretation of Moses' wanderings given by A. Dulles, the first American intelligence officer. According to the CIA man, it turned out that after 40 years of swallowing sand, it was not so much the former slaves who were supposed to die out as much as the untalented Hebrew chiefs who dared to place in doubt even the recommendations of the Lord God. But this kind of interpretation already personified the blame too much for the well-known failure, to which an end has not been put to this day, instead of spreading it on the sorrowful plate of our "irresponsible and ignorant" people. And here another biblical wisdom came in time. That which advises to begin "gathering stones" after a rout. The time, it is said, has come. Well, then, is this the end of crossing the desert? Proletarians, remaining kolkhozniks, emerging farmers, eternally dissatisfied intellectuals, and devouring new bourgeois, unite! But what is the question about? Is it really about the paschal table? Thus, the question of creating a new state ideology of Russia has assumed considerable significance. In fact, there was talk about an ideological vacuum a year to a year and a half ago, when a happy toast addressed to brother Balts "To your freedom and ours!" unexpectedly turned into a bitter and humiliating hangover for millions of Russians, who by the will of fate ended up outside the borders of Mother Russia. But the delayed attempts at least verbally to protect emigrants willy-nilly (even with references to the rich "democratic" American experience in this regard) ran into a torrent of accusations of imperial ambitions, although after the crash of the indestructible Union, Russia by definition could not become an empire. Oil was also poured onto the fire by the continuous discussions about the impending collapse of Russia itself, which was doomed, it was said, to repeat the Union's road to Calvary. The best minds even warned against early elections which, it was said, the former autonomies would repudiate after sanctioning the de facto decay of the great Russian body. As if it were possible to put off the elections indefinitely, at the same time preserving the appearance of representative democracy. They cannot be avoided... Just what happened recently that served as a catalyst of the process of fermentation in the Kremlin think tank? As a classic would write it, here is what happened during this time: Winter came. The winter of the introduction of a new state constitution, parliamentary elections, with their reassessment of many values that had become usual for a couple of years, and a noticeable distancing of the president from former historical allies (it is another matter that history itself is moving). The breakthrough of "the master in all languages," V.V.Zh., once again demonstrated that a state not protected by its own pragmatic ideology is in fact defenseless against the virus of radicalism and ultrainfections. But phrases of the type "we are not promising miracles" are not at all suitable for the state banner. A natural need has arisen to define the role of the Russian state more clearly, without restricting oneself to the abstract slogan "Less State," and its duty to the citizens and responsibility for the future of the nation, that is to say, to put together a complete state structure from the traditional blocks. And, apparently, it is at this stage that the split occurred, which far more logically than arguments on the new residence of parliament explain the hasty departure of Gaydar into the domain of the Duma. It seems that two concepts have collided, neither of which is without genetic defects. However, here is more detail about everything... The supporters of the new state ideology (conditionally speaking, a "Kremlin" ideology) prefer to call it centrist. The plan of the state structure is a Russia that is united and indivisible. In economics--restoration of the traditional elements of "controllability" that reinforce the role of state regulation. In policy--intensification of authoritarian trends combined with charitable trends on the scale of Russia (read the new constitution). In the sphere of relations with CIS countries--a period of "collection" that is expressed in a strengthening of the attachment of the former Soviet republics to Russia. Monetary union with Belarus--the first but important step. In international policy--something in the nature of the French "quiet strength," ensuring Russian influence and respect for its interests in areas of traditional Russian influence, in the final analysis also sanctioned by the world community. The symbols of this kind of approach are both continuation of the construction of the super-cruiser Peter the Great and the recent announcements of Andrey Kozyrev. And, naturally, the idea of the creation of a presidential party contemplated, apparently, for a "long" rule even under conditions of a permanent election game. Something like the Italian Christian-Democrats or the Japanese Liberal Democrats. Naturally, their epochs comprise many years of prosperity. Many first persons of the state who are not noted, as they say, for extremism will embody the new concept--V. Shumeyko, V. Chernomyrdin, O. Soskovets, evidently A. Kozyrev, many prominent presidential advisers...and, in the final analysis, the president himself. Other figures who until recently were considered filed away in the political archives are also possible. It is not for nothing that the names Abalkin and Shcherbakov, former minister of finance of the Union, which were partially forgotten for the last year and a half, surfaced once again in the last few days. Of course, the traditional reliance on strengthening the state comes into direct conflict with a number of already implanted liberal principles, but in the new context liberalism in the economy, evidently, will be preferable to political liberalism. It is not accidental that a high-standing Russian delegation headed by Minister Kozyrev is studying the experience of free economic zones in China this very week, a system that Gaydar apriori considered unacceptable for the new Russia. But this is one point of view. Another was expressed once again last Saturday by Yegor Gaydar, who stressed his adherence to the idea of an inexpensive state apparatus with a limited sphere of interference, patterning of foreign policy based on Russia's real capabilities (live within one's means), and guaranteeing the interests of the citizens. Gaydar's program is also logical in its way, but it is, perhaps, the same as when abstract logic runs up against state traditions and the national mentality. It is more likely that Gaydar' model would be suitable for Norway in an ideal way. Meanwhile, the de facto elimination of Russia's status as a world power threatens it with quite specific economic losses, not to mention the loss of many strategically important markets, including the armaments market as well. It is known that frequently arms are acquired from the country whose influence and support are counted on. And this is only one aspect of the problem. In a word, there are no ideal ideological systems. Especially in the changing conditions of the breakup. But it is obvious that Gaydar's departure is not a consequence of a private quarrel concerning monetary union with Belarus. And it is strange that the leader of Russia's Choice still only indirectly hints at his deepening differences with the Kremlin. Nonetheless, it will all come out in the open. What is most difficult of all, of course, is to determine unequivocally those who are right and those who are to blame in the emerging dispute on ways of ideologically forming the Russian state. The more so because not only did Zhirinovskiy succeed in the elections but it would seem that the classic statesmen from the Civic Union suffered defeat. Not one of the disputing sides can now manifestly refer to the voice of the people, who are far more concerned about prosaic and everyday problems. With the exception, perhaps, of the defense of their own national dignity. It is the lever that they use more and more frequently. It is clear, for example, that the Philippine authorities could not permit the arrest of two American generals even for the sake of forcing the departure of the military Yankees, as was recently done in Latvia with our generals. And any government will have to react equally to such challenges. Even the most incurable liberals. A year to a year and a half remain to make adjustments in emphasis, but the favorite at the next presidential elections will be precisely the bearer of a state ideology. Not so much one who is blatant like V.V.Zh., but one who inspires respect for the average Russian citizen. Especially in the provinces. Will this be Yeltsin himself?
