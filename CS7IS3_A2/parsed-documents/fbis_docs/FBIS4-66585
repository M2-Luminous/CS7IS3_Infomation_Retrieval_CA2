In particular, the project fails to make good use of the inductees, assigning them to locations unbefitting their specialties. It is also deceptive and superficial and the graduates who run it lack conviction. A whole government agency was created to administer the project. A High Commission for Public Service under the chairmanship of the minister of social affairs has been formed of the undersecretaries of the Ministries of Planning and Local Administration, as well as of representatives of the Central Agency for Mobilization, the Supreme Council on Youths, and other agencies concerned with Community Service and with implementing Public Service Law in the districts and governorates. Because Public Service is considered a "prerequisite" for employment, graduates view it as a year to waste for no purpose except to secure another job credential. Even though there have been calls to improve the project or abolish it altogether, and even though proposals have been submitted to that effect, nothing has changed and the project continues to exact funds and costs with no tangible benefit. We solicited opinions from a group of female graduates who have been required to perform Public Service. Suha Muwafi, BA in English Literature, said that "the newspapers reported that Public Service applications were being accepted for a limited period of time. I reported to the Public Service Bureau in my bailiwick where I was given an identity card and referred to their main office. I encountered several problems of red tape before I was assigned to a charitable health clinic. Such work, of course, does not fit in with my qualifications but, what can you do?" She added that based on her experience, the year of public service should be considered as a year out of work. "I neither benefit my place of work nor do I benefit by it. It is my view that the system should be amended in order to match the assignment to the college major." Ghadah Muhammad 'Ali, a College of Commerce graduate, who said that she was assigned to work at a cooperative society, described being in the service as a very difficult period and called for an amendment to the law that would help realize the purpose of the plan. Muna Sayyid Muhammad, BS, advocated termination of "this system which lacks any redeeming value." 'Afaf Yusif, BA in history, pointed out that she was taken by surprise after she was drafted when her period of service was extended an extra month because she never reported to the Public Service Bureau to collect her remuneration of four pounds. Her failure to do so meant an extra month of service. 'Ubayr Hamdi, a law school graduate, demanded that the plan be rendered voluntary and not compulsory. She said that she secured an exemption from public service because it would have meant the loss of a suitable job opportunity at an attractive salary. Suhayr Husayn, a 1993 Commerce graduate, added that she has no desire to do public service work because her friends have told her many stories that discourage any such inclination. She said that she would seek an exemption, which she heard could be obtained by submitting a request to the Ministry of Social Affairs. The ministry no longer makes things difficult and readily agrees to grant exemptions in order to save the funds it pays female graduates for going into service. She called for abrogating the project. No Discernible Value 'Alya' 'Abd-al-Mun'im, BA, said that her service at a cooperative society was incompatible with her degree. She believes that the service has no discernible value and merely delays female graduates from realizing their aspirations. Classmate Wafa' Mustafa, with a degree in literature, added that people in service do not get paid enough to cover their cost of transportation to their places of work, and public service therefore imposes an additional financial burden on women graduates, who must pledge in writing not to accept other employment when in public service. Hanan Radwan, BA in Arabic literature, said that she was performing public service at a charitable health facility, even though the assignment is a hardship on her family. She is married and has a child that must be looked after. Serving at a charitable clinic means working a night shift that sometimes extends to midnight, making it difficult for her to perform her maternal duties. She added that she did not wish to perform public service, but had to because she would be required to produce service or exemption documentation before she can secure employment. She said that exemptions could be secured through patronage, which she lacked, and consequently could not obtain the release. Useful Projects Graduate Usamah Zuwayl advocates that the year of public service be spent on useful endeavors such as assigning a graduate to reclaim a tract of desert land which he or she would then get to own for a reasonable price. Amal Fu'ad, a commerce graduate, said she was frustrated by mistreatment and repeated insults and threats by those in charge of the service who insisted that she do all the work. Manal Hasan, BA in cooperative agribusiness sciences, believes that the existing public service system is a failure and pointed out that she gained no benefit or skill from her assignment, even though she is nearing the end of her term. She calls for amending the system and abolishing the prohibition on employment during the period of service, since it pays very little and is not considered a real job. She suggested that the skills of inductees be utilized in a manner that would increase productivity and therefore raise their income. Dearth of Planning Thurayya Fahim, a public service specialist, believes that public service inductees are considered to be from the ranks of the unemployed and those to whom they are assigned sometimes refuse to allow them work. The solution would be for the female graduate to show up merely to sign in and no more. This reflects a lack of seriousness and control and the absence of necessary planning and coordination. Inductees are often assigned to locations teaming with employees without regard for major or field of study. Patriotic Duty Dr. Ahmad 'Umar Hashim is vice chancellor of al-Azhar University and chairman of the People's Assembly's Religious Committee--one of the committees that debated the public service issue. He believes that "public service is required of every citizen, be he an employed youth or otherwise, since it is a patriotic duty. The Service should focus, in my opinion, on the fields of health, public safety, social work, and rural development. These, as well as the eradication of illiteracy, are areas where public service could play an important role, provided that they are fruitful and of benefit to society." When we asked for comments on the manner in which public service is being implemented, Mr. Sayyid 'Abd-al-Hadi, director of the Public Service Administration at the Ministry of Social Affairs, first requested the permission of ministry officials then begged off after those officials refused to allow him to talk. The question we now pose to Dr. Amal 'Uthman, minister of insurance and social affairs, is why all this secrecy about ministry operations, which are for the most part social in nature? Experts with specialized national councils point at a number of negatives and impediments that surfaced with the field implementation of public service. Most significant among those is that local public service committees in the governorates are not serious enough and therefore are not implementing the plan with the required integrity. In most cases, the authorities do not control the inductees, making them carry out their assignments with due diligence and, thereby, properly utilizing their energies and contributions. Then there is the problem of over-induction in certain governorates, but not in those most in need. Cairo, Alexandria, and al-Jizah governorates account for nearly 60 percent of all inductees, but this ratio drops to 3.2 percent in al-Minya, 2.3 percent in Asyut, and 1.2 percent in Suhaj[this one is correct, I know that this has been spelled a million ways, but go with this one], which is one of the most densely populated governorates of Upper Egypt. Isma'iliyah governorate accounts for only 0.8 percent of, Suez for 0.6 percent, and Matruh for 0.1 percent. Experts point a finger at the lack of funds to remunerate inductees and issue them incentives, at insufficient allocations for athletic and social activities, and at inadequate appropriations for training and for incentives to Public Service Administration workers. Public service agencies also suffer from not having defined their needs of inductees, forcing them to mete out assignments without previous planning. The result is that some inductees complain of being assigned to units where they have no real work. Certain public service units complain of the overabundance of assigned inductees, while others suffer from dearth. Evaluating the System The public service issue was studied by two commissions--one organized in 1978 by the Central Agency for Organization and Administration, and the other formed of the Committee for Social and Religious Affairs and Endowments and the bureaus of People's Assembly committees for Youth, Defense, National Security, National Mobilization, and Labor Force. Their purpose was to evaluate the Public Service system and identify the problems that prevent it from realizing its objectives. They set out to do that by evaluating the most important aspects of the Public Service system, such as those dealing with drafting and qualifying graduates, with working conditions at their places of assignment, their remuneration, and other matters relevant to identifying the extent to which units have need for, and benefit by, the inductees assigned to them. Those studies, which included some field trips to the governorates of al-Minufiyah, Isma'iliyah, and Port Said, concluded that the Public Service System, as it now stands, is in need of improvement and enhancement. Experts with specialized national councils proposed a link between the Public Service System and the placement of surplus graduates on the basis of their level of education. That would help utilize those with intermediate and higher education in areas and spheres that match their disciplines or in fields where society needs more workers than it can attract, such as police work, nursing, and teaching. The majority of inductees would be assigned to help in the eradication of illiteracy within the framework of a comprehensive national illiteracy eradication strategy that would be implemented over a specific period of time in cooperation with the Ministry of Education. The Failure to Eradicate Illiteracy Ms. 'Inayat al-Fiqi, director of the Ministry of Education's General Administration for Adult Education and the Eradication of Illiteracy, spoke about the role of Public Service inductees in eradicating illiteracy, one which many believe could be fruitful. She said that Public Service inductees are accused of having a lack of seriousness about their work and of a lack of adequate commitment. "Consequently, we now exclude Public Service inductees from our illiteracy eradication programs. We used to seek their help in the past but that proved to be futile." The Wrong Method Dr. Sawsan 'Uthman, dean of the Social Services Institute in Shubra, believes that the methodology of the Public Service draft is faulty and accomplishes no positive results. She proposed that public service "target once every year a specific national goal, much as China did for the eradication of illiteracy and Cuba did about the sugar crop. Public Service performance should be characterized as being diligent, and controls should be instituted to guarantee that goal. We find that 40 percent of public service inductees are exempted [from service] by the Minister of Social Affairs. Another 40 percent register on paper only. Those who actually go to work and produce account for no more than 10 percent." Dr. 'Ali-al-Din Muhammad, the Institute's assistant dean, emphasized that planning is important, in order to identify those with more need for inductees and to ensure that the latter "are assigned in accordance with their fields of study because the current method of assignment simply turns them into idle capacity."
