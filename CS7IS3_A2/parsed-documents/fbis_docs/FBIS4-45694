A. Aybulatov, doctor of geographical sciences, RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Institute of Oceanology, under rubric "Ecology": "Radioactive Burial Grounds in the Kara Sea"] [Text] During recent decades the radioactivity of the seas has increased noticeably. The major reasons are nuclear weapons tests, the dumping of radioactive waste by nuclear plants (including the accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in the United States and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine) and plants that process nuclear fuel, as well as accidents on ships and aircraft with nuclear power units or nuclear weapons, and the burial of radioactive waste in the marine environment. A situation that currently is especially alarming is the radioactive pollution of the Barents and Kara seas, which wash the northern shores of our country. What is the scope of this pollution and what caused it? International Dumping The substantial radioactive pollution in the ocean is created by the dumping of radioactive waste directly into the water itself or on the bottom. Radioactive waste has been dumped in 50 places in the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean (dumping at sea began in 1946 and was not stopped by an international moratorium until 1983). According to estimates made by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the total radioactivity of the seas is 46 PBq, or 1.24 MCi -- one PBq (pentabecquerel) = 1 x 10[.sup]15[/] Bq = 27,000 Ci (curies). The total list of radioactive dumpings includes certain unpackaged dumps and liquid runoffs, which were widespread at sea as early as the 1950's-1960's. Of this list, 98 percent represent _g_- and _b_-radiating isotopes. We might note that the IAEA estimates do not take into consideration the dumping at sea that was carried out by the former USSR. Radioactive materials (not considering the USSR dumpings) were widespread in four oceans of the earth: 0.55 PBq are produced by waste products that were concentrated in 16 places in the northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and near the western shore of North America; 2.94 PBq, in 11 places in the northwest Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico; 42.31 PBq, in 15 places in the northeast Atlantic; and 0.002 PBq, in five places in the western part of the Pacific Ocean, near Japan and New Zealand. The largest share of the dumping of radioactive waste at sea belongs to Great Britain. In the North Atlantic that share constitutes 77.5 percent of the total amount of dumped waste. The radioactive "contribution" made by that country to the marine environment is 35 PBq. Dumping by Switzerland constitutes 10 percent of the total dumping; United States, 7.6 percent; Belgium, 4.6 percent; France, 0.8 percent;Netherlands, 0.7 percent; Japan, 0.03 percent; Sweden, 0.01 percent; New Zealand, 0.002 percent; and Germany, 0.0004 percent. Dumping of Radioactive Waste in the Kara Sea The leadership of the former USSR used to assert that our country's enterprises did not dump radioactive waste at sea, and, if such dumping of radioactive waste did occur, it was without the knowledge of the authorities and was a violation of the law. But in response to demands to release information about dumping operations, they never gave any official answers, or, in any case, no reports ever appeared in the press. However, thanks to the efforts of the public, as well as materials that were collected by nuclear physicist A. A. Zolotkov, a worker in the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Agency and former deputy to the USSR Supreme Soviet, it became known that in the USSR the dumping of radioactive waste in the Kara Sea had been carried out for more than 20 years (1964-1986). In the 1980's A. A. Zolotkov prepared a map showing the location of radioactive graveyards in the Kara Sea, while stating that that map was by no means complete. In late 1991 V. Ya. Stadnyuk, chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union Committee on Questions of Security, made two inquiries concerning the burial of radioactive waste --at the USSR Ministry of the Maritime Fleet and personally to the commander in chief of the USSR Navy. The answers to the inquiries were stupefying -- A. A. Zolotkov's unofficial research was completely confirmed. In response to the first inquiry, it was reported from Minmorflot [Ministry of the Maritime Fleet] that the burials of radioactive waste at sea (during the operation, repair, and modernization of nuclear-powered ships in the Murmansk Steamship Agency) were carried out from 1963 through 1986 in accordance with a decision made by the USSR Government. Special authorizations for this purpose were also given by the 3rd Main Administration of USSR Minzdrav [Ministry of Health), and, starting in 1971, the Medical Service of the Red Banner Northern Fleet (the government entrusted it with the task of monitoring the burial of radioactive waste in the arctic seas. The burials occurred in the following regions: liquid radioactive waste, in the area of the Barents Sea with coordinates from 74� to 78� north latitude and from 48� to 52� east longitude; solid radioactive waste, in areas of the Kara Sea (Zaliv Techeniya, Tsivolki, Abrosimova, Stepovogo, Oga, Blagopoluchiya, Sedova, as well as the deep-water area of the Novaya Zemlya Depression). For each area and each burial, the Medical Service of the KSF [Red Banner Northern Fleet established the maximum quantity of radioactive waste with regard to volume and total activity. The bulk of the waste that was buried during that period, according to USSR Minmorflot information, was in the category of weakly active radioactive waste. An exception was the burial of the first nuclear unit of the "Lenin" icebreaker, which was carried out in accordance with a special decree of the USSR Council of Ministers. Key: Areas where solid radioactive waste was submerged in the Kara Sea. 1 - Novaya Zemlya Depression -- 1450 containers with radioactive waste, barge with malfunctioning nuclear reactor (170,000 Ci), transport barge for carrying liquid radioactive waste; 2 - Zaliv Neupokoyeva -- radioactive waste with a total activity of 3400 Ci; 3 - Zaliv Tsivolki -- 4750 containers, "Nikolay Bauman" transport barge, central compartment of "Lenin" icebreaker with three malfunctioning reactors and screen assembly; 4 - Zaliv Olga -- 850 containers; 5 - Zaliv Stepovogo -- 1850 containers and malfunctioning nuclear submarine (two reactors with fuel that had not been unloaded); 6 - Zaliv Abrosimova -- 550 containers and compartments of four malfunctioning submarines; 7 - Zaliv Blagopoluchiya -- 650 containers; 8 - Zaliv Techeniy -- malfunctioning reactor (without nuclear fuel), total activity 1856 Ci; 9 - 400 containers; 10 - 250 containers; 11 -proposed location of regional radioactive waste graveyard; 12 - area where it is proposed to carry out an extensive long-term nuclear testing program.</graphic> The following were buried in Zaliv Tsivolki (near Novaya Zemlya) in 1967: -- an assembly of the first nuclear unit of the "Lenin" icebreaker, consisting of three reactors without nuclear fuel, with hermetically sealed standard equipment and biological protection that was mothballed in the assembly (steel with a thickness of 300 mm, concrete). The reliability and safety of the storage are estimated to be a period of no less than 500 years; -- cutout screen of one of the reactors with remnants of used fuel, which had been previously joined with a hardening mixture and mothballed in a reinforced-concrete container in a metal sheathing. Reliability and safety of the storage are estimated to be a period of no less than 500 years. In conformity with instructions from USSR Goskomgidromet [State Committee for Hydrometeorology], the burial of radioactive waste in the Barents and Kara seas was subsequently discontinued (burial of liquid waste in 1984, and solid in 1986). Detailed reports concerning all radioactive waste burials that were executed by the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Agency, with an indication of the quantity of waste products, their total activity, and the coordinates of the burial areas, are sent annually to the Medical Service of the Red Banner Northern Fleet. In response to V. Ya. Stadnyuk's second inquiry concerning the burial of radioactive waste, it was reported from the Navy that A. A. Zolotkov's information was not complete, and it should be augmented by the burials of radioactive waste in the Pacific Ocean. The preparation of a complete register of radioactive materials that had been buried by the former USSR Navy was completed in December 1991. However, the new Russian leaders at least until November 1992 failed to submit, despite their obligation, that register to the London Convention on Dumping. The international London Convention had been signed by the government of the former Union in January 1976, and it stipulates the taking into consideration of the IAEA recommendations when making decisions about the possibility of dumping radioactive waste. USSR Council of Ministers decree (March 1979), entitled "Measures to Guarantee the Execution of the Pledges Taken By the Soviet Side, Which Evolve From the 1972 Convention on Preventing the Pollution of the Sea By Dumping of Waste and Other Materials" made USSR Goskomgidromet responsible for issuing special and general authorizations for dumping. (The statutes in the Convention do not apply to Navy ships, according to an explanation from MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs].) In June 1983 rules were coordinated for dumping radioactive waste into the sea, with limitations concerning their activity, packaging, and disposal areas (it was not until 1985 that a Consultative Conference of the countries participating in the Convention adopted a resolution concerning a temporary moratorium on the burial of radioactive waste in the seas and oceans). Within the framework of the Russo-Norwegian commission for cooperation in the area of protecting the environment, in 1992 a group of experts on the radioactive pollution of the Barents and Kara seas was created. In the summer of that year the first joint Russo-Norwegian expedition to the Kara and Barents seas occurred, with the direct participation of Roskomgidromet [RF Service on Hydrometeorlogy and Environmental Control]. By providing false information to the London Convention, the Russian leaders violated international agreements on the disposal of nuclear waste at sea. Every opportunity to carry out an independent evaluation of the present-day situation with regard to radioactive burials was blocked. For example, all expeditions by the RAN Institute of Oceanology to the Barents and Kara seas in 1980-1990 that stipulated research in the disposal areas of nuclear waste were meticulously banned by the directive agencies. This is also attested to by the cruise on the "Solo" diesel ship, that belongs to the Greenpeace international organization, which had been given authorization to enter those areas after it had been towed to Murmansk... Total Activity of Radioactive Waste in the Kara Sea As was already mentioned, detailed reports on all the buried radioactive waste from objects in the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Agency were sent to the KSF Medical Service. Evidently one can also find there data concerning burials of radioactive waste that were carried out by the USSR Navy. By using that data it should be possible to make a fairly accurate estimate of the radioactivity (in PBq) in the Kara Sea. However, independent experts are not even allowed to obtain that data. Realizing this, certain researchers make their own estimates of the radioactive pollution, and forecast the behavior of the radioactive waste in the marine environment of the Kara Sea. A similar attempt, on assignment from Greenpeace, was made by the English nuclear physicist G. Large, who worked for 20 years at industrial nuclear sites. That researcher is well known as an excellent specialist in the dumping of radioactive waste in the seas and on nuclear technology. Usually it is no simple matter to estimate the total radioactive "inventory" of the reactors in submarines (radioactive equipment and fuel). The fact of the matter is that the radioactivity of the fuel is defined by the degree of irradiation and the enrichment of the fuel with uranium (U-235). By comparing American navy reactors with Soviet ones, G. Large provided an approximate estimate of the reactor fuel fillers and radioactive waste that are located in the Kara Sea. Under the pressure of public opinion, Russian President B. N. Yeltsin in October 1992 issued an edict concerning the creation of a special commission (under the leadership of A. V. Yablokov), which was given the responsibility of establishing precisely and officially providing the London Convention on Dumping with materials concerning the burials of radioactive waste in the seas of Russia, including the Kara Sea. The commission included representatives of organizations that had taken part in the burials. Unfortunately, the list of organizations that had participated in the work did not include the Russian Academy of Sciences, so that, once again, there arise doubts relative to the objectivity and completeness of the information that was submitted. Now, when the commission has completed its work, A. V. Yablokov, adviser to the RF president on questions of ecology and the protection of health, and corresponding member of the RAN, has submitted the latest White Book, entitled "Facts and Problems Linked With the Burial of Radioactive Waste in the Seas That Wash the Territory of the Russian Federation." In that document it is stated that, in the North and the Far East, burials of liquid radioactive waste were carried out in five areas of the Barents Sea and nine areas of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, and the open part of the Pacific Ocean; and solid radioactive waste in eight areas near the coast of Novaya Zemlya and in the Kara Sea, and four areas in the Far East. In 1959-1992 the total amount of liquid radioactive waste that was dumped into the northern seas, according to the commission's data, had a total activity of approximate 315 TBq (one TBq --tetrabecquerel = 1 x 10[.sup]12[/] Bq); and solid, a total activity (according to expert estimates as of the moment of burial) of approximately 590 TBq. In the Far East seas these values were, respectively, 12,300 and 6200 Ci. The items that represent potential danger first of all are the reactors of nuclear submarines and the nuclear "Lenin" icebreaker (total buried, 12 reactors and their parts without nuclear fuel, including three in the Far East) and seven in the malfunctioning state with nuclear fuel not unloaded (all in the north). The materials cited in the White Book will, of course, be submitted to the Secretariat of the London Convention and IAEA. Sources of Radioactive Pollution There arises the question of the further fate of the radioactive waste in the Kara Sea. Judging by the official answers from Minmorflot, the packaging of the radioactive waste is designed for a sufficiently long period of time, estimated at 500 years. But what will happen then? There is another disturbing fact: a large number of burials lie on the bottom of bays, at a shallow depth (up to 20 meters). In those places, according to data available to the author of this article, there is a rather intensive movement of fragmental material, as a result of which the packaging of the waste products corrodes and its thickness is reduced. This circumstance obliges oceanologists to insist on the carrying out within the near future of a careful study of the Kara graveyards with manned underwater apparatuses. According to our information, in 1993 it is planned to conduct research in radioactive waste disposal areas, in particular, in Zaliv Abrosimova, Zaliv Stepovogo, and Zaliv Tsivolki, as well as in the open part of the sea at location 72�48' north latitude, 58�18' east longitude. The total quantity of radioactive substances in the waters of the Kara Sea is the result primarily of tests of nuclear bombs in the atmosphere and under water, which were carried out on Novaya Zemlya since 1956, and the penetration of radionuclides through cracks in the rocks during underground tests of nuclear weapons on Novaya Zemlya after the banning of tests in the atmosphere an in the sea. Radionuclides were detected during the first landing on the southern island by a Greenpeace group in October 1990. On the slope of a mountain close to an old mine shaft they found at least three "hot spots" with considerable radioactivity (more than 50 Bq/cm[.sup]2[/] with an overall background of approximately 12-15 Bq/cm[.sup]2[/]. The "hot spots" were located 400 meters from the shaft, and two kilometers from it the instrument readings fell to 1.6-1.8 Bq/cm[.sup]2[/]. The high radiation in the shaft area, and the existence of "hot spots" there, indicate that products from underground tests have gotten into the atmosphere. Another source of radionuclides in the Kara Sea is the disposals of waste products by the radiochemical plant in Windscale (England). The maximum concentration of [.sup]90[/] Sr in the waters entering the Barents Sea exceeds the global level by approximately a factor of 2. The time for carrying the radionuclides into the southwestern part of the Kara Sea, according to data provided by research in the expedition on the "Otto Shmidt" ship (1982) is 6.2 years. The outflows of the Ob River serve as another, so far unevaluated, source of the radioactive pollution of the Kara Sea. They will have to be ascertained in future expeditions, including those of the RAN Institute of Oceanology. As a result it is necessary, unfortunately, to assert that the former USSR violated the major requirements of the IAEA that pertain to the dumping of radioactive waste in the seas and that prescribe the burial of radioactive waste beyond the limits of the shelf (no closer than 200 miles from the shore) at a depth of no less than 4000 meters and only in the band of latitudes from 50� north latitude to 50� south latitude. There continue to be violations of the Russian Federation Law "Protection of the Environment" (December 1991). All the research studies of the radiation situation after 1967 were conducted in the waters located 50-100 km from the burial areas of solid radioactive waste. In those waste burial areas themselves, no monitoring of the radiation situation was carried out throughout a 25-year period, and the system of monitoring did not begin to be created until 1992. The items that represent the greatest potential radioecological danger are the reactors of nuclear submarines that were dumped in the shallow bays of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Kara Sea, and the screen assembly of the "Lenin" nuclear icebreaker with nuclear fuel that had not been unloaded. What steps, then, should be undertaken to assure that the radioactive pollution does not intensify in the Kara Sea? In our opinion, it is necessary first of all to carry out the expensive and dangerous operation of raising the solid radioactive waste and burying it in special storage facilities on land.
