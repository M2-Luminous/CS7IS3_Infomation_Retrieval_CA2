It is only the second time in the history of the Czechoslovak state and the first time during the existence of the independent Czech state that a president of the United States has payed us a visit. Although this visit has above all a political content, according to Friday's statement by a senior White House official, it will play an important part in the negotiations in the capital of the Czech Republic [CR] and in improving the access of Eastern European countries to Western markets. Although the President is not bringing any concrete proposals, and understands that this is a problem for which there are no easy answers, he wants to contribute to its solution. The basic document which regulates economic relations between CR and the United States is the 1990 Agreement on Trade Relations, which gives CR a favored nation status. In 1991 the U.S. Government also accorded CSFR the preferential customs system which applies to developing countries, and which was extended for CR until 30 September 1994. Mutual relations are also regulated by, among other things, the Agreement on Support and Protection of Investments of 1991 and the Agreement for Preventing Double Taxation (ratified on 23 December 1993). Trade between CR and the United States shows a considerable dynamic, our newspaper was told in this connection by the director of the Department for OECD countries of the CR Ministry of Industry and Trade, Petr Postulka. In 1992 trade turnover grew by 176 percent, and reached a volume of $684 million. At the same time, however, the trade deficit on the Czech side climbed to $375 million. This happened because the imports ($529 million) included the purchase of aircraft for the Czechoslovak Airlines. Overall, United States is in the 10th place among the CR trade partners. In the first 11 months of 1993, the share of the United States in our foreign trade reached 2.4 percent. Exports to the United States amount to 1.8 percent of CR exports and U.S. exports to CR amount to 2.9 percent of CR imports. The deficit in the mutual balance of trade from January to November 1993 reached $137 million of the total trade turnover of $522 million. If we disregard the one-time impact of the purchase of the aircraft in 1992, it appears that the CR deficit still continues to increase, said Petr Postulka. In the structure of Czech exports to the United States the largest share is that of textiles (about 18 percent), glass (13 percent), and rolled steel (9.5 percent). According to Postulka, it would be helpful to the Czech economy if machine tools played a bigger part on the U.S. market, since consumer goods will have to face an increasingly stronger competition, especially from the developing countries. More than a quarter of the imports to CR consists of computer technology, followed by electrical conductors (7 percent), and telecommunication equipment (6 percent). CR therefore imports high technology goods which serve to modernize the Czech economy and strengthen its competitiveness. The regulations for protecting the Czech market are liberal, but the access of Czech goods to the U.S. market is in some cases encumbered by high tariffs (for example, footware, glass). On the other hand, for the time being Czech exporters can use the system of general customs preferences for some commodities. U.S. quotas are basically sufficient for them, and there is even the question whether, for example, the newly established quota for 800 tons of cheese will be fully used up this year, said director Postulka. Apart from cheese, United States sets quotas only for the import of woolen piece goods and ready-made clothing. The agreement on voluntary restriction of the export of steel from CSFR has not been renewed after its expiration on 31 March 1992.
