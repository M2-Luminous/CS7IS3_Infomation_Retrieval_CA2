But over a period of just seven years, GATT rapidly made the descent from the realm of arcane international diplomacy, to the domain of popular demonology. From being the preserve of the stodgy bureaucrat, GATT became in quick time, the demagogue's dream. But the time for fantasies ran out on December 15. After blowing hot and cold for seven years, with the principals now engaging one another in negotiations, then breaking off in acrimony--117 nations acceded on that day to an omnibus agreement that will govern international trade into the foreseeable future. The final accord was pushed through merely because the major players of the world trade game--the United States, the European Union and Japan, principally--knew they could not afford the costs of failure. India, as one of the developing countries which are sought in vain to establish a position in GATT, came out of it with little to celebrate. A very qualified victory came its way with the commitment by contracting parties to phase out quotas on textile exports within 10 years. India also managed to fight off a last-breath offensive by the European Union and the United States, to open up its markets in textiles to foreign manufacturers. That battle was won with a well-argued case and neatly-constructed logic--attributes that have over the current round of GATT talks won the Indian negotiators high marks. But the joint European Union-U.S. offensive was perhaps in the nature of a diversionary manoeuvre. Having beaten back this attack, India signed on the dotted line without demur--its concerns over the long-term consequences of the deal temporarily outweighed by relief over a short-term victory. Within India, preparations for accession to GATT had proceeded inconspicuously, but with an unmistakable sense of purpose. Parliament was in session as the deadline approached. And this proved an unavoidable irritant for the Government. Though the Government is accorded the unfettered right to accede to any international treaty, it perhaps imagined that some concessions to parliamentary sentiment would be prudent. As soon as Parliament got down to transacting business in the current session, a debate on the GATT talks was scheduled. Expectedly, Opposition members traversed ground that had already been well covered, holding forth on the dangers to the country's sovereignty implicit in the GATT treaty. And in an all-too-familiar litany, the Government responded with its own perceptions--affirming that on balance the Dunkel Draft Text of the GATT treaty promised a net gain to the country. Following this, the report of the Standing Committee of Parliament attached to the Ministry of Commerce was tabled. In an exhaustive document which counselled extreme caution upon the Government in accepting certain of the Dunkel proposals, the sections that gained publicity were dictated by convenience. The Standing Committee had refrained, considering the constitutional position, from insisting on any kind of a parliamentary right to vet the GATT treaty before the Government took a decision on accesion. The constitutional position in this regard is fairly clear--the conclusion of international treaties is an executive privilege. Parliament has the right of scrutiny, but no power of veto or sanction. Secondly, the Standing Committee had observed that on balance India would be better served by remaining within the multilateral framework of rules that GATT imposed. In a package so elaborate, it was inevitable that there would be elements not quite to the liking of the country. But withdrawal from the GATT forum would make the country especially vulnerable to political arm-twisting. The U.S. proclivity to extract some political concession in return for granting a partner country the Most Favoured Nation (MNF) status in trade deals could take a heavy toll of the country's room for autonomous action. Remaining within GATT ensured at least that the MFN status was granted automatically, as matter of right. If these were all that the Standing Committee had said, then the Government would have been on a safe wicket in authorising the Indian negotiators at GATT to appeal their signatures to the deal. But as soon as word had gone out that the Government had given its assent, Parliament broke out in a storm of outrage. In the ensuing babble, the one phrase that came through with some clarity was that the Government had "sold the country out." Eager to limit the damage, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee made an appearance in Parliament, stoically reading out a prepared statement through the din of Opposition voices. The Government had made certain commitments to Parliament and the people, he said. And these had all been met. There was no going back on any of the assurances that the Government had held out in relation to the GATT talks, he claimed. Though India's gains were not unequivocal, there was no gainsaying that on balance the country stood to improve its foreign trade on account of the new framework of GATT rules. A few concessions had been made in certain areas to ensure concord and cordiality in the multilateral trading system. This was no more than the normal give-and-take of international negotiations. The Minister's words failed to carry much conviction. The provisions of the Dunkel Text are far-reaching and wide. The areas in which the country has serious apprehensions--which yet remain undispelled--are many. To say that the country can afford to yield ground on issues like patents in return for major concessions in the area of agriculture, would seem to beg the question, as long as the gains in the latter sphere remain uncertain and unquantified. The consensus on the Dunkel provisions on agriculture appears to be that it will not radically hurt Indian price-support operations. Member-nations of GATT are expected to make an estimate of the aggregate measure of support (AMS) given to agriculture--roughly speaking, the AMS would be equivalent to the subsidy component as a proportion of the total value of output. AMS to the extent of 10 per cent is permissible under GATT rules. However, the developed market economies are bound by very different compulsions. They are committed under the GATT rules only to reducing their export subsidies by a certain figure--typically around 20 per cent. Concurrently, the quantum of subsidised exports is to be cut by 36 per cent. This still leaves the core of the issue of agricultural protectionism unresolved. And even if India should hope to gain a share in the world market for agricultural products, it should be disabused by the stringent sanitary and phyto-sanitary norms imposed under the new GATT deal. Pretending that all is well does not help in evolving survival strategies to cope with the regime of draconian trade controls that the latest GATT treaty imposes. There is little gainsaying that the concerns expressed by various responsible commentators in the areas of patents in particular, are of sufficient moment to warrant serious consideration. And it is also a fact that GATT is a loose treaty, which provides ample room for fudging. Where the Government is involved in an elaborate pretence that all is well, there is little likelihood of this room for manoeuvre being exploited. Witnesses before the Select Committee on the Dunkel Text had put forth a series of suggestions on how the Government could evade some of its most draconian provisions. For one thing, the patent regime envisaged seeks to reverse the burden of proof, putting on the defendant the onus of proving that he has not violated a patent. This reverses one of the fundamental tenets of Indian jurisprudence, which puts the burden of proof on the plaintiff rather than the defendant. Under the Dunkel Text, a product would be assumed to be made by a patented process, unless proven otherwise. This is the sense in which the "product by process patent" of the Dunkel Text marks a drastic shift from the concept of "process patent" which is a fundamental tenet of the Indian Patents Act. Certain witnesses appearing before the Select Committee observed that if amendments to the Indian patents law were to be made in line with this requirement, the result would be repugnant to notions of natural justice. Some of them suggested that suitable countervailing provisions be built into the Evidence Act to check possible abuses of the legal system using the reversal of the burden of proof. This would minimise abuses, and put the brakes on disruptive litigation. Another requirement of the Dunkel Text, that importation of a product into a country be deemed equivalent to the working of a patent, has understandably created much disquiet. Under the Indian Patents Act the public authority is empowered to sanction the "compulsory licensing" of production in the case of patents that fail to be worked. The Dunkel Text renders the circumstances which warrant resort to the compulsory licensing provision so restrictive as to virtually do away with this as an element of public policy. Concerns have been expressed that without the goad of compulsory licensing, patent-holders will capitalise on the monopolies that the law confers on them. And in matters of vital public interest, as for instance in the drugs and pharmaceuticals industry, the implications could be disastrous--unaffordable drugs for the mass of consumers, and immense private profiteering at the cost of the social good. The solution put forward by various witnesses before the Select Committee was that the Monopolies Act should be strengthened to deal with such eventualities. This would introduce a major qualification to the unfettered right of importation enshrined by the Dunkel Text. And while seeming to accede to most provisions of the new treaty, India could build up sufficient safeguards through sections of the law that are not directly covered by the GATT discipline. These are strategies of survival that could dilute the thrust of the GATT offensive. At a certain stage it is obvious the stratagems will be seen through. But GATT is a loose treaty which is observed more often in the breach. According to recent estimates, no more than half of the total world trade is covered by the provisions enshrined in GATT, and India's dependence on MFN trade is also of a similar magnitude. GATT provides a certain degree of latitude to most participant countries. Some like India have been using this latitude with great discretion. Others like the United States have been brazen in their resort to quantitative import restrictions and coercive trade diplomacy--all in violation of GATT norms. The hyperbole about a new dawn for multilateral trade needs to be viewed against the actual context of the U.S. behaviour over the last two decades or so. When the United States began to lose its manufacturing edge, it was the first to impose voluntary export restraints (VERs) on competitors such as Japan. These restrictions came thick and fast, starting in sectors such as steel, and going on later to automobiles and semiconductors. As the largest market in the world, the United States was at liberty to frame its own rules. And where other countries refused to play by these rules, it could resort to the kind of coercive diplomacy implicit in provisions such as Super 301 and Special 301 of its Trade Act. The basic structural features of the world economy which contributed to the U.S. economic woes of the 1980s, remain unmitigated. To expect GATT to serve as a panacea is unrealistic, especially when the counterpart agreement on services trade remains an ambiguous entity. The Dunkel Text adds a significant number of new weapons to the U.S.' trade armoury. But the United States is likely to be obliged at some stage to step beyond the ambit of the Dunkel Text, to force its will upon recalcitrant trading partners. Former Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey put it very well in the course of his deposition before the Select Committee. Asked about the future of multilateralism, he answered that the concept was always something of a myth. What is emerging in the current world scenario, he suggested, is "a hotchpotch of a highly qualified multilateralism, discriminatory regionalism, and arbitrary bilateralism." Far from benefiting from this kind of a shrewd reading, the official Indian response seems so far to be mired in a variety of wishful thinking--as with the official prognostication that the gains to India from accession to GATT would be of the order of $2 billion. That the figure is no more than a fantasy hatched by some fevered brain in the Government became apparent when Pranab Mukherjee proved unable to defend it at his first press conference since the GATT deal was signed. Shortly afterwards, Mukherjee flew out to Brussels to initial a trade protocol, under which India stands to gain certain special concessions in the European market. Official spokesmen were initially very unclear about the advantages the agreement conferred on India. Some said, unconvincingly, that the protocol would give India MFN status, forgetting that accession to GATT conferred this status as a matter of routine. Others said the protocol would help India expand its trade with the European Union under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)--which is a special concession granted on a bilateral basis. To mitigate the rigours of the new rules, India perhaps needs itself to take recourse to the kind of "discriminatory regionalism" and "arbitrary bilateralism" that fetched the United States rich dividends in the GATT talks. India has so far been at the receiving end. Its survival as a viable trading nation and economy will now depend upon whether it is able to give as well as it gets.
