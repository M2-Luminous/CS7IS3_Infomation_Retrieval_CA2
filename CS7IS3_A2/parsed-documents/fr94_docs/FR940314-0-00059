Combined mailings of second-class publications must be documented under E238. 6.4␣Segmentation, Labeling Documentation must be segmented and labeled by qualification tier (e.g., presort and residual).

Under either option, data must be presented as shown in 6.7 and 6.8. 6.5␣Type of Package Option If the report is segmented by type of package, for each type, individual entries for each destination must be ordered sequentially by ZIP Code: by 5-digit ZIP Code for 5-digit packages; by lowest assigned 5-digit ZIP Code for city packages (second-class only); by 3-digit ZIP Code for 3-digit packages and First-Class residual mail prepared under 5.4; and, for AADC packages and AADC groups (in working trays) under 5.2 and 5.3, by the applicable 3-digit AADC code in L803 (for automated site mailings) or L804 (AADC entries must be preceded by ``AADC''). 6.6␣Sequential List Option If the report is a sequential list, individual entries for each destination must be ordered sequentially by ZIP Code within each tier, regardless of package type: by 5-digit ZIP Code for 5-digit packages; by lowest assigned 5-digit ZIP Code for city packages (second-class only); by 3-digit ZIP Code for 3-digit packages and First-Class residual mail prepared under 5.4; and, for AADC packages and AADC groups (in working trays) under 5.2 and 5.3, by the applicable 3-digit AADC code in L803 (for automated site mailings) or L804. AADC entries must be preceded by the prefix ``AADC.'' For second-class only, listings for 5-digit, city, and 3-digit packages must be preceded by the prefixes 5DG, CTY, and 3DG, respectively. * * * * * M814␣Barcoded_Tray-Based Mailings 1.0␣Basic Standards * * * * * 1.2␣Grouping [Add the following at the end of this section:] c. For pieces for the same AADC area in working trays under 3.2. * * * * * 1.4␣Packaging Separator cards are permitted only under 3.4. Packaging is required: a. For mailings consisting entirely of pieces that qualify by size for First-Class card rates, regardless of the actual rate claimed or class of mail. Package labels are required in less-than-full trays. b. For mail in overflow AADC trays, in mixed-AADC trays, and in a less-than-full working tray. Appropriate package labels are required. 1.5␣No Packaging Packaging may not be used for larger than card-size pieces, except that: * * * * * [Delete current 1.5c and replace with the following:] c. Mail in AADC trays may be packaged and mail in mixed-AADC trays must be packaged into AADC packages. d.

Residual second- or third-class mail must be prepared under 3.2. Residual First-Class Mail must be prepared under 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4, except that preparation may be finer than those standards, by agreement between the mailer and the entry post office for multiple acceptance times. All residual mail must be presented under 3.5. 3.2␣AADC Sortation Prepare residual pieces as follows: a. All pieces must be sorted by AADC area using L804. b. Quantities of 10 or more pieces for an AADC area must be prepared as an AADC package (or, if possible, a full AADC tray). Packaging is not required in full AADC trays. AADC packages of fewer than 10 pieces are not permitted.
