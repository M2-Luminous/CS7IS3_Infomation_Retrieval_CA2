Children have gathered there together with their parents from Russia's various regions, primarily from the Russian hinterlands. The reputation of the Ust-Izhora oblast hospital is already quite high, and not only in medical circles. Sufficient experience and professional skills of center employees are magnified here by their rare good will and responsiveness to each patient. The high level of laboratory diagnostics, modern treatment procedures augmented by total anonymity of treatment--all this is very important for the parents who are trying to protect their children from today's and tomorrow's psychological traumas. The work of this unique children's center became possible due to the assistance of labor leaders from the Norwegian city of Tronheim.
