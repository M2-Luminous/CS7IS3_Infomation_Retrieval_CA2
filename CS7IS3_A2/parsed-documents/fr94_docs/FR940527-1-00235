FR940527-1-00235 FR940527-1-00014 CHAPTER 1 THE FUTURE OF HOSPITALS Hospitals_the central institutions in the American health care system_have long been the sole source of technology-oriented acute health care for the most complex cases. But because the capabilities of technology were limited, until the last 20 years or so one hospital was much like another. Each provided its community with essentially the same range of services and was structured in a similar manner. This is no longer the case. Changes in medical science and technology and the financing of services have required hospitals to become very different entities. Today, hospitals offer a rich mix of complex, intensive services to a variety of patients. Relationships among hospitals, other institutional providers, and payers have become more complex as well, incorporating jointly produced services and financial risk sharing. The role of physicians in hospitals' operations has also evolved. Because of the wider range of services, patients, and institutional arrangements, hospitals are now a much more diverse group of medical care facilities, with as many differences as similarities. The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC), created in 1983 by the legislation that established the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services, advises the Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on policies affecting payment for Medicare services in hospitals and other institutional settings. It is thus appropriate that the Commission look at changes that have affected hospitals in recent years and how hospitals have responded. This chapter does just that, providing a context for the recommendations in Chapter 2 on changes to Medicare payment policy. The chapter concludes by examining what lies ahead for hospitals, as government and private payers attempt to curb health care spending and as comprehensive health reform is debated by the Congress. Several major factors have influenced how hospitals have evolved. The continuous introduction of new technological capabilities has led to increases in the intensity of inpatient services for the acutely ill. These advances have also allowed services formerly provided only to hospital inpatients to be furnished in ambulatory settings. Consequently, new providers have entered the health care market, competing with hospitals for clients. Changes in financing, limitations by insurers on using specific services, and increased competition have contributed to unprecedented declines in inpatient hospital utilization. In 1992, for instance, there were 5.5 million fewer hospital admissions than in 1982, despite a 10 percent population increase. The average length of a hospital stay also fell to 6.4 days from 7.2 days, even though the average case was more complex. Total health care expenditures, however, have continued to rise at a dramatic rate, consuming 14 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 1992. As a result, payers have been pressed to reevaluate their cost-based and charge-based payment practices and to find ways to reduce their financial risk. Hospitals have responded to the marked declines in inpatient service use and constrained payments from public and private payers by actively seeking new sources of revenue. They have expanded their capacity to furnish ambulatory surgery and other outpatient services and developed specialized units to provide inpatient psychiatric, rehabilitation, and subacute nursing care. In addition, many have begun to offer home health and various community-based services. Others have concentrated on eliminating unprofitable cost centers or turned to more revenue-enhancing activities. Some, for instance, have become specialized facilities like psychiatric or rehabilitation hospitals, while in rural areas, some small hospitals have eliminated inpatient beds and become outpatient centers. Over time, hospitals have modified their relationships with insurers, other providers, and physicians and have attempted to curb expenses to strengthen their market position. The configuration of the hospital represents a complex interaction between financing, organizing, and providing specific services in a local environment. Recently, for example, insurers and other payers have strengthened efforts to reduce payments to hospitals and other providers, and implemented utilization control activities. These financial pressures have forced hospitals to assume more risk than was the case under charge-based or cost-based reimbursement. Additionally, hospitals have had to take a closer look at whether to add new technologies and services. Although for the past decade hospitals have been a major target of government cost control_primarily through Medicare and Medicaid payment policy_spending for the services they provide almost tripled between 1980 and 1991, from $102 billion to $289 billion. Total health care expenditures, however, have risen even more rapidly. Consequently, policy makers are currently debating how to reform the health care system to rein in the growth of public and private spending, while also expanding coverage to the nearly 39 million Americans who are uninsured. Even if reform is gradual and not comprehensive, hospitals will be pressured to reduce costs and generate new revenues by expanding service capacity. If comprehensive reform is enacted, the fundamental relationships among payers, physicians, and other types of providers may change markedly. The evolution of individual hospital swill depend heavily on how health reform affects each facility's local market, patient population, payer mix, and regulatory environment. Factors Affecting how Hospitals Have Evolved The health care environment has undergone radical changes over the past two decades and is on the threshold of even greater ones. Two major forces_advances in medical technology and financing mechanisms_have profoundly influenced hospitals. Technological innovations have expanded the services hospitals furnish and led to increased competition from other providers. Until recently, a steady stream of revenues from third-party cost-based and charge-based payers financed these innovations. Increasingly, as payment policies have changed hospitals have used higher payments from some payers to cover losses created by lower payments from others. This has allowed the continued expansion of services even as certain payers have attempted to limit expenditures. Technological Advances Recent technological advances affecting the hospital industry range from the development of new pharmaceutical and surgical instruments to expensive diagnostic equipment like magnetic resonance imaging devices (MRIs). During the 1970s and early 1980s, hospitals were quick to adopt new technologies even when clinical indications for their appropriate use were still largely unstudied.1 Computerized tomography (CT) scanners are illustrative. This technology first appeared in 1973; by 1985, almost all community hospitals with more than 300 beds had a CT unit, even though purchase prices averaged about $500,000.2 Similarly, in 1981, 14.8 percent of hospitals had cardiac catheterization capacity; by 1992, this had risen to 27.6 percent (see Table 1&hyph;1). Hospitals have also increased their magnetic resonance imaging, megavolt radiation therapy, and open-heart surgery capabilities since the beginning of the 1980s. Because it was so costly, most state-of-the-art equipment traditionally was purchased only by hospitals. But new technological developments, along with advances in medical expertise, have expanded the ability of outpatient providers to offer services in competing sites. The number of ambulatory surgery centers, for example, mushroomed from 239 in 1983 to 1,556 in 1991.3 Technological developments not only have allowed hospitals and other providers to offer a broader array of services, but also have enabled more people and conditions to be treated. The expanded volume that accompanies both new and existing technologies contributes more to the rise in health care expenditures than does the cost of the technological devices, themselves. Consequently, if frequently used, even relatively inexpensive innovations can contribute substantially to health care spending. As the supply of technology extends beyond hospitals and the demand for these services increases, utilization may grow more rapidly, thus driving up health care expenditures.
