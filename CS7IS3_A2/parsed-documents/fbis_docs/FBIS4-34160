He said that in his opinion the history of the Latin American countries has been marked by conflicts that have regrettably affected the continent's relationships. Arancibia said: "This has become a sort of culture which we are trying to modify with these meetings designed to make our relationship more feasible, pleasant, and attractive." Yesterday Arancibia presided over the inauguration of the second meeting of the Chile-Peru working group. This is a preliminary meeting to the IX Round of Talks between the Chilean and Peruvian Armed Forces High Commands scheduled to be held at the end of the month in Lima. The meeting started at 0900 in hall No. 7 of the Diego Portales building and was attended by two special commissions: the Peruvian commission headed by Army Colonel Mario Lucero Welblund and the Chilean commission led by Air Force Colonel Nelson Sanhueza Lagos. Vice Adm. Arancibia added that during these preliminary meetings the specific subjects to be discussed during each joint meeting of the chiefs of staff of the various Armed Forces' branches will be chosen. Arancibia said: "During the past nine years we have made progress regarding a series of measures that have allowed a rapproachment and allowed us to establish greater and closer relations of mutual confidence." Arancibia said that this rapproachment has resulted in exchanges, among other things, in the welfare field as well as of books edited by the armed institutions of the two countries. He added that contacts have been established at the border sector chief level and this has made it possible to effectively tackle and solve problems that have appeared in that area. The working sessions between the representatives of the chiefs of staff of the Chilean and Peruvian Armed Forces lasted all day yesterday.
