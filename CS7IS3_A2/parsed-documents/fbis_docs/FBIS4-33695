The organization calls on the Senate of the Republic to rigorously apply the Constitution to its maximum against Jean-Bertrand Aristide, accusing him of having asked, on several occasions, for the occupation of his own country by a foreign Army. The Capois-La-Mort Organization demands the government set in motion public action against the president-in-exile, guilty, according to the organization, of high treason and complicity with the enemy. The National Christian Democratic Party, PDCH, reasserts its opposition to the physical return of President Aristide to Haiti and expresses indignation about the latest statements by the priest/president. PDCH calls those statements murderous. PDCH of the late Sylvio Claude, led by Joachin Pierre, asks the concerned institutions, especially the Haitian parliament, to assume their responsibilities lest the institutions be questioned in the court of history.
