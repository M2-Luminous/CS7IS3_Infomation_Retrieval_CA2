At 10:00, Friday, he is expected to sign the agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European Union in St. George Church in the island of Corfu. Russia's Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told Interfax that the agreement was ready for signing. In the evening June 23, after the final coordination of the text printed in the 10 languages of the signatory states, this document will be initialled by the leaders of the delegations involved in the talks. Deputy Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Georgiy Gabunia announced that the package of the agreement-related documents consisted of about 100 pages, including the joint declaration and exchange letters. He also said that according to the agreement, the European Union would not consider Russia to be a country with a state-controlled trade system, but a state with a transitional economy. The Ministry's leading expert Maksim Medvedkov told Interfax that the agreement had been drafted during intensive talks which continued for two years. He also said that serious problems had been caused by the European Union's reluctance to ease the access of Russian goods to its markets, and by disagreements over Russia's uranium exports and the procedure of the European Union banks' work in Russia. "These problems have been solved on the whole," he said. IF Note: The draft agreement provides for the mutual observance of the basic GATT principles with a few exceptions reserved for the nuclear materials on which a separate agreement will be concluded in 1997. As to the European Union's banks, according to the reached compromise, the five banks which have been granted the permit to deal with Russian residents, but which have not used this right given the Russian president's decree on limiting foreign banks' operations (November 1993), shall have their rights restored. The rest of the banks will carry out limited operations during a lengthy transitional period. For instance, the maximum share of foreign capital in the Russian banking system will be limited to 12 percent. The number of foreign banks' branches will also be limited. Medvedkov said that the agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European Union set forth the terms for the Russian economy's gradual integration with the European economic system. It envisages a gradual implementation of the principles of freedom of trade, services and the movement of capital, and of the establishment and operation of companies. The most favored nation status will be granted on a mutual basis. IF Note: The European Union is Russia's biggest economic partner. It accounts for 35 percent of Russia's trade turnover with foreign countries and 36 percent of the Russian exports.
