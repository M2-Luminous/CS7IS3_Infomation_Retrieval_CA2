Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a briefing that a Russian delegation is leaving soon for North Korea to discuss a new agreement on timber processing in Khabarovsk and Amur regions as the latest one expired in 1993. "The Russian side believes that the most important article of the new document should become the provision, according to which the rights of citizens of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea working in Russia should correspond to Russian legislation and international norms", he said. Russian press reports said that the rights of North Korean workers are being rudely violated by their authorities. "If no agreement (on human rights) is reached Russia will consider itself free from the rights and obligations fixed in the earlier agreement", Demurin stressed. He also informed that Russian-North Korean talks at the level of deputy foreign ministers began in Moscow on Thursday. "The sides plan to consider the whole complex of bilateral relations and international problems", according to Demurin. He explained that this includes political and economic relations, key aspects of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, including the nuclear non-proliferation problems and the Russian proposal to convene an international conference on security and nuclear-free status of Korea.
