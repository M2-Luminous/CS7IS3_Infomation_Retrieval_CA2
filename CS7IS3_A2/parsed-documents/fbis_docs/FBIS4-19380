The targets chosen by thousands of rampaging demonstrators chanting religious and nationalist slogans and demonstrating a clear inclination to go out of hand, if a convergence of certain events took place, merely added to the importance of trying to understand what had happened and what may follow in its wake. In Ankara the main targets were the United Nations building--which was pelted with rocks and forced to take down its flag to appease the crowds--the U.S. embassy--whose grounds were entered and windows smashed--and the Russian trade mission which was also showered with rocks. These were attacked alongside "domestic targets" such as the state owned Turkish Radio and Television's (TRT) building, and the headquarters of the ruling True Path Party (DYP) with both also having their windows smashed. Apart from the attacks on the TRT, the privately owned media was also showered with abuse and its reporters and cameramen jostled and kicked. At one point during the demonstration in Ankara there was also serious concern that the crowd might also turn against the Parliament grounds, which are in the same vicinity of all the other targets attacked. All of these targets were significant and indicative of the ultimate political inclination of those partaking in the demonstrations and who and what they stood opposed to when the chips are down. These demonstrators were not only attacking one of Turkey's closest allies, together with an international institution which, for all its shortcomings, Turkey continues to be a staunch supporter of. At moments it appeared that they would also turn against the key institutions of what is integral to Turkey's secular and pluralist system. The fact that the demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul were attended by thousands of people carrying religious banners and shouting angrily with fists in the air had automatically increased the explosive nature of the situation at hand. Officials were saying later that while everything ended with just a few smashed windows this was not due to the police but in fact a matter of luck. Especially when the police in both Ankara and Istanbul were clearly taken by surprise, totally outnumbered and in effect unable to control the crowd numbering thousands up to 10,000 in Ankara and 20,000 in Istanbul. The sigh of relief among officials later was also coloured by the fact that the Marines in the U.S. embassy compound, a part of which had been overrun by the demonstrators, did not make any move that would have sparked off something which would be extremely difficult to control and clear up later. In fact the speed with which the Turkish public later got news of the NATO airstrikes against Serbian targets in Gorazde suggested close cooperation between the U.S. and Turkey in order to diffuse the situation. Giving the news before CNN and all the other international agencies TRT said in its 8.00 pm bulletin that the information had come from Turkish military sources who in turn were quoting NATO sources. Given that the planes in the operation against the Serb targets were U.S. the assumption in Ankara was that this quick transfer of information was the product of the two sides working to ensure things did not get out of hand in Turkey especially vis a vis the U.S. embassy and other western targets. The mood in the Turkish Foreign Ministry following these events was inevitably gloomy given that developments and images carrying overtones of Iran in 1979 had gone out of the two main cities of Turkey whose pride and joy is its secular system. Trying to play down in Western capitals the RP's [Welfare Party] success, Sunday's developments were precisely the kind of thing that Ankara has been keen to avoid. What the crowds in Ankara and Istanbul, as well as other cities around Turkey, were incensed at was reports that Bosnian Serbs had entered Gorazde which they had been bombing since March 29. Rumour was spread that the Serbs were using chemical weapons and killing of thousands of Bosnian Moslems as they progressed into Gorazde. When the news of this was disseminated in a provoking manner by two private TV channels, and when officials--including Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and State Minister and Government Spokesman Yildirim Aktuna gave statements suggesting the information was true--the crowd could not be contained, believing as it did that thousands of their Bosnian brethren were being mercilessly slaughtered at that very moment. Charged with the fervour of the gains by the RP and the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) in the local election, the crowd--mostly supporters of these parties--turned their ire to "the Christian West, which refuses to act while Moslems are being slaughtered," and it institutions, such as the U.N. as well as its extensions in Turkey such as the TRT and the DYP. Most analysts believe that this whole incident has proved to be "an excellent object lesson" to government officials in Turkey about when to speak and when not to speak on occasions that touch on public sensitivities. It was noteworthy that while Ciller and Aktuna appeared to be "playing to the gallery," that foreign minister Hikmet Cetin was indicating there was no evidence that chemical weapons had been used, that he had checked this, not just with U.N. and NATO sources, by also the Bosnian Prime Minister in Sarajevo which is only 65 kilometers from Gorazde. The bottom line was that while tension reached fever pitch as these rumors were being spread neither Ciller nor Aktuna had bothered to check with the foreign ministry as to what the situation really was in Gorazde. Ciller's critics say that having turned her visit to Sarajevo in February, together with the Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, into political capital prior to the local elections, she is still captivated by the issue which makes her give statements that are not absolutely sound. But there is also a message here for Bosnian Muslim officials whose attempt at drawing attention to atrocities by introducing unconfirmed elements into their account of events--in order to add a heightened sense of urgency--has clearly been seen to be explosive in Turkey's case. Given the heightened sensitivities in Turkey following the self-confidence gained by the pro-Islamic and ultranationalists after their electoral gains this element in Turkish society is seeking missionary outlets to vent its new found strength. Bosnia has proved itself to be an important galvanizing factor in this case, making it incumbent not just on Turkish officials, but also Bosnian officials to act cautiously and responsibly in volatile circumstances such as the one surrounding Gorazde. The presence of an official from the Bosnian Embassy trying to calm the angry crowds down in Ankara as they tried to storm the U.S. Embassy appeared to demonstrate that even the Bosnians were disturbed by the "political Frankenstein" that had been released into the streets of Turkey. The main message of what transpired in Istanbul and Ankara, as well as other cities in the country, on Sunday is of course to the key countries in the West. These events have signalled the extent to which the Islamic masses around the world are being pushed to taking a specific view of the West, and all that is associated with it, because of what appears to be Western indifference to the slaughter of Moslems in places such as Bosnia-Herzegovina. If the U.N. and the main countries in the Security Council had acted decisively days before against the Serbs when they first attacked Gorazde, which is supposedly a U.N. safe haven, the chances are Sunday's scenes from around Turkey would not have taken place. This lack of overall determination to say a definite stop to the Serbs is today sowing the seeds for hundreds of thousands of Mujahedeen. If these ever "hit the streets" charged as they will with an irrepressible feeling of vengeance, then the West is going to suffer as much as countries like Turkey--whatever its broader plans and calculations may be.
