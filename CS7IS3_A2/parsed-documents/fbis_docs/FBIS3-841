Tomorrow's maiden session is expected to examine the impact of the devaluation of the CFA franc on the economies of members. Many observers believe that by deciding in July 1992 in Dakar, Senegal, to transform the West African Monetary Union, UMOA, into UEMOA, the heads of the member states demonstrated their determination to consolidate their monetary union against the background of an international economic environment unfavorable to the continent. The head of state was accompanied on the trip by several cabinet members, including the ministers of finance, commerce, mines and energy, as well as the secretary of state for cooperation.
