"Taking part in the work of the Russian parliament's upper house, I managed to meet with Russian head of government Viktor Chernomyrdin and other leaders of the Russian Federation", Galazov told TASS on returning from Moscow. "We considered some pressing issues aiming to assist the republic in solving social and economic problems", he reported. Commenting on the meeting of the Russian Government presidium, which discussed the situation in the zone under state of emergency rule in the light of the presidential decree extending the state of emergency for another two months, the North Ossetian president said "the Russian president's decree was been approved but with considerable reservations. A deputies' group was set up to gather objective information on the spot... I submitted to the Russian Government our proposals as for how achieve a peaceful settlement in relations between North Ossetia and Ingushetia. These proposals had been approved by the republic's multi-national people. The Ossetian side is ready to work for improving relations with all neighbouring countries. But we must not use force on this way towards peace. Force engenders only force", Galazov stressed. The North Ossetian leader flatly rejected the idea by the Ingush side of imposing a special rule on the Prigorodniy District as the sole possible way to overcome the current crisis. Galazov qualified the idea as a gross interference into North Ossetia's internal affairs. "The problem of refugees' return should be solved not with military help of federal authorities, but on the basis of Kislovodsk accords", he said referring to the agreements on a complex solution to the problem of refugees and forced migrants in Ingushetia and North Ossetia, which were reached by the Russian, Ingush and North Ossetian delegations in the North Caucasian town of Kislovodsk last March. "Of the greatest importance here are conciliation commissions now working in each locality of the Prigorodniy District", Galazov emphasised. The situation in the zone under state of emergency rule, which has been extended for another two months, remains relatively calm, TASS was told at the North Ossetian Security Council. Military sources confirmed that no conflicts on ethnic grounds had been registered there. Russian peacekeeping forces and local law-enforcement bodies are in control of the situation.
