Station commentator Valeriy Surikov writes as follows: The DPRK's announcement of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in March 1993 rapidly deteriorated relations between Pyongyang and the IAEA. Since then, Pyongyang has not completely permitted the international inspection of the nuclear sites suspected of nuclear weapons development. The DPRK is expected to replace fuel rods in one of its nuclear reactors early in May and had requested the IAEA to dispatch its experts to watch the process. However, the IAEA did not accede to the request. The IAEA notes that if it is not allowed to analyze the radioactive waste, watching the process of fuel rod replacement will not produce a desired effect. With the analysis of the radioactive waste, the IAEA can assess if the North is developing nuclear weapons, they say. Thus, a new conflict broke out between Pyongyang and the IAEA. Pyongyang informed the IAEA that it would replace the fuel rods of the reactor without the participation of the international inspectors. In the meantime, the IAEA warned Pyongyang that it is prepared to resolve the nuclear issue by the convocation of a special meeting of the UN Security Council. It is not unpredictable where such a conflict will lead. The United Nations can apply economic sanctions against the DPRK. The United States and the ROK have long demanded such sanctions. However, there still is a chance to resolve the issue through diplomatic efforts. All the countries concerned should continue their efforts for the adoption of a reasonable decision. It should not be forgotten that the tactic of talk, rather than the tactic of pressure, is more desirable.
