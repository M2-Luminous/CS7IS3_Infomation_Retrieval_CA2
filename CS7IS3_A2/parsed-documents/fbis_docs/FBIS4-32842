According to Argentine officials, the map was published in black and white "without showing the colored areas and without the explanatory notes of the original, thus making a serious mistake in its interpretation." In a communique, the Foreign Ministry assures that the map published with the report was taken "from a chart in the `Atlas of Chilean History,' by Osvaldo Silva, published by Editorial Universitaria in 1992." The communique says: "The original clearly shows areas on the map as Argentine territory assigned to Chile. These are the territories that were `stripped' from Chile as of 1563 until the end of the 19th century when new viceregal jurisdictions and border treaties were implemented." It makes clear: "The original map entails no claim by Chile to any current Argentine territory." The Foreign Ministry emphasizes that "there is no border dispute" between the two countries, and that of the 24 pending border issues that remained unresolved until 1991, "22 were settled through a bilateral agreement that was signed that year." The two remaining issues, Laguna del Desierto and the continental glacier zone, are being considered by the two Congresses.
