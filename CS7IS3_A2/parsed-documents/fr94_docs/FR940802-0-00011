ACTION: Correction to final regulations. SUMMARY: This document corrects the list of subjects included in the final regulations that were published on June 30, 1994, [59 FR 33641&hyph;33643]. The regulations contain updated references to the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)'' book of methods. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Paula M. Cohen, Director, Regulations Development, Policy, Evaluation and Planning Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;3700, (202) 720&hyph;7164. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 30, 1994, the Food Safety and Inspection Service published a final rule updating references to the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)'' book of methods in various sections of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations. The list of subjects of the final rule stated that part 325 of the Federal meat inspection regulations contained a reference to the AOAC book of methods and that the reference was updated. This is not correct. Accordingly, the list of subjects included with the final regulations published on June 30, 1994, [59 FR 33641&hyph;33643] is corrected by removing the reference to 9 CFR part 325. Done at Washington, DC, on July 25, 1994. Terry L. Medley, Acting Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18693 Filed 8&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;DM&hyph;P
