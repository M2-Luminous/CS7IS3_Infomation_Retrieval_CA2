Davydov: "A Correction of Strategy"] [Text] Under the conditions of the continuing slump in transport volume and the deteriorating economic situation in the sector, the railroad workers have increasingly been forced to introduce corrections in the strategy of their activity. Not five months have passed since the Program for the Development of Reforms and Strengthening of the Financial-Economic Position of Transport in 1994-1995 was adopted in December of last year, and here the collegium held last week expanded anew the course taken, and interpreted the situation that has formed in a somewhat new way. As B.M. Lapidus, chief of the Economics and Development Administration, reported, representatives of all the railroads and ministry administrations took part in amending the program. In particular, the earlier accepted guidelines for releasing workers employed in transport, shutting down low-activity stations and sections, taking locomotives and rail cars out of service, expanding the testing ground for the use of old materials for the permanent roadway, and so on, were revised. All this will make it possible to save over 240 billion rubles [R] in operating expenses. Ways of increasing revenues were accordingly outlined. Thanks to additionally adopted measures, they can be increased to R325 billion. Well, the next few months will show whether this will be enough to improve the financial situation of the roads and sector as a whole. V.F. Zayko, first deputy chief of the West Siberian mainline, presented to those assembled the road program for a change in this line's structure. He emphasized that it would be simply impossible to work unless administrative expenditures were further cut. It was therefore decided to keep three divisions, instead of the five present ones. The Barabinsk will be completely merged into the Novosibirsk, and the Karasuk--by sections, into the Altay and Omsk. I will not retell in detail the technical side of the problem set forth by Zayko, particularly since it is similar to corresponding measures on the October Railroad, on which GUDOK has already given quite a detailed report. It is much more important, perhaps, to dwell on the social consequences of this step. The speaker assured us that each of the 512 administrative workers released will be found jobs on the railroad, and moreover without changing their place of residence. But here G.M. Fadeyev, minister of railways and the head of the collegium, began to read a letter that had arrived, addressed to him, from transport veterans of Karasuk, in which the actions of the railroad Commission for Eliminating Divisions were judged to be destructive and ruinous measures. They said that this number of administrative workers could have been released without breaking up the road structure. The letter ended with the words: "We beg you to take into consideration our pain and alarm when solving the problem at the collegium." "How can this be," the minister addressed the speaker, "you state that the work collectives and trade unions approved your actions, but after that, a letter like this arrives?" "One can understand the veterans," answered Zayko. "The Karasuk Division always occupied the central place on the Central Siberian Railroad, and by all indicators was one of the leading divisions on the road. Now, however, the daily load volume here is not over 40 rail cars, and on the Barabinsk division even less--27. Both divisions are constantly subsidized by the three remaining ones. This means that this is an enforced measure, and we feel that there is no alternative." None of the collegium members who spoke on this subject attempted to refute these conclusions. On the contrary. The idea was conveyed that consolidating the divisions was exactly what was needed to preserve the social milieu and protect the people, or else it could not survive under market conditions. With transit cut in half and a slump in passenger turnover, both divisions were becoming obvious candidates for bankruptcy. Apparently, though, the situation that has formed has not been convincingly enough explained to everyone, which gives rise to letters like this. The collegium passed a resolution to agree with the proposal of the West Siberian Railroad management that the divisions be consolidated. The problems of finding jobs for the people are not out of control, however. The main item this day was the problem of developing a transport-dispatch service for freight owners and improving the use of the container fleet. This problem was also posed back at the December collegium and stems from the need for better adaptation to work under market conditions, when freight owners become more demanding and competition from motor vehicle and other forms of transport increases. The reports by V.M. Logunov, chief of the Freight and Commercial Work Administration, and V.M. Bogdanov, deputy director of VNIIZhT [All-Union Railroad Transport Scientific Research Institute], gave a detailed analysis of the reasons for the development of a transport-dispatch service being slowed down. Both positive and negative factors in this sphere of activity were mentioned. The good work experience of the Moscow Railroad was especially noted, in particular that of the Moscow Junction, which had done away with the Mosavtotrans monopoly--the container areas that formerly belonged to it were returned to the road's keeping, the necessary motor vehicle transport has been acquired, and now practically all the mechanized subdivisions for loading-unloading work are engaged in performing transport-dispatch operations. It is expected that over R2 billion in additional revenues will be obtained this year through this. Other positive examples were also presented, including some by the directors, speaking at the collegium, of line enterprises, which are trying to expand the framework of the transport-dispatch service for enterprises and the people. V.A. Bakunin, chief of the Vologda Board of Directors for Loading-Unloading Work and Commercial operations, and L.K. Bezmenov, chief of the Magnitogorsk Municipal Freight Station, told of their achievements and problems. Efficient seeds are sprouting on the North Caucasus, Gorkiy, Kuybyshev, and South Urals railroads.... By the end of each speech, however, the cheerful pictures were replaced by quite a cheerless one, and it was almost unanimously verified: Despite the efforts made, a lot of private and semiprivate offices have propagated around the railroad, and they are taking on the delivery of freight wherever they like, even though they have neither locomotives nor rail cars nor containers, nor, of course, railroad tracks. Five such advertisements were found in a single issue of the newspaper IZ RUK V RUKI! After reading these out, the minister turned to the two speakers and all those attending with the questions: Why do you regard them as competitors, on what basis? Or are the station chiefs offering them everything they need as a bribe? In the end, what will prevent us from creating our own flexible system for a transport-dispatch service? Unfortunately, after this, most of the speeches were self-reports. True, someone alluded to the fact that the status and charter of the mechanized loading-unloading subdivisions were obsolete and were not being incorporated in the new work conditions. Someone else drew the conclusion that a transition to large containers must be made. The next one--we are losing a great deal because of the fact that freight insurance has been put in the hands of ZhASO [expansion not given]. And so on. Few people, however, remembered the main thing, the reason for which, strictly speaking, the collegium was assembled, and which was designated as the priority strategic task as far back as December--creating a through system of freight dispatch for the entire network, including the near abroad. Those preparing this problem for discussion at the collegium probably did not have a sufficiently systemic approach to its solution. After all, there is useful experience at the line enterprises and stations, and here and there they have begun to turn and face the inquiries of the customers on the divisions and in the road administrations. The Transzheldorekspeditsiya state enterprise has appeared under the aegis of the ministry. On the whole, though, the system is not working. Why? Attempts have been made, including in the speeches, to answer this question. Mention was made of the need for a market approach to the matter, the growing demand for creating dispatch organizations, contractual tariffs, the task office, and the speed of freight delivery. There were quite a few different ideas on the way in which large containers could be used more efficiently. All the same, closest of all to the truth, in my opinion, were those who gave a sober evaluation of the situation in the country, which has changed so radically. A simple example. Twenty years ago, it was no problem to transport household goods by rail. Now this is almost an insoluble problem. The main thing at that time was not the need to look for customers and attract freight to the railroad: Industry and agriculture worked smoothly, and the roads constantly had to seek reserves of rolling stock and throughput potentials. Today, however, the boundlessness of prices and tariffs is forcing the railroad workers to revise the guidelines and emphases of their activity. The main thing now is no longer to transport, but to find freight, and the leading occupation is therefore, most likely, not that of engineer but of freight dispatcher. So far, however, we have no such person, in the market sense of this figure. However you twist things, whatever explanation you think up, things cannot be put right without this figure, especially since there is also no information support for this new system we are trying to set up. Even though, as A.Ya. Sidenko, deputy minister, expressed it, our equipment permits us to learn in a matter of seconds, for example, the location of a rail car that went from Murmansk to Nakhodka a week ago. All right, once again you have to make sure: Any new model or system should have economic substantiation. This gap is to be filled by a commission created at the collegium, which should bring to a logical conclusion the preparation of the structure, sphere of influence, technical equipment, and clearing accounts mechanism of the future transport-dispatch system. It can be said without exaggeration that even the recertification of the managerial staff of the Northern Railroad went along on the basis of the new criteria. Essentially, the work of the entire collective of the mainline was evaluated under the most difficult economic conditions. The talk was specific, based on principle and with an emphasis on the existing shortcomings. First and foremost, there was an analysis of the situation with wages and the potentials for reducing debts. This collation of the course in the work of the collegium and the road leaders can probably be of mutual assistance. In connection with the approaching 20th anniversary of the start of BAM construction, the collegium discussed the proposals of the mainline construction veterans, the military builders, and a number of public organizations that a series of measures be prepared for carrying out in July-August. This includes the slated applied science conference, "BAM: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow." It is proposed that a trip be organized on BAM for a large group of journalists from the capital, in order to show, through the mass information media, the unutilized possibilities concealed on this route, and the way people are now living and working there, and at the same time to give a graphic demonstration to the journalists of the problems of the "steel mainlines." The Russian and Moscow journalistic organizations supported this idea. In this way, attention can be drawn to BAM's problems, in particular, to the uncompleted facilities, most important of which is the Severomuyskiy Tunnel. The collegium entrusted A.O. Bogdanovich, deputy minister, with all the problems involved in organizing these measures. K.P. Ayrapetov, chief of the Business Affairs Administration, reported to the collegium participants on the state of executive discipline on the ministry staff. The main idea of his speech amounted to the fact that preparation of the documents, particularly those outside the boundaries of the Ministry of Railways, can be accelerated through reducing the number of executors. He said that there should be one person responsible for coordinating the content in all the administrations involved in this matter.
