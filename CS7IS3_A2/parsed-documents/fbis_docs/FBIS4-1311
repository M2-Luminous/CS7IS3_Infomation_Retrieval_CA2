Arde'] [Text] Durban April 26 SAPA -- The delay experienced by some special voters in certain parts of KwaZulu/Natal was being urgently addressed on Tuesday [26 April] morning, Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman Glenn McDougall said. He said because of late changes to the ballot paper and logistical problems, especially transport, there had been delays at certain polling booths. Some voting material had also arrived late from Johannesburg. However, no serious disruptions had been reported in the region by 10AM, Mr McDougall added. Voting at two polling stations visited by SAPA in the greater Durban area on Tuesday morning was late in getting underway. In Amanzimtoti, special voters were served tea and cake while they waited for over two hours to cast their vote. An IEC official at the scene said some voters were "not impressed". The official said a number of people had missed the opportunity to vote as some had to board flights abroad, while other disappointed voters had gone home. At Durban's City Hall one disabled pensioner said after casting her vote: "I'm fed up ... I haven't even had a cup of tea." The old lady who had travelled from Umlazi at 5.30AM said she was happy she had finally had the opportunity to exercise her choice in electing the next government.
