Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed rule: (1) Will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) Will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) Will not require administrative proceedings before any parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification The Administrator of REA has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) the REA programs provide and finance grants and loans to REA borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable than those generally available from the private sector. REA borrowers, as a result of obtaining Federal financing, receive economic benefits which ultimately offset any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA regulations and requirements. Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implements the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and section 3504 of that Act, information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this proposed rule have been approved by OMB under control number 0572&hyph;0077. Comments concerning these requirements should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, Room 3201, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503. National Environmental Policy Act Certification The Administrator of REA has determined that this proposed rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance The program described by this proposed rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under number 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. Executive Order 12372 This proposed rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation. A Notice of Final Rule entitled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA and RTB loans and loan guarantees, and RTB bank loans, to governmental and nongovernmental entities from coverage under this Order; Background REA makes loans and loan guarantees to telephone system to provide and improve telecommunications service in rural areas, as authorized by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 901 et seq. , (RE Act). REA maintains a system of construction standards and specifications for materials and equipment. In accordance with the REA loan contract, these standards and specifications apply to facilities constructed by REA telephone borrowers. Presently, REA Bulletin 345&hyph;185, REA Performance Specification for Line Concentrators REA Form 397g, dated July 29, 1985, is incorporated by reference at 7 CFR 1755.97. Because of the many improvements in technology since the specification was last issued, REA believes that by updating and codifying the revised specification, borrowers will be provided with an opportunity to improve and increase subscriber services through enhanced system designs brought about through the technological advancements in an economical and efficient manner.

(3) When specified by the owner, party line service shall be supplied. The number of parties per line shall be no more than four. (f) Subscriber lines _(1) General. (i) The remote LC units shall operate satisfactorily with subscriber lines which meet all of the conditions under the bidder's specifications and all the requirements of this section. This section recognizes that the loop limit of the line concentrator is dependent upon the transmission facility between the LC central office termination and the LC remote unit. When voice frequency (physical) circuits are used, the loop limit from the COE to the subscriber shall be 1900 ohms (including the telephone set). When electronically derived circuits (carrier, lightwave, etc.) are used, the loop limits of the electronic system will control.

Reference document ยง1755.522 (p)(1)(i), REA General Specification for Digital Stored Program Controlled Central Office Equipment. (2) Traffic and Plant Registers. Traffic measurements consist of three types_peg count, usage, and congestion. A peg count register scores one count per call attempt per circuit group such as trunks, digit receivers, senders, etc. Usage counters measure the traffic density in networks, trunks and other circuit groups. Congestion registers score the number of calls which fail to find an idle circuit in a trunk group or to find an idle path through the switching network when attempting to connect two given end points. These conditions constitute ``network blocking.'' (3) When required, traffic data will be stored in electronic storage registers or a block of memory consisting of one or more traffic counters for each item to be measured. The bidder shall indicate what registers are to be supplied, their purpose and the means for displaying the information locally (or at a remote location when available). (h) Transmission requirements _(1) General. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in paragraphs (h)(2) through (20) of this section are specified in terms of analog measurements made from Main Distributing Frame (MDF) terminals to MDF terminals excluding cabling loss. (2) Telephone transmitter battery supply. A minimum of 20 milliamperes, dc, shall be provided for the transmitter of the telephone set at the subscriber station under all loop conditions specified by the bidder. The telephone set is assumed to have a resistance of 200 ohms. (3) Impedance_subscriber loops. For the purpose of this section, the input impedance of all subscriber loops served by the equipment is arbitrarily considered to be 900 ohms in series with 2.16 microfarad capacitor at voice frequencies. (4) Battery noise. Noise across the remote terminal battery at power panel distribution bus terminals shall not exceed 35 dBrnC during the specified busy hour. (5) Stability. The long-term allowable variation in loss through the line concentrator system shall be # 0.5 dB from the loss specified by the bidder. (6) Return loss. The specified return loss values are determined by the service and type of port at the measuring end. Two-wire ports are measured at 900 ohms in series with 2.16 microfarads, and 4-wire ports are measured at 600 ohms resistive. When other balance networks are supplied, test equipment arranged for operation with the supplied network(s) may be used. The requirement given shall meet the following cited values on each balance network available in the system: Line-to-Line or Line-to-Trunk (2-Wire) Echo Return Loss (ERL)_18 dB, Minimum Singing Return Loss (SRL)_Low_15 dB, Minimum Singing Return Loss (SRL)_High_18 dB, Minimum (7) Longitudinal balance. The minimum longitudinal balance, with dc loop currents between 20 to 70 mA, shall be 60 dB at all frequencies between 60 and 2000 Hz, 55 dB at 2700 Hz and 50 dB at 3400 Hz. The method of measurement shall be as specified in the IEEE standard #455, ``Standard Testing Procedure for Measuring Longitudinal Balance of Telephone Equipment Operating in the Voice Band.''

LC central office terminal equipment shall have an impulse noise limit of not more than five counts exceeding 54 dBrnC0 voice band weighted in a 5-minute period on six such measurements made during the busy hour. A WILCOM T-194C Transmission Test Set, or equivalent, should be used for the measurements. The measurement shall be made by establishing a normal connection from the noise counter through the switching equipment in its off-hook condition to a quiet termination of 900 ohms impedance. Office battery and signaling circuit wiring shall be suitably segregated from voice and carrier circuit wiring, and frame talking battery filters provided, if and as required, in order to meet these impulse noise limits. (11) Crosstalk coupling. Worst case equal level crosstalk shall be 65 dB minimum in the range 200 to 3400 Hz. This shall be measured between any two paths through the system by connecting a 0 dBm0 level tone to the disturbing pair. (12) Digital error rate.

The insertion loss in both directions of transmission at 1004 Hz shall be included in the insertion loss requirements for the connected COE switch and shall not increase the overall losses through the combined equipment beyond the values for the COE alone, when operated through a direct digital interface. Systems operated with a (VF) line circuit interface may introduce up to 3 dB insertion loss. Reference ยง1755.522(e)(3). (20) Detailed requirements for direct digital connections. (i) This paragraph (h)(20) covers the detailed requirements for the provision of interface units which will permit direct digital connection between the host central office and line concentrator subscriber terminals over digital facilities. The digital transmission system shall be compatible with T1 type span lines using a DS1 interface and other digital interfaces that may be specified by the owner. The REA specification for the T1 span line equipment is PE-60. Other span line techniques may also be used. Diverse span line routing may be used when specified by the owner. (ii) The output of a digital-to-digital port shall be Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), encoded in eight-bit words using the mu-255 encoding law and D3 encoding format, and arranged to interface with a T1 span line. (iii) Signaling shall be by means of Multifrequency (MF) or Dual Pulsing (DP) and the system which is inherent in the A and B bits of the D3 format. In the case where A and B bits are not used for signaling or system control, these bits shall only be used for normal voice and data transmission. (iv) When a direct digital interface between the span line and the host central office equipment is to be implemented, the following requirements shall be met: (A) The span line shall be terminated in a central office repeater and the DS1 bit stream shall be connected to a digital interface port on the central office equipment; (B) The digital central office equipment shall be programmed to support the operation of the digital port with the line concentrator subscriber terminal; (C) The line concentrator subscriber terminal used with a direct digital interface shall be interchangeable with the subscriber terminal used with a central office terminal.

Fuses shall be of the alarm and indicator type, and their rating designated by numerals or color code on fuse positions. (j) Electrical protection _(1) Surge protection. (i) Adequate electrical protection of line concentrator equipment shall be included in the design of the system. The characteristics and application of protection devices must be such that they enable the line concentrator equipment to withstand, without damage or excessive protector maintenance, the dielectric stresses and currents that are produced in line-to-ground and tip-to-ring circuits through the equipment as a result of induced or conducted lightning or power system fault-related surges. All wire terminals connected to outside plant wire or cable pairs shall be protected from voltage and current surges. (ii) Equipment must pass laboratory tests, simulating the hostile electrical environment, before being placed in the field for the purpose of obtaining field experience. There are five basic types of laboratory tests which must be applied to exposed terminals in an effort to determine if the equipment will survive. Figure 2 of this section, Summary of Electrical Requirements and Tests, identifies the tests and their application.

Paths with a 100 Hz impedance of 50 ohms or less shall be subjected to current surges, employing a 10 ร 1000 microsecond waveshape as defined in Figure 3 of this section, Surge Waveshape. For the purpose of determining this impedance, arresters which are mounted within the equipment are to be considered zero impedance. The crest current shall not exceed 500A; however, depending on the impedance of the test specimen this value of current may be lower. The crest current through the sample, multiplied by the sample's 100 Hz impedance, shall not exceed 1000 V. Where sample impedance is less than 2 ohms, peak current shall be limited to 500A as shown in Figure 4 of this section, Current Surge Tests; BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;F Figure 3_Explanation of Surge Waveshape E:GRAPHICSEP25AP94.001 BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;C Surge Waveshape is defined as follows: Rise Time ร Time to Decay to Half Crest Value (For example, 10 ร 1000 m s) Notes: T 1 = Time to determine the rate of rise.

The test shall be limited to 10 amperes Root Mean Square (RMS) of 60 Hz ac for a period of 11 cycles (0.1835 seconds) and shall be applied longitudinally from line to ground; (C) AC power service surge voltage tests shall be applied to the power input terminals of ac powered devices to simulate switching surges or lightning-induced transients on the ac power system. The test shall employ a 1.2 ร 50 microsecond waveshape with a crest voltage of 2500 V. Communications line protectors may be left in place for these tests; (D) Voltage surge tests which simulate the voltage stress to which a relatively high impedance path may be subjected before primary protectors break down and protect the circuit. To ensure coordination with the primary protection while reducing testing to the minimum, voltage surge tests shall be conducted at a 1000 volts with primary arresters removed for devices protected by carbon blocks, or the +3 sigma dc breakdown voltage of other primary arresters. Surge waveshape should be 10 ร 1000 microseconds; and (E) Arrester response delay tests are designed to stress the equipment in a manner similar to that caused by the delayed breakdown of gap type arresters when subjected to rapidly rising voltages. Arresters shall be removed for these tests, the peak surge voltage shall be the +3 sigma breakdown voltage of the arrester in question on a voltage rising at 100 V per microsecond, and the time for the surge to decay to half voltage shall equal at least the delay time of the tube as explained in Figure 5 of this section, Arrester Response Delay Time.
