The U.S. vice president brought to the fore the same subject that the U.S. and French delegations unsuccessfully tried to include in the ministerial declaration of Marrakech: the social dumping issue. Like almost all the initiatives of the Clinton administration, this is a clumsy, incomplete proposal that has provoked ambivalent perceptions and dubious feelings. It gives the impression of an ingredient that has been deliberately undercooked to be used later for whatever purpose. The representatives of developing countries have consequently, and rightly, rejected the idea. No matter how good the intentions of the U.S. Government -- which has declared its desire to preserve human rights -- the effects of a social agenda will be those of the most glaring protectionism, the victims of which will be those economies that use manpower in large volume. This issue has emerged with a touch of irony. Developing nations have for decades tried to go from theoretical discussion and factual descriptions to the adoption of concrete compensatory mechanisms for resolving the problem of the deteriorated terms of exchange. While the price per volume of raw materials and semi-processed products exported by poor countries was steadily dropping, the manufactured products exported by industrialized countries consumed -- at a growing speed -- the currency reserves of poor countries. Entire forests were cut down for producing paper on which to print the speeches and studies on the deterioration of the terms of exchange made at multilateral forums like ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America], Ecosoc [Economic and Social Council] [Consejo Economico y Social], GATT, and in universities. This has produced no change in world trade. Over the past 30 years the price of coffee -- which supported the economy of entire nations -- has dropped to the current levels, at which it is impossible to run a farm. Copper, which guaranteed prosperity of an extractive agricultural country like Chile, is today anachronistic, and fiber optics and other energy transmission techniques are expected to soon declare its final death as a generator of wealth. All this has produced compulsory changes, always involving economic loss and social friction which, whenever well-managed, are recalled by people as a difficult transition to better times. In several cases, though, it has placed countries with an extractive, primary economy on the list of the poor. Vice President Al Gore now also wants the terms of exchange to be regulated by the salaries and social rights of workers in exporting countries. The argument is terrifyingly simple. An underlying condition is that because human rights are the same everywhere and in all nations, social rights should also be the same. This will finally lead to the equalization of salaries, just as the trend toward globalization of production has equalized prices. A surtax should be applied to the production of countries in which manpower is cheaper and social rights narrower or less generous. This surtax will eliminate the comparative advantage of lower personnel costs. It is not necessary to say that this funny theory will clash with the vast majority of developing countries, which over the past few years have oriented their industry toward the export sector. Industrialized countries will look for the solution to the problems that have been caused by their own high social costs inside developing countries, or in countries that have recently developed their industry. They will be transforming conditions that fall within the jurisdiction of national organs into conditions for international trade. The fact that countries either pay high salaries or give few social benefits to their workers to promote their exports would at no time be taken into account. Low salaries are caused by low productivity, and this cannot be resolved through tariff surcharges. The proposal by Al Gore actually aims at transferring to developing countries the social and unemployment problems that industrialized countries are now confronting. At the Marrakech meeting Foreign Minister Celso Amorim went right to the point in his speech, in which he repudiated the social dumping thesis. It is an anti-liberal thesis driven by the siren song of freedom and equality. It is protectionism in its most detestable form, because it distorts values that must be preserved.
