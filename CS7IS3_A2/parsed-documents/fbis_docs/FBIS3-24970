Here is the headline of GUARDIAN: Obasanjo and Buhari List Leadership Ills. Yes, both former military rulers--one who gave power up to a democratic government and one who took power back again--have condemned the new regime of Sani Abacha. The GUARDIAN reports thus: General Buhari suggested the removal of all those responsible for the economic and political malaise from leadership positions, and Gen. Obasanjo advocated a nonmilitary national government to tackle Nigeria's political, economic, and social ills. But there isn't just the military who get the blame. Gen. Obasanjo accused Nigerians of being accomplices by their silence, saying that if only six responsible, principled, and respected persons nationwide had rallied, then this harrowing experience might have been avoided. Presumably, [words indistinct] when you take the two former leaders into account. Anyway, Gen. Buhari agreed. He said: It is time for the return of reason. Decent people should no longer leave matters in the hands of irresponsible elements.
