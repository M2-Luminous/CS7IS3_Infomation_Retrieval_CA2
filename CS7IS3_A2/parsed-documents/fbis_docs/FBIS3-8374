The talks related to the developments in the peace process. President Milosevic said the Croat-Muslim agreement was their internal affair and there was no reason for anyone to dispute it as long as it did not impinge on the interests of the Serb side -- and all the more so if its was aimed at achieving peace. At the same time it is understood that no political obligations on the Serb side could be inferred from the agreement, since the Serb side was not taking part in its preparation. Since the final agreement has not yet been reached, but has only been announced, it is impossible to take a final position on it. President Milosevic stressed he expected the United States to make efforts towards the suspension of economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, since the Serb side had accepted the European Union's peace plan, to which the United States and Russia had also given support. Such an action by the United States would be in the spirit of impartiality and equal treatment of all three sides in the conflict, which is of crucial importance for the lasting resolution of the Yugoslav crisis. The Srpska republic will continue to make a contribution towards peace in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and to support efforts aimed at achieving it, in keeping with its principle that nations should be able to exercise their unalienable rights and protect their national interests on an equal basis.
