After nearly eight years of protracted talks involving more than 100 countries, the Uruguay Round--as the GATT negotiations were called--had finally ended. In the middle of last month, Amorim, 52, who is a native of Santos, Sao Paulo, a former president of Embrafilme [Brazilian Film Company], and a former head of Brazil's delegation to Geneva, put his signature on the concluding agreements of the Uruguay Round and the new World Trade Organization. The ceremony, which was held in Marrakech, Morocco, will have a guaranteed place in history if the liberalization of trade called for in the new order succeeds in achieving the promised revolution--a growth in world trade that may reach $700 billion per year. In Amorim's opinion, the new business opportunities for Brazil are exceptional. Regarded in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a firm negotiator, Amorim is alert to other challenges. A little over two months ago, for example, he put his capabilities to the test when he was able at the last minute to ward off trade sanctions that the United States was threatening to impose as a protest against the delay in approving the new Industrial Property Law. Last week he granted the following interview to EXAME. [Caixeta] What is Brazil gaining from the GATT Uruguay Round agreement? [Amorim] The most tangible impact will be an increase in exports as a result of two factors: the opening up of the world market and the establishment of more stable rules for international trade. Estimates of that impact vary considerably. Forecasts indicate that world trade will grow by between $250 billion and $700 billion per year. Obviously, that impact will not be immediate because some of the measures agreed on in the Uruguay Round will not take effect until 10 years from now. Assuming that Brazil retains its current share of international trade (slightly less than one percent of the total), it can be expected that our exports will rise by between $2.5 billion and $7 billion per year. [Caixeta] Some people consider those estimates too timid. [Amorim] That additional $2.5 billion in our annual exports does in fact represent a conservative estimate. There are also the secondary effects that the liberalization of trade is going to have on economic growth itself. These estimates do not take into account the fact that we now have more stable rules for trade. Last year, for example, Brazil was in danger of losing from $200 million to $300 million because of antidumping measures applied by the United States to Brazilian steel exports. We did not lose that full amount because some of the measures in question were never implemented, but our steel exports were delayed. Stable rules are a basic factor as far as the firms are concerned, because when exporting their products, they must follow some kind of planning. It is not that antidumping measures are going to disappear beginning now. They will diminish, however, and we will be more certain of being able to take our complaints to the World Trade Organization, which replaces GATT. This means that we will be treated more appropriately. [Caixeta] Which sectors of the Brazilian economy will probably be the first to benefit from the new rules on international trade? [Amorim] The developed countries are supposed to lower their tariffs by an average of 38 percent. Brazil has a very diversified economy. It exports everything from relatively simple products to computer software. Barriers will also be eliminated in three sectors that are very important to us: agriculture, textiles, and steel. In the case of agriculture, the complicated import rules imposed by the European Union will be gradually eliminated over a six-year period. The same thing will happen in the case of textiles over a 10-year period. Also to be eliminated is the quota system based on so-called voluntary restriction agreements. In Brazil's case, that system affected steel in particular. [Caixeta] What impact will the reduction of export subsidies--especially in the agricultural area--have on Brazilian producers? [Amorim] As far as Brazil is concerned, this is very important. We are losing sales in several traditional markets--the Near East, Asia, and East Europe--because of the farm subsidies paid by the European Union and the United States. One side used to justify its own subsidies on the grounds of those paid by the other. Over a six-year period, the total value of those subsidies will be reduced by 36 percent. That is not much, but it is a start. [Caixeta] Including the service sector in the Uruguay Round was not well received by the Brazilian Government when the talks began back in 1986. What is the government's current assessment of that aspect of the agreement? [Amorim] It is true that the liberalization of trade in services frightened us at first. There was concern over competition from the developed countries. But Brazilian firms offer very efficient services in certain fields. Engineering services are one example. Bank automation is another. Today we even export software. Moreover, I was surprised to learn that Brazil is in a good position to export attorney services and legal consulting services. [Caixeta] How do you view the pressure that the rich countries are beginning to put on the developing countries in connection with what they call social dumping--that is, their threat to set up barriers against countries where wages are low? [Amorim] That is a new protectionist threat by the developed countries. At a time when markets are beginning to open up, we are seeing the emergence of this new issue, which can be used as a protectionist barrier. Incidentally, the environment issue may also be used that way. This does not mean that those issues in themselves are not legitimate. They must be debated. The doubt I have, especially on the labor issue, is whether it is right to tie the issue of low wages to trade. I can give you an example. I was in Marrakech, Morocco, for the signing of the Uruguay Round agreement. It is a very beautiful city of medieval origin, and today it is a big tourist center. All one had to do was leave the hotel and go downtown to see minors working. What might they be doing if they were not working? Would they be attending school, begging for handouts, or doing something worse? Obviously, no one can be in favor of the exploitation of manpower, but matters that must be resolved in Brazil in a sovereign manner cannot be left in the hands of foreign protectionist interests. [Caixeta] Have you been discussing these matters with the labor unions? [Amorim] I have been talking to the president of the CUT [Sole Workers Center], Jair Meneguelli. There have been contacts with other central unions, and they have also expressed their views on the matter. Unions in Brazil are free. They fully protect the interests of the workers. Brazil is a country where there are strikes even in the Budget Department. I lived in developed countries for years and never saw anything like that. It is through union freedom and freer trade abroad that our social conditions will improve, not as a result of sanctions imposed by other countries. I want to sponsor a seminar where that topic will be debated with the workers, people in government and other interested sectors, and the academic world. We have seen many noble causes being used as a pretext for protectionist measures. We cannot leave it up to an orange juice producer in the United States to decide in the future whether the manpower used by the juice industry in Brazil is well paid or poorly paid. If action is taken on the grounds of some alleged social dumping, regardless of whether it affects Brazilian footwear, steel, or orange juice, the effect will be higher unemployment in those areas. [Caixeta] When you arrived in the United States to discuss the issue of patents, there were only a few days left before the introduction of trade reprisals against Brazil. How did you manage to reverse that situation? [Amorim] I spoke frankly. That is the main thing if you want to win people's confidence. It is essential not to try to conceal, deceive, or promise things that are impossible. In that way we were able to lay a few ghosts to rest. The issue of intellectual property has developed into an emotion-filled subject over the course of many years. There were already scars in Brazil because of retaliatory measures and sanctions imposed by the United States. But basically, reality today is not what it was when the discussion began. Today we have the GATT agreement. The Americans were previously in the habit of talking about legislation on a worldwide scale. But what did that mean? There were no parameters. Simple compliance with the Uruguay Round agreement would be enough to solve 95 percent of the problems. [Caixeta] The Brazilian Government is proposing the establishment of a free trade area in South America. What benefits will that bring us in addition to those we already have in our relations with ALADI [Latin American Integration Association]? [Amorim] ALADI is an agreement whose long-range objective is to create a common market in Latin America. But in concrete terms, it functions only as an umbrella organization for fostering sectoral agreements. So far, ALADI has resulted in limited negotiations. There are agreements on a certain number of products, but most products are not covered. [Caixeta] Then what is the objective as far as the free trade area in South America is concerned? [Amorim] What we want in South America, based on our experience with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], is a more extensive liberalization of all tariffs and nontariff barriers over a period of 10 years. We want to reverse the situation that exists today. The fact is that we negotiate only 20 percent of the tariff schedule. Everything else is considered exempt. We must protect only what is absolutely sensitive. The South American countries belonging to ALADI--excluding those belonging to Mercosur--now account for about 8 percent of our export market. It can be said that that is not much, but the picture changes when you consider that 80 percent of what we export to those countries consists of manufactured goods, unlike what we export to the developed countries. [Caixeta] What is your assessment of the criticism directed at the implementation of Mercosur? Is it not true that the objectives of commercial integration as expressed in the Asuncion Treaty were too ambitious or unrealistic, as some people claim? [Amorim] We have already benefited noticeably from the integration process. Trade with the three Mercosur countries today accounts for 13 percent of our exports. Before the Asuncion Treaty eight years ago, it amounted to only 4.5 percent. There has been breathtaking growth. But if you take all the objectives of the Asuncion Treaty literally, it is true that they have not been fully achieved. [Caixeta] A few weeks ago, President Itamar Franco sent a letter to the presidents of the Mercosur countries explaining the Brazilian position on NAFTA. What did that letter say? [Amorim] We said that Brazil took a positive view of NAFTA and that we would be ready to talk as a group--all four countries--whenever invited. The letter had two main objectives. First, to dissipate doubts about Brazil's interest in the matter. Yes, we are interested in participating in NAFTA when we are invited to do so. Second, Brazil wants to negotiate together with its Mercosur partners. But the United States, Mexico, and Canada are still digesting NAFTA and the Uruguay Round itself. It will do no good for us to stand there knocking on the door when we know that they are not ready to open it. [Caixeta] Is it not possible that behind the establishment of that free trade zone in South America is a strategic motive--in other words, a desire to increase the region's bargaining power when and if the invitation comes to discuss integration with NAFTA? [Amorim] That might in fact happen as a consequence. But the objective is not to form a bloc. It is obvious that by opening up their markets to each other, the economies in the region will grow stronger. And that, obviously, will help in any other international negotiation.
