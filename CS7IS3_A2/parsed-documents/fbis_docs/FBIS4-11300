The group is currently in Havana to attend a conference organized by the Foreign Ministry. Luis Mendez, an investor living in New York, told PRENSA LATINA that rejection of U.S. policy toward Cuba and support for the conference continue to grow within the Cuban community living abroad. This is a growing movement, even among those who would never have spoken of any sort of change in relations with the country two years ago. Mendez left Cuba almost 30 years ago. He said a positive result from this conference could lead to more talks with Cubans living abroad. He added that it could also influence the evolution of future relations with Washington. The investor contended that many U.S. firms are interested in investing in Cuba, but the current restrictions set up by the blockade disallow such activity. He condemned the fact that after signing a letter of intent he was not allowed to transfer funds to the Caribbean island. The money was destined for family relief, but the U.S. Government did not give its approval. Mariana Gaston, a member of the Antonio Maceo Brigade in New York, also believed the meeting to be a first step toward continued conversations. Gaston was also a participant in the talks held between Cuban emigrants and the government in 1978. She highlighted the government's interest in seeking the historically significant normalization of ties with the Cuban community abroad that might resolve the worries or needs of that portion of the Cuban family. She pointed out the improved facilities for travelling to the island for family reunification, the solution of communication problems, and the improvement of migratory regulations in general as examples of that intention. She added that some of those living abroad try to mobilize the sometimes intimidated voices of those who want normal relations, despite the threats of terrorism. Such mobilization must have an impact on the U.S. Government, she concluded, from the President to Congress to local authorities, demanding that the United States change its outdated policy toward Cuba. Vicente Dopico, another emigrant and a member of the Cuban Change organization in the United States, said the very fact that Cuba has called the meeting, which begins tomorrow, proves the Cuban Government's intentions regarding its relations with the emigrant community. I believe the meeting will have positive results, although we all realize that some things may not be attained immediately, he explained. Dopico affirmed that the conference in Havana and the presence of groups within the United States that defend this type of relationship between the two parties, demonstrates the possibility of a future. This future means the normalization of a nation with more than 1 million of its citizens living abroad. This feeling is always growing among those who agree with the need to establish a stable bond and a relationship of mutual respect for the good of the country, he concluded.
