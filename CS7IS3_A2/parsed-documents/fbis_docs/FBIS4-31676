Dr. Mirko Pejanovic, a member of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Miro Lazovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, as representatives of the Serbs in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, recently returned, via Ljubljana, from an official visit to Moscow where they met with Vitaliy Churkin and top-ranking representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church. [Vasovic-Mekina] Whom do you actually represent? [Pejanovic] After the first multiparty elections in Bosnia, the victorious parties arrogated the right (and the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] institutionalized this in particular) to represent all of their own nation. This is a dangerous formula of "representation," both for the nation and for democracy, because a nation can never be represented by just one political party if we want to have a multiparty system. As far as the Serbian Civic Council is concerned, it was formed by an assembly of citizens of Serb nationality who live in free territory, territory under the control of the government and Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We stand for those citizens. Accordingly, through the Serbian Civic Council we do not represent, but rather stand for, those citizens in Bosnia-Herzegovina (around 200,000 of them) who both before and during the war were and remained in favor of coexistence with Muslims and Croats, in favor of an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina and equality of the nations. I am chairman of the Serbian Civic Council and a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, while Lazovic is the president of parliament and a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina War Presidency. [Vasovic-Mekina] Is it not paradoxical that on the one hand you, as representatives of civic parties, oppose blocs of expressly nationalistic parties while on the other hand you stand for Serbs? [Pejanovic] In our case, by organizing citizens of Serb nationality an association of citizens was created, which is not a party organization. [Lazovic] It is not our ambition to replace the SDS as a national party. Over the course of the peace process that has been going on for two years now, it has been necessary to oppose Karadzic's and Milosevic's policy so that the world will finally realize that they cannot speak on behalf of all Serbs. We continue to stand for the civic option and believe that Bosnia-Herzegovina as a civic state is the best solution for all its citizens, including the Serbs. [Vasovic-Mekina] As representatives of a portion of Bosnian Serbs, what do you think of the policy of other Bosnian Serbs being represented by Radovan Karadzic? [Lazovic] The idea that he represents all Bosnian Serbs has been taking shape for a long time, as if there is not a single Serb opposed to his political option. If that were the case, Bosnia-Herzegovina would have been partitioned long ago. [Pejanovic] One of the reasons for our public actions is to remove the collective burden that Karadzic's and Milosevic's policy has placed on the shoulders of the Serb nation. We believe that the Belgrade regime and the exponent of that regime in Pale bear the blame for what has happened in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and that the Serb nation on the whole did not want war, at least not the percentage of it claimed by Karadzic, so that this was the best way for Serbs themselves, within their own nation, to oppose the expansionist, greater-state policy of Slobodan Milosevic. On the other hand, we want to show the world community that an enormous percentage of the Serbs living on free territory do not support Karadzic's policy, and that an enormous number of Bosnian Serbs have fled territory controlled by Karadzic and his exponents, not wanting to take part in a war against their state and neighbors. Indeed, the figures put Karadzic against a wall--right now 40 to 45 percent of the Serbs who lived in the territory that he controls are unavailable to him. And even of that 45 percent, an enormous number does not support his policy, but since a regime of coercion and totalitarianism is in control there, it appears that all those Serbs are in favor of his policy. It is not known that an enormous number of them have fled, roaming Europe with Bosnian Croats and Muslims, and that is why it is high time to expose this false image of him and us that has been created in the world. They want to resolve everything through force, through war; true, they are a factor that must be considered in the course of the negotiations, although they can represent only one faction within the Serb nation, the chetnik faction. An enormous number of Serbs are for the civic option, the peace option, not for war. We want these Serbs to be heard. [Vasovic-Mekina] All the same, it appears that the world media are bashful about devoting attention to you, since you ruin the image that has been created about all Serbs in public opinion. Indeed, it seems that thus far it has not been in the interest of the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities to show the world, at the height of the war and shelling of Sarajevo, that there are in fact other kinds of Serbs? [Pejanovic] Unfortunately, the world media are already accustomed to gauging everything according to national leaders, regardless of what they do. I think the very worst about politicians who pursue policy through war. We are among the people and public employees who would prefer a thousand times over to talk, not for a single second to wage war.... It is true that the entire European world has accepted the formula that there are three nations, three parties, and three leaders in Bosnia, and that only what they say is important to Europe, so that multiparty life has also been ignored within the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. [Vasovic-Mekina] What are the prospects for negotiations with representatives of the same nation, with Karadzic? [Pejanovic] What is one to think of people who base their policy on God-given, inherited strength? Karadzic gained strength in the form of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], aimed at waging war in the name of Greater Serbian interests. And what is one to think of a policy that uses force to drive people from their age-old homes en masse? What is one to think about a policy that murders people? About a policy that thrives on hatred toward people who belong to another nation or another religion, even though they have lived in this region for centuries in mutual tolerance? Karadzic was not born in Bosnia, he simply completed his schooling and studies in Bosnia. And now he is fighting, with force, for the idea of the impossibility of ethnic mixing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He is destroying coexistence by force. That is the Greater Serbian policy that he brought with him from his native Montenegro. It is a policy that separates Serbs from the neighbors with whom they have lived together for centuries, that separates them into national pens, into ethnically pure areas. What does it mean today, at the end of the 20th century, to carry out a policy of ethnic cleansing, genocide, a criminal policy? [Lazovic] I have participated in all the negotiations in Geneva and Washington. Despite all the efforts to keep everything on a diplomatic and sober level, there were often occasions where we had to react emotionally to their incoherent proposals. For example, their proposal that everything must be divided, meaning that there must be separate roads for Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. The original solution was an intersection--the Serbs take the overpass and the Muslims take the underpass: They presented such absurdities to us in all earnest, with maps and drawings.... To our question about how the citizens of Sarajevo would get to Zenica, Karadzic said, literally: "Dig a tunnel under Kobilja Glava!" which is one of the mountains above Sarajevo. That is very indicative of those who are deciding the fate of the Serb nation in an extremely frivolous and irresponsible way. Milosevic's and Karadzic's policy have forced the Serb nation into a moral, material, and spiritual calamity that the Serb nation never deserved, because never before has it borne the stamp of the aggressor, it has always been the victim. [Vasovic-Mekina] Does it not seem, ultimately, that this policy of Karadzic and Milosevic has in fact been successful; the world accepts them as parties in the negotiating process? [Pejanovic] We differ from others in that we believe that people must now secure international guarantees that they can return to their own homes, and that the question of a territorial partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina according to ethnic criteria is criminal. For us, it is not possible to resolve the Bosnia-Herzegovina war drama through military force, but only through political negotiations aimed at stopping the war and all military operations, as well as enemy propaganda, and at making the Serb side accept a formula according to which Bosnia-Herzegovina is a unified state in which the equality of all three nations would be institutionalized through federal institutions. If that is not accepted, the war will simply continue. [Vasovic-Mekina] How can the war be stopped if now, for example, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government's troops are engaging Karadzic's army and attacking Brcko? [Lazovic] The position of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is legal, in pursuit of our political goals. On the one hand, we want to defend Bosnia-Herzegovina and block the full reconstitution of any future Serb ethnic state and its connection to Krajina in Croatia, while on the other hand there is the project to realize a Greater Serbia, which would undercut Bosnia-Herzegovina as a sovereign and independent state. We advocate a modern, civic republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its territorial borders and believe that that would be most suitable to Bosnian Serbs as well. What the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is now launching are campaigns in an attempt to defend an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina by cutting off the corridor, which would force Karadzic to sit down at the negotiating table.... [Pejanovic] Let us look at the facts--who took the offensive in Bosnia-Herzegovina? If it had been the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, then we might have controlled 70 or 80 percent of the territory; Karadzic's army would not hold 70 percent of the territory if it had not taken the offensive. Today they are circulating the theory that they are forced to continue fighting because they are facing an offensive by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which they call the Muslim army, which is a profanity. Concretely speaking, the Brcko front serves the purposes of the propaganda war, in a desire to project a continuation of the war. The Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina has spent the whole time in a position of defense and resistance, and in that way it has managed to defend some places and regain some of them. The policy of the legal institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to break off military operations and engage in negotiations and the search for political solutions. Our government did everything it could to find a political solution with so-called Herceg-Bosna, i.e., the Croat national corpus, in the form of the Washington agreement. That was not a wonderful solution, holding forth milk and honey, but at least military operations were halted through this constitution of peace. The same thing is sought from the so-called Karadzic side. Instead of that, he offers us an offensive against Gorazde. We have stopped Gorazde, and now Brcko is being opened up as a propaganda ploy. [Vasovic-Mekina] You said that it is a profanity to call the troops of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government a Muslim army. Besides Kladanj, can you cite any other example where Serbs are fighting on your army's side? [Lazovic] The Tuzla region is an example of a joint government in power, where people of different nationalities are trying to jointly defend themselves against the greater-state appetites of Karadzic's army. For two years, Serbs in Sarajevo have experienced together with Muslims and Croats all the horrors of the biggest concentration camp maintained by Karadzic's Serbs from the surrounding mountains. [Pejanovic] The Serb victims of shells in Sarajevo alone are enough to condemn Karadzic as a war criminal. In terms of inhabitants, Sarajevo was the biggest Serb city after Belgrade. And it still is today: Inside it there are still between 60,000 and 70,000 people of Serb nationality. Why is that hushed up in Belgrade, and who will bear responsibility for that?! According to some analyses, more Muslims than Serbs have left Sarajevo. The Serbs are the ones who have remained in Sarajevo in all the structures of life to work and continue fighting, to defy Greater Serbian aggression. By working in joint institutions of government, we have allowed the Serbs to preserve their political and human honor, both in Sarajevo and in Tuzla and the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Lazovic] During the first months of the war, two shells that fell in front of the building where I live and where children were playing killed seven children. Of the seven, five were Serb children. Were these children traitors? The theory that the Serbs who have remained in Bosnian cities are traitors is the fruit of chetnik ideology. In this context, we are traitors: I am personally a traitor to a chetnik ideology, and I will never support a Greater Serbian policy. [Vasovic-Mekina] Are you not afraid that the Bosnian Government will use you publicly as honorable Serbs and that you could be misused in its political activity? [Pejanovic] No, because we have always acted in the interest of peace and coexistence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Permit me to turn the question around: What would have happened to the other Serbs if Mr. Lazovic, I, and many other Serbs had not participated in institutions of power and shared responsibility with others for the fate of the state? What would have happened to Serbs in cities and villages all over Bosnia, where even today they live peacefully with their neighbors, if we had not defended our Bosnia? What would have happened, in the end, if we had not opposed the extremists within Bosnian politics, if we had not contributed to seeing to it that Cacina, Jukina, and other paramilitary units were transformed and that control over security was assumed by a professional Bosnia-Herzegovina army and a well-organized police? [Vasovic-Mekina] You participated in the Washington negotiations, but the Serbs are not included in the current constitution for a new Bosnian federation? [Lazovic] That is understandable. It is not possible to be constitutive twice--once within Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole (Karadzic's Serbs--author's note) and then again, separately, within the current federation. The Washington agreement is open to everyone. If Karadzic accepts the negotiations, then the Serbs too will gain the same status within an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina as all the other nations. If not, then Serbs in Bosnia, thanks to Karadzic's policy, will in fact become a minority. [Vasovic-Mekina] What then? [Lazovic] In that case, we are left with the possibility of fighting for adequate national, but most of all civil and human rights for Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina without the status of a constitutive nation. [Vasovic-Mekina] What sort of guarantees did Churkin give you in Moscow? [Pejanovic] We were pleasantly surprised when he confirmed that the entire world is united in the effort to preserve the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Churkin literally told us, let the war stop for one year, even with temporary maps, and that will be enough for the drunkards of war and the extremists to leave their positions.... We presented to Churkin our views, the views of all Serbs who do not agree with Karadzic's policy.
