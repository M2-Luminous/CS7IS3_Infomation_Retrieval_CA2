A report by Nenad Kocmur: [Kocmur] The Serb Democratic Forum holds that the UN presence in crisis areas in Croatia so far has produced some results, primarily in the halting of armed conflicts. According to Forum Chairman Milorad Pupovac, no important political changes have taken place in the field -- there have been no agreements on cease-fire and demilitarization. Therefore, they are proposing a number of concrete activities to be taken: [Begin Pupovac recording] First, the presidency of the Serb Democratic Forum believes that the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] mandate needs to be extended as long as possible in order to avoid the renewal of clashes by disputes on its extension which would create a stable time framework for the resolution of civilian and political issues. Second, agreements governing a cease-fire and demilitarization should be reached as soon as possible. They should provide adequate control of pink zones, of separation lines, and the international political observation and control of possible irresponsible actions. Third, full opening of all communications must be secured, both physical and commercial communications, which should be under the UNPROFOR mandate, on which the sides should be consulted, but are not expected to give their consent. [end recording] [Kocmur] The mobilization of Serb citizens into the Croatian Army was also mentioned at the conference. Petar Lazovic, chairman of the political committee of the Serb Democratic Forum, stated that some mobilization drafts are unacceptable, because citizens who do not have Croatian citizenship or persons either under 18 or over 50 years of age have been receiving draft notices. In that regard a letter has been sent to top representatives of Croatian Government departments.
