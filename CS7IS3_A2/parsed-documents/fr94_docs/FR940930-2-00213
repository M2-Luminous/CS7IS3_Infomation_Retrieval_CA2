FR940930-2-00213 FR940930-2-00072 [Release No. 34&hyph;34717; File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;91&hyph;20] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Equity Floor Procedure Advice E&hyph;A&hyph;1_Responsibility for Displaying Best Bid and Offer Prices September 26, 1994. On July 15, 1991, as subsequently amended on June 23, 1994, 1 and July 14, 1994, 2 the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 3 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 4 a proposed rule change to adopt Phlx Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``EFPA'') E&hyph;A&hyph;1: Responsibility for Displaying Best Bid and Offer Prices Established on the Equity Floor (the ``Advice''). 1 See letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, SEC, dated June 23, 1994. 2 See letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, SEC, dated July 14, 1994. This amendment, which is available in the Commission's Public Reference Room, changed ``national exchanges'' to ``national securities exchanges'' in the text of the Equity Floor Procedure Advice. This change was technical in nature and has no substantive impact on the original filing. 3 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 4 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). The proposed rule change, including amendment no. 1, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34342 (July 11, 1994), 59 FR 36244 (July 15, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. The Advice being adopted requires specialists to display the best bid and offer available in their assigned securities. The specialists' responsibility will be different for primary stock issues 5 and secondary stock issues. 6 For primary securities, specialists' will be responsible for ensuring that the best bid and offer voiced on the floor of the Exchange is properly and timely displayed for dissemination purposes. For securities in which the specialists make secondary markets, specialists will be responsible for ensuring proper and timely display of the best bid or offer so long as such bid or offer is equal to or superior to all other bids or offers reflected and disseminated at the time by the national securities exchanges. 5 A primary stock issue is any security listed on the Phlx which is not listed on any other national securities exchange or any issue dually listed with another exchange for which the Phlx has traded the majority of exchange volume over the previous six months. 6 Secondary issues are all securities in which Phlx specialists make secondary markets, i.e., all securities not classified as primary issues. See note 5, supra. In addition, the Advice will be included in the Exchange's minor rule plan. 7 The fine schedule below will be applied when an Exchange review identifies that five percent or more of the bids or offers have not been properly displayed in a timely fashion. The following schedule will be implemented on a three year running calendar basis: 8 7 See letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, Phlx, to Sandra Sciole, Special Counsel, SEC, dated August 18, 1994. The Exchange's minor rule plan is administered pursuant to Phlx Rule 970 (Floor Procedure Advices: Violations, Penalties, and Procedures). Under Phlx Rule 970, in lieu of commencing a disciplinary proceeding under Phlx Rule 960, the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $2,500, for any violation of a Floor Procedure Advice if the Exchange has determined the violation is minor in nature. 8 In November 1993, the commission approved a Phlx proposal to place nine Advices on a three-year rolling cycle for the imposition of fines. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33130 (November 2, 1993), 58 FR 59502 (November 9, 1993). Under the three-year rolling cycle, a violation of Advice E&hyph;A&hyph;1 that occurs within three years of the first violation of the Advice will be treated as a second occurrence, and any violation of the Advice within three years of the previous violation of the Advice will be subject to the next highest fine. Thus, a third violation of Advice E&hyph;A&hyph;1 within less than three years after a fine for a second violation of Advice E&hyph;A&hyph;1 will be treated as a third violation of that Advice, even though more than three years may have elapsed since the first violation of Advice E&hyph;A&hyph;1. Floor Procedure Advice E&hyph;A&hyph; 1 1␣ 1␣ 1st occurrence $100.00 2nd occurrence 250.00 3rd occurrence 500.00 4th and thereafter Sanction is discretionary with Business Conduct Committee. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). 9 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. 9 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). The Commission has long believed that transparency plays a fundamental role in the fairness and efficiency of the secondary markets. Transparency may be defined as the extent to which trading information ( i.e., information regarding quotations, price, and volume of transactions) is made publicly available promptly after either the entry of a quotation or the completion of a transaction. As the Commission's Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') stated in its Market 2000 Study, 10 at least three tangible benefits flow from transparency: (1) Transparency enhances investor protection because it makes it easier for investors to monitor the quality of executions they receive from their intermediaries, (2) transparency encourages investor participation in the market, and thereby promotes market liquidity, and (3) transparency fosters the efficiency of securities markets by facilitating price discovery and open competition, and thus counteracts the effects of fragmentation. 11 10 See Division of Market Regulation, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (January 1994). 11 Id. at IV&hyph;2.
