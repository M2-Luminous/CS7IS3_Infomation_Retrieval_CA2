He told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that an agreement had been reached to cut the catch of salmon by Japan in Russia's economic zone by 1,000 tons as against last year's catch and to keep the size of the catch in Japanese waters of salmon from Russia at the same level as last year's. This means that this year Japanese fishermen have the right to catch no more than 14,000 tons of Russian river salmon inside the Russian economic zone and no more that 4,800 tons in Japanese waters. [passage omitted] The head of the Russian delegation said that the decision was also made at the talks that Japan, as before, would compensate Russia for some of its expenditure on scientific research on salmon, on breeding and protecting them. [passage omitted] The first deputy head of the fisheries committee noted that the results of the talks in Tokyo would in no way have a negative influence upon Russia's salmon supply.
