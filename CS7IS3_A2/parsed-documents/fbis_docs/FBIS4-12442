Security forces launched a manhunt on Sunday after General Ra'uf Khayrat was killed by assailants who hurled a bomb at his car in the Egyptian capital. Three people in a car and two on a motorbike raked General Khayrat's car with automatic gunfire late Saturday and then lobbed the bomb before escaping, witnesses said. The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] said in a statement to AFP it had carried out the attack "to avenge the most atrocious violations of human rights which Islamic prisoners are subjected to in Egyptian prisons." Khayrat was the number two in the state security services, which have been accused by human rights groups of torturing suspected militants. His charred body was found in the burnt-out car after the attack in the suburb of al-Jizah on Pyramids Avenue, which happened as the general was leaving home at the wheel of his car, the witnesses said. The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah warned on March 27 that it would avenge what it called the "serious violations of human rights in Egyptian prisons," where the state security services interrogate thousands of suspects. It said it had tracked the general down even though he had changed address several times, and used three different cars in a bid to outwit possible assailants. [passage omitted] Khayrat was one of the leading officials in charge of the fight against militants who launched a terror campaign against the government in the spring of 1992. It was the first killing of a police general in Cairo, though four other police generals have been killed in southern Egypt, a hotbed of Muslim fundamentalism. Police launched a massive manhunt in al-Jizah, with officers out on patrol and soldiers armed with automatic weapons posted on all the main roads and bridges of the capital. The motorbike and car used in the attack were found near the general's home. It was the worst attack in Cairo since a failed November 25 assassination bid against Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi. The authorities had since kept Islamic violence mostly confined to the south of the country. The Egyptian Human Rights Organisation has accused Khayrat's services of systematically torturing suspects in Islamic militant attacks. More than 360 people have been killed, including 132 policemen, since the militants declared war on the secular government of President Husni Mubarak in March 1992.
