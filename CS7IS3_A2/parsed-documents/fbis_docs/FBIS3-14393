The poll was conducted by "Radar Eastridge," a research and public relations firm, which secured a permit from the Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics [CAMS]. The permit, numbered 1315/1993, was published in the Official Gazette on 6 December 1993. The U.S. poll, conducted over three months, covered a sample of 8,000 citizens. The Egyptian and foreign researchers focused on poor neighborhoods, especially in al-Jizah and Asyut Governorates, in contravention of a CAMS decision stipulating that the survey be confined to a sample of 300 citizens in Cairo Governorate, distributed as follows: Some 230 from Heliopolis, al-Zaytun, al-Alf Maskan, Hada'iq al-Qubbah, al-Shurabiyah, al-Minyal, Madinat Nasr, Shubra, al-Dhahir, and al-'Abbasiyah and 70 citizens from al-Jizah Governorate, specifically from the areas of al-Muhandisin, al-Duqqi, Mit 'Uqbah, and the Pyramids. The CAMS decision stressed that the citizens be told the survey is confidential and that data be gathered in accordance with an approved form prepared for this purpose. It also stipulated that only Egyptian researchers may gather the data and banned the participation of foreigners. The CAMS decision also stipulated that it receive two copies of the field study on completion before its handover to the quarter that commissioned it. CAMS would then hand the survey to that quarter. Radar Eastridge did not abide by the CAMS conditions and did not secure the necessary permits from the security and administrative departments. It sent the poll result to Gallup to analyze it. Gallup is a private commercial firm selling its surveys to whoever pays the right price. Most of its contracts are with the CIA. The Gallup Institute recently conducted an opinion poll in Israel on the Jewish youth view and stance on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. AL-'ARABI has learned that a team of experts from Tel Aviv University's (Shilwah) Center is analyzing the results of another opinion poll conducted in the Governorates of Cairo, al-Jizah, and Alexandria. This poll was conducted by the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo and based on a sample of Egyptians, most notably intellectuals, politicians, and scientists. The poll focused on upcoming expected developments in light of the role of the political Islam current and the strength of the Nasirite current in Egypt. In early January, the Israeli Academic Center received three researchers from the Truman Institute on Peace Research, which is affiliated with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. This is within the framework of comprehensive research by a team of 30 researchers from the institute who will study the "impact of Islam on African policies." The Truman Institute's African Research Unit is planning to conduct a new study on the "radical Islamic current groups" and those that are most likely to reach power. The study will begin in June when a new team of researchers will arrive to conduct an opinion poll with the assistance of the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo, which has close links with the Israeli intelligence service Mosad.
