At Pontida, Umberto Bossi obtained the go-ahead from the Northern League to form a majority government with Forza Italia and the National Alliance. Silvio Berlusconi said in Rome that the next government would be a centrist one, but Gianfranco Fini, stressed that the next government would be a center-right one. From tomorrow the delegations from the Freedom Alliance, comprising Forza Italia and the Northern League, and the Good Government Alliance, comprising Forza Italia and the National Alliance, will begin work in order to choose the Chamber of Deputies and Senate speakers. Our correspondents have the details. [passage omitted] After having injected his followers with hefty doses of Northern League pride, Umberto Bossi announced that at the next European and local elections in June, the Northern League would field its own candidates running under its own symbol. [passage omitted] [Begin Berlusconi recording, shown addressing Reform Party congress] The task that this government faces is extremely difficult. We have inherited a disastrous situation. I have begun to look closely at the state account books. I am looking at them as though they were company books, and let me tell you, the situation is sickening. [end recording] [passage omitted] [Begin Marco Pannella recording, addressing Reform Party congress] The Northern League was the first political organization, which along with us, asked for that which today Forza Italia, Silvio Berlusconi, and the country is saying is the best method. [end recording] [Correspondent Margherita Ghinassi, over video] As far as Silvio Berlusconi is concerned, Marco Pannella is turning out to be an indispensable ally. He is the catalyst for those parliamentarians elected on reform lists, and he has the support of certain socialist, liberal, and environmental factions. He wants to be the left-wing extreme of the future government majority. Berlusconi agrees with him. He wants to have a link with Mario Segni's Pact for Italy, and with that faction of the left which, he says, does not want to have anything to do with the Party of the Democratic Left. [passage omitted] [Correspondent Mauro Mazza, over video] Gianfranco Fini is not worried by this business of forming a centrist government. In fact he appears happy because at the end of the day, he explained, it will be Silvio Berlusconi who will steer a center course. However, the coalition will be made up of this center and the right, where Fini believes, the space for the National Alliance will be even greater. Tomorrow, the negotiations will be more serious. There will be talks on the next Chamber of Deputies and Senate speakers. It appears probable that both speakers will come from the Freedom Alliance. The Freedom Alliance now appears ready to get off the ground. Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center Party, said finally things were running smoothly. He commented that Bossi had finished chasing after rainbows. [passage omitted] The Left is attempting to put something together. Ottaviano Del Turco, the secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, suggested that an intelligent opposition must be formed to fight those that he called the illusionists and mountebanks of the Freedom Alliance. The leader of La Rete, Leoluca Orlando, called for the establishment of a great, democratic united party. The Party of the Democratic Left and its representative Fassino, welcomed the invitation of Mino Martinazzoli to take part in a united way in the 25 April demonstrations [Liberation Day]. Fassino said that the new alliance could get off the ground then.
