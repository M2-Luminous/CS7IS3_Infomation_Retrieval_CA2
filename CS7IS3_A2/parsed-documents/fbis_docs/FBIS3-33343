In statements to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, Delgado admitted that a group of former officers of the defunct Panama Defense Forces (FDP) met with retired General Ruben Dario Paredes to analyze "the country's problems, among them the public security problem." Delgado insisted that "none of the meetings (with Gen. Paredes) has been in favor of Carles or against Ernesto Perez Balladares." However, several sources have informed LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that Paredes tried to promote an association of former military men who would support Carles, the presidential candidate for the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena), the Civic Renewal Party (PRC), and the National Renewal Movement (Morena). Approximately 25 former officers attended the meetings with Gen. Paredes, among them Daniel Delgado Diamante, Carlos Arosemena King, Virgilio Mirones, Major Severino Mejia, and Maj. Juan Antonio Guizado. Yesterday on Radio Ancon, Gen. Paredes denied reports published in the 17 February edition of LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA. However, he did admit that he met with Carles for 45 minutes. According to Paredes, it was "a regrettable lie published by LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA." Delgado said the former officers are worried about the increase in crimes, kidnappings, drug trafficking, vandalism, and the failure of the current Public Force, but warned that they, the officers, are conceptually "Torrijists." "We continue to be Torrijists because we believe the ideas promoted by Torrijos are the appropriate answer to the country's problems," Delgado stressed.
