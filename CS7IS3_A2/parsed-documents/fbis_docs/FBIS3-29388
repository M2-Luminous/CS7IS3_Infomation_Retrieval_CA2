The source made the remarks shortly after the U.S. Commerce Department released 1993 and December trade figures. The department said the United States had a record merchandise trade deficit of 59.3 billion dollars in 1993 with Japan, while its deficit in December shrank to 5.30 billion dollars from 5.72 billion dollars in November. "The December trade deficit figure was smaller than expected," the source said on condition of anonymity, noting the improvement reflects a steady recovery of U.S. competitiveness.
