It opened on Friday [3 June] and went on for one night and one day beyond the scheduled time. Zhan Videnov was reelected leader and a new statute was adopted. The congress decided that the BSP programme will be adopted after an all-party consultation in the autumn and passed a resolution urging for early parliamentary elections this autumn. A banner headline in DUMA, the BSP daily, says that it had predicted that Videnov would lead the party to elections in the autumn. Yesterday, even before the start of the voting procedure, a front-page headline in DUMA announced that Videnov remained socialist leader. The story specified that this was a prediction by the press. "Other dailies ran similar 'scandalous' headlines yesterday," DUMA says. Under the headline "If You Fight Battles of the Past, You Live in the Past" the daily runs an interview with Zhan Videnov, who says the main steps of the BSP will be to complete "what we have prepared, paid for dearly and actually finalized in law-making and in our relationships with the government" and to guarantee "free, fair and democratic elections in an atmosphere of stability, needed for a mandate for stable and successful left-of-centre government". The leftist daily ZEMYA, the trade union TRUD daily and the private NOVINAR also run interviews with Videnov. DUMA publishes declarations adopted at the congress and lists the names of the members of the newly-elected 106-member Supreme Council, including 31 delegates from the constituencies, as well as of the All-Party Controlling Committee. The socialist daily stresses that in a resolution adopted at the congress the BSP expressed readiness for parliamentary elections in the autumn. Asked to be more specific about the timing of elections, BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva said, "The astronomical end of the autumn is December 22" according to DUMA. DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), covers the BSP congress under the headline "Videnov Appointed BSP Chief". Associate Editor Mikhaela Vuzharova comments: "The Socialists voted to make autumn 'a base' for a future date for the early elections; for the time being the Socialists make out that the autumn ends on Christmas". According to the author, Videnov, now BSP chairman, wants to become BSP leader. "The renamed Communists no longer shout `BSP', `Victory' or `Unity' and are not convulsed in hysteria at the mention of the SDS," the author says. ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of the most influential extraparliamentary Agrarian Party, headed by Anastasiya Dimitrova- Mozer, runs a brief report on the congress headlined "They Are Still the Same". "One after the other Socialist leaders speak about elections in autumn, but which autumn do they have in mind?" says a signed commentary in TRUD. The private KONTINENT daily carries two signed commentaries on the BSP congress. One of them stresses that Videnov was the only candidate for the leadership and won "against himself". "BSP Makes Painful Step to Power" runs the headline of the second commentary. The Social Democracy Alliance, a wing of the BSP, lost ground in the supreme body, says a front-page story in OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. "It, however, won a leader in the person of Videnov," the daily says. The private EXPRESS daily, which resumed publishing under a new editor-in-chief, says the non-conformists were thrown out of the BSP Supreme Council. These are Aleksandur Marinov, leader of the Sofia party organization, considered an alternative candidate for the position of leader, and ex-premier Andrey Lukanov, Dimitur Yonchev, Velislava Dureva and Elena Poptodorova, all four of them members of the Social Democracy Alliance.
