It has been learned that army authorities are currently evaluating the various aspects of the system. An official from the Chungshan Science Institute said the newly developed multi-barrel rocket system for army artillery resembles the current Kung-4 Rocket. It has been designed with reference to the MLR system [MLRS] of the United States Army, but built to meet the needs of the ROC. It has the capability to inflict heavy casualties on an invading fleet and on any enemy personnel who try to launch an offensive as they approach shore. The 12-barrel rocket launcher can be hooked up with radar, computers, and a firing control vehicle to automatically determine various firing positions and directions within a range of 45 kilometers. It has a firing angle which covers from zero to 60 degrees and a direction range of plus or minus 120 degrees, specifications which are superior to the MLRS range of 110 degrees which is used by the U.S. military. When fitted with MK30 or MK40 rocket missile warheads, the unit is capable of powerful penetration and inflicting heavy casualties. A researcher from the institute said the aerial mine-laying system had the advantage of being equipped with an automatic control, and can carry out mine-laying operations with great speed over a large area. According to on-the-spot testing results, each sortie could cover an area up to 3,000 square feet; and the anti-tank mine, which explodes within 30 seconds of falling to the ground, can cause casualties to enemy tank personnel within three meters of the mine, and pierce through the six-inch base and caterpillar tracks of an armored car. The system could, therefore, be effectively used to delay an enemy's landing and advance, thereby serving as an anti-landing operations weapon.
