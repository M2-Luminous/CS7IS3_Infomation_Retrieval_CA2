Krishchenko, Moscow State Technical University imeni N.E. Bauman; UDC 62-50] [Abstract] An analysis was conducted of the problem of synthesis of a terminal control algorithm for multi-dimensional nonlinear systems in the presence of state and control constraints. The algorithm proposed to solve the problem is based on a differential geometry approach to nonlinear systems and the concept of inverse problems of dynamics. The algorithm includes elements of several heuristic techniques as key components, and the proposed solution method entails the use of mathematical modeling in the control algorithm development stage. The workings of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by way of the example of solution of the problem of trajectory control of the three-dimensional motion of an aerospace vehicle in the three-dimensional prelanding maneuver leg of its flight. The underlying idea of the method is as follows: New (auxiliary) equations are introduced to transform the equations describing the control object's motion to affine form, i.e., to make them linear relative to the new equations. The new equations are designed to make it possible to transform the resultant equations to regular canonic form. After the equations are transformed into canonic form based on the concept of inverse dynamics equations, a program solution to a terminal problem is constructed and then stabilized by using a method proposed and published by the author in 1985. The values obtained for the auxiliary equations are then recalculated into the values of the starting equations. The aforementioned steps constitute the basic algorithm. If it does not yield a solution to the formulated problem with consideration for all of its constraints and for the entire set of initial states, the algorithm is used in conjunction with mathematical modeling to select the required number of intermediate states, and the sequence of their implementation to achieve more complex trajectories is established. The end result is an algorithm that establishes, on the basis of the initial state, the respective intermediate (or assigned terminal) state into which the control object has been brought. If the state is an intermediate state, the subsequent state into which the object must be brought so as to ultimately reach the terminal state is already known. For the example presented, it is sufficient to find about 10 intermediate states. The new algorithm is said to be suitable for a broad class of objects. Although mathematical modeling must be resorted to when the algorithm is developed, it may eventually be written in ``analytical form,'' i.e., calculated on the basis of the formulas derived, and thus does not require computers with speeds or amounts of memory greater than those currently available.
