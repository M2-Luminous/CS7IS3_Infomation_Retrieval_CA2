Ouyang Jui-hsiung, director of the Ministry's Department of Information and Cultural Affairs, said the ROC has expressed its concern about the Medan labor rioting to the Indonesian government and has ordered the ROC representative office in Jakarta to strengthen protection for Taiwan businessmen there. According to foreign wire service reports, a labor protest at a Medan factory over wages and holiday bonus payments last Thursday turned into a highly-charged race riot against the economically dominant ethnic Chinese. Banks, shops, and cars in Medan and several other Sumatran cities were attacked and one person was reportedly killed. Ouyang, quoting reports from Taipei's representative office in Jakarta, said the riot in Medan has almost been quelled and life there has begun to return to normal.
