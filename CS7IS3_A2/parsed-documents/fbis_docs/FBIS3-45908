While dealing with the right of permanent abode in Hong Kong, an issue of concern for Chinese residing in Britain and Sino-British trade in an interview with reporters here today, Ma Yuzhen said that on the right of abode in Hong Kong of those Chinese who have already acquired foreign passports and Chinese living overseas as well in the second generation, the Chinese authorities were studying the question according to the Basic Law; it was believed that the matter would certainly be appropriately resolved in due time; Chinese friends had no need to worry about it. Earlier, some individual responsible person of a Chinese organization aired his view involving the right of abode in Hong Kong in the future of former Hong Kong residents now residing in Britain, and was ready to reflect their anxieties to the Chinese Embassy in Britain. Regarding this, Ma Yuzhen said: "Chinese compatriots and friends are welcomed to actively relay their opinions to the Chinese Embassy; the matter is now under the study of the Chinese Government. Our compatriots may rest at ease; at the same time, we hope that our compatriots will guard against some people sowing discord at this moment." Ma Yuzhen explained: "On the Hong Kong issue, the British Government has pursued a plan for Hong Kong residents' right of abode in Britain, which the Chinese Government is against; however, the Chinese Government will not oppose or target those people who have already acquired the right of abode in Britain; furthermore, convenience will be allowed people in this category regarding their right of abode in Hong Kong; as to specific conditions, they are under study at present." He also talked about the contributions Chinese residing in Britain make to the British economy and Sino-British trade and the understanding of the anxieties of Chinese capital in Britain over the effects of the Hong Kong issue on Sino-British trade. While reiterating the Chinese Government's view on the issue, Ma Yuzhen said that because Britain had adopted a non-cooperative attitude, effects on other arenas in Sino-British relations would be inevitable. "Although subjectively, we do not wish to see such circumstances, there is nothing we could do about it. The responsibility does not rest with us; objective conditions and subjective wishes are two different kettles of fish." Ma Yuzhen said the above was what he told some British friends of the business circles of the British Industrial Association. He criticized Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's attitude toward Sino-British trade relations in his appearance at the hearing of the British Foreign Affairs group yesterday; it was unwise for Patten to have deliberately linked it to the issue of China applying for restoral of GATT membership. At the hearing yesterday, Chris Patten said that he did not believe that China would resist Sino-British trade because of the Hong Kong issue on the grounds that China was applying for the restoration of its GATT membership. "Restoring China's position in GATT will be helpful to China as well as the whole international community; should an attitude of obstruction be adopted, that would be unwise, nor would it be helpful to Britain," Ma Yuzhen concluded.
