In less than one week he succeeded in reeling in Alvaro Gomez and doing away with a long- standing split within the Conservative Party. Everybody, except for the Alvarists candidates, is happy with this. On one side, the Pastrana supporters are happy. With the Conservative Party majority assured, Pastrana can devote his attention to seeking the votes he needs and consolidate his image as a national candidate. The supporters of Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper are also claim to be happy because they say the Gomez endorsement of the New Democratic Force shows Pastrana's faithfulness to the old Conservative Party, something that weakens his stance as an independent candidate. Pastrana supporters respond by saying that what has been confirmed is Pastrana's independence regarding his father, Misael. For Andres Pastrana, the challenge is to gather Conservative votes and endorsements before and during the party's convention on 18 February and continue of appear as the young, independent, and suprapartisan candidate.
