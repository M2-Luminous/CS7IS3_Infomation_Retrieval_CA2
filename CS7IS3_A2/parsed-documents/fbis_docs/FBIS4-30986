After the signing of a ceasefire agreement, this would be a significant move forward in the process of normalizing the Knin-Zagreb relations, he said. As for the venue of the talks, he said he believed a place acceptable to both sides would be found. The agreement on cessation of hostilities and troop pull-out, reached in late March between the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) and Croatia at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, took effect in early April. The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 by local Serbs in their ancestral land within Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav federation and its attempt to downgrade the Serbs to a national minority. The territory was placed under U.N. protection in March 1992. In a statement to the press, Churkin said that all sides were preparing for a resumption of talks on a ceasefire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are scheduled to open in Geneva on Monday [6 June]. He described the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina as complex, stressing as important that all sides should attend the talks and warning that this was also a duty to the international community in the process of reaching a ceasefire agreement. He added that this could be the first step towards implementing the programme adopted in Geneva by the European Union, Russian and U.S. foreign ministers. He said that all preparations were completed and added that now the time was right for resolving the crisis. He also pointed out Moscow's engagement in seeking a solution for the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia. Churkin on Tuesday visited Belgrade, where he conferred with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, RSK President Milan Martic and senior officials of the Bosnian Serb republic. After Zagreb, Churkin on Wednesday leaves for Sarajevo, where he is scheduled to meet with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic and probably with Kresimir Zubak, the president of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation.
