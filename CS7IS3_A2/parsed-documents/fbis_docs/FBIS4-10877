Over the past six years the signal of Television Nacional de Chile has gained a significant audience in Argentina, besides having an important presence in Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and even the south of Brazil. Making the country known through the television screen is an important responsibility. This company thinks it has succeeded. But in a world where communications play an essential role, Television Nacional has wanted to take a new step forward. Its highest authorities, headed by Executive Director Jorge Navarrete, signed an agreement with the Television Corporation of the Catholic University of Chile directed by Heliodoro Rodriguez. With this agreement the two most important channels of the country will put together their most important programs for the generation, transmission, and sale of a single and common international signal, which will be transmitted through satellite and will be distributed essentially by cable television, directed to the Spanish-speaking people of the entire continent.
