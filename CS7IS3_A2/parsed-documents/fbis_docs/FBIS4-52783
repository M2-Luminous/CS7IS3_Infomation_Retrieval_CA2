Reyes] [Text] The full development of the country's financial markets continue to be stunted by various economic, financial and structural barriers, hence our underdevelopment as compared with our neighbors in this regard. In a recent speech before the Foreign Exchange Association of the Philippines, Negros Oriental Rep. Margarito Teves (3d District) lamented the existence of seven major obstacles to this growth namely: - The huge old Central Bank deficit, amounting to some P [Philippine pesos] 320 billion, "which burdened the entire financial system for a long time;" - The consolidated public sector deficit, tagged at P20.7 billion last year and targeted at 27.7 billion this year, "financed largely through domestic borrowing which crowded out private investments;" - The close-knit family structure of many companies which does not encourage sourcing of funds through public offering; - The prolonged existence of two exchanges wherein they used different prices on the same issue, with the effect that investors were not able to enjoy the best price; - The restrictive financial policies as evidenced by previously stringent foreign exchange regulations and bank branching rules; - Poor market information on the availability, risk and yield of alternative assets which is a major cause of the observed segmentation of the financial market that includes the presence of a sizable informal sector; and - The absence of an institution, separate from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] (BSP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which will exclusively address the development of capital markets. Mr. Teves lamented further the underdevelopment of these markets is emphasized more when compared with their counterparts among Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, saying: "Compared to our ASEAN neighbors, our financial markets, especially the capital market, are still relatively underdeveloped (while) ASEAN financial markets have been growing by leaps and bounds." First, the ratio of domestic liquidity (M3) to gross domestic product (GDP) in the country stood at only 34.4 percent in 1990, as compared with 74.6 percent in Thailand, 68.2 percent in Malaysia and 35.2 percent in Indonesia during the same period. "This low M3 to GDP ratio implies that the range of our financial instruments is still limited," Mr. Teves observed. "There is an absence of variety of alternative debt and equity instruments, while incentives to savings is unattractive and inadequate," he added. "Credit allocation is distorted and there is a sizable informal sector, particularly the 5/6 type of lenders, which serves the financing requirements of investors." Second, although the Philippines has the oldest stock exchange in Asia, its performance in terms of the number of listed participants (183 as compared with 300 each in the relatively young markets of Malaysia and Thailand last December) and of stock market capitalization (which stood at 15.1 percent, of GDP as of 1990, compared with 105.9 percent for Malaysia and 29.5 percent for Thailand for the same period) has left much to be desired. Finally, the level of credit to the private sector as a percent of GDP in the Philippines stood at only 19.4 percent in 1990, compared with 68.7 percent in Thailand, 67.9 percent in Malaysia and 35.9 percent in Indonesia during the same year. "The low ratio of credit to private sector to GDP in the Philippines is an indication of the crowding out of private investors due to large government participation in the bonds market," Mr. Teves observed. "As of 1992, the outstanding issuances of National Government had reached P445 billion," he added. "More than half of these government securities issued were in the form of high-yielding short-term Treasury bill." These problems notwithstanding, Mr. Teves lauded government's recent moves to rectify the current situation, particularly through six measures, namely: - The creation of the BSP and the consequent rehabilitation of the old Central Bank which is expected to reduce the burden on the financial system, especially on banks, in the form of a reduced reserve requirement; - The creation of the Philippine Stock Exchange which introduced a one-price system, thus resolving the issue of inefficient pricing that existed during the time when there were two separate exchanges offering the same products at different prices; - The liberalization of foreign exchange regulations which has facilitated the entry of foreign investments and the repatriation of earnings and capital; - The liberalization of the banking sector which includes the removal of the policy of auctioning branches; - The utilization of the stock market as a vehicle for privatizing government-owned and-controlled corporations; and - The improvement in the SEC's policy and regulation regarding pricing, insider trading and disclosure of information. Still, there are three indispensable,fundamental conditions for the unimpeded growth of the financial sector which the country has yet to see, namely: - A stable macro economic environment that encourages wealth holders to maintain their savings in financial instruments and with financial institutions, as opposed to such non-liquid assets as land and jewelry; - An effective prudential regulatory environment that will encourages safe and sound financial practices to prevent too frequent bank failures and the collapse of financial institutions, which cause a setback in public confidence in the financial system; and - The regulatory environment should balance prudential regulation with providing enough flexibility so that financial innovation is not stymied and financial players are able to provide creative solutions to various needs in the market.
