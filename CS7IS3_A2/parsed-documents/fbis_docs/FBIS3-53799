The five-week-long programme involving crack commandos of the U.S. Army has just begun near Peshawar. "It is ironic that the U.S. is participating in this high altitude warfare training programme, which can only help the Pakistani Army gain more experience regarding the ongoing conflict over Siachen," a South Block source said. The irony is that the U.S. had quite recently urged India and Pakistan to end their stand off, offering even to underwrite a mutual withdrawal from the glacier. It is learnt that the Clinton Administration had been pressing India to withdraw its forces from Siachen and come to an agreement with Pakistan. This was part of Washington's move to promote "confidence building measures" between the two countries. Sources here revealed that the U.S. had gone so far as to say that it would provide the "necessary underpinnings" for de-escalation of the stand-off in Siachen. In plain terms, this meant that Washington was prepared to even monitor compliance to any agreement between New Delhi and Islamabad. But any monitoring of the demilitarisation of Siachen by the U.S. would have involved the presence of foreign military personnel in Kashmir. This was not something India was prepared to accept. Interestingly Pakistan, too, is believed to have rejected the U.S. plan, making it clear that the problem would have to be resolved bilaterally. MEA [Ministry of External Affairs] sources revealed that contrary to media reports, the Siachen dispute came up for discussion when India's Foreign Secretary Mr J.N. Dixit, met his Pakistani counterpart, Mr Shahryar Khan, in Islamabad earlier this month. It has been agreed that discussions would continue for the resolution of the problem, but both countries are against foreign intervention. Indian officials say that although Kashmir itself is probably not high on Washington's diplomatic agenda worldwide, a series of statements and actions emanating from the U.S. Capital indicate that President Clinton has adopted a more activist posture with regard to South and Central Asia. This has caused concern in the neighbourhood, which is clear from the recent Chinese statement opposing a "third option" (that is, independence) for Kashmir. Clearly, Beijing feels that the U.S. has some interest in floating the "third option" idea. There is also considerable bewilderment here regarding the reasons for the U.S. Army to train itself for high altitude warfare. Indian officials are of the view that while the Central Asia angle cannot be ruled out, Americans would be foolhardy to even contemplate a military role, now or in the future, in this region. At the same time, American intelligence agencies are learnt to be deeply involved in the Central Asia region, comprising former Soviet Republics. In a real life enactment of a John Le Carre type scenario, a former chief of the KGB in Afghanistan was murdered in mysterious circumstances recently. Close on its heels, a CIA operative in Ukraine was shot dead allegedly by a drunken guard. Later it was discovered that the CIA man had been neatly shot through his neck at point blank range, which ruled out the "drunken guard" explanation. Experts here say that despite the end of Cold War, the U.S. and Russia are currently engaged in a tussle for control over the Central Asian region. Russia's strategy is to ensure that any future military conflict, or even civil strife on its peripheries does not spill over into the Russian mainland. To achieve this aim, it wants to exercise some degree of control, through military presence is necessary, over its former republics. The CIS system has been designed precisely for this purpose. The Americans, on the other hand, want to undermine Russian influence, first over the East European States and then on Central Asia. As part of this strategy, Washington is trying to rope in the East European States under the NATO umbrella. This has been strongly opposed by the Russians who fear that Western forces would be on their doorsteps if the NATO expansion plan succeeds. Thus, the mounting American interest in Kashmir needs to be viewed in the larger global perspective, analysts in Delhi feel. The increasingly interventionist posture of the U.S., however, is putting immense pressure on India which is keen to resolve its problems with Pakistan through bilateral discussion. "We understand each other's compulsions. For example, we realise that Ms. Benazir Bhutto has certain domestic reasons for her current belligerence. The Pakistanis, in turn, know that no Indian Government can possibly negotiate the status of Kashmir. It is, therefore, in our mutual interest to de-escalate conflict situations, so that no third party can seek to intervene," an official explained. MEA officials also say that the recent Foreign Secretary-level talks in Islamabad have not been as much of a failure as initial reports suggested. They point to a statement by the Pakistan President, Mr. Farooq Leghari, in Karachi this week which commended the resumption of the dialogue and stressed that this must continue.
