PRENSA LATINA reported that the Cuban diplomat in Mexico said that the Chiapas State incident is strictly a domestic matter and that the Cuban Government supports all efforts being made to find a peaceful solution to the problem. Regarding specific charges aimed at linking Cuba with the so-called Zapatist Army of National Liberation [EZLN], Fernandez de Cossio said that they are groundless. The ambassador said that those making these charges only want to cast a shadow on the relations between Mexico and Cuba, adding that, for the longest time, these relations have been based on the principle of non-intervention.
