FR940725-2-00116 FR940725-2-00069 II. Discussion The Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Act. 9 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal meets the requirement of Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) that a clearing agency be organized and have the capacity to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible. 10 9 15 U.S.C. §78q&hyph;1 (1988). 10 15 U.S.C. §§78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(A) and (F) (1988). In accepting the deposit of trading and underlying currencies, OCC is recognizing the global nature of the financial industry today. For example, by accepting foreign currencies as margin deposits, OCC may reduce the risk of having to buy-in a foreign currency clearing member or a cross-rate clearing member upon default of a delivery obligation because the deposit of the underlying currency may be used to meet such obligation. The Commission believes that the acceptance of trading and underlying currencies as margin will provide OCC with added flexibility in managing a clearing member's default of a delivery obligation and, therefore, should further OCC's ability to meet its safeguarding obligations. For this reason, the Commission is temporarily approving those portions of the proposals enabling OCC to accept trading and underlying currencies as margin deposits. The Commission is temporarily approving the filings in order that the Commission and OCC will have adequate time and data to review the program before the Commission grants permanent approval. OCC has agreed to undertake a review of the program for accepting non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies as margin collateral after the program has been operational for one year. OCC's review will be submitted in writing to the Commission and will include such things as a study of the effects of accepting foreign currencies as margin collateral, any perceived risk to liquidity, and any perceived need for concentration limits. 11 11 Letter from James C. Yong, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, OCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Esq., Chief, Branch of Clearing Agency Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (March 16, 1994). III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that OCC's proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act. 12 12 15 U.S.C. §78q&hyph;1 (1988). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 13 that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;31 and SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;92&hyph;32) be, and hereby are, approved through December 31, 1995. 13 15 U.S.C. §78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 14 14 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1992). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
