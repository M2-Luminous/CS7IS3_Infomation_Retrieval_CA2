NATO expansion was at the center of discussions today, the first day of the NATO summit. NATO leaders today approved a plan to establish closer military ties with all former communist countries in East Europe, including Russia. However, NATO leaders refrained from adopting a demand by many former East European countries to join NATO as equal members. The United States proposed a plan to gradually expand the alliance to the east. According to reliable Greek sources in Brussels, the Greek side is taking a positive approach to the U.S. plan but believes this expansion should include all CSCE members, in order to open the way for the membership of Cyprus.
