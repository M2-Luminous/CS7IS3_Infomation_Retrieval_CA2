FR941021-2-00118 FR941021-2-00079 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,965] Benicia Industries, Inc., Benicia, CA; Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration By an application dated August 23, 1994, Lodge # 1173 of the Automotive Machinists Union (IAM) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on July 28, 1994 and published in the Federal Register on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41792). Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or (3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. The findings show that the workers are engaged in predelivery services for imported Mazda automobiles prior to transfering these vehicles to automotive dealershps. Installing components_radios, bumpers, emblems and performing repairs on imported automobiles would not provide a basis for a worker group certification. The dominant cause for the layoffs at Benicia was a corporate decision to eliminate the Benicia facility and perform the predelivery services at two other west coast ports. Worker separations resulting from a domestic transfer of activity would not provide a basis for a worker group certification. Conclusion After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 11th day of October 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26174 Filed 10&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
