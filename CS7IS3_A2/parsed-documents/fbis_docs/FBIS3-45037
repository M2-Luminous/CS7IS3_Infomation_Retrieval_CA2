Tang Shubei, vice-president of ARATS, said that political and legal issues on which the two sides are unlikely to achieve common ground should be excluded in talks between the two non-governmental organizations. "As non-governmental organizations, ARATS and SEF should not be involved in political issues on which Taiwan and the mainland can hardly have common ground," Tang said. "We hope that in negotiations between the two sides, relevant departments in Taiwan will return to the common ground that the two organizations achieved during the Wang-Koo [Gu] meeting in Singapore last year." During recent talks between the two sides, some SEF officials put forward such political and legal issues as "legal jurisdiction," which Tang said are not in accordance with the Wang-Koo agreement. The Wang-Koo meeting was a non-governmental, economic and businesslike meeting, Tang said. The meeting has helped solve many problems which cropped up during exchanges across the Taiwan Straits and brought more contacts across the straits. He said that ARATS has made continuous efforts following that meeting to implement the Wang-Koo agreement, and great progress has been achieved with efforts from both sides.
