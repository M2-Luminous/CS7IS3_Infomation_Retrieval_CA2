On the unresolved issue of an exchange of special envoys between North and South Korea, Yi said: "Theoretically, it is still possible to have the exchange in time," but "that is only what we are hoping for. In reality, this will be difficult to achieve." He indicated he was pessimistic about the possibility of exchanging special envoys before 21 March, when the third round of high level talks between the United States and the DPRK (North Korea) is scheduled to be held. Yi revealed that during recent talks with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, they had agreed that "if the exchange of special envoys does not materialize, the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks will be postponed," indicating the possibility the talks may be delayed. Yi cited the fact that on 12 March North Korea virtually withdrew the four prerequisites it had set [for the exchange of envoys] -- including "discontinuation of military exercises using nuclear arms" -- at the North-South working level negotiations in Panmunjom, and predicted that "even if the exchange of special envoys could not take place in time, I am optimistic that we will be able to reach agreement (in the end)." However, as far as the timetable for exchanging envoys is concerned, Yi said: "We would not be able to tell before the working level meeting on 16 March." Yi stated that the exchange of special envoys with North Korea has already been agreed between the North and South, and it would amount to an indirect dialogue between the leaders of the two sides, which might open the way to direct dialogue. Seoul, therefore, intends to work for this patiently. He also said that the reason the North is not eager to exchange envoys "seems to be that it wants to give priority to negotiations with the United States. However, the North is surely aware of the importance of direct North-South dialogue." Touching on the nuclear inspections currently being conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yi said: "While we cannot say they are proceeding smoothly, they are somehow progressing." On recent developments in North Korea, Yi said: "There are signs of policy change, such as the North's admitting the failure of its economic construction. It also seems to be in the process of reconsidering its withdrawal from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)."
