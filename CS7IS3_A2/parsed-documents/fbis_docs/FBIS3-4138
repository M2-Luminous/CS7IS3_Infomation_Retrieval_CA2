Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua reminded the teams today that although China's economy has been growing at a rapid speed, price rises and high-pressure inflation have arisen as two big problems in the country's current economic outlook. "The urgent task is to find a quick solution to the problems of a large expansion of investment in fixed assets and a relatively backward management system over investments and prices, which are the key factors leading to inflation and price rises," he said. Timely completion of the inspection work will be helpful toward implementing policies the central government has drawn up for this year's overall work in 1994 and toward the fulfillment of tasks set for 1994 in terms of reform, opening and economic development, he said. The price inspections will mark random charges on daily necessities like food and cooking oil and extortionary, unauthorized price rises which take advantage of market monopolies on important productive raw materials such as rolled steel, electricity, coal, petroleum and chemical fertilizer, and unauthorized extra charges on services. The inspection of investments in fixed assets will focus on newly-started projects. The team will make clear the source of investment and the extent of funding for national key projects, see to the stoppage of some projects that must be suspended or stopped, and tend to other matters. The vice-premier called on the members of the inspection team to make thorough-going investigations and study and report on the situation as it is. Moreover, he added, they must also abide by laws and regulations and be clean and honest themselves in performing their duties. Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, has been appointed head of the price inspection team, which is composed of executives concerned with state planning, supervision, finance, banking, taxation, auditing, industry and commerce and technological supervision. Chen will also head the other team concerning the inspection of investment in fixed assets. Its members are drawn from departments of the State Planning Commission, the State Economy and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Supervision, the State Development Bank and the State Statistics Bureau.
