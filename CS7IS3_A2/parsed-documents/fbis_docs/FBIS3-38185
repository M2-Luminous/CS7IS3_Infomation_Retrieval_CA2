This came out in a statement by Gustave Feissel, the UN Secretary General's alternate special representative, upon his return to Cyprus this afternoon from Ankara, where he and special representative Joe Clark held consultations on the confidence-building measures after similar talks in Nicosia and Athens. Asked if it is his understanding that the conditions set by Rauf Denktas through his first letter remain in force, Mr. Feissel said: I would not say that what is outlined in Denktas' first letter fall under the category of conditions. Certain assessments and concepts are outlined. However, I would not like to comment on them before I discuss them with the two leaders. Concerning Denktas' second letter, Mr. Feissel said that it is brief and deals with substance. Denktas notes in that letter that he accepts in principle the package of measures as presented in ?he Secretary General's report. Mr. Feissel described the talks in Athens and Ankara as useful. However, he avoided any statement on the substance of the consultations, saying that he would first prefer to have another round of consultations with President Glavkos Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas. He also noted that during his meetings -- which probably will be held tomorrow -- he will outline the results of the consultations in Athens and Ankara and he will discuss with President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas their appraisals of the situation as it has been formulated. Mr. Feissel further said that the result of his contacts with President Kliridhis and Rauf Denktas will help Joe Clark -- who is going to leave Ankara for New York -- to firm up the suggestions he will submit to the UN Secretary General. John Paul Kavanagh also returned to Cyprus with Mr. Feissel.
