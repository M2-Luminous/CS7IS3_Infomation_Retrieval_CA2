Marking the KPA founding anniversary -- a felicitous revolutionary day -- I warmly congratulate the courageous officers and men of the KPA and the Korean People's Security Forces, who are firmly defending the defense line of the fatherland by cherishing a lofty sense of loyalty to the party and to the revolution, in the name of the Political Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee and of the Central Military Commission of the party, under the authorization of the respected comrade supreme commander. [applause] I also express the lofty sense of reverence to the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs and to the patriotic fighters of the People's Army, who dedicated their precious lives for independence and liberation of the fatherland, for freedom of the people, for the party and for the revolution. [applause] I extend warm congratulations to the old anti-Japanese fighters, old war veterans, disabled soldiers, and discharged soldiers, who registered heroic feats in the arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and in the great fatherland liberation war and who are continuously blooming the revolutionary flowers of the socialist construction today. [applause] I send warm greetings to all people who are vigorously struggling to defend, protect, and glorify the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style in firm unity with the party and the leader and who love and sincerely help the People's Army as if they are their own offspring. [applause] Comrades, more than 60 years have passed since our people founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army [KPRA] -- their first revolutionary armed forces -- to achieve the cause of national liberation by upholding the banner of the chuche idea. At this significant occasion of commemorating the 62d anniversary of the founding of the KPA today, we are recalling with deep emotion the path of honorable struggle along which our revolutionary armed forces have traversed and their immortal achievements. The cause of independence and the cause of socialism of the popular masses are carried out in a fierce confrontation and struggle against the imperialists and all sorts of reactionaries, and these causes can be carried out successfully by the armed support of the revolutionary armed forces. The country and people without their mighty revolutionary armed forces cannot defend the fatherland and the revolution from the imperialists' aggression, nor can they victoriously advance the cause of socialism. The cause of building the revolutionary armed forces in our country was pioneered by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, and it was continuously deepened and developed by the victorious advance of the chuche revolutionary cause. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth a policy on building genuine revolutionary armed forces to organize and improve the armed struggle against the Japanese imperialists based on his deep insight into the historical lesson of our country's anti-Japanese movement for national liberation learned during the period he pioneered the course of the Korean revolution. This was a revolutionary policy purporting that the Korean revolution must be carried out by the Korean people themselves. It was an original policy that opened a new road for the anticolonial war for national liberation and for the building of the revolutionary armed forces. [applause] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the KPRA on 25 April 1932 based on a strong political and military foundation, which he himself provided through his energetic struggle to realize his policy on building the revolutionary armed forces, and proclaimed the founding of our revolutionary armed forces to the entire world. [applause] The founding of the KPRA was a magnificent birth of true chuche-type revolutionary armed forces in our country. It was a historic event that brought forth a momentous turning point in our people's anti-Japanese struggle for national liberation and in the development of their communist movement. [applause] With the founding of the KPRA, our people could victoriously wage the struggle, on a new higher plane, for the independence of the country and the liberation of the people with their genuine revolutionary armed forces. This was the very starting point of the glorious history of our revolutionary armed forces. Our revolutionary armed forces have traversed a proud victorious road for the past six decades through the blaze of the stern and arduous struggle. With their heroic struggle, our revolutionary armed forces have made immortal achievements that will shine long in the history of the country. [applause] The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: Our People's Army has waged a heroic struggle to defend the party and the leader and to defend the gains of the country and the revolution and has made great accomplishments for the party and the revolution. The KPRA, which was the first rank of our revolutionary armed forces, had to wage a bloody struggle against the strong imperialist enemy right from the time of its founding. The anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle was the most glorious revolutionary war in which our revolutionary armed forces defeated powerful imperialists, fighting with them over a protracted period of time under unprecedented arduous and grim conditions. During the severe anti-Japanese revolutionary war, when there was no rear area of the nation or support from regular armed forces, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song victoriously organized and led the KPRA while solving difficult and complex problems raised in the course of implementing the general Korean revolution, including the armed struggle, in an original way based on a chuche- oriented position. [applause] The KPRA men fully demonstrated the revolutionary Army's militant power everywhere by using chuche-oriented hit-and-run tactics under the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's extraordinary military and political leadership. At last, our revolutionary armed forces smashed the Japanese imperialist aggressors and brilliantly achieved the historic cause of liberalizing the fatherland by carrying out the heroic struggle for 15 years while overcoming various trials beyond man's imagination. [applause] During the fortitude anti-Japanese struggle, the single-hearted unity of revolutionary ranks around the leader [suryong] was achieved, vivid models of the faithfulness of upholding the leader [yongdoja] were created, and our party's brilliant revolutionary traditions were firmly prepared. These are deep and stout roots of our party and Army, as well as an eternal footstone that guarantees the victory of our revolution. [applause] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song strengthened and developed the KPRA into the regular armed forces, KPA, in a short period following the liberalization, based on the revolutionary armed forces' valuable traditions prepared in the period of the anti-Japanese struggle. The KPA, the direct descendant of the KPRA, has been strengthened and developed into modern, regular armed forces and has excellently fulfilled its honorable mission in defending our party's cause. The invincible might of the KPA was fully demonstrated in the fatherland liberation war, which was a great revolutionary war in which our people defended their fatherland after defeating [tasung] the U.S. imperialists, the head of world imperialism, for the first time in history by carrying out the heroic all-people struggle. While saddling himself with the heavy burden for both the front and the rear in the severe period of the life-and-death war -- decisive to the destiny of the fatherland -- the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song united the entire party, the entire Army, and all the people as one and organized and mobilized them to the sublime struggle to destroy the enemies, thus leading the fatherland liberation war to victory. [applause] Upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's orders, the wise and brave soldiers of our Army, Navy, and Air Force rose as one and sagaciously fought to defend every inch of the fatherland at the cost of their blood, while bearing deep in mind their lofty mission for the fatherland the people. Heroic feats of the People's Army officers and men, who guaranteed the victory in the war by destroying the enemy's tanks and warships with human bombs and by blocking the enemy's guns with their hearts on the field of fierce battle with the enemy, will be handed down forever with the history of the great fatherland liberation war. [applause] During the period of the arduous war, all the people in the rear area, regardless of age or sex, rose and supported [wonho] the front line and ensured wartime production by defending their plants and villages. Thus, they made great contributions to the victory of the war. Officers and men of our People's Army inflicted disgraceful defeat on the U.S. imperialist aggressors, who boasted being the strongest in the world, by demonstrating mass heroism and a sense of peerless sacrifice in the great fatherland liberation war. Thus, they honorably defended independence of the fatherland and sovereignty of the people. [applause] Our people, who rose in a just fight against an armed invasion of the imperialists, won active support and encouragement from hundreds of millions of people in the world. In particular, the Chinese people, who carried out a common struggle against the Japanese imperialists for a long time, dispatched support forces under the slogan: "Resist America and aid Korea," and helped our people's struggle with their blood. Our people are always grateful to our friends for the sincere support and encouragement they extended to us during the most arduous period. We will never forget them. [applause] Our people won victory in fights against the two most atrocious and strong imperialist powers in the anti-Japanese revolutionary war and in the fatherland liberation war. These victories were vigorous demonstrations of the might and invincibility of our revolutionary ranks, who are firmly rallied behind the party and the leader. [applause] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward the self-defense military line for converting the entire Army into a cadre Army, for modernizing the entire Army, for arming all people, and for turning the whole country into a fortress, in conformity with the demand of the situation created after the war and of the development of our revolution. He also put forward the outstanding and unique line for advancing economic construction and national defense construction at the same time. He wisely led the struggle to implement the line. With thorough implementation of the party's line, our People's Army has been strengthened to a one-a-match-for-one-hundred revolutionary armed forces, and our nation came to highly display its dignified appearance as a strong independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive socialist country. [applause] The People's Army smashed every step of the enemy's constant aggression and war provocation maneuvers, and reliably defended the security of the nation and the people. Thus, the People's Army made a great contribution to construction projects for the nation's prosperity and the people's happiness. Whenever the revolution faced an arduous trial, our People's Army tenaciously defended and protected the party and the leader at the van of struggle, and actively carried to accomplishment the party's line and policy. When the situation at home and abroad was complicated and difficult after the war, the People's Army firmly defended the party's cause with arms by upholding the slogan: "Let us defend with our lives the party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il-song!" At the same time, our People's Army displayed heroic feats in the great socialist construction by upholding the slogan of loyalty: "What the party decides, we will do!" Thus, it honorably fulfilled its mission as the Army of the leader, of the party, and of the people. [applause] Indeed, the brilliant history of our people's revolution has been embroidered with proud feats of our revolutionary Armed Forces registered before the nation and people. The great creations built on the land of the fatherland contain precious blood and sweat of officers and men of the People's Army. Today our People's Army has entered a new historic period of its development by following the outstanding and refined leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, and an epochal turn is being effected in all domains of building the Army. [applause] Our comrade supreme commander, who directed great efforts to strengthen and develop the People's Army at an early date, put forward the outstanding line of building the Army and remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea in compliance with the new demand of development of the revolution, and energetically led the struggle to implement the line. The line of remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea is the most just program for building the Army, which enables us to make officers and men of the People's Army genuine revolutionary vanguards who are unswervingly loyal to the party and to the leader and to provide reliable military insurance for the socialist cause by accomplishing the chuche-based cause for building the Army. [applause] The line of remodeling the entire Army on the chuche idea has been vigorously accelerated under the outstanding leadership of the respected comrade supreme commander, and as a result, the chuche-based system of commanding the Army, under which the entire Army moves as one under the leadership of the party, has been firmly established within the People's Army. The chuche idea has been thoroughly embodied in all domains of building the Army and military activities, and single-hearted unity and tradition of loyalty have been brilliantly inherited. Today all ranks of the People's Army are filled with death-defying determination to loyally uphold the leadership of the party, no matter what storm and trial may come forward, and to become a fortress and a shield to defend and protect the respected comrade supreme commander. [applause] Our comrade supreme commander developed the chuche-oriented tactics in compliance with the demand of modern warfare and with the concrete conditions in our country, and wisely led us to build a powerful modern defense industry and to constantly strengthen combat capabilities and armed equipment of the People's Army. Under the leadership of the respected comrade supreme commander, our People's Army has been fostered to be a loyal combat unit capable of fighting for the party and the leader by dedicating its life and one-a-match-for-one-hundred strong Army with all sorts of powerful offensive and defensive means. Our revolutionary Armed Forces are upholding as their supreme commander the great general and great commander who has indomitable will and courage and outstanding strategy and alchemy. Herein lies the guarantee for all victories and for constant strengthening and developing of our revolutionary Armed Forces. [applause] Together with the People's Army, combat capabilities of the Red Worker-Peasant Militia and Red Youth Guard have been remarkably strengthened, and all people have been armed and the whole country has been further consolidated as an impregnable fortress. Our party's idea for military-people unity has been brilliantly embodied in the entire Army and whole society, and as a result, blood ties between the military and people have been further intensified at a new higher stage. As long as we have the revolutionary Armed Forces, which have been strengthened and developed into indomitable combat ranks, and as long as we have the all-people defense system with the People's Army as its center, we can smash any aggressor and firmly defend the party's cause -- the socialist cause. We can say this with confidence. [applause] The party, the Army, and the people are firmly united as one with our comrade supreme commander -- the great military strategist and iron-willed sagacious commander -- as the center, and constitute a strong independent main force of the revolution. Therefore, our socialism is advancing victoriously without wavering even in the midst of violent upheaval. [applause] This invincible might of our revolution was verified again through a severe trial last year. Last year's political and military confrontation between our people and the U.S. imperialists was a large battle without gunshots. It was also an all-people, life-and-death battle to protect our party and the socialist fatherland. When the fatherland and the revolution faced a grave trial, our comrade supreme commander took the stern self-defensive measure of declaring a semi-war state of the entire nation, all the people, and the entire Army to cope with the then-prevailing situation. After receiving the supreme commander's order from the bottom of their hearts, officers and men of the People's Army and all the people launched as one into the struggle to protect the country's sovereignty and revolutionary gains and honorably defended the dignity and safety of their socialist fatherland by smashing the enemy's challenge and aggression maneuver. This was a victory of our comrade supreme commander's extraordinary military strategies, braveness, and iron-firm faith and will as well as a great victory of the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses. [applause] The valuable achievements and immortal feats registered by our revolutionary Armed Forces were a brilliant victory of the chuche- oriented military ideology of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il as well as the result of the outstanding and seasoned leadership of the party and the leader. [applause] At this meaningful moment of commemorating the 62d anniversary of the founding of the KPA, I extend the greatest honor and the warmest gratitude, along with the boundless admiration and fervent loyalty of all people across the country and of the People's Army officers and men, to Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and our people, who founded our revolutionary Armed Forces at an early age and has led them along the single road of victory, thus greatly demonstrating the honor of our fatherland and our nation and building a firm military guarantee for the completion of the socialist cause in our country, and to the respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, an extraordinary military genius. [applause] Comrades: Today's situation for our revolution is very complicate and tense. We must build socialism amid fierce confrontation with the enemy and achieve the historic cause of national reunification. The U.S. imperialists and reactionaries have unprecedentedly strengthened anti-Republic maneuvers in order to isolate and crush our nation -- the stronghold of socialism -- on pretext of the so-called nuclear problem. By bringing numerous war means and troops into South Korea, they are leading the situation on the Korean peninsula into the brink of war while militarily threatening us. We should further strengthen the People's Army to accelerate the revolution and construction and to firmly defend the popular masses-oriented socialism of our own style under today's acute situation. The might of the People's Army lies, above all, in its political and ideological superiority. We should intensify the party's political work in the People's Army so as to firmly arm all soldiers with the chuche idea and to make them resolute revolutionary fighters who do not hesitate in sacrificing their youth and lives for the party, the leader, the fatherland, and the people. The endless loyalty to the party's leadership is the life of the People's Army. Officers and men of the People's Army should thoroughly establish a revolutionary military trait, with which the entire Army acts as one according to the supreme commander's order, and should make all ranks of the People's Army filled with the revolutionary, militant military spirit of working and living in conformity with the party's ideology and intent. [applause] The ethos of unity between officers and men and between the party and society is an important content of the ideological superiority of the People's Army and lofty trait to be maintained by all soldiers. The officers and men of the People's Army should show the unity between the upper and lower levels, continue to highly display the ethos of unity between officers and men and between the party and society with which they help and lead each other, and further be possessed with lofty traits of a revolutionary army. The political and ideological superiority of the People's Army can display its invincible might when it is combined with military and technological preparedness. In accordance with the party's military line of self-reliance, we should thoroughly implement the party's policy of turning the whole Army into an army of cadres, a modernized army, and continue to exert efforts to make all the people armored and fortify the entire country, thereby fortify the self-reliant national defense power that is able to resolutely defend and safeguard the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style in any changing situation. [applause] The People's Army should put emphasis on combat and political training as the fundamental task and thoroughly implement the training methods and principles presented by the party. All soldiers should be strongly armed with our party's military strategic ideology and chuche-motivated war method, foster them as one-a-match-for-a-hundred fighters with high combat efficiency suitable for modern war, and further reinforce the People's Army companies. Highly displaying the traditional ethos of army-people unity is important for strengthening the People's Army and completing the preparations for a combat. Only when the People's Army help the people--the people actively support the Army, and the Army and the people literally become harmoniously united--can the People's Army be strengthened and developed into a matchless rank and win the fights against the enemies. Officers of the People's Army should maintain the spirit of devoted service for the fatherland and the people, and continue to demonstrate heroic feats in the struggle to build socialist economy and protect the people's lives and property. The people should establish social ethos that stresses military affairs, and love and sincerely support the People's Army as family. In this way, the Army and the people can firmly be prepared to fight as one sharing the destiny of life and death in the contingency. The single-hearted unity between the party and the revolutionary rank should be strengthened by all means. The single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses is our party's revolutionary philosophy and our revolution's mighty weapon. As did in the past, we should face the enemies with single-hearted unity in the future to push forward and complete our revolution with the might of single-hearted unity. [applause] All the people and the KPA officers and men should be loyal toward the party and the leader and have their belief and character, and defend our firmly united revolutionary rank's single-hearted unity around the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander like the apples of the eyes. Economic construction is an important work for firmly building up our socialist revolutionary position. In this regard, we should thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy so as to further strengthen and highly display the superiority of socialism of our own style. In order to thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy, we should highly manifest the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. We should break through difficulties and obstacles in socialist economic construction with a revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, and at the same time we should continue to work without faltering with the firm ideological determination to carry out assigned revolutionary tasks with our own strength. National reunification is the nation's supreme task that should not be delayed even for a moment. We should achieve the cause of national reunification at the earliest possible date to achieve our nation's unanimous desire. Thus, we should hand a reunified fatherland over to our next generations. Our party and the Government of the Republic have made all sincere efforts to achieve national reunification under the principle of national independence in conformity with the desire of the whole nation and the desire of the times. However, a graver obstacle has been created on the road ahead of national reunification because of the maneuvers of the United States and the South Korean authorities. The United States is adhering to the military adventure [kunsajok mohom] to crush [apsal] our Republic by stepping up anti-Republic pressure commotions more openly in the international arena over our nuclear problem. The South Korean authorities frequently stage large-scale military exercises against our Republic in collusion with outside forces and are driving North-South relations to a dangerous phase while talking about military countermeasures and an international cooperation system under the pretext of our nuclear problem. All of these moves in South Korea show that traitor Kim Yong-sam is precisely an out-and-out flunkeyist nation-seller who surpasses successive puppets, a treacherous and wicked fascist hangman, and implacable warmaniac. As for our nuclear problem that the U.S. imperialists and their followers are clamoring about, it is a product of the antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers that the United States has been tenaciously perpetrating. It is precisely the United States who brought nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula and is actually threatening us. It is also the United States who clamors about the suspicion of the nonexistent nuclear development in the North. Even now the United States is deploying improved new type missiles to South Korea and is, thus, further strengthening military pressure on us. This proves that the United States has not renounced its wild ambition to keep hold on South Korea as an advanced base of the Far East and that it is using the nuclear problem as a means to isolate and crush our Republic. The danger of war is growing momentarily on the Korean peninsula because of the reckless military threat and war provocation maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique [choson pandoesonun chonjaengui wihomi sisi kakkakuro kogago issomnida]. Today, at a time when our nation, which has been forced by outside forces to endure the sufferings of division for half a century, is faced with even the danger of suffering the holocaust of nuclear war. We can never look at this grave situation with folded arms. Although they are frantically running wild to isolate and suffocate our Republic and crush our socialism under the pretext of the nuclear problem, the U.S. imperialists and international reactionaries cannot frighten our people with any pressure, threat, or blackmail, and no high-handedness or pressure can fool us. As recognized by the world, our people do not like to engage in empty talk. They are a resolute people [kyoltansong innun inmin] who will do what they say they will and will not do anything when they say they will not. Responding to dialogue with dialogue and to war with war is our firm position. [applause] Our people who treasure the nation's independence and the country's peace do not want war, but we will not beg for peace even if our sovereign rights are infringed upon. Pursuing aggression and war under the pretext of peace is the imperialists' conventional means. All situations taking place today on the Korean peninsula and the international arena show that the imperialists' aggressive and plunderous nature will not change at all and that we must not have any kind of fantasy about imperialism. The officers and men of the People's Army and the People's Security Forces and members of the Red Worker-Peasant Militia and Red Youth Guards must be firmly armed with the chuche-oriented point of view on war, observe with vigilance the moves of the enemies, and assume a full combat readiness to destroy in a single blow whenever and wherever the enemies attack. [applause] If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula where U.S. nuclear weapons are concentratedly deployed, it will easily draw the world into the ravages of a thermonuclear war. Then, man will suffer an irrecoverable wretched calamity. The United States and the South Korean authorities must contemplate over the grave consequences this reckless act will bring about and act with discretion. The Japanese reactionary class must correctly look at the trend of the times and must not commit a rash and thoughtless action. If the U.S. imperialists and their following forces kindle the flames of a war on Korea to the very end, running counter to the trend of the times, our people and the People's Army will fight to the end for the party and the leader and for our socialist fatherland obtained through blood, to thoroughly annihilate and sweep away the aggressors and once again manifest the spirit of the heroic Korea. [applause] Today's situation is presenting a very grave problem before our 70 million people of whether to open the road for the fatherland's reunification through great national unity, or become a victim of the big powers by carrying out hostility and confrontation between the fellow countrymen. Our nation must move toward the road of reunifying the fatherland through great national unity. Great national unity must be achieved to break the current deadlock, defend the nation's dignity and sovereign rights, and open the road for the fatherland's independent and peaceful reunification. All the fellow Korean countrymen of the North, South, and overseas must unite as one under the banner of the 10-point program of great national unity for the fatherland's reunification to carry out a nation-wide struggle. Therefore, we will realize the cause of the fatherland's reunification without fail. [applause] Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is an honorable and sacred struggle for the fatherland's prosperity and man's bright future. Voices of the world's revolutionary people supporting the socialist cause and our people's struggle for the fatherland's reunification are being raised with each passing day, and our revolution's international solidarity is being all the more strengthened. Amid the active support and encouragement of the world's progressive people, there is no power in this world that can obstruct our people's advance fighting for the just cause of the leadership of the great leader and the great party. We will also be always victorious. [applause] Let us all single-heartedly unite around the party Central Committee accompanied by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song to all the more vigorously fight in realizing the cause of the fatherland's reunification and completing the chuche revolutionary cause. [applause] Hurrah for Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause] Hurrah for the glorious WPK, the organizer and leader [hyangdoja] of all victories of the Korean people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause] Let there be victory and glory for the officers and men of the heroic KPA. [applause]
