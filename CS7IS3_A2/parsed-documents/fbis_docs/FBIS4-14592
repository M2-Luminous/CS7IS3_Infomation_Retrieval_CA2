Lately, there has been a big upsurge in Russian-Polish top-level contacts, Kozyrev said after the meeting. However, the Polish press at times carries irresponsible unofficial statements that clearly do not help to strengthen bilateral relations. The minister expressed the hope that the talks in Moscow between the members of the Polish parliamentary delegation and Russian parliamentarians and representatives of executive power would lead to the elimination of certain distortions.
