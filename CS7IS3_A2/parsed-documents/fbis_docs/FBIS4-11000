Here are some of them: In 1992 (by which time the crisis was already full blown), 191,800 couples got married, all in civil ceremonies. Church marriages are so rare that they do not appear in any statistics. (The Family Department of the Archbishopric of Havana estimates that there are about 2,000 in the entire country, which amounts to one percent of civil marriages.) The marriage rate is 18.2 per 1,000 inhabitants, a significant increase over the 7.1 per 1,000 reported in 1980. The government gives each newlywed couple a package of goods and services that are difficult to obtain by other means these days: a wedding cake, three cases of beer, an order of "hors d'oeuvres," and a chance to go to a special store and buy products such as sheets, towels, irons, pressure cookers, underwear, etc. That is, if they are in stock. In addition, for their honeymoon it gives them a reservation for two nights and three days at a hotel or house located on the beach. On weekends, couples flock to Marriage Palaces--old mansions adapted for the purpose--and upon emerging, are greeted with hugs and kisses from small family groups. "We do not throw rice because there is none, but we do give out applause and congratulations," says Antonia Vazquez, mother of the 18-year-old bride Odalis Lugo, who is already on her second marriage. The bride and groom usually wear wedding attire rented from the state. Recently, it also became possible for "private parties" to rent such clothing to make a living, at 350 pesos for a bridal gown (the monthly wage of a medical specialist) and 200 pesos for the groom's suit. Some couples also rent cars--1950's-era convertible Fairlanes and Cadillacs decorated with balloons--that lead noisy caravans through the streets of Havana. Although the increase in the number of weddings is considerable, it is not disturbing. According to the CIPS study, it is within worldwide norms. The significant thing is that for every 100 marriages, there are more than 80 couples living in common-law relationships; for every five married women, there are four living in common-law relationships. These "consensual unions" are particularly frequent among young people under the age of 20, and it is disturbing when they occur between teenagers under the age of 15; in the last decade there has been an increase of 100 percent in these. In other words, many young people in Cuba do not believe in marriage. In Cuba, according to the study, common-law relationships are concentrated in the eastern part of the island (Las Tunas, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo), especially among mulattoes and mestizos and, in general, among low-income and unemployed persons. Love and Affection But if marriage is easy in Cuba, divorce is even easier. All that is required is 100 pesos, the papers, and the presence of one of the spouses. Between 1955 (prior to the revolution) and 1988, the marriage rate multiplied 2.8 times. During that same period, the divorce rate increased 12.5-fold. According to data from the UNPF, there is one divorce for every four marriages. "Nowadays," says the CIPS study, "Cuba has one of the highest divorce rates in the world. It is 3.4 per 1,000 inhabitants, exceeded only by the United States (4.8) and Puerto Rico (4.2)." Fifty percent of divorces occur within the first two years of the marriage, and in general, among young people under 30. Recently, youths between the ages of 15 and 20 have begun divorcing much more frequently, as much as five times more. According to a CIPS study, young people who start families do not have enough information about contraceptives. The pregnancy rate among teenage girls is growing by the day. For every 1,000 women under the age of 20, there were 57.1 pregnancies. These women dropped out of school, became isolated from their contemporaries or were unable to spend free time with them, and "became detached from the political-social activities aimed at that age group." Abortion is not prohibited in Cuba. Health authorities try to discourage women from using it as a birth-control method, and provide guidance to prevent pregnancy. Nevertheless, every day dozens of "regulations of the menstrual cycle" and "interruptions of pregnancies" are performed in maternity hospitals. Most of the women receiving them are under the age of 20. They go to these hospitals accompanied by their partners or their mothers. The CIPS study states: "Abortion is a woman's right, but tolerance of its use as a contraceptive method poses an ethical problem that should be confronted by society, by the family, and by the couple themselves." And it offers these statistics: "Forty-five percent of pregnancies are interrupted, and 81.8 abortions occur for every 100 deliveries." Normally, marital conflicts between Cubans are due to the couple's lack of information, the lack of understanding of what marriage is all about, the young age of the spouses, and their limited education. Many weddings are "forced by the parents," and another factor is the poor conditions in which the couples live: the shortage of funds, unemployment, the lack of a home of their own, and other conditions. Indeed, the housing shortage is a decisive factor. In view of the lack of housing in Cuba, especially in Havana, newlyweds have to live as "add-ons"--that is the way Cubans say what we in Mexico call "keeping company"--with the parents of one of them. It is not rare for a small house to hold the parents, their single children, the married children and their spouses, and the grandchildren. [passage omitted]
