The resignations of Jorge Camet and Alfonso Bustamante y Bustamante were especially due to the enactment on Thursday of a law which the Peruvian Congress approved at the beginning of the week. The law modifies the procedure that has been applied by the Supreme Court up to now whenever it had to rule on a case of jurisdiction between criminal justice and military justice. According to observers, the application of this law would allow military judges to try the "La Cantuta" case -- the disappearance at La Cantuta University during the summer of 1992 of nine students and a professor, whose charred bodies were found a year later -- in which several military officers are implicated. The voting on this law and its enactment by President Fujimori led to a real scandal in Peru and observers have pointed out that the text -- published in the official newspaper on 10 February -- did not have the signature of Bustamante. Moreover, according to other rumors disclosed by LA REPUBLICA newspaper, the United States, concerned over the attitude of the Peruvian authorities regarding the La Cantuta incident, is reportedly ready to announce its withdrawal from Peru's Support Group.
