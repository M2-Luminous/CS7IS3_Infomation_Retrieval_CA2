[passage omitted] Mr. Chairman, your committee's session is being held at a very important and critical period in view of the international changes and their impact on human rights in various parts of the world. The international changes which put an end to the Cold War period were accompanied by many regional and internal wars in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. As regards the Middle East, the situation is still the same and the volcano of its wars has not settled yet. You know, ladies and gentlemen, the numerous human rights violations generated by these wars. Human rights violations perpetrated during wars or foreign occupation resulting from war may be the worst and the most serious ones, and in any case of war, people are the victims, be this war real or cold, international or regional or internal. The result is always victims among people. No one can predict putting an end to one kind of war and ignore other kinds of wars which are themselves resulting from other wars. The Cold War has come to an end but other wars have been ignited and they are ceaselessly threatening to expand. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to inform you from this solemn rostrum that out of our commitment to human rights, democratic freedoms, international laws, and the UN Charter, and out of our concern for building a healthy, dynamic, open, and active society, our first decision dated 30 September 1993 following the decision to establish a Palestinian National Authority, was to approve the creation of the higher Palestinian national human rights commission as an independent body. The decision stipulates that the task of this commission is to follow up and secure the provision of the requirements for the protection of human rights in all Palestinian laws, legislation, and systems, as well as in the work of the various services, bodies, and institutions belonging to the Palestinian national authority. We confirmed a few weeks ago the official recognition of this body which will include a number of moral and legal personalities and it will be chaired by sister Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at the world's geopolitical map from the perspective of the principles of human rights and international humanitarian law, we would not be able to move from one place to another without putting our fingers on grave and systematic violations of human rights, whether by torture or other forms of inhumane treatment, premeditated killing, arbitrary execution, detention and arrest without trial, racism, racial discrimination and segregation, foreign occupation and domination, hatred of immigrants and the emergence of neo Nazism, poverty and deliberate impoverishment, all forms of denial of national, economic, social and cultural rights, right of self-determination of peoples under foreign occupation and domination, religious extremism, terrorism, state terrorism, discrimination against women, and the absence of the sovereignty of law. This is why I have the pleasure of praising the Vienna Human Rights Declaration which emanated from the international conference on human rights held in Vienna in the middle of last year. I would also like to praise the United Nations General Assembly's decision to adopt this important declaration. Ladies and gentlemen, at two previous sessions I addressed you on the state of human rights everywhere in the world and, specifically, in Palestine. I addressed you on human rights and the occasional [ahyanan] violations, exploitation, and mistreatment to which these rights are exposed. [passage omitted] I have also spoken to you about the extent of the suffering of our Palestinian people under Israeli occupation as a result of violations of human rights and basic liberties, which the violations have extended to include all rights without exception, starting with violation of the right to live and ending with violation of the right of expression. This was achieved by subjecting our people to deliberate killing, torture, arbitrary arrest, deportation, seizure of land and building settlements on them, collective punishment, disruption of educational programs, closure of schools and universities, attacks on places of worship and holy places, closure of trade unions, destruction of the Palestinian national economy and our people's right to exercise self-determination in their territory. Furthermore, the occupation in itself constitutes a grave violation of our people's human rights in our occupied land. Your respected committee has dealt with this painful reality for more than 26 years, and has rejected and condemed it, and called for its end. It has also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Palestinian territories, including Holy Jerusalem and the other Arab territories it occupied by force in 1967, as a radical solution for the deterioration of human rights and the return of the Palestinian people's right to their homeland and self-determination without external interference. This action has been taken through its numerous resolutions which have continued with its latest, 49th, session in which it appointed Mr. Rene Felber as special envoy for investigation into Israel's violations of the principles of international law, international human law, and the provisions of the fourth Geneva agreement in our occupied land. [passage omitted] Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, our Palestinian people, who have made huge sacrifices for decades in order to recover their homeland and rights, are the people most in need of a just and comprehensive peace because of foreign occupation and the injustice and tragedies of expulsion as a result of that, as well as denial of their national rights. These rights were affirmed by your respected commission, the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, and the other international meetings and were strengthened by the principles of international legality and international law. Our people's struggle for peace has become linked to our deep conviction in peace based on justice, and there is no peace with occupation or aggression and denial of rights. On this basis, we have continuously responded to all the international peace initiatives which led in the end to the Madrid Conference and the resulting negotiations in Washington and Oslo, which also produced the agreement on the Declaration of Principles which was signed in Washington on 13 September last between the PLO and Israel's Government, as well as the declaration of mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel. The signing of the above mentioned agreement came as a first step expressing good intentions and goodwill to achieve the peace of the brave, which is based on justice and respect for human rights, a peace which turns the page of history containing the occupation, tragedies, wars, and hostilities. It is also a peace which opens wide prospects before a new stage of relations, of fruitful cooperation between the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples which will be based on good neighborliness, mutual respect, and solving conflicts with peaceful means, dialogue, and arbitration. The signing of this agreement under the auspices of President Clinton, the evidence of the U.S. and Russian co-sponsors of the conference, and the blessing of the whole world formed the first necessary step to move forward on the road of finding a comprehensive and just settlement to the conflict in the Middle East on the basis of implementing Security Council's resolutions 242 and 338. [passage omitted] We entered these talks with good intentions to achieve a comprehensive and just peace, and we are still pursuing them with good intention. We hope that the Israeli Government has the same good intention and gives it a concrete form toward the agreement by adhering completely to it in letter and and in spirit. [passage omitted] All this took place after the signing of the agreement in Washington. It stirred up negative reactions among our Palestinian people, the Arab masses, and the peoples of the region and generated convictions that the Israeli Government is not serious in implementing this agreement. The seriousness of this is doubled by Israel which places obstacles to the implementation of the agreement and attempts to change its aims according to its whims, for example, the redeployment of Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region instead of withdrawing from them in accordance with the Declaration of Principles, in addition to other problems. These attempts still form the major characteristic of the Israeli negotiators, and this motivated us to look for the good intentions and the measures to make the required confidence available in order to move forward toward the hoped for goals in a comprehensive and just peace, which we have not managed to feel so far. Mr. Chairman, we would like to affirm to you our unyielding faith in the peace process, and on the basis of that we will continue to give impetus to the whole of the peace process, including negotiations. We will not be swayed by any maneuvers, retractions, or frustrations. We hope that the Israeli side will understand that this agreement has a clear perspective in so far as it concerns Palestinian human rights. We interpret past violations as a result of the occupation. We have to equate them now with a new action created by the spirit and prospect of peace. Therefore, we hope, and undoubtedly you share our hope, that we will see Israel setting out to implement the rules of the fourth Geneva Accord and the principles of international law, and abandon their old methods, fanaticism, and prevarication so that we will be able to work together in order to reach the peace and security which we all aspire to. In light of these developments, the need for the international community to persistently bear its responsibilities regarding the issue of Palestine is firmly established. Any attempt to marginalize the role of the international community, represented in the United Nations, in this issue is an attempt to vilify international legitimacy and to undermine its principles on the basis of which the peace process was built, starting with drawing on the UN Charter and the UN Security Council resolutions and ending with guaranteeing the Palestinian people's right to exercise their national rights as a basis for reaching a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the Middle East region. We would like to stress that the results of the peace process and the ongoing negotiations must be based on the rulings of international legitimacy and the principles of international law as a means of safeguarding the noble principles of the international community which the world has accepted as an instrument to establish the bases of justice, friendship, and the resolution of disputes among states by peaceful means. For our part, we will push with all our strength to ensure the success of the peace process so that our future generations and our children and their children will be able to live in peace, security, stability, harmony, and freedom far away from threats, repression, violence, and wars. To that end, I turn to you, for your honorable commission to continue its mission of defending our people and their right to their homeland, and putting an end to human rights violations and protecting human rights in our occupied land for as long as the occupation continues, particularly in the transitional phase during which the occupation forces will remain in parts of our land.
