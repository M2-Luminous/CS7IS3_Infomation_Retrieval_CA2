Romashin and B.M. Paramonov; UDC 621.385] [Abstract] Possible resonance interactions of electron beams and the high-frequency field in open periodic waveguiding electrodynamic structures are examined, quasi-optical such structures being considered for propagation of electromagnetic waves shorter than the period of these structures. One known possible interaction is that of a relativistic electron beam and only the field of the first harmonic (fundamental component) of such a structure, their interaction being attended by large diffraction losses tolerable only in ultrahigh-power devices. Another known possible interaction is that of an electron beam and space harmonics of the periodic structure generated on the inside surface of the waveguide rings, in which case one can always minimize diffraction losses by optimizing the dimensions of the waveguide segments. A third possible interaction now under investigation is that of a relativistic electron beam and an oversize waveguide with a retarding structure placed on its inside surface. The possibility of electromagnetic radiation being amplified during resonance interaction of a relativistic electron beam and the field of space harmonics in an open waveguide line is demonstrated theoretically, of interest being radiation wavelengths much smaller than the waveguide period. As a specific case is considered a planar quasi-optical waveguide with a large period 2D on one side and structures with a small period d on periodically spaced mirrors. The efficiency of this interaction is calculated analytically in the Fresnel approximation and then compared with that of conventional interaction where the period of the retarding structure is comparable with the radiation wavelength. It is shown that resonance interaction in such a system is possible even under less stringent design constraints on the electrodynamic structure with a small period d, the Fresnel parameter however depending on the interaction mode and can be as large as twice the number of space harmonics of the 2D period. Therefore, achieving significant interaction output in such a system requires special means of minimizing diffraction losses. Figures 1; references 6.
