The foreign minister told REUTER that it is in the interest of all nations participating and interested in the Middle East negotiations to ensure that incidents similar to the Hebron massacre will never occur again. Minister Musa said that Israel should abandon its current policy concerning settlers and settlements. Israel should also revise its security policy to provide protection for the 2 million Palestinians who live under occupation, for those Palestinians are its responsibility, Musa pointed out. The foreign minister said that Israel should abandon the policy that Israeli Army forces refrain from confronting armed settlers attacking Palestinians in the occupied territories. It is in everyone's interest that negotiations resume, but only once it is clear that measures, not yet taken, are in place to protect the Palestinians and deal with the settlers and settlements. Minister Musa said that a UN Security Council resolution calling for an international presence to protect the Palestinians would not only pave the way for the resumption of talks between the PLO and Israel, but also breath life into the stalled Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Jordanian talks.
