However, Russia does not hurry to sign the program. Speaking of relations with the Serbs, the president noted the most important now is to prevent them from greater confrontation and further combat operations. Yeltsin said they are working in this sphere and Russian representative Vitaliy Churkin is permanently staying in the conflict zone. As need be Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev may leave for the conflict zone on Thursday. If greater confrontation is prevented and the crisis is discussed at political negotiations, there will be no more bombing. A political way out of the situation should be found through negotiations; "force will not solve the problem, it will be an eternal war. Those who did the bombing will be responsible in case of aggravation," stressed the president.
