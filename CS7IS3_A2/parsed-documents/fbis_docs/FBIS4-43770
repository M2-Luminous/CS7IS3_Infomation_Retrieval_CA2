In France, the government issued a denial during the morning of publication stating that this "allegation" is "absurd" and pointing out that, at the time of the attack, there were just 25 French military left in Kigali, all employed on very specific tasks. In Brussels, the Foreign Ministry and the prime minister stated that they had no information to support the theory. Mr. Dehaene, leaving LE SOIR responsible for its information, stated that "the theory put forward was not within the scope of the enquiry being pursued by the military authorities." It is true that, in the strictest sense, the enquiry being conducted by the military authorities only concerns the circumstances in which the 10 Belgian blue helmets died in Kigali. But colleagues at the RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television], who also contacted the military authorities, were told on Friday [17 June] that the theory of white mercenaries, including some French, remained open with respect to the attack on 6 April. The denials from the official authorities do not answer the outstanding questions and, given the present status of our information, the lead we mentioned yesterday remains credible even if it is not of course certain. We are continuing to receive information of the return to Kigali last February of 11 French soldiers who, until December, had been members of the DAMI [Military Training Assistance Detachment] and who were apparently recognized in civilian clothing in Kigali. Shadowy areas also remain regarding the French military presence in Rwanda. For example: We have learned, in another context, that shortly after 6 April two French development conscripts were killed in Kigali, together with the wife of one of them. One of them, a member of the GIGN [National Gendarmerie Intervention Group], Jean-Paul Mayertz, had arrived in Kigali in December and was responsible for training activities, with the Presidential Guard in particular. Information given to their relatives indicates that these French citizens were killed by the soldiers of the Rwandan Armed Forces in the "lot" neighboring their residence. Their bodies were recovered by the blue helmets, repatriated and buried as discreetly as possible. To our knowledge, Paris has never mentioned the death of these French soldiers.
