There was no doubt about NATO's capability of launching air strikes and within an hour after the order was issued, he told a conference on European security in Munich. But he was also cautious about the military action in the former Yugoslav republic which has been embroiled in civil war for the past 22 months. "I can tell you unequivocally at this stage that we will not take any military action without considering seriously the effect on the situation in Bosnia, and we will not invoke air strikes unilaterally, not with 28,000 troops of our allies on the ground in Bosnia," he said. The United States and several other NATO countries currently have military attack jets based in Italy awaiting any decision by UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to launch air strikes in Bosnia. Perry, who was sworn in as secretary of defense only two days ago to replace Les Aspin, said the U.S. had been in close contact with Western Europe and the United Nations following a mortar attack on a market place in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo on Saturday which killed 68 people and wounded about 200. The bloody incident has prompted even more calls for outside intervention. France urged international action, including the use of air power, to lift the siege of Sarajevo. The Russian Foreign Ministry has also expressed its anger over the atrocity. After attending the security conference, Perry flew back to Washington to consult with President Bill Clinton over the latest killings in Bosnia and their moves to check further massacres in the war-torn territory.
