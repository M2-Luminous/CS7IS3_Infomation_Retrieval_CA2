They said plans by UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) to have monitors check on Serb artillery stored in Serb barracks did not amount to proper control. One source, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said: "That's not a proper control. We need to be serious about this. The control has to be strong enough to stop the weapons being used." [passage omitted] In Zagreb, UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig denied reports of differences "between the goals pursued by NATO and the UN." He maintained Tuesday that the UN wanted "effective control" of the weapons and not mere monitoring. But Nerzig would not give details of the UN plans, and conceded that UNPROFOR officials were giving a "broad interpretation" to the concept of control. The UNPROFOR spokesman said the NATO ultimatum issued last week called specifically for "the withdrawal or regrouping and placing the heavy weapons under UNPROFOR control. Under UNPROFOR control means just that: this is not a monitoring of heavy weapons, this is the effective control of those heavy weapons," he said. Nerzig quoted a recent statement by the British commander of UNPROFOR in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, who said there were many ways of effectively controlling the Serb weapons. "Those are the ways that are being looked into and being discussed with the (Serb and Moslem belligerents)," he said. Nerzig added: "I wouldn't spell out exactly which procedure or process we are going to use in the variety of cases. We are working on setting an effective control."
