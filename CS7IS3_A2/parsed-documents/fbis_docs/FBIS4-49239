During these hearings, many men of insight -- including Cradock -- called for a "stance that Britain must abide by the Joint Declaration," and they criticized changes in Britain's China policy as "injuring others without benefiting oneself." The Foreign Affairs Select Committee, however, turned a deaf ear to these criticisms, and on 13 April published a report entitled: "Anglo- Chinese Relations Before and After 1997." Following its publication, the report was widely criticized by the media, which said that it "is "out of step with the times," "lacks a sense of historical reality," and "is irresponsible and erroneous." The Foreign Affairs Committee of the China's National People's Congress also sternly rebuked the report for flagrantly advocating viewpoints and suggestions hostile to China, and expressed its strong indignation at the report's wanton interference in China's internal affairs. The British parliamentary report lacked a sense of historical reality. It could not but admit that the Chinese economy, with a vast market, is developing at full speed and thus Britain must maintain ties with China, but with the exception of this, all of its viewpoints and suggestions were hostile to China's flourishing development. Moreover, the report barefacedly stated that it was necessary not only to reverse the Joint Declaration, but also to repudiate the principles for establishing diplomatic relations between China and Britain. It called for turning back Britain's China policy to the 19th century to try to revive the old historical dream in which the great British Empire wantonly interfered in and split up China. The report confessed that "Britain undeniably has changed its ways." It said: "It should not be taken for granted that the Beijing regime will last beyond 1997, so Britain should not draw up a rigid China policy." That is to say, even though Britain promised in the Joint Declaration to return Hong Kong to China and to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during the transition period, the report proposed that the above-mentioned China policy "should not be formulated rigidly," which clearly laid bare Britain's malicious intention to rack its brains and to seize any opportunity to obstruct the implementation of the Joint Declaration. The article "Our Basic Stand on the Issue of Hong Kong" and its annotations, which were published in the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," showed very clearly that the British side would not return Hong Kong to China willingly. The fact that at that time, Mrs Thatcher put forward the "thesis of the validity of the three unequal treaties" and the "thesis of exchanging sovereignty for administrative authority" indicated Britain's holy grail of extending its administration over Hong Kong, but China warned the British side that if it did not change its position, China could not but unilaterally announce its own principles and policies for settling the Hong Kong issue. Only under this situation did Britain acknowledge that Hong Kong's sovereignty and administration should completely revert to China, and did Britain sign the Joint Declaration. However, Deng Xiaoping foresaw long ago that during the transition period, it would be mainly the British that created artificial chaos. It showed that the Chinese side was on the alert long ago against the likelihood that the British side -- under various pretexts and by all kinds of tricks -- definitely would attempt to obstruct China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. The report imputed the reason for the change in Britain's China policy to the "Beijing disturbance" in 1989, which was absolutely a sophistry. As a matter of fact, this is the natural instinct of the British colonialists. International agreements, once signed, should be implemented, and no signatory should ever flagrantly interfere in the other party's internal affairs and take the latter's internal affairs as a pretext for not fulfilling agreements. The raging tide of cracking down on separatist activities in Northern Ireland and of mass resistance to the poll tax, as well as human rights problems, also were seen in Britain, but China had never made it a pretext for shirking its responsibility to fulfil the Joint Declaration. In her memoirs entitled "The Downing Street Years," Mrs. Thatcher wrote that faced with China's solemn position, the British side could not but "indicate that we did not anticipate there would still be any power linkage between Britain and Hong Kong, or that Britain would have any obligation in Hong Kong after 1997. However, I felt sorry about that." For those who "felt sorry about" the fact that the British side could not but sign the Joint Declaration, the "Beijing disturbance" was a misfortune over which they gloated, and they harbored the illusion of a fluke rather than felt "sorry" about the situation, and even did not hesitate to make a reckless move, which was precisely a manifestation of colonialists unwilling to retreat from the historical scene. The report attacked Articles 18 and 58 of the Basic Law, barefacedly opposed the fact that China has sovereignty over Hong Kong, urged the European Union to draw up anti-China policies, extended support to Patten's unilateral action in his "three violations" political reform package, and even flagrantly called for meddling in the Tibet and Taiwan issues. All these attacks are a resurgence of the die-hard nature of colonialism throughout history. The report made various viewpoints and suggestions that were hostile to China, demonstrating that some people in Britain still try to employ tricks and to handle Sino-British relations with the gestures of a past century. The extent of the deficiency in their sense of historical reality and their inability to keep up with the times is amazing. The report said: "From the Opium War on, China has been forced to adapt to a new order of the international community backed by the international law, and this process is yet to be completed." This remark really hit the nail on the head and fully exposed Britain's motive in changing its China policy, that is, it wants to revert to the historical stage, from the Opium War to the years before 1949, when Britain plundered and split up China. The new China, however, rejected the so-called "order" imposed by Britain and other powers from the West. Hence, those die-hard colonialists in Britain yearn for the likelihood that the Chinese people's regime "may not last beyond 1997" and that the "process" of extending British rule over Hong Kong will be "completed!" However, as China grows rich, strong, and prosperous, it is fully capable of resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule. Moreover, Britain and other countries from the West will never be allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs or to split up its territory. While it has become a historical trend for every country in the world to develop its cherished relations with China, the British parliamentary report attempted to organize an international anti-China coalition to contain China, split it up, and obstruct it from resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. However, all these moves indicated that they merely overrated their abilities. History will prove that the British parliamentary report merely noted down the dishonorable trouble-making scheme worked out by British colonialists when they were withdrawing from Hong Kong, whereas such a scheme is doomed to fail.
