FBIS3-40868 "jpsea002___94001" JPRS-SEA-94-002 Document Type:JPRS Document Title:East Asia/South East Asia 18 February 1994 INDONESIA POLITICAL PDI Elects New Leadership 94SE0052A Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 24 Dec 93 pp 1, 15 94SE0052A Jakarta KOMPAS Language: Indonesian Article Type:CSO [Excerpts] Jakarta (KOMPAS)--The leadership structure of the Central Executive Council (DPP) of the Indonesian Democratic Party [PDI] was finally formed Thursday night, 23 December, after a difficult and tiring process. Alex Lithay was elected PDI DPP secretary general to assist Megawati Sukarnoputri, who Wednesday night had been confirmed as general director of the PDI DPP. Mega [Megawati Sukarnoputri] formed a group that she called a renewal, in which most of the faces are new and in which the individuals reportedly have no conflicts. In the end, Megawati Sukarnoputri's expectation that the formation of PDI DPP leadership would not be easy became a reality. The nominating team, which she led directly, worked with difficulty Thursday because of the tug of war between Mega's faction and a "potential" group that turned out to have a candidate. In addition, the nominating team also had to face external groups with aspirations who wanted their candidates accommodated in the PDI DPP structure. As a result, the formation of DPP leadership, which was scheduled for completion by 1000 hours, was again delayed, thus producing an atmosphere of near hopelessness among MUNAS [National Conference] participants, who waited without any clarification at Hotel Garden, South Jakarta. [passage omitted] Mega said she hoped the DPP leadership structure would be warmly received, with a view to PDI's future "after our long journey, which has been full of pain and apprehension." Tiring Discussions Although she said the day had been full of struggle and apprehension, Megawati was ready with lengthy "lobbying" that was tiring and sapped one's strength. The daughter of the late President Sukarno met yesterday, Thursday, with eight other nominating team members at Hotel Atlet Century Park to form the PDI DPP. Meanwhile, the other participants waited at the conference site at Hotel Garden. They apparently did not guess that the nomination meeting would be difficult, and fatigue was visible among all the participants. Becoming impatient, DPD [regional executive council] delegates held a meeting at 1415 hours in room 403 of Hotel Garden. Their discussion included the possible position of all the DPD's if the MUNAS should fail or if the nominating team working at Century Park Hotel should be unable to finish its task on the designated day. The delegates told reporters that the DPD's agreed to ask the nominating team to report the results of their work and gave them a deadline of 1700 hours. If the nominating team did not report on the results of their work by that hour, the MUNAS would take further action. "We would decide whether the nominating team should be given time to complete its task this week, or what, because we are the ones who gave the team its mandate," said a delegate. In the end, however, the nominating team was able to complete its task before 1700 hours. According to a KOMPAS source, an official was present while the team discussed the PDI DPP structure. The meeting lasted until about 1500 hours. According to the source, the difficulty in the team's discussion lay in the designation of a PDI DPP secretary general. Reportedly, most of the team members, and particularly the chairperson, wanted Wiyanjono as secretary general. Agreement on that was not easy, however, because some wanted Ismunandar to be secretary general. The problem became even more complex because of demands of team members from a "potential" element, which wanted Edwin Sukowati to be included in DPP leadership. The meeting then arrived at an impasse. The source said that Megawati nominated Wiyanjono because she wanted the general director and the secretary general to be able to work well together. "If the PDI really wants unity and integrity, I want a secretary general who can cooperate," the source quoted Mega as saying. With regard to her objection to the candidate nominated by the "potential" element, Mega reportedly cited a similar reason. She asked that for the sake of unity and integrity the people involved not press their wishes too far. Because none of the parties was willing to withdraw its nomination, Alex Lithay was brought up as an alternative. In the end, his name was approved by the nominating team. Alex Lithay was born in Ambon on 1 October 1948 and is a DPR [Parliament] member elected through nomination by Maluku Province. According to sources close to Mega, she selected Alex because Mega has always received much support from branches in Eastern Indonesia. "Thus, it was a must for a person from Eastern Indonesia to sit in DPP leadership," the source said. Edwin Renominated After the DPP was formed, Megawati, Antoni Rahael, and Slamet Mulyadi met with Director General for Sociopolitical Affairs Sutoyo N.K. for about 15 minutes and then returned to Hotel Garden at about 1700 hours. Upon her arrival at Hotel Garden, Mega was guarded closely by security guards and was guided directly to room 417, where she was to rest. It turned out that the work of the nominating team was still not final, however, because lobbying went on in Megawati's room and almost undid the results that had been achieved. The Megawati faction had to accommodate a request from the "potential" group, which was again determined to put Edwin Sunawar Sukowati in DPP management. This happened despite the fact that Mega had rejected the presence of Edwin in DPP ranks because the DPP in the future would help her to run the organization's activities. Megawati's position in rejecting Edwin was so firm that she had threatened in the meeting that "either I or he (Edwin) will withdraw." It was because of this rejection that the name of Edwin H. Sukowati was deleted from the document containing the PDI DPP leadership structure for 1993-1998. It was this failure to include Edwin that prompted Alex to gather the DPD's at about 1950 hours to lobby them again, with the result that, in the end, Megawati consented to accept Edwin as a DPP deputy treasurer. According to the source, she accepted him because the "potential" group threatened to form a shadow DPP in opposition if Edwin was not put in the PDI DPP structure. Composition of DPP The structure of PDI DPP leadership for the period 1993-1998 with, as expected, Megawati Sukarnoputri as general director tries to picture oneness and integrity in the PDI organization by including various factions that have always been sources of conflict. The 14 directors are Soetardjo Soerjoguritno, Ismunandar, Fitmah Achmad, Kwik Kian Gie, Gerri Mbatemooy, Panangian Siregar, Subagyo, K.H. Kholiq, Slamet Mulyadi, Yahya Theo, Abdulgani, I Gusti Ngurah Sara, Mangara Siahaan, and Suparlan. Secretary General Alexander Lithay has as deputies Syafei Ali Gumay, Andi Chaerul M.M., Haryanto Taslam, Mrs. Ratna Purnami, Edi Junaedy, and Titik Juliasih. Treasurer Laksamana Sukardi has as deputies Mulyono Soetarmo, Untung Sutomo, Neneng A.D. Asmasoebrata, Novianti Nasution, F.X. Urip Sujud, and Edwin H. Sukowati. The emergence of Alexander Lithay as secretary eneral surprised some of the delegates, because the director of the Central Executive Council of the Indonesian Christian Youth Movement (GAMKI) had never previously been mentioned as a candidate for secretary eneral. It is conjectured that his name emerged because no common ground was found among the nominating team members to select any of the four people nominated for secretary general: Ismunandar, J.B. Wiyanjono, Supardan, and Sudaryanto. Although he had been a member of the Indonesian Christian College Student Movement (GMKI), Lithay can be called a "new person" in PDI DPP leadership. Although he has not personally worked with Megawati, he said that as director/coordinator of the PDI's Banteng [the wild ox, symbol of the PDI] Campus Campaign Team at Salatiga, Central Java, (1987) he had opportunity for "interaction" with Mega when she was on the F-PDI [PDI Faction] Assistance Team of the MPR [People's Consultative Council] Working Committee (1993) [year as published]. As a "new person," Lithay immediately received messages in room 206 from his seniors in the PDI, who included DPR F-PDI member Sukowaluyo, who even had a personal talk with Lithay in Lithay's room. When asked for his comments on Megawati, Lithay said, "She is a determined person. The PDI needs someone like her, and she is the most suitable person at this time. When a reporter asked what steps he and Mega will take to respond to future challenges to the PDI, including the never-ending conflicts and the "fusion" issues, Lithay was not yet able to make much comment. "I think that is a job for the team. We will deal with those things together with other DPP members," he asserted. "What about internal and external pressures on the PDI?" the press asked. "I have no comment on that," Lithay answered. Speaking Without Notes At exactly 2255 hours, Megawati Sukarnoputri left room 417 closely guarded and in the company of Ismunandar and Soetardjo Soerjoguritno and proceeded to the meeting hall. Meeting chairman Alex Asmasoebrata then opened the session. MUNAS participants immediately applauded as each name was pronounced by Megawati as director of the PDI DPP. When Mega mentioned the names of Neneng Amalia D. Asmasoebrata and Edwin H. Sukowati as deputy treasurers, however, many participants immediately shouted, "Boo!" After the installation and confirmation of the new PDI DPP directors for the 1993-1998 term, which was led by meeting chairman Alex Asmasoebrata, Megawati made her first speech to her organization and in the presence of Department of Home Affairs Secretary General Suryatna Subrata, who was present also to close the MUNAS. "The result is that the PDI will be able to do good work for all its members, following its long journey from the congress in Medan, the special congress in Surabaya, and this MUNAS in Jakarta," Mega said. Therefore, she said, let us welcome PDI's future. "Each day, we have experienced extraordinary spiritual and physical struggles. If PDI members cannot practice internal unity, our desire to advance the PDI will not be achieved. Therefore, we must all be united," she added. "Forget the past, and look to the future with a sense of unity. Practice that, and encourage each other. Let us together achieve unity and integrity for the sake of the image of the PDI and our beloved nation and republic," she urged. Mega did not forget to salute and sincerely thank the press. "The press has disclosed the dynamics of the PDI as they are. For that, I say many, many thanks," Mega said at the end of the speech, her first. Policy Statement Meanwhile, spokesman Antoni Rahael issued a PDI policy statement, which expressed determination to improve the general welfare and national capabilities. The PDI also rejected isms such as "marhaenism," Marxism, and Leninism, because the PDI reached a consensus that Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state] is its only basis. [passage omitted]
