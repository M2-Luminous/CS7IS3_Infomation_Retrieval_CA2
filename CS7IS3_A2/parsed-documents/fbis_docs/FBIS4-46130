The official predicted a rise in effective attacks by the Islamic resistance in the near future. Israel may be able to abduct hostages, he said, but it cannot twist the arm of the resistance or dissuade it from pursuing its strategic task of confronting occupation and repelling aggression against the Lebanese people and land. [passage omitted] Reiterating Hizballah's position on the Israeli navigator, al-Musawi said that Hizballah has no information about the navigator's fate. He pointed out that Mustafa al-Dirani, although a resistance figure, has no organizational link with Hizballah. 'Ammar al-Musawi expressed doubt that al-Dirani has any information about the Israeli navigator. He expressed his belief that Israel, in carrying out the abduction, may have benefited from some loopholes in the internal security situation. Al-Musawi said that the Lebanese authorities have an urgent duty to protect the resistance in every part of Lebanon, north or south. [passage omitted]
