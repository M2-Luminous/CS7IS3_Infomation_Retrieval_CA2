SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 4, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The SIP revision consists of amendments to Virginia's definition of the term volatile organic compound (VOC), administrative changes to Virginia's lists of emission control areas, and the addition of a new emission statement regulation. The portion of Virginia's November 4, 1992 SIP revision submittal pertaining to emission statements is the subject of a separate rulemaking action. I. Background On November 15, 1990, amendments to the 1977 Clean Air Act were enacted. Under the amended Act, EPA and the States were required to review the designation of areas and to redesignate areas as nonattainment for ozone if the air quality data from 1987, 1988, and 1989, indicated that the area was violating the ozone standard. On November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992, EPA promulgated designations pursuant to the amended Act, which expanded the boundaries of the Washington, DC, Richmond, and Hampton Roads nonattainment areas. 56 FR 56694 and 57 FR 56762. The Washington, DC nonattainment area was extended to include Stafford County; the Richmond nonattainment area was expanded to include Charles City County, Colonial Heights County, Hanover County, and Hopewell County; and the Hampton Roads nonattainment area was expanded to include James City County, York County, Poquoson County, and Williamsburg City. To fully comply with the provisions of the Act relative to Federal requirements to control VOC and NO X emissions in ozone nonattainment areas, Virginia is required to expand the geographic applicability of its VOC and NO x control regulations to conform to EPA's ozone nonattainment designations. On November 4, 1992, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted a SIP revision that defined the VOC and NO X emission control areas to make them consistent with EPA's designated nonattainment areas in 40 CFR part 81 as promulgated on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992. II. EPA Evaluation and Action The following is EPA's evaluation of the SIP revisions submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Detailed descriptions of the amendments addressed in this document, and EPA's evaluation of the amendments, are contained in the technical support document (TSD) prepared for this revision. Copies of the TSD are available from the EPA Regional office listed in the Addresses section of this document. Commonwealth's Submittal (1) Section 120&hyph;01&hyph;02 has been amended to revise the definition of the term volatile organic compound (VOC) to be consistent with EPA's definition. (2) Appendix P, which contained a list of VOC emission control areas, has been amended to include a list of emission control areas for oxides of nitrogen (NO X ). The NO X emission control areas correspond to the ozone nonattainment designations which EPA issued in the Federal Register on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992. 56 FR 56694 and 57 FR 56762. (3) The list of VOC emission control areas in appendix P was revised to correspond to the ozone nonattainment area designations which EPA issued in the Federal Register on November 6, 1991, and November 30, 1992. 56 FR 56694 and 57 FR 56762. EPA's Evaluation These amendments are administrative in nature, and will have no adverse effect on air quality. These amendments are consistent with EPA requirements, and consequently serve to strengthen the Virginia SIP. Therefore, they are approvable as a revision to the Virginia SIP. EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will become effective December 19, 1994 unless, by November 18, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on December 19, 1994. Final Action EPA is approving amendments to Virginia's definition for the term VOC and lists of VOC and NO X emission control areas, section 120&hyph;01&hyph;02 and appendix P, respectively, as a revision to the Virginia SIP. The Commonwealth of Virginia submitted these amendments to EPA as a SIP revision on November 4, 1992. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. EPA , 427 U.S. 246, 255&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 19, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)).
