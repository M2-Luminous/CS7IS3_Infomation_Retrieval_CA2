FR940804-1-00048 FR940804-1-00014 Historically, the Cuyamaca Valley population of Limnanthes gracilis ssp. parishii occurred throughout much of the valley floor. Recently, the Cuyamaca Valley population of L. gracilis ssp. parishii was described as consisting of 100 stands by Bauder (1992), and 8 small populations by the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CNDDB) (1992). However, these smaller groupings are contiguous, separated by less than 1.5 km (1 mi), and concentrated within a 9 square km (4 square mi) area. Approximately 120 hectares (ha) (300 acres (ac)) of a potential 800 ha (2,000 ac) of the Cuyamaca Valley and Stonewall Creek area are occupied by L. gracilis ssp. parishii . The number of individuals and the location and size of stands within this area varies in any given year in response to rainfall, the extent of winter flooding, and temperature (Bauder 1992). Under favorable conditions, L. gracilis ssp. parishii can be a conspicuous element of the Cuyamaca Valley during the spring bloom (Craig Rieser, Pacific Southwest Biological Services, pers. comm., 1993). Other populations of Limnanthes gracilis ssp. parishii are considerably smaller, both in number of individuals and the extent of occupied habitat relative to the Cuyamaca Valley population. They range in size from less than 2 ha (5 ac) to as much as 40 ha (100 ac) in extent, and most populations contain fewer than 1000 individuals. At least five of these other populations occur on National Forest lands. A single isolated population is located in vernal pools on the Santa Rosa Plateau of southwestern Riverside County, California. This area of approximately 2 ha (5 ac) is managed by The Nature Conservancy (TNC). One additional population has been introduced to National Forest lands in the Laguna Mountains from seeds gathered from the Cuyamaca Valley population (Winter 1991, CNDDB 1992). Previous Federal Action Federal government action on the two plant taxa considered in this rule began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, and presented to Congress on January 9, 1975, recommended Limnanthes gracilis var. parishii (= L.g. ssp. parishii ) for endangered status. The Service published a notice in the July 1, 1975, Federal Register (40 FR 27823), of its acceptance of the report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)(A)) of the Act, and of the Service's intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein, including L.g. ssp. parishii . The Service published a proposal in the June 16, 1976, Federal Register (42 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascular plants to be endangered species pursuant to section 4 of the Act. Limnanthes gracilis ssp. parishii was included in this Federal Register notice. General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal were summarized in an April 26, 1978, Federal Register notice (43 FR 17909). The Endangered Species Act amendments of 1978 required all proposals over 2 years old to be withdrawn, although a 1-year grace period was given to those proposals. In the December 10, 1979, Federal Register (44 FR 70796), the Service published a notice of withdrawal for that portion of the June 6, 1976, proposal that had not been made final and which included L. g. ssp. parishii. The Service published an updated Notice of Review of Plants in the Federal Register on December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82480). This notice included Downingia concolor var. brevior and Limnanthes gracilis ssp. parishii as category 1 candidate taxa (species for which data in the Service's possession are sufficient to support a proposal for listing). On November 28, 1983, the Service published a supplement to the Notice of Review of Plants in the Federal Register (48 FR 53640). This notice was again revised on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526). Both plant taxa were included in 1983 and 1985 supplements to the Notice of Review of Plants as category 2 candidate taxa (species for which data in the Service's possession indicate listing may be appropriate, but for which additional biological information is needed to support a proposed rule). The Notice of Review of Plants was again revised on February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6184), and again on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51144). Downingia concolor var. brevior was included as a category 1 candidate taxon, and Limnanthes gracilis ssp. parishii as a category 2 candidate taxon in both notices. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretary to make findings on pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13, 1982 be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. This was the case for Limnanthes gracilis ssp. parishii because the 1975 Smithsonian report had been accepted as a petition. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of this species was warranted but precluded by other pending listing proposals of higher priority, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Notification of this finding was published in the Federal Register on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992.
