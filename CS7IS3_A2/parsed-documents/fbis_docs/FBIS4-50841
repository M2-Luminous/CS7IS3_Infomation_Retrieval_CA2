The Standing Committee of the Municipal People's Congress [MPC] on Saturday approved the city's Regulations Governing Implementation of the Law For The Protection of Women's Rights and Interests. The Municipal Committee for Protection of Women's Rights and its subsidiary neighbourhood groups are the watchdogs of women's rights. The new regulations, passed by the 10th Plenary Session of the Beijing MPC Standing Committee, are a first in China. Similar regulations are expected to be drafted and adopted by other municipalities, provinces and regions within the next two years. The law requires the municipal and county women's rights committees to be composed of leading officials from local government, courts, procuratorates, and local organizations of the Women's Federation, Trade Union and Youth League. The national Law for the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests (LPWRI), which was introduced in early 1992, requires the State to set up institutions to safeguard women's constitutional rights. Accordingly, the Beijing Committee for Protection of Women's Rights was set up in October 1992. Another key part of the new law stipulates that women should be given a minimum number of seats in the Municipal and County People's Congress, local administrations and enterprises. But it does not give an exact percentage which is considered proper. Women account for almost half of the 10.5 million people living in the capital. Currently, there are about 368,000 women officials including the vice mayor in Beijing, or 44.5 percent of the total. Women account for about 33 percent of the MPC deputies. However, women only occupy 11.9 percent of the city's senior posts. The new regulations specify in detail that any discrimination against women in school enrollment and employment constitutes a violation of the law.
