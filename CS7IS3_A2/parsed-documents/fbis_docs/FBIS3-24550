The studies were performed in the morning on 90 unfed nonpedigree male rats that weighed 210-320 g each and that had been anesthetized with nembutal (0.1 g/kg injected intramuscularly). A photometry-based method was used to record the phase contractile activity of the wall and the motor activity of the valves of lymphatic microvessels located in three segments of the mesentery: the ``transparent'' section, the section around the adipose tissue at the periphery of the mesentery, and in the adipose tissue itself. The microvessels studied ranged from 30 to 300 �m in diameter. During the course of the studies, leu-enkephalin, naloxone hydrochloride, dalargin, and adrenalin hydrochloride were applied to the surface of the lymphatic microvessels in doses of 0.004 to 40.0 �g per kilogram of the animal's weight in 0.1 ml of a 0.14 M sodium chloride solution. Computer processing of the study data confirmed that the lymphatic microvessels of the rat mesentery do not contract rhythmically either spontaneously or under the effect of opioid peptides. Leu-enkephalin and dalargin (40 �g/kg) increased contractile activity to different degrees. Leu-enkephalin mainly affected the valves: It activated the frequency and doubled the amount of time for which the cusps were closed. It had a lesser effect on the microvessels' walls but did increase the duration of each contraction. Dalargin, on the other hand, did not affect the valves even 30 minutes after application but did activate the walls of the lymphatic vessels. The combination of the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone or adrenalin with leu-enkephalin, both soon (15-20 minutes) and long (1.5-2 hours) after application, caused the walls of the lymphatic microvessels to be hypersensitive to nonspecific stimuli (a physiological solution of sodium chloride or air stream). Adrenalin and naloxone modulated the lymph-stimulating effect of leu-enkephalin and dalargin by inhibiting the lymphatic microvessels' contractile activity.
