Romania considers that a political solution is the only one capable of settling the conflict in former Yugoslavia, said the spokeswoman and underlined: "One of the assumptions Romania has taken into account when stating its position with regard to the situation in former Yugoslavia was the important role that could be played in a peaceful settlement of the conflict by the countries neighboring former Yugoslavia." The Geneva meeting could be considered a direct and concrete result of the two international mediators' talks in Bucharest, the spokeswoman said. Secretary of State of the Romanian Foreign Ministry Adrian Dohotaru, currently visiting the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, met with the federal minister of minorities and human rights and federal culture minister, with the deputy minister of foreign affairs of Yugoslavia and with the minister of culture and relations with diaspora of Serbia. The visit is an expression of the Romanian Foreign Ministry's preoccupation of maintaining a continuous dialogue with the Romanian nationals living in Yugoslavia and of finding, together with the Yugoslav authorities, the means of full expression of their ethnic, language, cultural and spiritual identity, said Romanian Foreign Ministry's Assistant Spokesperson Simona Miculescu. A Romanian delegation will attend a meeting on February 11, in Athens, of representatives of the European Union, the six states associated to the European Union and the Baltic states, to discuss a draft pact of stability in Europe. Romania will reiterate its support for a pact ensuring stability in Europe through the promotion of good-neighborly relations among states, will underscore the precedence of the European Union's support to the reform and democratization processes in Central and Eastern European states, will promote the principle of frontier inviolability, will reassert Romania's readiness to entrench the European standards in the field of the rights of the persons belonging to ethnic minorities, the spokeswoman said. Referring to the consultations that are taking place on February 9 and 10 between experts of the Foreign Ministries of Romania and the Czech Republic, the spokeswoman said they were working on the updating of the bilateral relations through an intergovernmental protocol to discern which of the conventions agreed by Romania and former Czechoslovakia until 1992 are still effective and which are not. Talks are scheduled to take place today, February 9, in Bern, between secretaries of state of the Foreign Ministries of Romania and Switzerland, approaching issues of the Romanian-Swiss relations and seeking to find out joint actions aiming to develop these relations. The Romanian Foreign Ministry Secretary of State Gheorghe Tinca will have consultations by mid-February at the Foreign Affairs Ministries of Pakistan, Japan and the People's Republic of China. The state secretary's visit in Pakistan is going to be the first at such level after 1989. State Secretary Tinca will convey a message from Romanian Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu to Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The talks the secretary will have in Japan represent a continuation of the ones in Bucharest, in 1992. The consultations in the People's Republic of China follow the protocol signed earlier this year referring to the collaboration between the two ministries. During his three-state tour, Gheorghe Tinca will approach also international issues of mutual interest and will promote some actions meant to evince the economic potential of Romania.
