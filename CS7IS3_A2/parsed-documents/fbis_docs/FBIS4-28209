The report indicated that in 1940, the country had a total forest area of 17 million hectares or 70 per cent of its total area. This forest area shrank to 12.7 million hectares by 1973 and 11.2 million by 1981 and is 11 million at present. The reduction in the forest cover was the consequence of various practices, such as slash and burn cultivation, forest fire, and wanton tree-felling. To restore and preserve the forest, the government has issued regulations facilitating and ensuring the plantation of trees on a family and business basis. Timber traders are now compelled to undertake tree planting. To families engaged in slash and burn cultivation, the government will allocate cultivation and production land. Those living in watershed areas will be allocated new settlements or assigned to rehabilitate the forest in their particular areas. The government agencies concerned have in the past years made several efforts to protect and develop the forestry resources of the country with the participation of both the private and public sectors. This involves reforestation and restricting slash and burn farming, especially in mountainous areas. At the same time, measures have been taken against those who illegally fell trees and who start forest fires. Sweden has assisted Laos in preserving forestry resources through the Lao-Swedish cooperation project for the restriction of slash and burn farming.
