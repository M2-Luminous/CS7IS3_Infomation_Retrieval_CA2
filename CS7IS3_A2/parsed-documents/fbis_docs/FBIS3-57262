Last Friday the opposition deputies blocked again the parliament's decision on the issue. Opposition deputies believe that only a new, democratically elected parliament is able to evaluate the events of three years ago when over 100 Baku residents died. The leader of the National Independence Party Etibar Mamedov and representatives of the People's Front of Azerbaijan believe that the present parliament formed under ex-president Ayaz Mutalibov demonstrated more than once its unprincipled approach and took decisions to please each leadership. The Front's faction demands the disbandment of parliament and the holding of new elections. The opposition disagrees with the point of view of President Geydar Aliyev and other leaders who are convinced that the former First Secretary of the Azeri Communist Party Central Committee Abdurakhman Vezirov, the then Chairman of the republic's Council of Ministers A. Mutalibov and the then KGB Chairman Vagif Guseynov are to bear responsibility for what happened January 20, 1990. The deputies of the People's Front of Azerbaijan and of the Party for National Independence believe that the political leadership of the former Soviet Union who took the decision to bring in troops in Baku are the main culprits of the tragedy.
