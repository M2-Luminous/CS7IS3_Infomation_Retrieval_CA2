Churkin described his visit to Sarajevo as very encouraging. All three sides are contemplating peace rather than a continuation of conflicts, the Russian envoy maintains. Asked by a reporter about his view on possible attacks by NATO on positions of Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo, Churkin said: [Begin recording of Churkin, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] Let me explain my attitude. I am not speaking as a private individual but as a Russian official. First, regardless of what they are telling us, I believe that NATO's decision goes beyond what the UN Security Council resolutions stipulate. We should have taken it to the UN Security Council and then we would have total unanimity in the international community's stands. This was feasible since basically we are talking about the same views. We would have the UN Security Council's authority behind us. I believe that this method would have been far better.
