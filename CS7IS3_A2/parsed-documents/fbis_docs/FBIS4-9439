To be tried along with Alia are former government officials Adil Carcani, Manush Myftiu, Rita Marko, Simon Stefani, Hekuran Isai, Aranit Cela, Zylyftar Ramizi, Rrapi Mino, and Veiz Haderi. The pre-trial investigations have lasted nearly a year. The accused are charged with conspiracy leading to the misappropriation of state property in the amount worth 2,883,502 leks. They are also charged with abuse of office and violation of the fundamental rights of citizens resulting in economic damages of 484,778 leks. The results of the investigation are held to show that these crimes were committed while the accused were serving in high government and party posts in deliberate violation of judicial norms and laws in force at the time. Among the acts constituting the violation of the civil rights of citizens were the execution of 22 persons without trial in 1951 and the subsequent falsifying of court records. Other former high officials of party and state shown by the investigation to be involved in planning and carrying out these criminal acts were: Enver Hoxha, Mehmet Shehu, Kadri Hasbiu, Beqir Balluku, Nevzat Haznedari, Edip Cuci, Shuaip Panariti, Vangjel Kocani, and Siri Carcani. These persons will, however, not be tried because they are dead or missing or the statute of limitations has expired. The evictions and dislocations of thousands of people were carried out in illegal fashion by special administrative organs, when these actions were used as forms of punishment for various civil acts. These activities by the former organs of state security were approved by the Politburo and carried out in secret in violation of the Constitution and other laws in force. These practises resulted in a pattern of continuous, systematic abuses of the inviolability of the person (including loss of life) and property of the citizen and the violation of his fundamental rights including freedom of speech, assembly, press and other forms of communication. The accused are charged with complicity in the 1990 killing along the state borders of persons held to be committing treason by illegally trying to leave the country. To the charges of murder in these cases has been added that of the desecration of the bodies in order to create an atmosphere of intimidation among the population. Finally, the indictment holds the accused responsible for the anti-constitutional acts during 1967-1976 of forbidding the practice of religion and the destruction of religious properties of great historical and cultural value.
