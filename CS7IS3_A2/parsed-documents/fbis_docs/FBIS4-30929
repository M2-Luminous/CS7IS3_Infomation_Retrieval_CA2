The Association President Boro Ristic pointed out the census is a test for the democracy and statehood of Macedonia. He appealed to all Serbs in Macedonia to declare themselves Serbs, and not Yugoslavs. As for the elections laws, the Association suggests the parliament should consist of 120 deputies elected on a majority principle, 15 on a proportional one, and five deputies, to be appointed by the Ethnic Council. "Unless the parliament accepts this proposal or comes up with an adequate coalition partner to protect the rights of Serbs in Macedonia, the Association will boycott the elections in November," Ristic stated.
