He further claimed that his remarks were taken out of context, saying that when speaking about jihad, he meant a religious, nonviolent struggle and that his remarks were misconstrued in Israel. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz was told that upon his arrival in Oslo, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres announced that he would boycott all the events he was scheduled to attend with 'Arafat until the PLO head personally announced his commitment to the DOP and declared his opposition to violence and terror, and declared his support for peace. It has just been reported that Minister Peres indeed boycotted a luncheon with former U.S. President Carter and PLO Chairman 'Arafat. Before holding the joint news conference in which 'Arafat made the above announcement, Peres consulted Prime Minister Rabin regarding the steps he should take during his stopover in Stockholm.
