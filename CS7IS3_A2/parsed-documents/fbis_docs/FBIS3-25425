Azanian National Youth Unity [Azanyu] National Chairman Mosotho Petlane said Azanyu's "endurance cup is running out" because the media had largely ignored memorial services for Azanian Peoples Liberation Army Commander Sabelo Phama. "We would like the media to advise us on what we must do. Must we kill one journalist before we get fair coverage? Or must we demand a PAC volkstaat [homeland]? Or must we threaten a civil war?" Mr Petlane asked. He alleged that the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] was masterminding a campaign against the PAC. He said that of the 17 memorial services for the late commander, only one had been partly covered by the media. He said the deaths of Chris Hani and Andries Treurnicht had received extensive coverage. Freedom of the press was a two-way process, he said.
