FR941103-2-00142 FR941103-2-00081 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Petition for Modification of a Previously Approved Antitheft Device; Volkswagen AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Grant of petition for modification of a previously approved antitheft device. SUMMARY: In 1988, this agency granted Volkswagen of America, Inc.'s (Volkswagen) petition for exemption from the parts marking requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for the Audi 100 and Audi 200 lines. The lines have been redesignated for model year 1995 as, respectively, the Audi A6 and Audi S6. This notice grants Volkswagen's petition for a modification of the exemption originally granted in 1988, and modified in 1992. The agency grants this petition because it has determined, based on substantial evidence, that the modified antitheft device described in Volkswagen's petition to be placed on the car lines as standard equipment, is likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as compliance with parts marking requirements. DATES: The exemption granted by this notice is effective at the beginning of model year 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Barbara A. Gray, Office of Market Incentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Ms. Gray's telephone number is (202) 366&hyph;1740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In February 1988, NHTSA published in the Federal Register a notice granting the petition from Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen) for an exemption from the parts marking requirements of the vehicle theft prevention standard for two model year (MY) 1989 Volkswagen car lines, the Audi 100 and Audi 200. (See 53 FR 4095, February 11, 1988). The agency determined that the antitheft device which Volkswagen intended to install on the two car lines as standard equipment was likely to be as effective in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft as would compliance with the parts marking requirements of the theft prevention standard. Subsequently, on April 29, 1992, NHTSA published a notice granting Volkswagen's petition for a modification of the 1988 exemption so that company could begin installing a new version of its antitheft device (See 57 FR 18203). The new device was placed as standard equipment on the MY 1992 Audi 100 and S4 (formerly the 200) lines. Volkswagen stated that the MY 1992 antitheft device included a modified central locking system, and included, on the higher priced models in the 100 line, a remote control signaling unit.
