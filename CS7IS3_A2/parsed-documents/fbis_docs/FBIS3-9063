But there is one thing that I find very difficult to bear: My family also has to live in this atmosphere of threat. [passage omitted] The extent of the media war's deterioration surpasses any imagination. And why? Purely and exclusively so that Hungarian Radio can speak to Hungarians and for Hungarians without any exclusion, by using the voice of decency. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] It is often said in various statements that there is a certain power behind you. Let me ask you, who is behind you? [Csucs] I do not know who you mean, or which party. I have practically no support whatsoever. [Correspondent] The [word indistinct] of the extreme right was mentioned. [Csucs] I do not know any extreme right and especially dislike this kind of adjectival locution. [passage omitted] I start out from what the parliament laid down in the budget law. And there is no sense in making politics out of it, about whether the government or the coalition parties or some other parties dominate or not. As long as the management of the institution is in my hand, I try to fulfill the professional requirements of my job to the best of my ability. [passage omitted] Even people opposing us did not dispute the fact that the level of overstaffing, which has reached the proportion of hydrocephaly, had to be tackled. On the other hand, we have to grab every opportunity to generate our own revenues. [passage omitted] The reorganization is completed, the government approved the amendment of the operational regulations regarding these institutions, and parallel with the reduction of managerial jobs, ordinary jobs were also cut. However, the way the public was informed, precisely because in essence, almost exclusively in the hand of a particular circle [words indistinct] it was linked to a singularly political tone. [Correspondent] So what was the motive in sacking the team of "168 Hours" and Akos Mester, their leader? [Csucs] We can talk about "168 Hours." The supervisory committee evaluated its work not long ago but the listeners have also formed their opinion. Considerable deviation from objective informing can be unequivocally proven in the program. These excesses do not favor the government particularly, rather the opposite. And when I say this as a criticism, I also have to say that I did not expect any program, especially not "168 Hours," to operate as the mouthpiece of the government, but neither do I expect, and what is more, I will not tolerate it operating as the mouthpiece of the opposition. This is a professional matter. [passage omitted] I also consider it a professional matter that a Hungarian radio should speak to the Hungarians and for the Hungarians, that to profess to be Hungarian and to champion Hungarian interests should not be considered a shame. Hungarians should be given proper information in all matters, about the legislation in order that they should battle through the painful period of transition. Hungarians should not have to sneak close to the wall with their heads down but, in possession of appropriate information, they should walk confortably in their own country with their heads high. [Correspondent] How long can this situation of being threatened be tolerated? How is your family bearing up to it? [Csucs] Yes, I can still tolerate it but my family is suffering. The idea was most resolutely formulated that if in Hungary, not only the head of the family but also members of the family are persecuted for pledging Hungarian values, then one has to emmigrate. From the country's point of view, if these affairs continue and things perhaps deteriorate, it will cause enormous damage. Just as ruining the country's reputation and discrediting it causes enormous damage, and certain radio employees are in the forefront of this. Earlier on I said that this was the betrayal of the nation but I can also say that it is the betrayal of the country. For this I will have to answer to the courts, since I was sued with the aim of financially ruining me. Well, this is where we are.
