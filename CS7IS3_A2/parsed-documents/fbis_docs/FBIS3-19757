The National Assembly delegation headed by Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih demanded that this issue be added to the agenda of the IPU conference, which was opened by French President Francois Mitterrand earlier today. The correspondent of the Iraqi News Agency in Paris said that the parliamentary delegations attending the conference, representing 125 countries, will discuss the Iraqi proposal and make a decision on it. The week-long conference will discuss the means of averting international conflicts; the United Nations' peacekeeping role; protecting the environment; the international political, economic, and social situation; and the possible drafting of a plan to remedy inequality between men and women in politics.
