FBIS4-10291 "drlat069_c_94016" FBIS-LAT-94-069 Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 MEXICO Thousands of Peasants, Workers Commemorate Zapata Thousands of Peasants, Workers Commemorate Zapata PA1004213994 Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2003 GMT 10 Apr 94 PA1004213994 Hamburg DPA Spanish BFN [Text] Mexico City, 10 Apr (DPA) -- Thousands of Mexicans marched today in the capital city to commemorate revolutionary peasant Emiliano Zapata, murdered 75 years ago. With a march along Reforma Central Avenue to the Zocalo, the demonstration -- which included peasant organizations from all over Mexico as well as leftist groups based in the capital city -- also protested the reforms made to Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution which now allows the privatization of the so called "land tenures" [ejidos]. Zapata, born in the State of Morelos, south of Mexico City, was a leading figure during the Mexican revolution (1910-1917). He became famous as a result of his cry "land and liberty" as well as because he demanded the distribution of large estates among the peasants. He was murdered in an ambush on 10 April 1919. Since this Mexican revolutionary and national hero's name was adopted by the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), some of the protesters openly expressed their support for the Chiapas guerrilla group that took up arms on 1 January 1994. Several of the signs held by the protesters read: "Zapata lives in the EZLN." Other signs carried the revolutionary hero's image, and expressed support for a "Government by the EZLN, the workers, peasants, and people's organizations." In addition to shouts such as "Here, there, Zapata will prevail," there were also shouts condemning the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico, the United States, and Canada which entered into effect this year. In the meantime, during a commemoration ceremony that took place at the Topanzolco Municipal Auditorium in Morelos, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said that many of Zapata's aspirations have come through. "However, Mexico changed, new problems arose as well as new opportunities, the Mexican rural sector changed, and our peasants also changed," Salinas pointed out in justifying the much criticized reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution which now allows the privatization of state land tenures established by the Mexican agrarian reform. The president highlighted that "prior to modifying Article 27 of the Constitution, we proceeded to discuss it exhaustively with the peasant organizations." Likewise, the president ruled out fears related to the reappearance of large estates. "The large estates will not reappear, they disappeared from our country's history," the president indicated.
