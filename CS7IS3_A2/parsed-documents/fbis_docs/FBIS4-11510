In the communique, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry "deplores the worsening of the Haitian crisis and deeply regrets this wave of violence, intimidation, torture, disappearances, assassinations, and illegal imprisonment of people linked to democratic political and labor movements." After indicating the death of the 23 Haitians "should be added to the list of other equally condemnable events in recent months," the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry states that there is "a systematic campaign by the Haitian military sector to exterminate the Haitian Democratic Movement and prevent a return to peace and institutional normality." The Venezuelan Government calls on Latin American and Caribbean countries "to join efforts to end the situation of violence and terror." It reiterates its support for OAS and UN efforts to restore institutional norms to Haiti. In conjunction with the United States, Canada, and France, Venezuela forms part of the so-called "Friends of Haiti Group," which has tried to mediate the return of ousted President Jean- Bertrand Aristide. Aristide took asylum in Venezuela for some months after the military coup against him in September 1991.
