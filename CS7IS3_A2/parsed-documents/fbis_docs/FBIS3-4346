Now, having apparently failed to make much of an impression on the Hong Kong Government, Cheung Kong chairman Li Ka-shing has revealed he has also been asking the Chinese Government to give the green light to increase the land supply. Beijing is certainly the right address for such a request. And it is tycoons like Mr Li, whose mainland links have long given them the ear of the Chinese leadership, who are in the best position to deliver it. In the current state of Sino-British political relations, the Hong Kong Government would be virtually helpless to push through any increase, even if it were convinced of the need. The failure of Governor Chris Patten to offer any concrete solutions to the property speculation problem led to an overnight sit-in last night by 11 United Democrat legislators. Although land releases beyond the strict minimum of 50 hectares a year laid down by the Joint Declaration are technically possible, they have to be agreed jointly with the Chinese through the Land Commission. It would take someone of Mr Li's stature and influence to get the Chinese side to be more cooperative. However, the question remains whether even Mr Li is able to push China into meeting their needs. If keeping a stranglehold on land supply is seen in Beijing as a crucial bargaining chip with Britain, there will be no increase in the amount of new land for a while yet. An indication of China's negative thinking is the row over the release of 62 hectares of land for the construction of the airport railway. If China persists in demanding the new land be phased in gradually under the 50-hectare quota, it will seriously delay the completion of the project and sharply reduce the amount of new land available for other projects. It surely will win over many Hong Kong people's hearts if Beijing agrees to release more lands promptly. Mr Li and his fellow Hong Kong Affairs advisers have been claiming that it is a shortage of land, not the hoarding of completed flats, which has been pushing up prices. Nevertheless, the Consumer Council estimates that about half of the flats completed last year have remained vacant. Whom do these empty flats belong to?
