The Russian side is represented at the international banking congress by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Vice Premiers Anatoliy Chubays and Aleksandr Shokhin, and Russian Federation Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko. EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere declared that the European Bank intends to fundamentally modify the ideology of cooperation with Russia and the CIS countries, going over to direct ties with regions, commercial structures, and enterprises. There will be presentations of 50 Russian investment projects within the framework of the International Banking Forum. An agreement on the use of the Proton carrier rocket to put European space satellites into orbit is expected to be concluded with the Russian premier's participation. Representatives of the "Mayak" Design Bureau and the European Bank intend to sign the relevant documents. At the initial stage the project is valued at U.S.$10 million. In the opinion of experts, this contract could signify the reorientation of European space structures toward the Russian market. Precisely 24 investment programs submitted by St. Petersburg were submitted for the European bankers' verdict. They include a project for the construction of a ring road which will solve the problems of transit communication between north European and Baltic countries and the northwest region of Russia, the construction of a high-speed main railroad between Moscow and St. Petersburg, and the reconstruction of the historic city on the Neva.
