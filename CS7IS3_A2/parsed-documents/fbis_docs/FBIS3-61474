Bukarov, Yu.S. Sedov, Yu.S. Ishchenko, NIKIMT Scientific Production Association; UDC 621.791.754:621.643.1/.2] [Abstract] The stringent requirements imposed on the toxic substance concentration in process media transported mostly over electrochemically polished stainless steel pipes which are usually fabricated by gas-shielded nonconsumable electrode welding prompted the development of comprehensive support for pipe welding in clean rooms. The equipment and machine tool attachments necessary for ensuring the requisite welded joint quality from the viewpoint of protecting the weld metal and heat affected area (ZTV) from oxidation are outlined in detail. The Kama-1 pipe welding head developed, manufactured, and tested by the NIKIMT Scientific Production Association for welding small diameter pipes (5-14 mm) and its successor--the Kama-2 head--are described and their specifications are cited. Equipment for the ER-273 power supply unit for single- and multiple-pass wedding, a TV endoscope, ODA welding head attachments, and a manual pipe cutter developed by the association are described and their technical data are summarized. All above equipment can be stored in a specially designed transportable case. Figures 6; tables 2.
