Comrade Kim Chong-il has led the WPK over the past 30 years, taking upon himself the work of all domains of party building including the organisational, ideological and leadership departments. The article says the history of his leadership over the party building is a history of unfailing loyalty in which he has firmly defended the lineage of the party established by the leader and glorified the party as a great revolutionary party, and a brilliant history in which he indicated the fundamental questions of the revolutionary party building with his extraordinary intelligence and comprehensively completed the theories of building of a working- class party in the present era. The article goes on: Expounded in the theories of the party building which have been historically developed by the dear leader in depth are all the principled questions of party building, including the basic principles of party building, the idea and theory of building the party in a prospective way, the guidelines for strengthening the party ranks organisationally and ideologically and intensifying the party's leadership over the revolution and construction, and the ways of achieving close unity with the masses. The past 30 years of his leadership to our party is also a proud history in which he has fundamentally changed the looks of the party with his surprising organisational skill and leadership ability. He has changed fundamentally in a historically short period all domains and units of the party work from the question of improving the party members' mode of thinking and style of work to the question of traits of cadres, from the intra-party affairs to the external activities of the party. Comrade Kim Chong-il has performed immortal feats unprecedented in the history of the revolutionary party building in the course of his glorious 30 years of leadership to the work of our party. The greatest feat performed by him in realizing the cause of building of our party is that he has laid solid organisational and ideological foundations for strengthening and developing the party into a revolutionary party of chuche united in one mind forever. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has said: "The top echelon of the party has been built up, the organisational and ideological foundation of the party laid as firmly as a rock and its guidance system solidly established so as to carry on the ideas and leadership of our party. This is a brilliant success and a great victory in the building of our party." A great victory worthy of special record in history has been won in the organisational and ideological building of our party under the guidance of the dear leader over the past 30 years. In our party now, the ranks of cadres who constitute the backbone of its organisational and ideological foundation have been built with staunch revolutionaries who are sharing life and death with the party in any adversity. All our party members are vanguard fighters following the leader only with loyalty and filial piety. In the aspect of ideological building, our party has become a pure ideological entity in which only one idea, the chuche idea, prevails. Any heterogeneous idea or unsound trend contrary to the ideology and intentions of the leader cannot intrude into our party. Great feats performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il in the cause of building a revolutionary party of chuche also lie in that he has strengthened and developed our party into a powerful general staff of the revolution leading the revolutionary cause along an ever- victorious road with his invincible leadership ability. In the course of his leadership of the cause of party building the party's leadership system has been established in our society on the highest level whereby to firmly ensure the party's leadership over all the domains and units of the revolution and construction. Having strengthened and developed the party into an invincible revolutionary party linked to the masses by the strongest, close bonds of kinship is a great feat performed by Comrade Kim Chong-il in the cause of building the revolutionary party of chuche. He has established throughout the party a revolutionary trait of working as demanded by the Chongsanri spirit and the Chongsanri method, thus turning the party into a revolutionary party always sharing the same destiny with the masses at all times in one lineage, a party without bureaucratism and abuse of power, for the first time in the history of the communist movement. Having strengthened and developed the Workers' Party of Korea into indestructible militant ranks never seen before in the ideological and organisational aspects and in relations with the masses and set a model of the times in building a revolutionary party holds the most brilliant place in the revolutionary feats performed by the dear leader.
