Hand-to-hand combat continues. National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's [UNITA] rebels continue to pitilessly shell the martyred city of Cuito. In response, government forces continue to inflict heavy losses on Jonas Savimbi's UNITA, which has already lost more than 100 men. The clashes have been intensifying day by day and it is still not yet known when peace will return to Cuito.
