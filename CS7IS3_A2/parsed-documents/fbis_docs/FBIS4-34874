General Cedras visited the Military Academy, the Dessalines Barracks, and the Haitian Navy installations on Friday. Cedras, the leader of the coup d'etat that overthrew constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, criticized the international community for its "immoral" attitude toward Haiti. The Haitian Army chief has called on the troops to be ready to take action in case of any emergency or foreign intervention. For the past few days, on Cedras' orders, security measures have been tightened at the barracks, and "strategic zones" have been established to which civilians may not get close. Air traffic between the United States and Haiti should be suspended this weekend as part of the tightening of sanctions against the country's coupist regime following several weeks of constant departures of foreigners from Port-au-Prince. Some people, who were waiting to board a plane to leave Haiti last night, could not do so despite having confirmed reservations with Haiti's "Trans Air" airlines. Meanwhile, Haitian citizens, who were in the United States, and some foreign journalists arrived in Port-au-Prince aboard an "American Airlines" flight coming from Miami. The Center for Free Enterprise and Democracy (CLED) in Haiti, mostly made up of young businessmen, protested the new economic sanctions imposed by the United States against the Caribbean island. The CLED criticized the drafting of a list of businessmen who would face sanctions without prior warning and without the possibility of resorting to lawyers. This week, U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to freeze the bank accounts of all Haitians who have money in U.S. banks and live in Haiti. According to the CLED, this is an "immoral" measure. The CLED said the people adversely affected are not responsible for the crisis in Haiti. In a communique, the CLED stated it is unfair to punish people just because they belong to such and such a family. The CLED also spoke in favor of the restoration of constitutional order and state of law in Haiti. According to the CLED businessmen, the attitude of the United States and the international community is to "drown" Haiti. The document issued by the CLED, dated 24 June, states that the U.S. Government is acting in an "illegal and hypocritical" manner against Haiti. The CLED believes the measures approved by the United States seek to divide the private sector and inspire society to go against the businessmen.
