An official PLO spokesman said in a statement to AFP: "The PLO presents its condolences to the families of the victims (of the attack)," which also left 45 wounded. "The PLO hopes that all concerned parties will assume their responsibility to safeguard the peace process and achieve its aims, to ensure a just and equal solution between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples," the statement said.
