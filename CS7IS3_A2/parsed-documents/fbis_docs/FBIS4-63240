In reality, all that happened was that a commission from Ukraine's Interior Ministry headed by Valentyn Nedryhaylo, Ukraine's first deputy minister of internal affairs, arrived in Crimea. [passage omitted] Because the Crimean side was not informed ahead of time of the arrival at 0300 [on 19 May] of the Ukrainian internal affairs commission headed by Valentyn Nedryhaylo, who was accompanied by 15 "special force [spetsnaz] troops," the commission considers that this was a blatant violation. Valentyn Nedryhaylo also admitted that representatives of the power department acted "rather improperly." But in the words of the "spetsnaz" themselves, there was no attempt at an assault. By way of confirmation, Oleksiy Tkach, a representative of Ukraine's Interior Ministry press center, demonstrated video scenes of all the night's events to representatives of the television and radio company "Crimea." It is interesting that after General Kuznetsov's speech at the session of the Crimean Supreme Council, deputies appointed him minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Crimea.
