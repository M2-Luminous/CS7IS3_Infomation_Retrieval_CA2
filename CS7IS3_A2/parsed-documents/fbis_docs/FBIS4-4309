The report says: The current conference initiated by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a historic meeting, the first of its kind ever since the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea. It will powerfully demonstrate the revolutionary faith and unshakable will of the entire party cell secretaries and party members to remain loyal to the party and the leader and accomplish the cause of socialism without the slightest vacillation under the complex situation; it will also mark a radical turning point in further strengthening the WPK into an invincible party and accelerating the general march of Korean-style socialism. Through a long-drawn-out arduous yet glorious struggle, the WPK has been strengthened into a tested veteran party with great revolutionary exploits and rich experience and a powerful revolutionary party that can defend and carry to completion the revolutionary cause of chuche, the cause of socialism and communism, through storm and stress. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said in his letter of congratulations to the delegates to the current conference: "The foundation of our party and its development are inconceivable apart from the development of its cell, the basic party organization." The party cells, the basic organisations of the party and militant units directly implementing the party's line and policy, have played a very important role in strengthening the WPK and victoriously advancing the Korean revolution. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song formed the grassroots organisations of the party and expanded them before founding the wpk, a revolutionary party of chuche type, and strengthening it. The work of strengthening the party cells as required by the party's chuche-based idea of its building has been promoted more dynamically in the gigantic undertaking to model the whole party and society on the chuche idea under the outstanding and tested guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. "On letting the party cell discharge its duty of effectively guiding the activities of the party members," "the party cell must properly organise party assignments and review them in time," "let us strengthen the unity and cohesion of the party members in ideology and purpose based on the revolutionary idea of the leader" and other works published by the dear leader in the early 1960s have served as a highly important guideline in improving the work of the party cells and the activities of the party members. The dear leader declared the modelling of the whole society on the chuche idea the supreme programme of the WPK and laid down the policy of modelling the whole party on the chuche idea in the 1970s, and guided the party cells to effectively train the party members into ardent communist revolutionaries of chuche type who are intensely loyal to the party and the leader and uphold the leadership of the party centre with loyalty, to meet the new requirement of the development of the party and the revolution. The national short course for party cell secretaries held in may 1991 marked a significant milestone in strengthening the party cells. Over the last three years, all the party cells and their secretaries have worked hard to make their cells unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader in hearty response to "let us strengthen the party cells," the historic letter sent by the dear leader to the participants in the short course. The members of tens of thousands of party cells sent letters to the dear leader, pledging to follow the party wholeheartedly and remain loyal to the revolutionary cause of chuche to the last, and are carrying their pledge into practice. The party cells have made vigorous efforts to implement the party's military line of self-reliant defence to the letter, greatly contributing to the increase of defence capabilities of the country to smash any formidable enemy at one blow. They are devotedly working to consolidate the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses, the source of the invincible might of our socialism. All the party members and people, closely rallied behind the party and the leader in one mind and purpose, breathe the breath of the party's idea and will, speak the way the party does, and march as one at the command of the party. The WPK has been strengthened into an ever-victorious revolutionary party deeply rooted among the broad masses and the party and people have won victory after victory in the political and military confrontation with the enemy hell- bent on stifling the cause of socialism. Lurking behind this are the devoted efforts and hidden feats of all the party cell secretaries. Hundreds of thousands of party cells secretaries who are intensely loyal to the party and the leader and devote everything to the country and the people are valuable beings of our party and revolution. Our party and people are highly proud of having these excellent party cell secretaries. The reporter elaborated on the tasks for a vigorous march toward the final victory of the revolutionary cause of chuche, the cause of socialism, saying: If all the party cells are to become militant organisations remaining intensely loyal to the party and the leader and defending and exalting the cause of socialism, they must thoroughly fulfill the five major tasks of party cells advanced by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his letter of congratulations to the delegates to the current conference as well as the highly important tasks set forth by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in his historic letter to the participants in the national short course for party cell secretaries in May 1991 "let us strengthen the party cells." All the party cells must continue to maintain it as the keypoint of its work to establish the system of the unitary leadership of the party, and wholeheartedly uphold the party's leadership with loyalty and filial piety, cherishing deep in mind the high pride and honour of having the dear leader as the centre of unity, the centre of leadership and the supreme commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces. The party cells must establish a revolutionary habit of unconditionally accepting and fully implementing the instructions of the great leader and the dear leader and the party's line and policy, their embodiment, and train all the party members to be iron walls and rifles and bombs to resolutely defend the party and the leader politically, ideologically and with their lives under whatever condition and circumstance. The party cells and their secretaries must educate all the party members and other working people to maintain high revolutionary vigilance against the war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique and make full preparations to firmly defend the socialist motherland and the gains of the revolution under any unexpected circumstance.
