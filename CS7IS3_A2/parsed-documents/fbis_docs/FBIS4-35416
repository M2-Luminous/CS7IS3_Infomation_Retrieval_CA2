Dr. al-Majali and Mr. Buwayz discussed ways of bolstering relations between the two countries, particularly in the fields of economy and trade. They also reviewed latest developments in the Middle East peace process. The Lebanese minister said later that Middle East peace should be given a chance even if nearly three years of Arab-Israeli talks have failed to achieve much for his country. He said the Israeli side had to prove it is still committed to the principles of peace and to implementing international resolutions, including the principle of land for peace. Buwayz told the News at Ten that Jordanian-Lebanese ties were good and commended Jordan's position toward the peace process as highly credible. [Begin recording] [Buwayz] If we have to describe our relations, I will say that we have some very good relations, which need to be maybe better organized at the technical, at the commercial, at the economical level. And, I hope, we talked about the possibility of naming a high commission, which will study all the problems concerning this field. [Correspondent Maha al-Sha'ir] With respect to the peace process, how do you view coordination with Jordan, and where is Lebanon now? [Buwayz] I think that Jordan, the Jordanian Government, proved a high level of credibility in the unified Arab position till now. We think that this peace can be only a global peace, real peace, and this ask from ourselves unified position concerning the whole problems of the area. We think that any party, which will try to go very fast, will have to wait for the others because at the end this peace cannot be between Israel and only one party. And nobody in the Arab world can by itself only cover this peace decision. [end recording]
