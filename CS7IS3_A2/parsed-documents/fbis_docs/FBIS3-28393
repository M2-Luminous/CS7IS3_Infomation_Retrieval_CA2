After hearing Mr. Le Xuan Trinh, minister of state and head of the government office, give a briefing on the actual financial situation of the union and the responsibility of Director-General Nguyen Van, and based on the views of various responsible statement mangement sectors, on a protest note from the Supreme People's Organ of Control, on the results of an audit conducted by the Ministry of Finance, on inferences of the personnel affairs section of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry and of the Lam Dong provincial party committee as well as on the many public views reported earlier, and after hearing various sectors express their views, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai arrived at the following decision: 1. The Vietnamese sericultural sector is one of the country's high potential sectors. It has been and is providing employment to hundreds of thousands of workers. However, present and long-term development plans for the sericultural sector must be carefully worked out. As the main end-product of the sericultural sector is destined for export, we must accept the mode of development and production in line with the market system and international competition. 2. Violations committed in the past by the union of sericultural enterpises in financial management principles were grave. These include using short-term capital loans for capital construction, especially for a number of projects which are not necessary for sericultural production and are characteristic of showiness, failing to develop any economic results. In a number of projects built with short-term capital loans, the union has failed to comply with state stipulations. The union's expenditure management has not been strict enough. Its sluggish debt payment has resulted in a higher interest rate which the union can hardly afford. The responsibility for these violations rests with Director-General Nguyen Van. Director-General Nguyen Van used part of the loans obtained from the state to buy silk cocoons from the people and to carry out capital construction, such as buying certain equipment and transportation means. He also built a number of projects such as hotels and shopping centers just for show without taking into consideration their economic results and the consequential bank interest payments. He also failed to carefully consider various factors such as product quantity and quality and production cost when it comes to borrowing money from a number of countries to import silk-reeling and weaving tools. Comrade Nguyen Van is a cadre who has devoted himself to the development of the Vietnamese sericultural sector. He planned to develop a specialized sericultural production center in the Bao Loc hilly area for use as a basis for nationwide sericultural production efforts, trying to build a sizable industry with Bao Loc as a center. However, having committed such shortcomings is very grave. Noteworthy is the fact that the prime minister has on several occasions warned Comrade Nguyen Van, the minister of agriculture and food industry, and the secretary of the Lam Dong provincial party committee about the irregularities committed by the union in using its capital loans. It is requested that the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry's personnel affairs section and the minister of agriculture and food industry sternly criticize Comrade Nguyen Van for his irregularities, and that Comrade Nguyen Van be made to face stern disciplinary actions given the fact that he is the head of a giant union. If Comrade Nguyen Van is willing to correct his wrongdoings and continue to devote himself to the sericultural sector, to place himself under the ministry's control, and to accept the assistance of various state organs, he will be able to continue his service with the sericultural sector. It is also necessary for him to rectify the production and business activities of his union to bring it back to effective operation and to clear up its debts. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry must sternly criticize the board of directors of the union and strengthen it so it will become more competent to serve the cause of sericultural growth and will see economic results as the ultimate goal as opposed to any excessively showy formats without taking into account economic results. As for the union's party executive committee, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry must provide the Lam Dong provincial party committee with a detailed report with recommendations so the latter can criticize the committee over this issue in accordance with the party's principles and statute. The criticism of Comrade Nguyen Van and the disciplinary actions taken against him as well as efforts to criticize and revamp the union's board of directors must be completed within the first quarter of 1994 if we are to promptly stabilize the union's production and business activities. The comrade minister of agriculture and food industry must criticize himself in view of his responsibility of providing managerial guidance for the union in the past. Responsible sectors, especially specialized commercial banks which have provided capital loans to the union, must also show a sense of responsbility by helping the union resolve its present difficulties. The state bank governor must also criticize himself given his responsibility to provide state management. He must also criticize specialized commercial banks for having as a result of their lack of control and auditing failed to detect the mistake of loaning a large sum of money to the union to use for inappropriate purposes as noted above. Presently, the financial situation of the union is very difficult. As the union is an important union of the state whose survival has an effect, both directly and indirectly, on the employment and welfare of hundreds of thousands of sericultural workers, we must, on the one hand, point out the shortcomings of the union so it can correct them while, on the other, seek ways to consolidate the union, trying to bring the union's activities onto the right track, effectively reorganize the union's production and business activities, secure and recover the amount of capital already invested by the state in the union, make full use of the source of agricultural labor and the latent potential in land and climate of various areas in the country for sericultural production, and increase the competitive power of our sericultural products in the world market. The prime minister decided on a number of specific corrective measures aimed at rectifying the operations of the Vietnam Union of Sericultural Enterprises. These measures include those designed to clear up debts; to rectify those tasks involving finance, capital, assets, equipment management, and renovating the union organizationally; and so forth in order to continue to maintain and develop the sericultural sector at a time when we are shifting to a market economy amid increasingly tough world competition in this field of activity.
