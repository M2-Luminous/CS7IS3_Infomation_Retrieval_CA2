The greatest concentration of chetniks and the largest amount of military hardware have been registered in the valley of the Praca River from the direction of Necici toward Jabucko Sedlo and Sjenokos. The situation in the town (?center) is taking on the bloodiest proportions. The innocent civilian population has been suffering from being out in the open. A wide-scale epidemic is threatening, so Gorazde is again sending an appeal for help for the suffering. The situation in the war hospital, the health center is worse than sad. No words can describe the situation there. Dozens of civilian victims killed by the criminals from the hills are lying in the streets of the town and on the bridges over the Drina. It was impossible to help them at all, as the chetniks blanketed every inch of the free Gorazde territory, and particularly the town center, with fierce artillery and sniper fire from the surrounding hills.
