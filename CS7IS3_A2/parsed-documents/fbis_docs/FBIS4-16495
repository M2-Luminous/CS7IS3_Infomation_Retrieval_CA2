Kostomarov: "NATO General Harry Johnson: `Like Most Soldiers, I Am Happily Married'"] [Excerpt] Kaliningrad Oblast was the last stopover in the tour of Harry Johnson, commander in chief of NATO forces in the North European theater of war operations. Prior to that, he visited Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Severomorsk (Murmansk Oblast). On the final day of his visit, the British general toured Baltiysk where he familiarized himself with the crews of the patrol boat "Nesokrushimiy" and the squadron torpedo boat "Nastoychiviy." On board the latter vessel, Harry Johnson and Vice Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, first Baltic Fleet deputy commander, who accompanied the general, answered journalists' questions. [Journalist] You managed to spend very little time in the Baltic Fleet. Nevertheless, how do you assess the level of constructiveness in the talks with its command? [Johnson] This is my first visit to the Baltic Fleet. However, my first meeting with Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, current Baltic Fleet commander, took place 18 months ago in St. Petersburg. In the presence of the press, I would like to express my gratitude for the sincere and extremely warm welcome that was given to me by the fleet command, Vice Admiral Kravchenko, its first deputy commander, and all officers who worked with our delegation. We had a good opportunity to visit two combat ships. We were favorably impressed with their equipment with the most up-to-date arms, and with its maintenance. You have asked me about cooperation that the future has in store for us. Actually, this cooperation has already begun. This year, a Baltic Fleet ship will participate in joint NATO maneuvers under the coded name "Baltic Operation `94." During the visit, we conveyed the invitation to Baltic Fleet Commander Admiral Yegorov to attend the exercise of missile boats as an observer, which are scheduled for this year. During our stay in Moscow and meetings with General Colonel Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the general staff of the Russian Armed Forces, and Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the Russian Fleet, as well as with the Baltic Fleet command, we saw that their attitude toward our cooperation was highly favorable. Our current key goal is to work out the details of interaction under the circumstances of reduced finances, which is a pressing issue for both parties. It is these technical details that I, as well as the officers of my staff, are engaged in today. This is the key goal of our visit here. Let me express my views as a soldier and commander in chief of NATO forces in Northern Europe. It is the naval forces that have a great potential for the development of our cooperation. Our aim is to turn the zones of the Baltic and North Seas into a region of true cooperation and interaction. [Journalist] As you know, Russian Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev visited this area recently. He referred to the implementation of the idea about the creation of the so-called special defense region in Kaliningrad Oblast in the immediate future. You happen to be the first foreign guest after the defense minister's visit. Could you, as a military person, express your attitude toward this idea? [Johnson] Unfortunately, I have no information about the decisions that Russian Defense Minister Grachev adopted here concerning the establishment of some special defense region in Kaliningrad. However, this oblast is part of Russia, and it is a matter of this country, its government and the defense ministry to introduce such a defense regime which they deem necessary. Even if I had some information, this is neither my business nor my right to discuss and comment on decisions adopted by the Russian Defense Ministry. [Journalist] You just returned from a ship, the commander of which has said that the crew will shortly participate in the NATO exercise "Baltop `94." I would like to hear something from the two military leaders about the perspective of our cooperation. [Johnson] I had a chance to tour a modern and well-equipped ship. It has made an impression on me. The crew and the commander are convinced of the ship's capacity to fulfill the set tasks. I believe that its level of equipment with up-to-date military facilities, guidance and navigation systems allows this ship to perform any tasks in such an operative group as the "Baltic Operation." This is a U.S. exercise, which, if we follow its development, is expanding its scale and becoming more complicated in terms of its tasks. I believe that the participation of Russian ships in this drill will serve for our closer military cooperation. [Kravchenko] Any cooperation, particularly among the military, will bring only benefits. This year, our ships will visit several countries, including Finland, Belgium. and France. The question of whether our ships will go to the Kiel week is now being resolved. Here in Baltiysk, we also receive guests and ships from other countries. All these contacts lead to a better mutual understanding. The fact that a Russian ship is participating in a NATO exercise for the second time reflects the strengthening of this collaboration year by year. The time will come when several vessels rather than a single ship will take part in this enterprise. [Journalist] We know the story of the establishment of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The latter is already nonexistent. What is your opinion on the future of NATO? [Johnson] The Warsaw Pact ceased to exist concurrently with the breakup of the Soviet Union. Contrary to this, the situation in NATO is slightly different. The European Union continues to exist. Moreover, the process of integration among these countries is expanding. At the same time, this leads to the development of NATO. This development is progressing along the line of defining its goals and tasks in accordance with the current situation. [passage omitted]
