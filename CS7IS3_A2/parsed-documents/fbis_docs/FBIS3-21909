A Caracol correspondent has reported that inmates Gustavo Adolfo Gutierrez Arrubla (alias Maxwell and La Trapeadora), Luis Carlos Aguilar Gallego (El Mugre), Jose Fernando Posadas Fierro, and Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo (Arete) are scheduled to be transferred to Itagui. On 8 December 1993, the four confessed drug-traffickers were unexpectedly transferred to Santa Fe de Bogota's La Picota Prison. The Caracol Network reports the inmates are being transferred to Itagui "despite recommendations against such a move by the national government." Two weeks ago, a conflict arose between Colombia's justice minister and the nation's prosecutor general because the minister opposed the order to transfer the inmates to another prison, warning that the transfer could help the dismantled Medellin Cartel reunite despite Pablo Escobar's December 1993 death. Meanwhile in Medellin, it has been reported that the widow of Pablo Escobar, Victoria Henao, today visited her brother-in-law Roberto, alias Osito, at Itagui Prison. Victoria Henao traveled with her son Juan Pablo from her home in the Colombian capital to Medellin, where she stayed only a few hours. In the afternoon she returned to the Colombian capital aboard a charter flight.
