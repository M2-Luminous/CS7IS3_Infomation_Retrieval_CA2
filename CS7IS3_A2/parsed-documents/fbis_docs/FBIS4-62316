Moscow still insists that the Bosnian conflict can only be settled through negotiations.

In their latest proposals signed in Vienna, the Muslim-Croat side claimed as much as 58 percent of the territory. I can easily imagine, from my endless contacts with the sides, that both the Muslims can as yet claim up to 90 percent, and the Serbs, who also have some hotheads among them, can also claim up to 90 percent, leaving their neighbors with just a tiny stretch of land.
