Addressing those present, Leonid Kravchuk said: [Begin Kravchuk recording] [passage omitted] As for the 26 June elections, there is no common point of view on this issue among the people at this point. An opinion is widely held by power structures, local authorities, political circles, and working teams that it is not expedient to hold the elections for president as well as heads and deputy heads of local councils at this time. This position was also endorsed in an address by a group of deputies to the people and the president of Ukraine. Since it was the Supreme Council that made a decision on early presidential elections and the election of local councils, only the Supreme Council can rescind it. As the president and a presidential candidate in the next presidential elections, I consider it necessary to explain my position on the June elections to the deputies and some proposals concerning this issue. The situation that has take shape as a result of the elections for president and local councils has three aspects -- political, economic, and legal. The political aspect. As you know, some time ago, I actively supported the intention to hold early presidential elections, seeing it as a way to assuage political tension in the country. However, at this very time, there is a great risk that the political campaign will not only fail to soothe this tension, but hasten destabilizing processes as well as the polarization of political forces and their confrontation. An intensive campaign to elect the state's leader will only step up the political fight, while today, we need accord and mutual understanding to carry out socioeconomic changes and emerge from the current crisis. Perhaps, it is not by coincidence that many countries, especially in the CIS, conclude agreements on civil peace, accord, and joint efforts to preserve the state. This is of extraordinary importance for Ukraine and presents a chance for saving the state. One should take into consideration the arrangement of political forces in the country and distinctive features of its regions, which would inevitably divide people on the grounds of their attitude toward presidential candidates. It is already clear that those divisions will assume very acute forms and become an obstacle to civil accord. A serious threat to state-building is the vague status of local governments. The June elections are supposed to determine an utterly new option for the Ukrainian state system. Oblast and rayon councils receive the status of state bodies, or to be more precise, a new and imperfect status of local self-government bodies. As a matter of fact, it is an attempt to introduce a federal type of state system because oblast councils are given legislative powers. Their heads are elected directly by the oblast's population and cannot be replaced without its consent -- of course, if the established principles of expressing people's will are respected. [passage omitted] Supporting broad economic independence of the [Ukrainian] regions, I am not going to use it as an excuse for dividing the unified unitarian state into separate parts. The state's federalization, unmatched by clearly defined constitutional norms, well-considered current legislation, and mechanisms for relations between the center and the hinterland, will make society unmanageable. By the way, experience shows that it will take years, not one month, to create legislation and adopt the Constitution allowing Ukraine to become a federal state. I am convinced that such large-scale transformations can only be done based on a new constitution. In this particular case, I invoke our national experience. Everyone knows that contradictions between Ukraine and the Crimea were caused by the fact that the Constitution does not specify relations between the country as a whole and its autonomous territory. Now, we are faced with the threat of spreading this kind of tension to all Ukrainian oblasts, which may trigger a political crisis. So there are serious grounds to believe that the June elections, in spite all good intentions, can lead to abrupt changes in society and put the state-building process in jeopardy. I am confident that one should at first adopt relevant constitutional principles and lay the legal base, and then launch political reforms. [passage omitted] [end recording]
