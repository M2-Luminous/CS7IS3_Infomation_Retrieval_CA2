Mironski: "No Justification for the Greek Measures"] [Text] German Foreign Ministry Minister of State Helmut Scheffer and the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski held a news conference yesterday in which they emphasized their mutual interest in the further development of bilateral relations between the two countries. Crvenkovski indicated that Scheffer's visit coincided with the embargo imposed by Greece against Macedonia, which was also a subject of the discussions. Minister Scheffer pointed out that he did not arrive in Macedonia as a mediator between Greece and Macedonia, but as a representative of a government of a member country of the European Union, which wanted to gain an insight into reactions in Macedonia and then transmit these impressions to its own government, and also to the Union. He said: "My impression is that there is great tranquillity here concerning the development of events, without any demonstrative emotions about the Greek embargo. It is difficult for every state to make concessions under foreign pressures. That is why I consider the Greek measures to be wrong." Minister Scheffer also added: "Nobody in Europe wants the political isolation of Greece; it is part of Europe, but Greece must also admit that it should have agreed with its partners before taking these measures. The decision, which came without warning or reasons, was hard for everyone in Europe to understand." "Greece must understand that it cannot make unilateral decisions without any reason," he said, and added: "I cannot find a single argument that Macedonia represents a threat for Greece; it is nothing but a fantasy. We cannot allow the borders in Europe to be changed by force. I do not believe that Macedonian integrity will be endangered, because it is impermissible to have another conflict on the territory of former Yugoslavia." Concerning the Greek embargo and the damage suffered by Macedonia, Scheffer said: "Greece is losing a lot itself. Perhaps not as much as Macedonia, but it is. I do not see any reason why it should harm itself economically and politically. The embargo is a question that will have to be solved by the European Union, and the official German stance is that it has to be lifted immediately." He also emphasized that he would transmit his impressions to the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the Union Hans van den Brook, suggesting that negotiations should restart promptly, and he also pointed out that preliminary agreements should be organized. Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski said that Scheffer's visit was of enormous importance, first of all for bilateral and economic cooperation between the two countries. An agreement was made about an exchange of experts to help companies restart the long cooperation that existed before the war in former Yugoslavia. A larger scientific and cultural cooperation was also subject of the discussions, and soon a German library is expected to open in Macedonia.
