Repeating the ramifications for Hong Kong of a Sino-U.S. trade war, Mr Patten said the withdrawal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status could undermine the effective implementation of the Joint Declaration. The Sino-British Joint Declaration sets out the conditions under which Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule in 1997. Mr Patten warned that if China's U.S. trading privileges were withdrawn, the crippling effects for Hong Kong would undermine the "one country, two systems" concept under which the territory would operate after the transfer of sovereignty. It was the first time that Mr Patten had linked economics to politics, having strenuously urged China not to do so during the current Sino-British stalemate. "It's (the implementation of the Joint Declaration) which will be the principal task for Britain and China in Hong Kong until ]997 and afterwards," Mr Patten said. "(The withdrawal of China's MFN status) would be a body blow to confidence in Hong Kong at a crucial time. It would put at risk all that we are trying to do to secure Hong Kong's future," Mr Patten told the American Chamber of Commerce, adding that the territory's economic growth would be cut by more than half and unemployment trebled. U.S. President Bill Clinton has stated that the renewal of China's preferential trade status hinged on whether it could demonstrate a marked improvement in its human rights record. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned yesterday that China still had time to make sufficient progress on human rights by early June to justify maintaining its MFN status. The Governor yesterday dispatched his deputy, Chief Secretary Anson Chan, to the U.S. to lobby the Clinton administration to renew China's trading privileges. Mr Patten himself spearheaded the campaign in Washington last year. His strongly-worded warning yesterday, on the eve of Mrs Chan's visit, appeared to mark the start of Hong Kong's annual lobbying campaign to preserve China's trading privileges. A high-powered Hong Kong Chinese business delegation has been in Washington this week to press for MFN renewal, and the American Chamber of Commerce -- the biggest outside the United States -- plans to do likewise in the coming weeks. Mr Patten insisted that Hong Kong people were concerned about human rights and the conduct of China in jailing MING PAO reporter Xi Yang for allegedly stealing state secrets. But curtailing trading privileges was not the answer, he said. "It's possible to have a serious dialogue, for example, as Australia is doing with China, without mixing up trade and politics," Mr Patten said. U.S. investment in Hong Kong was worth more than $1.2 billion, Mr Patten said. Arguing that free trade leads to greater human rights -- and noting that Libya and Iran had MFN status -- he said that it would be China's masses who would be paying the price of a Sino-U.S. trade war. "The people who are performing the Chinese economic miracle are above all the ordinary people, the entrepreneurs, the small businesses, the investors," Mr Patten said.
