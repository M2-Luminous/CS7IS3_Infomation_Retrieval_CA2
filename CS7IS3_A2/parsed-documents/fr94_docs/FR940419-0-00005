FR940419-0-00005 FR940419-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of Thrift Supervision 12 CFR Chapter V and Parts 503, 504, 505, 515, 544, 552, and 561 [No. 93&hyph;250] Technical Amendments AGENCY: Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations to incorporate a number of technical and conforming amendments. The amendments include a global revision to reflect the change from the MACRO to the CAMEL rating system used by the other federal banking regulatory agencies and a reinstatement of the definition of ``affiliated person'' that was inadvertently removed. The rule also revises OTS's organizational regulations to reflect current titles and makes technical corrections to provisions concerning bylaws and charter reissuance. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Gottlieb, Senior Paralegal, (202) 906&hyph;7135, or Deborah Dakin, Assistant Chief Counsel, (202) 906&hyph;6445, Regulations and Legislation Division, Chief Counsel's Office, Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street NW., Washington DC 20552. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The OTS is today adopting several technical amendments to its regulations to implement the new rating system for savings associations, to reinstate a definitional provision, to update organizational titles and addresses and correct an erroneous cross-reference. CAMEL Rating System The OTS is amending its regulations to reflect the conversion from the MACRO to the CAMEL rating system. The purpose of the conversion is to reduce regulatory burden by using the same rating system employed by the other federal banking regulatory agencies. The MACRO system currently used by the OTS is very similar to the FDIC's CAMEL policy guidance. The conversion is intended to improve consistency with regard to risk-based assessments and joint examinations. The OTS expects there to be virtually no practical effect on savings associations as a result of this change. Affiliated Person Definition The OTS is also taking the opportunity to reinstate its definition of ``affiliated person,'' which formerly appeared as ยง561.5. The definition, which was inadvertently removed through the final rule on regulatory review, 1 is being restored without change to avoid confusion or misunderstanding about the applicability of restrictions on affiliated persons. 1 58 FR 4308 (Jan. 14, 1993). Bylaws and Charter Reissuance The appendix to part 544 which sets forth model bylaws for mutual savings associations is being amended to bring it into conformity with ยง544.5(b)(8). The appendix to part 552 containing model bylaws for stock associations is being revised to bring it into conformity with ยง552.6&hyph;1(h). A conforming change is also being made to ยง552.6(d), based upon the model bylaws contained in the appendix. The provisions undergoing amendment specify the amount of notice to be given prior to certain meetings of boards of directors and state when voting lists are to be prepared and how the meetings may be conducted. Section 552.4 concerning charter reissuance is also being revised to correct an erroneous cross-reference. Miscellaneous Parts 503, 504 and 515 are being updated to incorporate the current titles of senior OTS personnel. New addresses are being incorporated into part 505 to reflect recent office relocations. Administrative Procedure Act Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, the OTS has found good cause to dispense with both prior notice and comment on this final rule and a thirty-day delay of its effective date. OTS believes that it is contrary to public interest to delay the effective date of the rule, as it brings the OTS's regulations into conformity with the current rating system. The OTS believes that it is in the best interest of savings associations for the implementing regulations to be amended at the time the rating system is changed. The other amendments are purely technical corrections.
