Jonan Denki Co., a Tokyo-based electric appliance discount store chain, put some 12 tons of domestically grown rice on sale at its store in Nishi Eifuku and sold out all of it in three hours. The Food Agency repeatedly warned the firm to call off the rice sale, saying that doing so without a government license is a violation of the Food Control Law. A queue began forming Saturday midnight and more than 2,000 people lined up over a kilometer before the store opened at 10 A.M. While selling the rice despite the agency's warning, Toshio Miyaji, president of Jonan Denki, told customers through a loudspeaker, "we must break the bad law." The customers, mostly housewives, were attracted to the rice because it was from Akita Prefecture, northern Japan, one of the nation's leading rice producing regions, and because it was sold at a discount price of 3,000 yen per five-kilogram package. Jonan Denki limited purchases to one bag per customer. The government has imported foreign rice to make up for shortages from last year's poor rice harvest, but since February, consumers have queued up at shops selling domestically grown rice, despite higher prices. A senior Food Agency official said earlier the agency will take "proper action" if Jonan Denki failed to comply with its order not to sell the rice. But no agency officials showed up at the store Sunday to block the sales. The discount store said it procured 29 tons of rice from the village of Ogata in Akita Prefecture and plans to sell remaining rice at another store in Tokyo in the near future.
