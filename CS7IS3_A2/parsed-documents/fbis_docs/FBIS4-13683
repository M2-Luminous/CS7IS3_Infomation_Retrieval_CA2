The apparent shift in the movement's strategy was spelled out by one of Hamas's senior members, the head of its political bureau, Musa Abu-Marzuq who is based in Damascus. It was confirmed yesterday by Hamas leaders in the occupied territories. Both Jordan and the U.S. received this development warmly. This shift in the hardline Islamist group's thinking, which so far advocated a maximalist position, is an omen of goodwill not only for the Palestinian-Israeli track of negotiations but also for the wider Arab-Israeli Muslim-Western conflict. On the Palestinian-Israeli track, Hamas occupies a leading role both in the occupied territories, especially in Gaza, and among the Damascus-based Palestinian rejectionists, the so-called Alliance of Palestinian Forces that groups 10 factions. If Hamas would join the negotiations that would certainly lead to reduced tension in the occupied territories, would strengthen Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's hand both in the Palestinian camp and in his quest for an accelerated process and would expose Israeli hardliners. What matters now is how Israel and the PLO would respond to the Hamas initiative. Any deal with Hamas now, either on the Israeli or on PLO behalf, would smoothen transition towards Palestinian self-rule and put to rest fears of imminent Palestinian infighting. On the Arab front, any involvement of Hamas in the peace negotiations would lead to the mitigation of Islamists' ideologies especially in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan. The Muslim Brotherhood movements in Egypt and in Jordan can only be expected to lend support to their Palestinian brothers. Likewise, Lebanon's Shi'ites will be watching to see if their fellow Islamists in Palestine would be wrestling Palestinian right from the Israelis through negotiations. On the wider Muslim-Western front, Hamas's involvement in peace negotiations with Israel and by extension the U.S. will open a main channel of communication between Muslims and the West that can only lead to an enhanced understanding between the two. We see in the development a precious opportunity that should be seized by the Palestinians, Arabs, Israelis and Americans. In light of that we see the response by the Jordanian government and the U.S. administration as positive signs the PLO and Israel should emulate.
