On 4 July 1989, a unanimous resolution to this effect was adopted in the Bundesrat. In fulfillment of this clear parliamentary assignment, on 17 July 1989, I presented Austria's application for membership in Brussels. The actual membership negotiations with the Community, which meanwhile has developed further into the European Union [EU], started on 1 February 1993. Today, I can inform Parliament that, after marathon talks of more than three days and more than 70 hours of actual negotiations and talks, these negotiations were successfully concluded some 12 hours ago at the political level. I have been told today that Parliament will stick to its agenda, and I should present my report today, which I regard as an obligation. This is why I only made a short appearance at the news conference and retired to prepare my address to this Parliament. [applause] Ladies and Gentlemen, even though the legal experts will still have to do much work on all the details, one thing is now certain: The way for Austrian membership in the European Union has been paved. When I think back to the difficult, and even tough, negotiations, there is one fact that clearly comes back to mind, and that is the strong determination for cooperation that encouraged all the Austrians involved in this process of negotiations in one way or another. During the long marathon of talks over the past few days, and also during the preceding weeks, once again I was able to realize that, regardless of party affiliations and our individual positions, we Austrians are really able to stick together when it is necessary for our country. [applause] The positive conclusion of the negotiations was essentially facilitated by the political preparatory work, which was done particularly over the past year and a half in the capitals of the EU -- by the Federal Government, and certainly also by members of Parliament. In this connection, I would also like to mention the intensive contacts our federal president has had with the heads of state and governments, and the parliaments and media of the EU member states. I would like to seize this opportunity to express my cordial thanks to the federal president for his efforts. [applause] In addition, I would like to thank the chancellor, the vice chancellor, and all my colleagues in the government, especially those who accompanied me to Brussels, and the representatives of the provinces, of industry and labor, and public servants for the very fine cooperation over the past few weeks and months. [applause] The regular talks that have also been going on here for many years with the representatives of the opposition were, of course, also part of our foreign policy orientation, regardless of the differing views of the objectives pursued by the government and members of the opposition. I have felt very clearly we are all aware of this being a central national issue. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is probably the most important issue our country has faced since 1955. I am confident the issue of EU membership will be treated with the same attitude in this house. Following today's debate I will provide you with detailed documentation within the next few days. The results achieved in the negotiations mean Austria now has the opportunity to take part in the peace work [Friedensarbeit] of European integration. And I would like to stress, Ladies and Gentlemen, without ignoring the idealism that was there in the past as well, that this is specific peace work and not just a nice vision, as always we have had in Europe and in other parts of the world. In specific terms, the outcome means Austria now has the opportunity to be part of the community of stability and security in Europe and we have a seat and vote in the European organizations creating the future of Europe. I am all the more pleased about this because I am convinced our entry can take place in conditions that take account of the specific situation in our country. I am well aware, Ladies and Gentlemen, that in a democracy negotiations -- be they national or international -- always will involve compromises that require those responsible to set priorities and to weigh important points against each other. Regardless of the documentation mentioned earlier, I would like to make a few points: During the first few months of negotiations we made sure that Austria will remain a country where nuclear power stations can neither be built nor operated. We have made sure that Austria can keep its higher environmental standards after joining the EU. We have made sure that Austria can fully participate in the common foreign and security policy; the Austrian law on neutrality will remain valid after joining. I would like to remind you that Burgenland was declared a Target-1 area in EU regional policy, which means it will fall into the group receiving the highest subsidies. Perhaps I should point out one example in particular: Austria will be given four votes in the Council of Ministers of the EU. In comparison, Germany with its 80 million inhabitants has only 10 votes. This means we will have 40 percent of the votes of the EU member with the greatest population. We will use these votes in the interest of our country and in the interest of Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen, during the last round of negotiations we could show -- and this resulted in reports that we were being too tough -- we tried to make our positions clear. This time we were discussing mainly the issues of holiday homes, agriculture, and transalpine transit. As for holiday homes Austria can maintain the existing regulations to restrict the holiday homes market up to the year 2000, that is five years after entry. This fully meets all the provincial regulations in this respect. After the year 2000, using measures in the fields of regional planning, development, and environmental protection, we will be able to ensure that the requirements of the local population for housing at adequate prices are met first and that Austria's landscape is protected from being spoilt by uncontrolled development. These possibilities will be recognized and laid down in the final act to the membership agreement. Regarding the issue of agriculture, we joined forces to achieve solutions in favor of our farmers. On the understanding that it is of vital importance for all of us that our farmers continue to supply us with healthy food in the future, contribute to the preservation of our environment, and can participate in the cultivation of our farming sector, I think we managed to achieve a result in the negotiations that does justice to our specific interests and will secure the future of Austrian farmers. [applause] What I regard as a particular success in the talks is the result that was achieved by my colleagues in the entire area of structural promotion, ranging from compensation payments for mountain farmers to subsidies related to environmental conditions. The adaptation to the lower level of agricultural prices in the Community will be facilitated for Austrian farmers through full compensation in the form of direct payments for a period of four years. Contrary to initial demands that came from within the EU's ranks, these payments will not have to be funded exclusively by us but, to a considerable degree, will be funded from the EU budget. During this transition period, Austrian farmers will receive a total of 7 billion schillings from EU funds alone. Another 6 billion schillings in EU funds will flow to Austria as part of permanent subsidies in the area of regional and structural policy. After particularly difficult negotiations we also achieved agreement that the ecological substance of our transit agreement be preserved even after Austria's EU accession. That way, the transit regime that was concluded at the time, in particular the ecological regulations and the objective of a 60-percent reduction of pollutants, can fundamentally be maintained until the year 2004 -- for the entire federal territory. Ladies and Gentlemen, since this question is quite rightly very often brought up, I would like to make the following point: A change of the current regime as of 2001 is possible only under two conditions, namely if a new common model is developed that guarantees the same protection or if a study that is made in cooperation with the European Environmental Agency establishes that the 60-percent reduction of pollutants has already been permanently secured. My colleagues from the government who were in Brussels with me will explain any further details of the agreements that we reached. At this point I would like to emphasize that I think, all in all, we have managed to achieve a satisfying result, which we will present for a referendum with a clear conscience. I would like to tell this house and my fellow Austrian citizens that, with this negotiated result, we now have a basis that will allow us to embark on the path to the common Europe with self-assuredness. The negotiations of the past few days have proved Austria is able to present its positions in Brussels with clarity and determination. The warnings that were also voiced by some, namely that Austria's inflexible position might lead to strains in certain bilateral relations and ultimately uncouple our country from the current enlargement process, have not had an impact on our policy in the negotiations, a policy that the substance of the agreements had precedence over other deliberations. I think our efforts have been worthwhile. Austria has protected its essential interests in the integration process and, at the same time, it now has the real perspective to participate in the shaping of the future of Europe as an equal partner -- a Europe of peace, security, prosperity, increasing environmental awareness, and growing social justice. We have much reason to be happy about the invitation extended to us by our 12 new partners. Let us accept this invitation. It offers a great opportunity for our republic and for our nation. [applause]
