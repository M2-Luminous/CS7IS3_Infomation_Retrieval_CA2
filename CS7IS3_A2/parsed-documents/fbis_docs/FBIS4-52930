At present, Thailand has no law for the prevention of dirty money laundering, while such a legislation has already been enforced in many countries, including by our neighbors, such as Singapore. The money laundering prevention will enable the authorities to probe into the financial status of any suspicious persons to determine the sources of their money and related transactions. As a matter of fact, the examination of assets and liabilities of suspected individuals is nothing new to Thailand. Following the previous coup, the then ruling National Peacekeeping Council issued a special order for the examination of assets of suspicious politicians. As a result, the people were informed of politicians who received gifts of checks and individuals who gave such gifts to them. This is another type of money laundering law onced enforced in Thailand. But this peculiar measure was unacceptable in a democratic society because of its discriminatory enforcement. Looked at from another angle, the money laundering law can also affect individual rights. However, if too much emphasis is placed on personal rights, the whole society can suffer adverse consequences. It is imperative that the state place the interests of the society over that of individuals. Without this law, it is feared that Thailand can become a haven of dirty money which is normally earned from narcotics trafficking, the contraband goods trade, and other illegal activities. Financial institutions might find it hard to swallow if such a law is enforced. Their business and liquidity can be hampered should the money of their clients be ordered frozen pending official investigation. But they should consider the adverse consequences the country has to bear without this law. Switzerland was once labelled as one of the places where dirty money was deposited. The current situation and present trends in the world and society have warranted a money laundering prevention law for Thailand. Hence, the authorities will be able to examine the money of suspicious individuals. Otherwise, Thailand will become a haven of dirty money from law breakers in the country as well as from unscrupulous individuals abroad. However, if the law makers themselves also have wounds on their backs that need covering, it is very likely that such a legislation will never be promulgated.
