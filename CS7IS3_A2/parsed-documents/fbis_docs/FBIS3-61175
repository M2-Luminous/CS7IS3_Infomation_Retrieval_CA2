The volume of imports fell off by 47 percent in current prices and amounted to R19.8 billion. The positive foreign trade balance of the Commonwealth countries as a whole increased from $2.6 billion in January-October 1992 to $17.8 billion over the corresponding period of 1993. The main foreign trade partners of almost all Commonwealth countries are the European Union countries, the United States, China, and Japan, which account for 60 percent of all export-import operations. The most important commodities which form the bulk of the countries' exports (more than 80 percent of exports) remain mineral products (crude oil, products of oil refining, natural gas), machine building (electric machinery and means of transportation) and chemical industry (mineral or chemical fertilizer) products, nonprecious metals (nonferrous metals and items made of them), as well as textile and textile items (cotton fiber). Prevalent among imports are machine building products, products of plant origin, ready-to-use food products, and the chemical industry output; these commodity groups account for 70 percent of imports. As of 1 November of this year, employment services of the Commonwealth countries had 1.5 unemployed persons looking for work registered with them. The number of job vacancies reported by enterprises to the employment service amounted to 800,000. The correlation between supply and demand in the labor market in the Commonwealth countries changed in October as compared with the beginning of the year as follows (in thousands of persons): Total Number of Unemployed Of That, Those Granted Enterprises' Labor Needs the Status of Unemployed Reported to Employment Services January October January October January October Azerbaijan 35.0 43.9 6.9 18.8 10.4 11.8 Armenia 67.8 105.7 61.8 98.6 0.9 5.4 Belarus 31.4 65.8 31.4 65.8 20.6 20.0 Kazakhstan ... ... 35.6 39.1 43.4 56.5 Kyrgyzstan 6.0 8.0 1.9 3.2 4.4 4.4 Moldova 19.7 13.8 14.2 10.8 1.1 0.8 Russia 1,028.8 994.2 628.0 728.4 301.1 453.0 Tajikistan 31.0 108.4 8.6 18.0 1.0 18.9 Uzbekistan 23.9 31.3 10.8 14.1 22.0 32.2 Ukraine 143.7 128.8[.sup]1[/] 73.2 78.7[.sup]1[/] 126.6 184.4[.sup]1[/] [.sup]1[/] September On the average in the Commonwealth, 70 percent of nonworking persons had the status of unemployed; of them, in Azerbaijan 73 percent, Armenia--93 percent, Belarus--100 percent, Kyrgyzstan--40 percent, Moldova--78 percent, Russia--73 percent, Tajikistan--17 percent, and Uzbekistan--45 percent. There were 3.7 nonworking persons per job vacancy in Azerbaijan as compared with 3.4 in January; in Armenia, respectively, 19.7 and 74.6; Belarus--3.3 and 1.5; Kyrgyzstan--1.8 and 1.3; Moldova--18.3 and 18.5; Russia--2.2 and 3.4; Tajikistan--5.7 and 32.6; and Uzbekistan--1.0 and 1.1. Of persons with the status of unemployed, 57 percent received unemployment benefits. Industry As compared with the corresponding month of last year, the total volume of industrial production in the Commonwealth in October fell off by 13.9 percent in comparable prices. The average daily output in October declined as compared with October of last year by 11.8 percent; as compared with September of this year (eliminating seasonal fluctuations in production), it increased by 1 percent. Overall, over January-October the total volume of industrial production was 14.8 percent lower than that over January-October of 1992, and the average daily output--13.9 percent lower (there were fewer working days this year than last). As compared with January-October of 1991, the industrial output declined by 30 percent. Production of consumer goods in sale prices on average in the Commonwealth declined by 9 percent as compared with January-October of last year. The output of foodstuffs declined by 11 percent, alcoholic beverages--by 2 percent, and nonfood items--by 9 percent, including light industry output by 14 percent, and cultural and household goods by 6 percent. Food products account for 46 percent of the total volume of consumer goods production, nonfood items--48 percent, and alcoholic beverages--about 6 percent. Changes in the production of consumer goods over January-October 1993 as compared with the level of the corresponding period of 1992 in the Commonwealth countries are characterized by the following data (in percents): Consumer Including: Of Them Goods Foodstuffs Nonfood Light Cultural, Items Industry Personal, Goods and Household Items Azerbaijan 89 92 96 92 99 Armenia 72 53 78 78 77 Belarus 97 92 100.1 98 102 Kazakhstan 88 85 92 93 91 Kyrgyzstan 79 75 86 93 77 Moldova 86 85 99.8 100.8 99 Russia 89 89 89 79 93 Tajikistan 88 92 86 87 82 Turkmenistan 105 103 108 114 81 Uzbekistan 112 107 117 116 121 Ukraine 80 78 81 77 84 (January-September) As compared with January-October 1991, the output of consumer goods on average in the Commonwealth declined by 25 percent, including in Russia--by 26 percent; in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Moldova--by 32-35 percent; Kyrgyzstan--by 47 percent; and Armenia--by two-thirds. The output of foodstuffs has declined. Industrial production of meat in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan was lower than over January-October of 1992 by 8 percent; in Belarus and Russia--by 16 percent; and in Moldova--by 37 percent. The output of whole milk products in Russia declined by 17 percent, Kazakhstan--by 36 percent, and Kyrgyzstan--by 41 percent. The output of vegetable oil, commercial edible fish products, flour, macaroni items, and cereals has declined in most Commonwealth countries. Production of the main varieties of light industry products has declined. On average in the Commonwealth as compared with January-October of last year, the output of all varieties of fabrics fell off by 26 percent, and footwear--by 25 percent. In Russia, the output of fabrics fell off by 32 percent; the output of footwear declined in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan by 30-33 percent. The output of certain categories of complex home appliances increased somewhat in a number of states. Production of television sets, refrigerators, and freezers in Russia increased by 11 percent as compared with the level of last year's January-October. The output of washing machines in Uzbekistan and Belarus increased by 14-15 percent, and in Moldova--by 26 percent. Kazakhstan produced 17 percent more tape recorders, and Moldova--13 percent more refrigerators and freezers. At the same time, production of some categories of these items declined as compared with January-October 1992: The output of tape recorders in Russia declined by 16 percent and of radio receivers by 28 percent; in Belarus, the output of tape recorders declined by 33 percent and television sets--by 24 percent; and in Kazakhstan, that of washing machines by 24 percent. Electric power generation in January-October across the Commonwealth declined by 6 percent as compared with the corresponding period of 1992, including in Armenia--by 31 percent, in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan--by 10 percent, and in Turkmenistan--by 8 percent. Coal production over 10 months declined in Russia by 10 percent, and in Kazakhstan--by 11 percent, including that of coking coal--by 14 percent and 11 percent. Gas production in Russia was 4 percent below that of the corresponding period of last year, while this figure rose 4 percent in Uzbekistan and 18 percent in Turkmenistan. As compared with January-October of 1992, the output of oil in the Commonwealth has declined, including in Russia by 13 percent, in Kazakhstan by 10 percent, and in Turkmenistan by 14 percent. The decrease in production of oil led to reduced volumes being refined and reduced output of basic petroleum products. On the average across the Commonwealth, primary refining of oil decreased by 16 percent, the output of automotive gasoline by 15 percent, diesel fuel by 16 percent, and furnace fuel oil by 14 percent. In Belarus the output of automotive gasoline declined by 33 percent, diesel fuel by 34 percent, and furnace fuel oil by 38 percent; in Turkmenistan, these indices were 23 percent, 31 percent, and 33 percent, respectively. Production of the main categories of petroleum products in Uzbekistan increased as compared with last year's levels. The output of finished rolled ferrous metals decreased by 7 percent as compared with January-October of last year. The decline in the total volume of production in machine building has not been halted. Output of metal-cutting machine tools in Kazakhstan fell off by 25 percent, in Russia by 18 percent, and in Belarus by 14 percent; of drop forges by 19 percent, 55 percent, and 68 percent, respectively. Production output of tractors in Russia declined by 25 percent, in Uzbekistan by 36 percent, and in Kazakhstan by 59 percent. The lag in production of chemical products continues. Output of mineral fertilizer declined over 10 months in Russia by 21 percent, Belarus by 34 percent, and Kazakhstan by 68 percent. There was a 25-percent decline in production of chemical thread and fibers in Russia as compared with January-October of last year; the output of calcinated soda declined by 24 percent, and of caustic soda--by 22 percent. In Belarus the output of chemical thread and fibers declined by 22 percent, and of synthetic resins and plastics--by 23 percent. Production of construction materials has declined. For instance, the output of cement on the average across the Commonwealth--and in Russia--declined by 20 percent; in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan--by 35-39 percent; and in Tajikistan--by half. Agriculture In a number of Commonwealth countries grain crops remained unharvested on a considerable area; part of the potato and vegetable crops also perished, which may be seen from the following data for the Commonwealth on the whole (in millions of hectares): Area Sown Harvested Unharvested Area, (Planted) With (Threshed) as of thousands of 1993 Crops 1 November 1993 hectares Grain crops 93.2 89.1 3,756 (without corn) Sunflower 4.4 3.6 762 Sugar beet 2.9 2.8 156 (industrial) Potatoes 1.3 1.2 118 Vegetables 0.7 0.5 116 In Russia, more than 3 million hectares of grain crops remained unharvested (81 percent of the total unharvested grain crops area in the Commonwealth countries), as well as 621,000 hectares of sunflower (81 percent), 66,000 hectares of sugar beet (42 percent), 78,000 hectares of potatoes (66 percent), and 42,000 hectares of vegetables (36 percent). By 1 November, considerable acreage of grain crops and sunflowers remained unharvested in Kazakhstan--410,000 and 86,000 hectares, respectively; and in Ukraine--176,000 and 43,000 hectares. Overall across the Commonwealth, the total yield of grain from the threshed area (in initial book weight) amounted to 174.3 million tonnes (not counting corn), which is 12.6 million tonnes less (by 7 percent) than of the same date in 1992. The average yield of grain per hectare of threshed area amounted to 19.6 quintals as compared with 20.2 quintals in 1992. By the middle of November, 50.2 million tonnes of grain had been delivered to grain procurement facilities (99 percent of last year's level). As compared with 1992, grain procurement increased in all Commonwealth states except Kazakhstan and Armenia. In Russia, 26 million tonnes of grain had been procured (8 percent more than in 1992); in Ukraine--14 million tonnes (28 percent) more; and in Belarus--1.7 million tonnes (4 percent) more. Grain procurement in Kazakhstan amounted to 6 million tonnes (49 percent of last year's level).

By the beginning of November throughout the Commonwealth states winter crops at the farms were sown on the area of 28.3 million hectares, which is 3.9 million hectares, or 12 percent less, than as of this date in 1992. Fall plowing has been completed on the area of 60.6 million hectares, which is less than last year by 7.2 million hectares, or 11 percent. Winter crops sowing and fall plowing in the Commonwealth states as of 1 November are characterized by the following data (in thousands of hectares): Winter Crops Sown Fall Plowing Completed 1992 1993 1993 as a 1992 1993 1993 as a Percentage Percentage of 1992 of 1992 Azerbaijan 449 425 95 ... ... ...

At the same time, as compared with last year, the rate of production decline slowed down somewhat. For instance, while over January-October of 1992 production of meat had fallen off by 22 percent as compared with the analogous period of the preceding year, that of milk--by 19 percent, and that of eggs--by 16 percent, over January-October of this year as compared with 1992 these indices measured at, respectively, 15 percent, 8 percent, and 10 percent. Overall over the elapsed 10 months in the Commonwealth as a whole, agricultural enterprises produced 9.8 million tonnes of meat (in live weight), 45.9 million tonnes of milk, and 33.8 billion units of eggs. This is less than the volume produced over the analogous period of 1992: meat--by 1.8 million tonnes (by 15 percent); milk--by 4 million tonnes (by 8 percent); and eggs--by 3.9 billion units (by 10 percent). The volume of animal husbandry products output at agricultural enterprises in the Commonwealth states over January-October has changed as follows (in thousands of tonnes): Meat (in Live Milk Eggs (million Weight) units) 1992 1993 1992 1993 1992 1993 Azerbaijan 64 44 200 144 223 101 Armenia[.sup]1[/] 10 2 12 5 76 9 Belarus 974 852 3,613 3,234 1,698 1,721 Kazakhstan 837 800 2,277 2,213 1,680 1,513 (January-September) Kyrgyzstan: all 310 296 818 772 501 336 categories of farms including 107 82 321 253 270 132 agricultural enterprises Moldova 150 108 627 441 378 211 Russia 6,293 5,436 29,076 27,071 26,002 24,095 Tajikistan 40 30 170 107 218 97 Turkmenistan 63 75 182 187 146 116 Uzbekistan 202 187 807 809 815 669 Ukraine 2,811 2,100 12,688 11,400 6,163 5,100 [.sup]1[/] Without peasant (private) farms, which account for more than 90 percent of the total volume of agricultural production Overall in the Commonwealth in January-October of the current year, the state has purchased fewer products from all categories of farms than over the same period in 1992: livestock and poultry (in live weight)--by 1.8 million tonnes (by 17 percent); milk--by 3.4 million tonnes (by 8 percent); and eggs--by 1 billion units (by 3 percent).

In most Commonwealth states the cost of retail commodity turnover rose as a result of higher prices. Some consumer goods are sold by individuals outside of officially registered trade. The volume of such sales in Russia, for instance, amounted to an estimated R1.9 trillion over January-October of this year, which comprises 7.6 percent of the total trade turnover in the republic. The data on retail turnover in the Commonwealth states over January-October 1993 are shown below: Billion January-October 1993 as a Percentage of Rubles, in Current Prices January-October 1992 January-October 1991 in Comparable Prices in Current in Prices Comparable Prices Azerbaijan 159.9 531 52.2 20.7 Armenia 55.2 540 57.9 15.8 Belarus 2,015.2 1,129 94.7 75.3 Kazakhstan 1,375.0 1,012 85.1 52.1 Kyrgyzstan, 0.76 821 78.8 28.7 billion soms Moldova 308.3 805 73.8 35.6 Russia[.sup]1[/] 25,132.4 1,034 101.9 66.7 Tajikistan 107.7 810 69.4 24.5 Turkmenistan 278.1 1,394 107.3 70.7 Uzbekistan 844.4 955 120.0 83.6 Ukraine, billion 19,205.6 2,337 78 59.8 karbovantsy [.sup]1[/] Including sales at outside of officially registered trade channels In a number of territories in October there was a wave of panic buying of consumer goods; in particular, in Uzbekistan it was caused by the anticipated exchange of banknotes, and in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan--by the announced transition to a national currency. As of 1 November the value of current inventories of consumer goods in the retail trade network of the Commonwealth countries measured at about R8 trillion and could sustain trade for 44 days (based on average daily turnover in October) as compared with 42 days as of the same date last year. Inventory levels in the trade sector fluctuated between 35-38 days in Armenia, Moldova, and Ukraine, and 43-46 days in Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to 63-74 days in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, 86 days in Kyrgyzstan, and 104 days of trade in Azerbaijan. The value of realized paid services in the Commonwealth as a whole amounted to R3.8 trillion and was higher than that in January-October of last year in current prices and rates by a factor of 10, while in comparable prices and rates it declined by one-quarter.
