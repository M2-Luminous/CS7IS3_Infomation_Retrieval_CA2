The first report points to "massive" illegal building in the Arab sector in the last few months, particularly in 'Isawiyah, Ra's al-'Amud, 'Anata, the Old City, and Herod's Gate. Most of it does not consist of building infractions, rather construction of new houses. According to city officials, these activities are financed by Palestinian elements in view of reports about Israeli plans for accelerated construction in the eastern parts of the city in anticipation of the negotiations about the permanent arrangement in Jerusalem scheduled to begin in three years. According to the reports, construction is very rapid, with the foundations and the ceiling being built simultaneously so that people may move in as soon as possible. The buildings are connected to makeshift water and electricity mains, and most of the work is done on Saturdays and holidays when municipal inspectors are off. According to the municipality's report, a total of 344 building infractions (most of them new housing starts) was registered in East Jerusalem in 1993 alone: 189 in Bayt Hanina, Kafr 'Aqab, Shu'fat, and the northern part of the city; and 155 in the Old City, Jabal al-Mukabir, Sur Bahir, and Umm-Tuba. The second report, issued by the Interior Ministry's Planning and Construction Inspection Unit, notes that as of July 1993 "there has been intensive illegal construction in East Jerusalem," in the face of "massive lack of inspection" on the part of the authorities, including the municipality. A map charted in recent months (which includes only parts of East Jerusalem and green and unzoned areas) shows that 438 buildings were built without permit in the last two years. As noted, the map does not include built-up areas, where the volume of illegal construction is estimated at hundreds of units. Some 23 solid structures and 12 temporary Bedouin dwellings were built within the perimeters of the airport in 'Atarot; 29 illegal buildings were erected in a green area in Bayt Hanina; 51 in Walja; 19 in Khirbat Mazmuriyah; 41 in a green area in Abu-Tur; 23 in a green and unzoned area in al-Tur; 17 in a green and unzoned area in 'Isawiyah; 32 in an unzoned area in Hizma, on the edge of the municipal lines; and 13 in Dayr al-'Amud. The report stresses that the charting is partial and has not yet been extended to areas where there is a greater incidence of illegal construction, such as 'Arab al-Sawahirah, Kafr 'Aqab, Ra's al-'Amud, Jabal al-Mukabir, etc. The report states there are numerous reasons for the illegal construction, the main ones being: -- Lack of massive inspection in the field. -- The absence of city blueprints indicating where construction is legal. -- Population growth. -- The rise in the standard of living after 1967 which affords additional building. -- Vagueness about the boundaries of Jerusalem's jurisdiction. -- Water connections installed by the municipality, as well as water and electricity connections installed by the Arab electricity and water companies operating in Jerusalem. The Interior Ministry's report asserts that Jerusalem Municipality indirectly caused the rise in illegal construction and the establishment of new neighborhoods through the large number of legal suits it files against building infractors and its lack of power to demolish illegal buildings. "This means that an illegally-built structure stands many years as the legal proceedings continue. The suits usually end with the infractors paying fines or serving short prison terms. Another factor is the long-standing policy apparently adopted by the municipality not to use a heavy-handed approach on the issue due to internal and external pressures." The report goes on to say that the Interior Ministry's chart shows the existence of hundreds of inhabited illegal buildings in unzoned and green areas included in urban blueprints. Many such buildings have been included in city blueprints and legalized retroactively, but many others remain illegal. A study based on an air photograph carried a few years ago showed over 1,000 structures built without permits. The number of such buildings has increased considerably since then.
