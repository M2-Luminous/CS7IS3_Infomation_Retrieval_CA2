FR940902-2-00148 FR940902-2-00060 Furthermore, even though Amendment No. 1 does not specifically define ``pattern of weakness'' for purposes of Rule 509(b)(4), the Commission does not believe that this lack of specificity will create undo confusion as the application of the rule. Any specialist that is cited for substandard performance for this reason will still be entitled to a meeting with the Subcommittee to discuss the reasons for the finding and if an adverse decision is sustained after that meeting, the specialist will be entitled to appeal that determination. Additionally, a specialist can reapply and have the Enhanced Parity Split reinstated once the condition which led to the suspension is found to no longer exist. As a result, the Commission believes that the lack of specificity does not raise any significant regulatory concerns. Finally, Amendment No. 2 merely codifies that intent stated in the original proposal 21 that specialists will only become eligible for the Enhanced Parity Split described herein once they are no longer eligible to receive the enhanced parity treatment afforded to new specialists pursuant to Commentary .17 to Rule 1014. 21 See supra note 3. Based on the foregoing reasons, the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Phlx's proposal on an accelerated basis. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;12 and should be submitted by September 23, 1994. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 22 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;12) is hereby approved, as amended, on a pilot basis until August 26, 1995. 22 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988).
