Upon an inquiry, the Foreign Ministry expressed the suspicion that the ammunition in question "probably" never existed -- at least, it was "probably not" stored in the depots of the Russian Army in Germany. Also, it is considered completely "unlikely" that it was buried on the vast training area. Questions as to whether the government wants to know exactly what happened with the ammunition have been answered evasively. In the Finance Ministry, which is responsible for the property returned by the Russians, the report gave rise to fears that the new laender might refuse to assume responsibility for the property. The laender do not want the risk of taking back land contaminated by ammunition and, thus, be responsible for the disposal of toxic waste. The leadership of the Defense Ministry has issued a decree forbidding the passing on of information to the public about problems resulting from the ammunition and about violations of existing agreements that might be discovered in the future. In addition, the Bundeswehr is not allowed to approach the Western Group of Russian Armed Forces -- as in the past -- if deviations from existing agreements are noticed. This is the exclusive task of the Foreign Ministry.
