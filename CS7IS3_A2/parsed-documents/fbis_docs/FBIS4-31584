How do you see this? [Jovanovic] This is a continuation of the position in U.S. policy, which from the beginning of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been insisting on a so-called hard solution, on pressure, on blackmailing the Serbian side in the hope that this would yield maximum results. This line in the U.S. policy is not always consistent; very often it is in contradiction with the official line that has always been a lot more considerate and has taken into account the repercussions of such a position on other U.S. interests, on relations with the allies, and finally, on the U.S. strategy of using sanctions on a global scale, whenever U.S. state or national interests warrant it. Therefore, a possible surrender to this hard line could initially bring some advantages to immediate U.S. policy, but, in the long run, it would threaten many other goals, particularly the option of using sanctions as the most lethal, albeit most inhuman and most undemocratic means in the current policy of this great power. On the other hand, the Islamic lobby -- which is very powerful and which is just a herald of the monolithic political bloc of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] -- is active in all spheres, and it is particularly focused on the U.S. decisionmaking centers, knowing that if it manages to win over the United States, it will have an easier time dealing with the other political factors. In this respect, President Clinton is certainly exposed to immense pressure -- both internally and externally -- which he has so far successfully resisted. The assumption and the logical conclusion is that the President will succeed in resisting this to the end, because all the pros and cons of such an action -- the unilateral lifting of the arms embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina -- imply that the cons would prevail over the pros, and that the number one man of this great power would have to be a great gambler to opt for this voluntarily. The threat is nevertheless serious, this time it comes from the united Congress -- both wings of Congress have practically voted in favor of lifting the embargo -- and President Clinton will need a lot of skill, strength, and time to relativize this pressure and to maintain the peaceful option as the general option in his country's policy toward the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I believe that he will look for strength of argument for his position in the dynamics of the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself or about Bosnia-Herzegovina [sentence as heard]. I believe that this is the best way to match this warmongering wing, which does not only come from within -- from the U.S. Congress -- but also from an extremely militant Islamic bloc that is on the offensive and is trying to minimize the significance of the achievements -- modest as they may be -- of the peace process so far, and is trying to marginalize and diminish the process itself. [Colovic] Minister, earlier you mentioned the sanctions. It is interesting to note that this dangerous U.S. congressmen's initiative comes at a time when the first hints of a change in U.S. policy toward the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina are becoming apparent in the sense that the U.S. President has announced the possibility of relaxing the sanctions toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. How do you explain this? [Jovanovic] Well, you see, it is probable that the [word indistinct] Congress for the lifting of the embargo and the announcement of the possibility of relaxing the sanctions are part of the same policy -- the policy of a stick and a carrot. On the one hand, the possibility of lifting the embargo is intended to apply psychological and political pressure on the Serbian side in Bosnia-Herzegovina so that it becomes frightened and more yielding in the peace negotiations, while on the other hand, the announcement of the possibility of relaxing or lifting the sanctions should apply a similar pressure that would reflect on, and as such be registered by the Muslim side in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These two things are, after all, part of the same whole, although each one has its own autonomy, particularly the first one that concerns the embargo, of which I have already spoken. The important thing for us is that this positive evolution in the U.S. Administration's position toward the sanctions is, at least verbally, continuing. Moreover, for a month and a half now, we have had these new tones that imply that the policy of this country toward the sanctions is not firm, but is also a dynamic process that can be adjusted depending on the positive changes in solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is probably a reflection of the fact that the United States -- along with all of Europe, with the exception of Austria, Albania, and Turkey -- is also becoming aware of the fact that the sanctions have lost their raison d'etre, that they are beginning to inflict losses on their initiators, and that they are beginning to think about how to rid themselves of these sanctions without losing face and particularly without losing face on the ground. [sentence as heard] It is conceivable that all this is part of a whole, and it would not surprise us if the United States -- providing some undesirable turnabout does not happen in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- were to give us a new, similar, positive surprise in the coming weeks. [Colovic] A pleasant surprise in any case. Mr. Jovanovic, in recent days, the international factors have been trying to speed up and intensify the peace process, particularly after the one-month cease-fire was accepted. All this is aimed at urging the acceptance of a territorial demarcation, and finally a political solution. What developments can we expect after Geneva? Are not perhaps certain pitfalls also present in this speeding up of the process? One of the pitfalls could be that a solution might be imposed which, instead of contributing to the end of the war, could lead to its escalation? [Jovanovic] First of all, this progress, the one-month cease-fire -- which is very modest -- is nevertheless progress because it maintains the momentum of both the negotiations and the relative stabilization of the situation on the ground. However, it is so minimal that to count on it in any way would be to grossly deceive oneself. We need to urgently invest new and essential efforts in order to prevent the Muslim side -- once the month is over -- from launching military operations, or complicating both the negotiations and the situation and in this way forcing the whole world to go with their variant rather than the peace variant that is the current name of the game. Therefore, there is a realistic chance of the Muslim side setting traps, and it stems from both the Muslim side in Bosnia-Herzegovina and from its friends and supporters on the other side -- the Islamic bloc and friends in the U.S. Congress. On the other hand, hints that the new division and the new package of the peace solution could be placed on the table in the form of take-it-or-leave-it, must not be lightly dismissed because it is obvious that this type of activity at international meetings is pretty familiar, particularly to certain Western powers. The problem is that until now, this was only employed on the Serbian side in Bosnia, and on Yugoslavia in connection with the Yugoslav crisis, whereas it was never employed on the other sides. Even if this time it was employed against both, or all three sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, there would still be a realistic danger that this pressure -- in respect to the Serbs in Bosnia -- would be overdone, more pronounced than the possible pressure on the Muslims. Finally, the fact that it has been implied that the Muslims, in exchange for the lifting of the arms embargo, could be, so to speak, punished by the relaxation of the sanctions against us, is not proportional, because the lifting of the sanctions [as heard] would be an introduction to a long war, while the relaxation of the sanctions would be just a partial alleviation of Yugoslavia's position under the burden of sanctions. We must be careful and the international community must be reminded of something it kept reiterating, which is that it would respect the consensus of the warring factions and that it would not impose the political solution of either side. If it were to adhere to this, then there would be no danger of this happening. However, we must not forget that a year ago, during the time of the Vance-Owen plan, there was an attempt at imposing such a solution on one side -- the Serbian side -- in Bosnia, and that after it rejected this, the famous UN Security Council Resolution 820 was passed. Therefore, all the cards are in the game, nothing has been excluded in advance, and it is possible that the international community -- under the pressure of an ultimatum-like offer -- will aim it at only one, the Serbian side, while the other side is faced only with a cosmetic ultimatum [sentence as heard]. This unbalance, as a consequence of the double standards applied so far in solving the Yugoslav crisis, is still predominant in the policy and position of the leading Western countries.
