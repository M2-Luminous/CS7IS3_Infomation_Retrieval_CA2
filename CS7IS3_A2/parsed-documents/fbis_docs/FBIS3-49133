She added that in a speech today, Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik told ministry staff that few countries can boast of a budget surplus, and the Czech Republic is the only country undergoing transformation that has a surplus. The surplus, he said, is a sign of successful economic transformation, especially as the new tax system was instituted and enforced with no loans from the state.
