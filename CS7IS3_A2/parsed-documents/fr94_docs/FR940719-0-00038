FR940719-0-00038 FR940719-0-00013 PANAMA CANAL COMMISSION 35 CFR Parts 7, 9, 10, 60 and 135 Technical Amendments AGENCY: Panama Canal Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Panama Canal Commission is today amending its regulations in title 35, Code of Federal Regulations in order to reflect mailing address changes, both for the agency headquarters located in the Republic of Panama and the Office of the Secretary located in Washington, DC. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Barbara A. Fuller, Assistant to the Secretary for Commission Affairs, Office of the Secretary, Panama Canal Commission, International Square, 1825 I Street NW., suite 1050, Washington, DC 20006&hyph;5402, (Telephone: (202) 634&hyph;6441). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In compliance with changes in the military APO postal system, the Panama Canal Commission's correspondence address in the Republic of Panama has been modified to include: A four-digit unit number, the letters ``AA'' after the APO, and the addition of a four-digit number to the zip code. The new correspondence address is: Panama Canal Commission, Unit 2300, APO AA 34011&hyph;2300. Also, because the Office of the Secretary has relocated from 2000 L Street, NW., suite 550, Washington, DC 20036&hyph;4996 to a new address at International Square, 1825 I Street, NW., Suite 1050 Washington, DC 20006&hyph;5402, it is necessary to amend title 35, Code of Federal Regulations so that correspondence, publications and other documents will be addressed to both new mailing addresses. The Commission has been exempted from Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, the provisions of that directive do not apply to this rule. Even if the Order were applicable, this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Further, the agency has determined that implementation of the rule will have no adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, under sections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. Finally, the Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission certifies that these changes in regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12778.
