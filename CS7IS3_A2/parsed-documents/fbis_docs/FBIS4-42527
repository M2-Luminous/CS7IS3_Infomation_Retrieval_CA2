The first pair of side panels for the forward portion of the fuselage were shipped last Wednesday [4 May] from the Valmet aircraft plant in Halli, Kuorevesi, for delivery to McDonnell's assembly plant in St. Louis, Missouri. In all, 57 side panels will be manufactured for airplanes ordered by Finland, which are to be assembled in Halli, and 147 will be manufactured for the United States, according to the U.S. Navy. However, according to Pertti Jokinen, former commander of Finland's Air Force and now project director for Valmet, the number of panels that will be made depends upon how well the F-18 Hornet sells in the future. By the time production at Valmet is in full swing next year, Valmet will be the only producer of this particular part. What are side panels? They are the portion of the fuselage that occupies the place between the nose cone and the cockpit (Forward Fuselage Side Panel Assembly). Produced from a composite of coal, synthetic, and glass fibers or cables, the side panels consist of approximately 1,500 parts and require just as many hours to be assembled. The assembly work on the first pair began last year in early September. Some 32 weeks of personnel training was required to produce the first pair. In 1996, when production is in full swing, a pair of panels will not take more than 16 weeks to finish, Jokinen indicated. Other Components Side panels are not the only components that Valmet and its subsidiary, Valmet Avicomp, is manufacturing for McDonnell Douglas. The final assembly of the 57 single-seater F-18 Hornets, the assembly and installation of 57 complete undercarriages, and the final assembly of 121 Hornet motors, including inspection and testing, is not all there is to Valmet's share of the pie. Valmet is also manufacturing flaps made of composite for the fuselage's dorsal cover, 57 of which are destined for the Finnish Air Force and 158 for the U.S. Navy. In addition, there are the 200 Series flaps for the U.S. Navy, which are Northrop's part of the offset deal. Except for the Finnish airplane contract, these figures are only estimates. If more planes are ordered, Finland will make more components. Should the orders from the U.S. Navy slow down for any reason, then Valmet's deliveries would also slow down. There is also a provision in the offset sale for the delivery of 10 Redigo planes, the final four of which are to be delivered this year. According to Jokinen, these are not part of the Hornet project. "So far, 18 of the flaps have been delivered to MDA (McDonnell Douglas)," he added. "One delivery was a day late, the others were on schedule. U.S. quality standards were met 100 percent." Some 304 units for the 39 Series flaps have been delivered so far. "Here, also, quality standards were met 100 percent," he said. Reticent When asked what the value of Valmet's parts deliveries meant in real money, he was reluctant to answer. It is a business secret. But he said that the offset sale corresponded to 2,600 jobs annually extending to the year 2000. From the experience in parts manufacturing and with final assembly, Valmet will hopefully acquire the capability to handle servicing and repairs on the Hornet in the future. It has been Valmet's objective to utilize its available resources on the project, with minimal new investment. It will be necessary to build a new surface finishing plant. The rest of the final assembly will be done in the same buildings in which the 12 Dragons and 46 Hawks were formerly assembled. "Then the bubble will not be burst when the project is finished," said Jokinen. That would be a catastrophe for employment in a little place like Halli. To the contrary, the Hornet sale should ensure that employment at the aircraft plant, which has been in continuous operation since 1921, lasts a good way into the next century. And Yet, the Offset Sale... None is willing to give a precise answer as to what the final figures on the Hornet offset sale will ultimately be. In the case of the Air Force, the bets are close to 4 billion markkas. The Hornet deal is projected today at between 16 and 17 billion markkas. Back when the deal was concluded, the Finnish customers had anticipated a 100-percent offset sale. So much is still left to do. The face of Glenn Cunningham, director of the McDonnell Douglas office in Helsinki, was aglow in Halli's spring sunshine as he accepted delivery of the first pair of side panels: ``The side panels are an essential part of the airplane's fuselage, both in the number of components and the amount of work involved. Everything depends on timely delivery. If the parts deliveries are late, the assembly work in St. Louis stops. Which is not cheap! ``But the delivery is taking place on the appointed day and represents a milestone in the project. And we are pleased with the quality of the parts that Valmet has thus far delivered!''
