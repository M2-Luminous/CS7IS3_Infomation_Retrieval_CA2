The NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reported from Harare on Wednesday [23 February] that the delegation arrived in Harare quietly on Sunday aboard a Cameroon Airline aircraft for discussions with the Zimbabwean Government over the issue. Diplomatic sources in the region told NAN that the Cameroonians opted for the diplomatic move to paint Nigeria as an aggressor in the current conflict and to win sympathy among the English speaking countries in case the issue was referred to the OAU for resolution. Meanwhile, some Nigerians in Zimbabwe have called on the Federal Government to give the Cameroonians a bloody nose while others called for restraint. A Nigerian lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe, Dr. Hameed Nuru, told NAN that Nigeria should, at least for once, teach Cameroon a lesson over its continued aggressive tendencies over the years. However, another lecturer at the university, who declined to be named, told NAN that it would be counter productive for Nigeria to go to war with Cameroon over the matter as it would only worsen the economic situation in both countries.
