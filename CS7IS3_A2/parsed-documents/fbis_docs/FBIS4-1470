An officer of the Rwandan Patriotic Front reportedly said that Tanzania has closed its borders with Rwanda, an act which he said is unlawful against innocent Rwandan civilians who are being killed. The story was carried by the Uganda DAILY ROCKET on 25 April. A statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said the story on Tanzania closing its border with Rwanda is baseless because large numbers Rwandan citizens cross into Tanzania's Kagera Region almost daily. On Tanzania's move to station troops alongside its border with Rwanda, the statement said the action was taken to safeguard Tanzanian citizens and their properties along the border. It is not for any other purpose, the statement added.
