The latter stated that the Argentine president is an "opportunist" who aligned himself with the United States. Is there any possibility of their meeting in Cartagena [de Indias, Colombia]? [Robaina] The presidents must decide that, and secondly, my country wants bilateral relations with Argentina to be above any argument. [CLARIN] If Menem continues to demand what he terms "the democratization of Cuba," do you still want them to meet? [Robaina] We really want to explain to him what we understand by democratization. We agree with their request that our country institute a multi-party system, but Cuba is a besieged stronghold (by the United States) and cannot afford to lose its unity. [CLARIN] Brazilian trade unionist Lula da Silva has a good chance of winning the Brazilian presidential elections and the Grand Front may be successful at the polls in Buenos Aires City on 10 April. Are we seeing a resurgence of the left in Latin America? [Robaina] Latin American peoples have an extremely complex economic reality which has helped the resurgence of the left in some Latin American countries. This goes to prove the extent to which they continue to believe that some (neoliberal) movements, currently in office, have not yet met their needs. [CLARIN] Will your government grant refuge to [former Revolutionary People's Army leader Enrique] Gorriaran Melo, just as it granted asylum to Argentines who were persecuted by the military regime? [Robaina] Cuba has relations with several leftist parties throughout Latin America, but it would be unwarrantable for the Cuban Government to undertake acts that may damage its relations with other countries. The times of Cuban relations with a left that was experiencing persecution and savagery are behind us now. [CLARIN] With the election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general, does Cuba believe the time has come for it to return to this forum? [Robaina] That is not a matter of priority for us because we were expelled from that organization. Notwithstanding this, those already furthering that idea within the OAS should know that Cuba will not object. [CLARIN] Will you invite anti-Castroist groups residing in Miami to the meeting of Cuban exiles to be held on 22 April in your country? [Robaina] It will not be a meeting of groups. In any case, those who have not been invited are just hysterical individuals. [CLARIN] Will the agenda include proposals like the one allowing elderly Cubans living abroad to spend their last few days in Cuba? [Robaina] You are well informed (he laughs). One cannot say, however, that there is a closed agenda. [CLARIN] Will the legalized use of dollars on the island lead to the establishment of a privileged social group -- one that has foreign currency? [Robaina] No. The country is undergoing a process of economic transformation which entails the implementation of an open market policy for foreign capital, the liberalization of the job market, and the legalization of the use of a hard currency.... But this has an enormous political and social cost, which we assume because if we do not effect these changes the consequences will be even worse. [CLARIN] It has been mentioned that you, a 37-year-old minister, might be Fidel's successor. Is that true? [Robaina] Fidel himself brought up the subject in a very clear way -- he is not interest in staying in power for ever.... He is there because Cubans decided to give him that mandate.... Instead of looking for a successor, we should try to find a way, as Cubans, to collectively participate in the process.
