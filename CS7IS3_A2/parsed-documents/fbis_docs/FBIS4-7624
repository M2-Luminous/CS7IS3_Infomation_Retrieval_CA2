Noting that due to financial difficulties the United Nations will send only 3,500 fresh soldiers, Jarcevic stressed in a statement for Radio Yugoslavia that the shortage of soldiers would be made up with the authority of the United States and Russia because "they guaranteed that peace along the border between the RSK and the Republic of Croatia would not be violated." The RSK foreign minister also welcomed the fact that NATO will surveil the air space between the RSK and Croatia in order to "protect the blue helmets." Jarcevic expressed the hope that the RSK will be internationally recognized in the next six months, that Zagreb will understand that it cannot defeat Krajina militarily, and that the Croatian demand to the United Nations to force the Serbs to return to Croatia with NATO's help cannot be fulfilled. "In its actions, Croatia must take as the starting point the current state of affairs and the fact that Krajian exists," Jarcevic told Radio Yugoslavia.
