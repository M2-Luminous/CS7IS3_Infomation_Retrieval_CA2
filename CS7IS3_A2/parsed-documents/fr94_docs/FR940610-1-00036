FR940610-1-00036 FR940610-1-00007 Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 111␣/␣Friday, June 10, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service 26 CFR Parts 1, 20, and 25 [PS&hyph;26&hyph;93] RIN 1545&hyph;AR56 Actuarial Tables Exceptions AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed amendments to the income, estate, and gift tax regulations under the Internal Revenue Code relating to exceptions to the use of standard valuation tables for valuing annuities, interests for life or a term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests. These amendments are necessary in order to provide guidance consistent with court decisions that call for deviation from the use of standard valuation tables in valuing those interests. The proposed regulations would apply in valuing all interests that would, but for the exceptions, be valued under section 7520 of the Code. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing must be received by August 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R ([PS&hyph;26&hyph;93]), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. In the alternative, submissions may be hand delivered to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R ([PS&hyph;26&hyph;93]), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Blodgett, telephone (202) 622&hyph;3090 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background This document contains proposed regulations (26 CFR 1.7520&hyph;3(b), 20.7520&hyph;3(b), and 25.7520&hyph;3(b)) for the valuation of certain partial interests in property under section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), as added by section 5031 of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, when the use of standard actuarial tables would produce unreasonable results. The regulations are proposed to be effective for valuation dates occurring after the date the regulations are published as final regulations in the Federal Register . Explanation of Provisions Section 7520(a), which is effective after April 30, 1989, provides that the value of annuities, interests for life or a term of years, and remainder or reversionary interests is to be determined under tables published by the IRS based on an interest rate equal to 120 percent of the applicable Federal mid-term rate (rounded to the nearest two-tenths of one percent) in effect under section 1274(d)(1) for the month in which the valuation date falls. Section 7520(b) provides that section 7520 shall not apply for purposes of any provision specified in regulations. The Conference Report to the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1104, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 113 (1988), 1988&hyph;3 C.B. 603, explains that section 7520 does not apply to ``situations specified in Treasury regulations.'' The IRS has never attempted to include in the regulations all of the different actuarial factors that could apply to the many different kinds of vested and contingent annuity, income, and remainder interests that can arise in tax administration. The actuarial tables that have been set forth in the regulations from time to time have listed only those factors that are most frequently needed by taxpayers. Generally, these actuarial tables have included the one-life annuity, income, and remainder factors for ages 0 through 109 and the term-certain annuity, income, and remainder factors for periods of 1 through 60 years. These one-life and term-certain factors are often referred to in this notice of proposed rulemaking as ``standard actuarial factors'' or ``standard section 7520 actuarial factors.'' Other standard actuarial factors that are less frequently needed by taxpayers are included in tables that have been separately published by the IRS from time to time and that may be purchased from the Government Printing Office. The tables in these books include two-life actuarial factors, as well as many one-life factors and term-certain factors not found in the regulations tables. These publications also include a number of examples that illustrate how to compute special section 7520 actuarial factors such as the annuity, income, or remainder factor for a period limited to the lesser of a term certain or a lifetime. Special actuarial factors have for many years been referred to as such in the regulations. See, for example, §20.2055&hyph;2(f)(5). Other special section 7520 actuarial factors that may apply to more unusual situations may be computed by the taxpayer or, upon request, by the Internal Revenue Service for the taxpayer, by using actuarial methods consistent with those used to compute the standard section 7520 actuarial factors that appear in the tables in the regulations and in the Service's publications. Examples of these more unusual situations include an annuity payable for more than two lives, a right to income for a term certain or until the prior death of the first to die of two individuals, and the right to receive a remainder after a term certain if an individual survives the term.
