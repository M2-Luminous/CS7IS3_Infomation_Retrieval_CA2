A six-month schedule of the Queen's engagements was listed as well as details of the officers' addresses, telephone numbers and car registrations, according to reports in a Dublin newspaper. Police on both sides of the Irish Sea were playing down the significance of the documents last night, as some information is understood to be old. However, Special Branch officers at Scotland Yard were liaising with their Irish counterparts last night. Irish police confirmed yesterday that sensitive documents were found during a raid last week on a house used by the IRA in Dublin. A spokesman for the Garda said: "We can confirm that we found certain materials in a raid on a house on the north side of the city. Owing to security matters we can't discuss any further." Attempts to make the Queen a priority target would mark a departure in IRA policy. Any attack on the sovereign would inevitably bring a backlash in Great Britain and Ireland and a profoundly adverse reaction abroad, especially in America. However, as reported in The Times yesterday, the most recent list to cause serious concern to the police and MI5, found two weeks before the mortar attack on Heathrow, included a number of fresh targets. It appears that a a number of sites associated with the royal family may have been detailed. Hundreds of MPs, judges, senior civil servants and other Establishment figures have been put on a high level of alert. Intelligence suggests that the IRA is looking for another spectacular terrorist incident in the wake of their Easter ceasefire and their rejection of the Downing Street declaration.
