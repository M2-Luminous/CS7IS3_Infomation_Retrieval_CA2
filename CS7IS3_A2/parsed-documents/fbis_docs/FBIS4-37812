He described the new peace talks offer made by the LTTE ideologist, Anton Balasingham, to the BBC in Jaffna as an old song with a new tune. The only concession the Tigers had made was the cease-fire which is tantamount to the laying down of arms, which is one of the preconditions laid down by the government. If the LTTE was genuinely interested in settling the problem they should contact the Sri Lankan Government direct and not use intermediaries as ploys. They should inform the government of the framework of their proposals. The senior government spokesman said that the Sri Lanka Government has a precondition also stated that the LTTE leader Prabhakaran should deal direct with the government and not through his spokesman and intermediaries. In addition, the government requires that all political parties should take part in the peace talks. Once these preconditions were met, the Sri Lankan Government was willing to (?listen) to them resuming negotiations to end the crisis and terrorism. Meanwhile, a military spokesman told LANKAPUVATH that preparations were being finalized for an all out onslaught which would end LTTE terrorism and restore peace in the northeastern region.
