[Darawshah] A heated debate is taking place on the Israeli political map and among the Arab community in Israel regarding the necessary arrangements to guarantee protection for the Palestinians and prevent the settlers' aggressive acts against the sons of our Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The reality is that although the Israeli Government has facilitated the entry of a Palestinian police force and international forces consisting of Norwegian police, these arrangements do not seem to be enough, because the population of Palestinians in the occupied areas exceeds 2 million, all of whom need protection. They need protection from the armed extremist settlers, who have been equipped with arms by the Israeli Government. They receive the full support of the Israeli Government. The Palestinian people in the occupied areas also need international protection from the Israeli Army and the other security organs, particularly the musta'ribin units [Israeli agents who disguise themselves as Arabs], who fool the Palestinians. While we welcome the recent agreement, I am not confident that these arrangements will provide real protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. While there is settlement and occupation, the problem will remain. The fears of massacres similar to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and other such acts will remain. The dangers of renewed daily aggression against the Palestinian people will remain. [Al-Jundi] But how do you read Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's recent statements that he is not ready to meet the Palestinian demand to evacuate the settlers from the Palestinian city of Hebron? [Darawshah] This stance is not justified. Yitzhaq Rabin fears the Israeli right. He is afraid of the demonstrations the Israeli right might hold. The extremist and criminal settlers are at the head of the Israeli right. This is why he tries to appease them at the expense of the peace process, the Palestinian people, and the Arab nation. Proceeding from this perspective, we criticize Yitzhaq Rabin's stance and demand practical action to prove that he has honest intentions toward protecting the Palestinians and deterring the extremists, be they settlers or Israeli forces, to prevent them from taking action against the Palestinians and carrying out crimes of terrorism against them. This is why Yitzhaq Rabin has been talking a great deal about peace but he has implemented no real practical steps that deter the extremist settlers and secure protection for our defenseless Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories. [passage omitted] [Al-Jundi] How will the Israeli people view the need to implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement quickly as a means to cool down the heated struggle inside the occupied territories? [Darawshah] There are two trends on the Israeli street. The Israeli right does not want to implement this agreement and is working to destroy it. It is also trying to prevent an Israeli withdrawal from even one inch of the occupied Arab territories. The left wants the agreement to be implemented immediately to allow the PLO led by Yasir 'Arafat to enter Gaza and Jericho first, implement the agreement, and prevent things from worsening. There is interest among the forces advocating peace inside Israel in implementing this agreement. But the problem is that the Israeli Government swings between the right and the left. In particular, Yitzhaq Rabin swings back and forth, although he heads a leftist government. He has not had the courage to take practical steps to prove his credibility and readiness to implement the agreement on 13 April. This is why discussions concentrate on how to reach agreement on implementing the Oslo Agreement by 13 April. I doubt withdrawal will take place by the middle of next month. It could take much longer than that. [passage omitted]
