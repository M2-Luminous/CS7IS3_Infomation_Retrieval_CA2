A Russian Foreign Ministry source said today that the new Russian proposal was recently passed to President Geydar Aliyev of the Azerbaijan Republic, President Levon Ter-Petrosyan of the Republic of Armenia, and to Robert Kocharyan, the Nagorno- Karabakh leader, by Vladimir Kazimirov, special representative of the president of the Russian Federation. Depending on the replies received additional steps will be taken to bring about an end to the hostilities in Karabakh. A meeting of the warring parties in Moscow this week cannot be ruled out. Bloody fighting, with fluctuating success, has been taking place around Nagorno-Karabakh since the second half of December last year. Several thousand people have already died as a result. Thousands more have been wounded, mostly among the attackers. The new escalation of hostilities is all the more pointless, the Russian Foreign Ministry source notes, in that the leaders of all the warring parties acknowledge that the conflict cannot be solved by force, and are calling for a political settlement. This relapse into bloodshed, the source considers, is seriously impeding the peacemaking efforts of Russia and international organizations. Russia is striving, as an intermediary, to bring the warring parties' positions closer together, to persuade them to sign an agreement on ending the armed confrontation as soon as possible, and not to allow the destabilization of the region as a whole. In the second half of December 1993, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev held meetings in Moscow with Gasan Gasanov and Vahan Papzyan, the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia, and with Arkadiy Gukasyan, a representative of the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership.
