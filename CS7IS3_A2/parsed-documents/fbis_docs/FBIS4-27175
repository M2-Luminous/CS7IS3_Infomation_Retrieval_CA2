The report is "totally groundless," the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN newspaper said in its Tuesday evening edition that MITI will propose to the United States its removal of the tariffs, currently set in a range of 0 to 6.3 percent, sometime in June. The step is intended to boost Japanese imports of sheet glass, which accounted for only 7.7 percent of the total consumption in Japan in 1993, the daily said. "MITI has not heard anything about the reported plan," the official said. Sheet glass is expected to be included in the expanded priority trade sectors under the Japan-U.S. "framework" talks scheduled to resume Wednesday.
