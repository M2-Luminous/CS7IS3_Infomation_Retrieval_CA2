The Commission's initiative is essentially not in keeping with procedural law based on Article 225, Paragraph 2 of the European Treaty, but should be seen as a political act aimed at pressuring our country. Misusing the provisions of Articles 223, Paragraph 1B and 225, Paragraph 2 of the [Rome] Treaty whose context is economic and devoid of political significance, the Commission acted against its identity as a keeper of legality in the implementation and interpretation of Community law, and simultaneously violated the fundamental principle of Community solidarity between the European Union (EU) member states. The provisions of Article 223, Paragraph 1B, of the Treaty envision granting member states relative freedom to act unencumbered by the limitation of the competition rules of the Treaty when manufacturing or marketing war materiel, as long as this particular initiative is related to the defense of their security. However, if one member state, overstepping the boundaries of such freedom under the pretext that it needs to defend its security, acts within the EU space against the competition rules and in a way that may hurt the interests of the other member states, the Commission, or another member state, has the right to resort to the European Court of Justice against the member state overstepping such boundaries. In fact, this is a very limited form of applying the above provisions. In this specific instance, our country did not manufacture or market war materiel, neither did it hurt EU interests, since in principle it did not act within EU space and its initiative, moreover, was not economic, but eminently political. It should also be stressed that because of the minimal exchanges between the EU and Skopje, which represent only 0.50 percent of EU trade transactions on a yearly basis, the preconditions for the implementation of Articles 85, 169, and 170 of the Treaty do not exist. The embargo imposed by the Greek Government on Skopje was its ultimate means of defense in the face of the increasing arrogance of the political leadership of that country, whose Constitution includes provisions of an irredentist nature betraying expansionary aims against our northern borders. In conjunction with Skopje's falsification of our history, the theft of the Veryina symbol and the name of Greek Macedonia, this undoubtedly and obviously created a major danger to the national security and territorial integrity of our country, as well as the risk of upsetting domestic peace and public order. The Greek Government's decision was thus aimed at warding off these dangers and at safeguarding our country's historic heritage. Consequently, our country does not belong in the "box of the accused." On the contrary, it should raise its voice in protest against the unjust and abusive behavior of an EU organ. It must be understood that the functioning of EU organs to threaten smaller member states using the "two-speed" approach--meaning the privileged treatment of our northern partners at the expense of the smaller southern partners--is contrary to the EU's fundamental proclamations. Finally, the Commission's initiative is a serious blow to the principle of legality and Community solidarity. When viewed as a political act to pressure our country and favor the goals of a third country at the expense of our national security, it cannot be accepted by the European Court of Justice, because by its very nature it is condemned to rejection as inadmissible, excusatory, and altogether devoid of context and legal foundation.
