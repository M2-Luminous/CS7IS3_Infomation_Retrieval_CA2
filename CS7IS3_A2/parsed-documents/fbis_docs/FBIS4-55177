President of the SPO Executive Board Milan Komnenic told a press conference that the party leader, Vuk Draskovic, on Monday familiarized the U.N. Secretary General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and the foreign ministers of Russia, the U.S., Great Britain, France and Greece, with proposals to resolve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In his letters to these officials, Draskovic pointed out that after the conflicts have ended, heavy weaponry of all the three warring sides (Moslems, Serbs and Croats) should be placed under UNPROFOR control -- and when this is over -- complete disarmament should be carried out. The leader of the SPO party which is the backbone of the Depos coalition, the strongest opposition group in the Serbian parliament, suggested in his letters the soonest possible holding of a summit of the heads of state of Russia, the U.S., France and Great Britain, and the chair-country of the European Union, Greece, and the U.N. secretary general who would send demands to all the warring sides to submit themselves to this summit's decisions. Bosnian Serbs advocate an end be put to all the conflicts throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has not been accepted by the Bosnian Moslems who propose termination of conflicts on some of the battlefronts or a truce of up to two or three months.
