[Chuyev] Of course. We nominated 108 candidates, but the Central Electoral Commission ruled that we did not collect the 100,000 votes in our support required for registering our bloc, although we disagree with that. Yevgeniy Fedorov, our candidate from Leningrad Oblast, was elected in a one-mandate district, and another two deputies, who were elected as independents, have raised the question of joining our party. For us, the elections continue. I personally and another two representatives of the Russian Christian Democratic Party are running for the Federation Council in Chelyabinsk Oblast. In addition, we will participate in municipal elections in Moscow. We hope that two or three of our candidates will make it. [ROSSIYA] Which faction at the State Duma will express your interests? [Chuyev] Hard to say, but definitely not "Russia's Choice." In all likelihood, it will be a faction of independent deputies, because there are people there who sympathize with us. We may also form our own group there. There are deputies whose views are close to ours in the Russian Democratic Reform Movement and in Sergey Shakhray's Party for Russian Unity and Accord. [ROSSIYA] What do you think about the State Duma's future? [Chuyev] Unfortunately, it will be even less effective than the previous one. All decisions will be blocked by large factions. Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman of the Russian Federation Republican Party and member of the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" faction [ROSSIYA] From the first day, everyone has been urging constructive work at the State Duma. How real is that? [Lysenko] Given the list of demands published in SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA by opposition electoral blocs requesting that the Belovezhskaya Forest agreement be abrogated, the president's actions in September-October be deemed as criminal, the results of the vote on the Constitution be reviewed, and so forth, this is an unlikely prospect. Large blocs are politicized throughout, and they are intent on achieving their own objectives. Zhirinovskiy is dreaming about the presidency, and the communists will try to deal the final blow to Yeltsin and the current government lineup. They will try to force a vote on starting an impeachment procedure against the president, because in this case the latter will not have the right to dissolve the State Duma. Here a dramatic tug-of-war may break out. Either Yeltsin will manage to dissolve the Duma on the basis of Article 111, or it will demand impeachment. My fears may not materialize, however, because the interests of Zhirinovskiy and the communists do not fully coincide. [ROSSIYA] Does your organization have a package of legislative initiatives? [Lysenko] So far we have not been able to agree one page of our political statement. It concerns the Constitution. Some argue that it should be accepted as a political reality, while others demand that we should go to court so that it will rule its adoption as unlawful. On other matters we are unanimous. We oppose the commissions about which I spoke earlier. We believe that we should deal with the rules of procedure and with committees. [ROSSIYA] Will your faction be able to preserve itself? [Lysenko] Everything will depend on whether the faction will pay heed to the parties on whose bandwagons these deputies entered the Duma. Gleb Yakunin, cochairman of the Democratic Russia movement and member of the "Russia's Choice" faction [ROSSIYA] How do you assess the future of the State Duma? [Yakunin] I think it will be ineffective owing to substantial political differences. It will hold on for hardly a year. But at least it must resolve the fundamental question -- to demystify Zhirinovskiy's party and the man himself. To show the people that they made a mistake in electing him. To demystify his team made up of state security and Main Intelligence Administration officers and so forth. I think that Lukyanov and Kryuchkov must shed light on the subject.
