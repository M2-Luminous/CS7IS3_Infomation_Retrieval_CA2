Lesotho's prime minister, Ntsu Mokhehle, said the two sides had agreed in principle to lay down their arms, but the situation had not yet been fully resolved. Mr. Legwaila, who was in the Lesotho capital on behalf of the Organization of African Unity, returned to Gaborone early this morning, leaving behind calm but tense conditions in Maseru. Labor and church organizations have called for a national stayaway from work tomorrow to protest against the death of three civilians, blamed on the government's mishandling of the crisis.
