How much money is left in the till? [Brodet] We are not petty. When Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip there will be tens of millions of shekels in the Civil Administration coffers; all of the planned budget for May. This money will be turned over to the Palestinians and will suffice to finance the daily activities of the Palestinian authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho for two or three weeks. After that, they are in charge. [Plotzker] Will they manage? [Brodet] They have no choice and they have no money. This is a great organizational and managerial incentive. There will also be debts to pay immediately. Water, electricity. As a goodwill gesture, we are leaving them the Civil Administration's computer network and a package of diskettes with detailed budget software programs free of charge. As soon as they load the software, they will know who to pay, when, and how much. They will be able to make use of an efficient tax collection system, the same system used by the Civil Administration and its Palestinian employees. They wanted overlapping and that is what they will get. We are handing over to them an effective and well-equipped administration machine with enough gas to reach the next gas station. Money, however, is something that they will have to raise by themselves, and immediately. [Plotzker] The World Bank announced today that it would give them $1.2 billion. That sets them up pretty well, does it not? [Brodet] Far from it. The World Bank, as the representative of the countries contributing to the Palestinian entity, has solicited commitments of $1.2 billion in aid for the Palestinian self-governing authority. This sum will be spread out over three years, which means about $400 million annually. The Palestinians will get a bit more in the first year but right now there is no point in talking about billions. [Plotzker] Did you discuss this issue in your talks? Do the Palestinians realize their needs? [Brodet] Certainly. They lose sleep over this. When we started the economic negotiations in November 1993, they stated that they had no intention of collecting taxes from the Palestinian population. Yasir 'Arafat sent Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the head of the Palestinian economic delegation, his grandiose plan for a tax paradise in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. When the PLO came in there, it would make everyone happy and cancel most taxes. Everything would be dirt cheap. When we asked them how they intended to finance their budget they replied that the donor countries would pay for it. In those days, incidentally, the Palestinian delegation did not always have enough money to pay for their phone calls. [Plotzker] In the end, however, the economic agreement signed with the PLO stipulates that the taxes in the territories will be the same as those in Israel. [Brodet] There was only one problem with the wonderful plan for a tax paradise in the Gaza Strip and Jericho: its implementation. The Western countries which promised money and aid to the Palestinians took one look at the plan and categorically rejected it. The Palestinians were very clearly told that they would not get a red cent to just squander away. Before giving the Palestinians any money, the Western countries first demanded to know how much money the Palestinian authority planned to collect in taxes from its constituents, which projects it intended to spend the money on, who would oversee expenditures, and who would submit the reports. Incidentally, part of the money was given as bridging loans. [Plotzker] Did the World Bank's tough approach have any impact on the negotiations? [Brodet] It had an immediate effect. We saw the Palestinians' faces sink. At the end of February this year, after three months of negotiations, they began to thoroughly study the Israeli tax system. Several seminars were held for them, and the Palestinians admitted they would have no choice but to impose heavy taxes. The Israeli customs rate did not seem excessively high any more, perhaps even too low. A value added tax of 15 to 16 percent struck them as necessary. That is how things are when you begin to stand on your own two feet. [Plotzker] How big a budget will the Palestinian national authority have? [Brodet] In our assessment, the anticipated expenditures during the first year will reach approximately one billion shekels. [Plotzker] What does that include? [Brodet] Their budget will include one major item that the Israeli Civilian Administration did not have to take into account: the cost of establishing, equipping, and operating the Palestinian police force. This will cost at least 450 million shekels in the first year. The establishment and operation of the autonomy institutions will cost at least 100 million shekels. They will employ many new civil servants and have to pay the salaries of officials from Tunis who have become accustomed to living conditions there. They also told us that they would have to expand administrative and social welfare services for the local population. [Plotzker] Will they have a budget deficit? [Brodet] They will have a large deficit of 400 to 500 million shekels. [Plotzker] Will they print money to cover it? [Brodet] Fortunately for them, they are not permitted to print their own money. The shekel will continue to be the accepted currency in the territories. The Palestinians assume that external aid will cover the cost of financing the police and the self-governing institutions for the first six months. They believe that they will thus be able to balance the budget and continue functioning. Maybe they will be able to sell Gaza Municipality bonds. [Plotzker] Did the Palestinians raise the issue of what they call "compensation for the occupation." After all, they claim that Israel appropriated billions of dollars in taxes from the residents of the territories as well as national insurance payments from Palestinian workers in Israel. [Brodet] Now that the agreement is signed I can tell you about this. This issue was mentioned at the first dinner between Abu-al- 'Ala' and Finance Minister Avraham Shohat. We decided to study the matter thoroughly and collected all the relevant data starting from 1970, when the first group of Palestinian workers were allowed into Israel. We compared the income we received with the Military Government's and Civil Administration's expenditures on behalf of the residents. [Plotzker] What was the bottom line? [Brodet] Between 1970 and 1994, the Israeli Government collected approximately 2.5 to 3 billion shekels at today's rates from the Palestinians, including VAT and income taxes in the territories and income taxes and national insurance payments from the workers who were employed in Israel. One must remember that Israel only started collecting taxes from the residents of the territories in a serious way in the 1980's. At the same time, Israel transferred 7.5 billion shekels to finance civilian budgets in the territories and awarded Palestinian workers another 2.8 billion shekels worth of special tax credits. The bottom line is that we gave the Palestinians a net sum of about 7 billion shekels. We presented this account to the Palestinian representatives in Paris. [Plotzker] So, are they going to return the money? [Brodet] We presented the bill to underscore the fact that the past must be forgotten. There must be no more settling of accounts between Palestinians and Israelis. [Plotzker] You sat down with senior PLO officials for hundreds of hours, for whole days and nights, whereas just a short while ago we were bitter enemies. How did that fact influence the course of the talks? [Brodet] If in the beginning there was a feeling of enmity on the national level, it disappeared. We really became friends. We celebrated birthdays and laughed together. We passed each other phone calls. During Ramadan we were careful not to offend their religious sensitivities. We ate kosher food all the time. The Israeli Embassy in Paris took care of that. Most of the time, the French paid and occasionally we did. Sometimes the Palestinians invited everyone to a Lebanese restaurant. [Plotzker] When the talks began, you presented the Palestinians a conception of an almost total economic union between the Palestinian and Israeli economies. You proposed that the PLO opt for an Israeli-oriented economy as opposed to a Jordanian one. When did they become convinced that this was the right choice? [Brodet] In our assessment, they were already convinced of this upon arrival. Their delegation included excellent economists and professionals with doctorates from Western universities, people with an international background who knew very well that the Palestinian economy had no chance of growing and developing without establishing tight links with Israel. The Jordanian option, from the economic point of view, was very unattractive to the Palestinians. The problem was with the Jordanian pressure and the hesitancy of the political leadership in Tunis, which obviously did not want to burn its bridges with Jordan. [Plotzker] Would you describe the negotiations as being strewn with crises? [Brodet] No. I remember two fundamental crises, both political in nature, and many mini-crises which were resolved without leaving any traces. I am not complaining about this. The agreement we wanted to achieve was very complicated and sets many precedents. Neither party had anything to base themselves on. The PLO came to the talks out of a weaker position. It is an organization that never dealt with building an economy or planning a national economic policy. We dragged suitcases full of position papers. [Plotzker] What was the most serious crisis? [Brodet] Contrary to the media reports in Israel, the most serious crises did not pertain to the nature of relations between the Palestinian and Israeli economies but rather to the relations between the Palestinian economy, Jordan, and the Arab countries. The most difficult crisis occurred on the eve of the Hebron massacre [25 February 1994], after the PLO delegation in Amman signed a declaration of economic principles with Jordan. Abu-al- 'Ala' proposed that the Palestinians be allowed to open up the eastern border and establish a free trade zone with Jordan as well as Israel. We could not accept such a proposal because it would expose the Israeli economy to unrestricted imports from all the Arab and Islamic countries, with no reciprocity and no negotiations. Prior to all this, the Palestinians were already angry at us for signing a banking agreement with Jordan. One could sense an impending explosion in the air. A marathon discussion, lasting almost a whole day, between Abu-al-'Ala' and Shohat got the talks back on track. Shohat was at his best during the last months of the negotiations. He solved problems and radiated understanding. Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala got along well. They loved each other's jokes. [Plotzker] Was there also a last-minute crisis of the kind the PLO loves so much? [Brodet] Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' completed most of the agreement before the talks were halted in the wake of the Hebron massacre. All kinds of crises can pop up, however, even at the last minute. They told us: after we sign an agreement on open economic relations, on a bona fide economic union with Israel, we cannot seal off the Palestinian self-government to goods from the Arab world and Islamic countries. That would be simply inconceivable. We could understand the political constraints here, and agreed to prepare a detailed, precise list of goods the autonomy could import from Egypt, Jordan, and other Islamic countries with our approval. For example, we authorized the import of several thousand Jordanian-made television sets. Will that bother anyone in Israel? Of course not. Israel imports 120,000 television sets a year from all over the world. But this will enable the Palestinians to tell the Arab world that they have not sold themselves out to the Israelis. [Plotzker] The Palestinians committed themselves in writing to establish a national insurance institute, monetary authority, and national insurance company, as well as other things. We promised that when we collect custom levies and taxes for them, we will transfer the money to these new institutions. Whom will we send the money to if these institutions are not established? [Brodet] When a product destined for Gaza reaches the Ashdod port, Israeli customs inspectors will assess its value and exact a customs tariff. The money will be deposited in an account set up by the Palestinian authority. We will transfer the income tax and national insurance we collect from Palestinian workers in Israel in the same way. During the first year, we will transfer approximately 150 million to the Palestinian authority in this way. We will not stand around with a stopwatch in our hand henpecking the Palestinians to establish their own stock market and pension funds. As far as they are concerned the important thing is organizing a budget, collecting taxes (they can collect about 300 million shekels in the Gaza Strip and Jericho in the first year), and satisfy the demands of the countries donating funds within the framework of the World Bank so that they will indeed send the money. [Plotzker] Which sectors of the Israeli economy will be detrimentally affected by the agreement with the PLO? [Brodet] We attempted to calculate the effects of the agreement on each individual branch and sub-branch of the economy. Except for certain farmers who grow three kinds of vegetables, no one else will be affected at all, and with time will even begin to make a profit. [Plotzker] Will Israel's economy remain unharmed even when the Palestinian economy takes off? [Brodet] On the contrary. That is when we will really start to enjoy things. What do we export to the Gaza Strip today? Approximately $200 million worth of goods. I can see no foreign element capable of replacing Israel's economic and commercial presence there. Our produce is in very high demand in the territories. It enjoys a good reputation for quality. Our ports, in Haifa and Ashdod, will continue to serve Palestinian importers, especially in the renovation, construction, and development projects that will be implemented by the Palestinian self-government. [Plotzker] Have we guaranteed our participation in these development and renovation projects? [Brodet] The government cannot act in lieu of joint business projects. The projects will start when the mutual feelings of suspicion and fear have dissipated. We adamantly insisted on one thing: The Cairo agreements clearly prohibit any discrimination against Israeli entrepreneurs, companies, or the State of Israel in general. We will be allowed to bid for any tender. [Plotzker] How much compensation has the Treasury allocated for the expected damages to agriculture? [Brodet] The Treasury will try to be understanding toward the vegetable growers harmed by the agreement; however, we are not talking about large sums. We are not even thinking along the lines of compensation, we are thinking about growth. [Plotzker] What do you mean? [Brodet] Our model for the Palestinian economy foresees a dramatic shift toward a 20-percent real growth rate beginning in 1995. The Palestinian economy's gross national product may grow by 100 percent within three years. At the same time, we expect a six to seven percent growth rate in the Israeli economy. [Plotzker] At the same time? Will one not come at the expense of the other? [Brodet] No, both will come together. We will have complementary economies.
