Although absolute silence was kept on this subject, EVENIMENTUL ZILEI soon learned the real reason for Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's dismissal. According to information we have been able to obtain thus far, in the wake of certain operative actions carried out by the Counterintelligence Division, Maj. Gen. Diaconescu put together certain intelligence files according to which Maj. Gen. Magureanu and his first deputy, Maj. Gen. Victor Marcu, were involved in monkey business. Although he proceeded in accordance with the law and notified the Department of Military Magistracies through Maj. Gen. Mihai Ulpiu Popa-Cherecheanu, deputy prosecutor general of the General Magistracy of the Supreme Court of Justice, Maj. Gen. Diaconescu found himself nonetheless dismissed. Mihai Ulpiu Popa-Cherecheanu did nothing else but to seal the filing box with the compromising documents against Virgil Magureanu. Virgil Magureanu Launched a Diversion: "The Cristea Case" The latest data obtained by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI show that Virgil Magureanu launched an obnoxious diversion to divert attention from the "Diaconescu case" to the "Cristea case." We would like to recall that Maj. Gen. Dumitru Cristea, rector of the Higher Institute for Information Studies and deputy SRI director, was accused of immorality, that is of having a sexual affair with a former female student. The "Cristea case" was presented in detail by Virgil Magureanu to the parliamentary commission for supervising the SRI activity and was reported with suspect promptness by all newspapers, who were supplied an abundance of information on the topic. The entire fabric of the scandal involving Maj.Gen. Dumitru Cristea was construed in accordance with the classic rules of disinformation. The Sealing of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's Filing Cabinet Was Done in Secret The aim of all these efforts to divert attention from the compromising files on Maj. Gen. Magureanu was to guide the research of the journalists, of the members of the Parliament's SRI Supervisory Commission, and of the members of the parliamentary defense commissions into a totally different direction, namely the alleged sexual affair of Virgil Magureanu's deputy with a former female student. In reality, the tension within the SRI is caused by the existence of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's sealed filing cabinet, which contains some extremely compromising files that would lead to Maj. Gen Magureanu's immediate dismissal by Ion Iliescu. In this respect, the efforts made by Virgil Magureanu to divert attention elsewhere appear extremely logical. It is worth mentioning that Maj. Gen. Gheorghe Diaconescu's dismissal and the sealing of his filing cabinet were done in great secrecy, without prior notification to the SRI Supervisory Commission. One can easily assume that in the time which has elapsed since then, the documents have disappeared without a trace. Normally, the members of the SRI Supervisory Commission should have been notified in advance and its chairman, Senator Vasile Vacaru, should have been present at the sealing of the filing cabinet. Maj. Gen. Diaconescu Is Being Subjected to Great Pressure Although it is not the first time that we write about the implications of the "Diaconescu case," the former head of the Counterintelligence Division has not been yet heard; instead, he is being subjected to very strong pressure from Virgil Magureanu. Anyone who has ever read an espionage book cannot possibly understand why Maj. Gen. Diaconescu's physical and psychological protection has not yet been secured up to this date. This omission can be easily explained if one considers the hypothesis that several persons, much more important than Maj. Gen. Magureanu, are involved in this scandal. The immediate hearing of Maj. Gen. Diaconescu by all relevant bodies, including by the parliament's Defense Commissions, and the placing of the former chief of the Counterintelligence Division under effective protection are essential for the elucidation of this case.
