Joint training is also something Finland would like to discuss. Within two weeks a group of Finnish experts -- among them Commander Juha Rannikko, chief of the ASW Office on the Naval Headquarters Staff -- will go to Sweden in order to discuss with their Swedish colleagues what forms of closer cooperation could be achieved. Swedish naval sources refused comment on this matter, which can be seen as involving a sensitive area. Lieutenant Colonel Soren Trygg of the Swedish Defense Staff's Naval Command stated in response to a direct question from [Swedish news service] FLT that he "is prevented from commenting on this," and refused to give any further information on the issue. The background to this is that the Finnish and Swedish naval chiefs in discussions held in 1992 and 1993 came to agreement on studying the possibilities for developing cooperation and exchanging experiences "in analysis and operations for passive and active sonar systems." Finland would like to have access to the Swedish Navy's advanced training simulators, equipment which Finland lacks. "We will first and foremost look at the simulators that the Swedish Navy has. We are even considering acquiring similar equipment ourselves. Another alternative we discussed is whether we could be allowed to train our own operators on the Swedish equipment," said Rannikko in a telephone interview with the FLT news service. On the other hand, said Rannikko, it is not a question of any active cooperation between Sweden and Finland in hunting foreign submarines. Rannikko refused to comment on how many Finnish military personnel would be involved in such possible training in Sweden.
