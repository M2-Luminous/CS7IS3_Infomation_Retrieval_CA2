FBIS4-52596 "dreas092_m_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-092 Daily Report 10 May 1994 Thailand Reports on U.S. Drug Probe on MP Thanong Continue Reports on U.S. Drug Probe on MP Thanong Continue Paper Urges Speedy Investigation BK1205031794 Bangkok THAI RAT in Thai 10 May 94 p 3 BK1205031794 Bangkok THAI RAT Thai BFN [Editorial: "For the Thai National Assembly's Dignity"] [Text] The Chat Thai Party has done the right thing in appointing a committee to investigate the U.S. drug trafficking charge against one of its MP's, Thanon Siriprichaphong. Thanon is accused of having been involved in exporting huge quantities of marijuana into the United States. The US Information Service [USIS], the U.S. Government' mouthpiece in Thailand, has confirmed the seizure of the MP's property in the United States. Likewise, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri has also done the right thing when he assured the U.S. ambassador to Thailand that the Thai Government, dutybound to defend Thailand's integrity and interest, will fully cooperate with the United States in handling the case under the country's legal system. Earlier, several opposition leaders pointed out that the controversy is a political ploy to discredit the opposition Chat Thai Party, while many others noted that the drug charge was a personal affair with no effect on the House of Representatives or Thailand. This opinion is correct only to a certain extent. Since the accused person is a member of the honorable House of Representatives and a public figure, his action does have repercussions on the institution he belongs to and on the country as a whole. This is a criminal case brought to court by a foreign government and the accused person's property has already been confiscated. There is no way to keep the matter quiet. We have learned from the new USIS release that the U.S. Embassy notified the Thai Government about the charge on 12 January 1993. It has been more than a year now and all senior figures in the government and officials concerned earlier said that they knew nothing about the matter. The accused MP himself told mass media representatives that he had not received any formal charge from the United States. Hence, people wonder about the efficiency of Thai law enforcement. How can the agencies in charge of narcotics suppression with their close touch with the United States be unaware of the incident? We appeal to all parties concerned, be it the government, House of Representative, or Chat Thai Party, to expedite the investigation into the charge and publicize the clear facts to preserve the prestige of the Thai House of Representatives and the good reputation of the country. Do not create a negative image for the country's legal system, law enforcement, and judicial procedure in the eyes of foreigners.
