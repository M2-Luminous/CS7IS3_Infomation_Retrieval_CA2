(4) Testing date_ (i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, a loss corporation is required to determine whether an ownership change has occurred immediately after any owner shift, or issuance or transfer (including an issuance or transfer described in §1.382&hyph;4(d)(8)(i) or (ii)) of an option with respect to stock of the loss corporation that is treated as exercised under §1.382&hyph;4(d)(2). Each date on which a loss corporation is required to make a determination of whether an ownership change has occurred is referred to as a testing date. All computations of increases in percentage ownership are to be made as of the close of the testing date and any transactions described in this paragraph (a)(4) that occur on that date are treated as occurring simultaneously at the close of the testing date. See §1.382&hyph;2T(e)(1) for the definition of owner shift. The term option, as used in this paragraph (a)(4), includes interests that are treated as options under §1.382&hyph;4(d)(9). For rules regarding the determination of whether dates prior to November 5, 1992, are testing dates, see §1.382&hyph;2T(a)(2)(i). (ii) Exceptions.

(ii) Certain convertible preferred stock. Convertible stock that, when issued, would be described in section 1504(a)(4) by disregarding subparagraph (D) thereof and by ignoring the potential participation in corporate growth that the conversion feature may offer is treated as stock described in that section (and thus is not treated as stock for the purpose of determining whether an ownership change occurs, but is taken into account for the purpose of determining the value of the loss corporation immediately before an ownership change; see sections 382(e)(1) and 382(k)(6)(A)) if_ (A) The stock was issued on or after July 20, 1988, and prior to November 5, 1992; or (B) The stock was issued prior to July 20, 1988, and the loss corporation makes the election described in Notice 88&hyph;67, 1988&hyph;1 C.B. 555, (see §601.601(d)(2)(ii)( b ) of this chapter for availability of Cumulative Bulletins (C.B.)) on or before the earlier of the date prescribed in the Notice or December 7, 1992.
