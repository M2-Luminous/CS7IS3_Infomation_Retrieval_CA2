The attack is expected from the direction of Foca and (?Prata). Yesterday and overnight, the aggressor brought in 30 more armored vehicles along with well-armed and fresh troops consisting of members of the Herzegovina Corps, local chetniks, and Russian and Romanian mercenaries. Meanwhile, the Serbo-chetnik aggressor is continuing the intensive artillery and infantry attacks on the defense lines of the Gorazde defenders and civilian targets in this area. The courageous fighters of our army last night repelled a strong attack on Popovaca by drugged murderers. The attack lasted more than two hours. In this fierce fighting, the chetniks suffered major losses. One defender of Gorazde was slightly wounded. This morning, the chetniks carried out one of the fiercest artillery-infantry attacks on Lastan, the 13th attack since the beginning of the offensive on Gorazde. Even though every single inch of territory in this region is literally being turned over by the destructive power of high-caliber projectiles, the fighters of Lastan and all other defense lines are saying that the ideas of war criminal [Radovan] Karadzic will never materialize in this region and that this region will always remain free This is Enes Musovic reporting for Bosnia-Herzegovina radio and television from the the Gorazde region press center.
