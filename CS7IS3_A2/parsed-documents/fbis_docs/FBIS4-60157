Reyshahri, who was addressing a large group of hajj pilgrims, said whether the enemies like it or not, they should know that the Almighty's promise is true and Islam will eventually fill the earth. He referred to prayer as a strong weapon against the enemies and said today is a day that one should pray for deliverance from the enemy, especially for the immediate annihilation of the U.S. and its mercenaries. Reyshahri added: "To whom (other than God) should we complain that we cannot disavow polytheists and cannot chant death to the criminal U.S. which commits crimes against Islam and Muslims?" He censured those responsible for banning holding of the rally against disbelievers and said "pilgrims intended to voice their disavowal of polytheists at the ka'ba but were not allowed. "We would complain to Imam Mahdi (may God hasten his reappearance) to take our revenge." Reyshahri said the pilgrims' silence made people in even the remotest parts of the world aware of the real facts. Saudi authorities last Monday forced the Iranian pilgrims to cancel the scheduled rally despite earlier promises to allow its holding.
