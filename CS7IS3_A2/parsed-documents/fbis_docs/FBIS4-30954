As the leader of a newly established state, he does not miss the opportunity to stress his adherence to peace and security in the Balkans and Europe. He also did this during his visit to Sofia. Simultaneously, he stubbornly and selflessly defends opinions that overtly contradict the principles of goodneighborliness and affect vitally important interests of Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. For example, how is it possible to declare a willingness to develop constructive cooperation with Greece and, at the same time, to infringe upon its cultural monuments? Is it impossible to speak about a fruitful dialogue with Tirana, while the rights of the Albanian minority in Macedonia, which is about 30 percent of the country's total population, are restricted in all possible ways? What could we say about the attitude of the government in Skopje toward our country? It is well-known that it tries in all possible ways to obtain recognition of the "Macedonian nation," conceived by the Comintern, and of the "literary language" concocted by the eminent academician Blaze Koneski. Recently, President Gligorov prompted a scandal in Sofia by demanding signature of the previously prepared interstate agreements in Bulgarian and "Macedonian." Is this a real striving toward goodneighborliness and developing broad cooperation? He preferred to foil the signing of the documents in order to utilize an opportunity to insult us. Naturally, his trick failed. What remained was the bitter taste of the behavior of the former graduate of Sofia's Kliment Okhridski University, who got so carried away he forgot that he speaks and understands Bulgarian. However, an evil seldom comes alone. In his speech at the opening of the Skopje International Fair, the same Kiro Gligorov dared to infringe upon the holiest of the holy -- the cause of the holy brothers St. Cyril and St. Methodius, and their first pupil -- St. Clement. Well, we Bulgarians really are a nation, and we are used to our lands being stolen. We will also survive the attempts of some people in Skopje to usurp our historical and cultural past. The truth cannot be amended or forged. Regardless of the pathetic attempts of pseudohistorians along the Vardar River, they cannot convince anyone that King Samuil, for example, was not a Bulgarian king, because his great enemy, the emperor of Byzantium, was called Basil II -- "the Slayer of the Bulgars." The same circles, and indeed Kiro Gligorov himself, cannot convince the world that "Macedonia is the land on which the Slavonic alphabet was created by the Thessaloniki brothers," because at the time of those brothers, there were only two states in the Balkans -- Bulgaria and Byzantium. There simply was no Macedonia. Thus, if someone in Skopje is interested in goodneighborliness, then he should reassess his behavior. We can live without a few thousand Janissaries, who deny their kin and mother. However, they cannot live alone.
