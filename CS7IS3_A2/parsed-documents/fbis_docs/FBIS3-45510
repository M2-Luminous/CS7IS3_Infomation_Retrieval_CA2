To do a good job of issuing the accountancy certificates, the following instructions are given on issues related to submitting "accountancy certificate" application forms: 1. Accounting staff (and those with higher ranks) who have been assessed by their units as to their qualifications for professional accounting work or their special academic qualifications in finance and economics (vocational high schools, high school special training courses, and post-vocational high school professional certificate courses recognized by the economic and trade sectors) and found to be qualified for the basic requirements set out in Section 4 of the "Notice on the Administrative Details for Accountancy Certificates for Foreign Economic and Trade Sectors (Draft)," may fill out their own "accountancy certificate application form" (see Table 1 of the "Notice on the Administrative Details for Accountancy Certificates for Foreign Economic and Trade Sectors (Draft)" for the format), have it signed and marked by their unit, and send it no later than 15 December 1990 either to units under the ministry's direct authority, or commercial chambers, associations, academic societies, or head companies to which their unit is subordinate in the financial sector hierarchy. 2. Units under the ministry's direct authority, commercial chambers, associations, academic societies, and head companies should collect the "accountancy certificate application forms" from their subordinate units or staff of their own units and compile a "comprehensive table summing up the status of accountancy certificate applicants" (see Table 2 for format) and send it along with the accountancy certificate application forms to MOFERT no later than 20 December. MOFERT will issue the accountancy certificates after verification. 3. Units which have not assessed the qualifications of their accounting workers for professional accounting work and do not have any accounting workers who possess any post-vocational high school special academic qualifications in finance and economics should put the work of accountancy certificate application on hold. These units will be notified by the ministry of the specific date to resume such work. 4. It is imperative that units process accountancy certificate applications in time and in accordance with the requirements of this notice. Late applicants must wait one year to reapply. Units are advised to implement the notice as stated [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [Dated] 1 December 1990
