This was established in a draft law submitted by the executive branch to Congress for urgent discussion. The bill is already in the Justice Committee, whose members must meet in the next few days to decide on the proposal. According to the bill, in the case of redemption of penalty through work and education, it will be at the rate of one day of penalty for two of effective work for those found in possession of up to 200 grams of cocaine or its byproducts. For those arrested in possession of larger quantities, it will be one day of penalty for five days of education or effective work. The bill also considers the possibility that a process ends ahead of time at the initiative of the Attorney General's Office or the individual being processed. If the initiative comes from the one being processed, he will get the benefit of a one-sixth reduction of penalty. The benefit is an addition and will be added to the benefit received by confession. The bill adds a clause to the Civil Code establishing that a "small quantity of drug" will be considered up to 200 grams of cocaine and its byproducts, 100 grams of cocaine hydrochloride, 500 grams of marijuana, and 50 grams of its byproducts. The bill also changes Article 299 of the Penal Code, allowing that drug addicts not be considered traffickers after a legal medical checkup and if they were arrested with less than five grams of cocaine. Another draft law that also was submitted by the executive branch to Congress includes the cultivation of poppy as a crime of illegal drug trafficking, establishing severe punishment for those who grow it. In the reasons for this bill the executive branch warns that the introduction of poppy in Peru is a serious threat not only to our institutional stability but also to the community due to the harm caused by the psychoactive substances derived from it. Taking into account the problem's seriousness, the bill excludes those processed or sentenced for cultivating poppy from the penitentiary benefits, either early release or executive branch pardon. The proposal only has four articles, establishing that "the one who cultivates poppy, and promotes, facilitates, or finances the cultivation of poppy will be punished with imprisonment of not less than 12 years and not more than 20 years." If the quantity of poppy plants does not exceed 100, the violator will be punished with not less than eight years and not more than 15 years. The bill also establishes that all poppy cultivations will be destroyed by any means in the presence of a provincial prosecutor, the land will be transferred to the state, and the equipment and other supplies used in the cultivation will be confiscated.
