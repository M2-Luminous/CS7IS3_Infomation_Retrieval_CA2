A delegation invited to Moscow will argue before the Duma that the Serb Civic Council, which supports Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, has as much right to represent Bosnia's Serb community as the self-proclaimed Serb republic based in Pale, the council's leader, Mirko Pejanovic, told AFP. Delegates will visit Paris later in the month and have also been invited to Washington and the European Community in Brussels, he said. The reluctance so far of foreign governments to recognise the representativeness of the loyalist Serb leadership is a serious mistake, Pejanovic believed, pointing out that the number of Serbs in the territory controlled by Pale is under half the total of 1.3 million who lived in the pre-war republic. Of the 400,000 Bosnian Serbs who fled the fighting that broke out two years ago to Serbia and Montenegro and the 100,000 in Europe, the great majority support the loyalist position, he said. Pejanovic, a member of Bosnia's collective presidency, claimed the moral high ground with the argument that since loyalist Serbs shared the suffering of the Moslems and Croats during the bombardment of Sarajevo by the Pale forces, they represent a unique force for reconciliation. "We are a moral and peace factor because we are for a multicultural society with equal rights for all groups and seek a negotiated and political solution. Karadzic has ruled out a multicultural society, and offers only more war," he said. The Civic Council was elected by a consultative assembly in late March to represent the 200,000 loyalist Serbs in Bosnia, of whom around 60,000 live in Sarajevo. "We believe that in order to act (in the Bosnian conflict), the international community must include the loyal Serbs," Pejanovic said. "We don't want to represent the Karadzic Serbs, we don't want to represent criminals. But we cannot accept that he with his lies represents us." While Pejanovic and other Civil Council leaders dispute the legitimacy they believe foreign governments are abusively attributing to the Serbs in Pale, the loyalties of the Serbs in both camps are hard to assess. Those who remained in government-controlled territory did so for a variety of reasons, in which regard for legality and the democratic process may have been stronger than any firm commitment to the govermnment that emerged from parliamentary elections in 1991. "Loyalist Serbs need not be regarded as pro-government," presidential advisor Kemal Muftic said. "They are pro-Bosnian and patriotic. Governments come and go." The loyalties of individual Serbs have been tested as the conflict has developed. They have been regarded by some as a potential fifth column -- there were attacks on Serbs during the early stages of the war -- and have themselves looked with growing unease on signs of increasing Islamic sensibility in some government ministries. A number of Serbs, difficult to quantify, are tempted to leave if only because of the immense physical devastation inflicted on this city and the general hardship. The same could be said of many Moslems and Croats. The morale of Serbs in Pale-controlled territory is said by reporters who have visited the provinces to be flagging, and Civic Council secretary Gavrlo Grahovac said he had received secret messages of support from such separatist strongholds as Banja Luka and Trebinje. "Karadzic's power is not greater than ours," he said. "It's just that he has more weapons." Grahovac, a publisher, said he and his wife had been wary during the early stages of the conflict. "Some people were killed on the street just because they were Serbs." But the antipathy of non-Serbs had been "very little, compared with what the Karadzic Serbs did." He spoke of the "shame of many" in the Serb community at the actions of the separatists, and looked back with fondness at the days when "there were no Serbs, or Moslems, or Croats, only Yugoslavs."
