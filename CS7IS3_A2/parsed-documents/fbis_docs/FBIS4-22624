In our Homeland the situation is much better--at least the population and its growth rates give us hope: The fate of the Japanese does not threaten us. The president's edict of 5 April "On the Creation of the Republic Corporation 'Television and Radio of Kazakhstan' [RKTRK]" was a surprise to those in the know. The fact is that the former State Television and Radio Company Kazakhstan, in the hands of its chairman Sherkhan Murtaza, has long held its rightful place in the country's information space, properly performing its role as a mouthpiece for state policy. And the proposed rules of the game were unquestioningly accepted on the other side of the screen: The majority of Kazakhstan television viewers took advantage of the services of commercial television channels, tuning in to State TV only in extraordinary situations (the introduction of the national currency, price increases, earthquakes, etc.). Recently a certain amount of excitement among the viewers was caused by the election of Mr. Murtaza to the professional parliament, in connection with which the candidacy of his successor was actively discussed. But in fact everything turned out not to be so simple. Even from the first point of the president's edict it follows that the upstart "telemonster" will dominate the republic air waves, since it is being created "as a part of the State Television and Radio Company Kazakhstan, and also other enterprises and organizations included in it on a voluntary basis." According to certain preliminary information, TAN and KTK [expansions not indicated] intend to merge with RKTRK (nothing is known so far about the other commercial channels). Be that as it may, it is TAN and KTK that are the most popular among television viewers of the capital today. And if the "statization" of the former is not especially surprising, taking into account the appointment to Murtaza's position of the former TAN chief, Leyla Beketova-Khrapunova, the mooring at that same dock of the ship of Mr. Fidel looks somewhat strange. In a word, in a country where the three branches of power do not always manage to separate themselves from one another, this kind of symbiosis within the fourth should come as no surprise. And, judging from certain nuances, they did not come up with this alliance just yesterday. According to unverified information from sources close to the leadership of the former Gosteleradio, the draft of the aforementioned edict was prepared at the end of last year. And after the official electronic press, precisely in keeping with the scenario, won the role allotted to it in the election campaign, the document was blessed with the president's signature. Observers regard this innovation as another step to the achievement of the cherished dream of domestic authorities: agreement of opinion that is "democratic" in form and authoritarian (at best) in content. If in addition to all this they manage to realize the age-old plan of the "higher-ups," to organize Russian-language broadcasting on the Russian channel, the television viewers will very soon be able to see the irony of the well-known commercial: With all the wealth of choice there is no alternative...
