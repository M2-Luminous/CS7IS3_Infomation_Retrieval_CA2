He is believed to have made the remark to shake up the Japanese Government, which continues to take a hard-line attitude toward the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. It is highly possible that the United States will restore the Super 301 provision through presidential decree if the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks end in failure, but the United States is not necessarily confident it will have the desired effect. A bill on restoration of the Super 301 provision is expected to be introduced to Congress in late January, when its recess ends, and it is widely believed the bill will be supported by Congress. The U.S. Government has explored ways to restore the provision through presidential decree since last year, before Congress moved to enact the bill. It began to look at how to restore the provision in December when Japan and the United States were locked in confrontation over the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and the multilateral trade negotiations [the Uruguay Round of GATT] reached their conclusion without some U.S. complaints having been addressed. But the Japanese do not expect restoration of the provision to have the desired effect. A source traveling with the Japanese delegation said, "there is no need for Japan to be furious at all." If the United States restores this one-sided sanction so soon after conclusion of the Uruguay Round, it would lead European and Asian nations to criticize the United States. The U.S. Government must, therefore, be cautious about invoking the provision. It could create a situation in which Japan and the United States come to a showdown on the eve of the scheduled Japan-U.S. summit talks in February. How will Prime Minister Hosokawa and ministers of the coalition government respond to the issue? If government leaders rush to instruct Japanese negotiators to make absurd concessions at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United States will get what it wants. It goes without saying that whatever the U.S. attitude, the Japanese Government needs to decide on concrete measures on its own to fulfill the prime minister's public pledge to expand Japanese domestic demand and cut its current account surplus by opening the Japanese market.
