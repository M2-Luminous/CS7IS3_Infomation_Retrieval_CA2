It can create the conditions for establishing a safe zone in Europe, Defense Minister Baudys said. "A number of critics say that the process is very slow. However, we have been unable to find anything better so far, something that would be accepted by all NATO members," Baudys said and continued: "I see the fact that all parties were able to reach a complete agreement as a significant success of Clinton's administration, and also his own personal success." According to Baudys, it is also theoretically possible to look at the matter like thus: If NATO decided to admit several new members now, then all the Partnership For Peace processes would have to be started anyway. The only difference would be: We would have security guarantees from the very beginning. Baudys also believes that guarantees are not an issue at this time. "We can see no actual danger in Europe, for the time being." Baudys explained what the Partnership For Peace program demands of the army. He said that we would have to find a certain number of very capable young officers to undergo foreign language training. "We would give them a six-month course of intensive language training, international law, and NATO organization. They should acquire the necessary knowledge of coordinating, planning, and organizing activities, so they can represent us in NATO institutions." The preparation of joint exercises and actions is the second step. Baudys said that several military exercises were agreed with France outside the Partnership For Peace program. Joint exercises with smaller units from Holland have also been planned. Baudys said that in consultations with NATO countries, we were informed beforehand and had time to prepare ourselves. Baudys described as the most important prerequisite for our joining NATO equipping our army with NATO-compatible communication and telecommunication systems. Replacement of the arsenal will continue in the years to come, but this is not the most important factor. It is expected, according to the Partnership For Peace program, that individual countries will be able to provide some of their forces in case of need. According to Baudys, apart from other units, the fully professional Rapid Deployment Brigade could be used for this purpose. This brigade is in the process of being established and will be given priority when providing new equipment to army units. The brigade should have some 3,500 people. Baudys sees a problem in the selection of proper people for the brigade. This is why the Defense Ministry is preparing a publicity action to help acquire proper people. The ministry is examining all the possibilities of financing the brigade in such a way as to make service in they brigade attractive.
