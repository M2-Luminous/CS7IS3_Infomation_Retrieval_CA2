FR940804-0-00090 FR940804-0-00023 Paragraph (d) requires the agency that will process a dual-filed complaint or charge to notify all concerned parties that the other agencies will be deferring their processing, and of the possibility of further action by such agencies pursuant to §§ XX .10 or XX .11. Paragraph (e) establishes that, under certain special circumstances where deferral may be inappropriate, the agencies involved may jointly agree to reallocate investigatory responsibilities. For example, if the section 504 agency would normally process the complaint, but the agency does not receive information that another charge has been filed with the EEOC until after an investigation has been started by the EEOC, this exception permits the agencies jointly to decide that the EEOC should continue processing the charge and that the section 504 agency should defer further action. This exception could also be used in connection with subsequent complaints or charges, such as allegations of retaliation, related to the original complaint or charge. The special circumstances listed in paragraph (e) are illustrative and agencies may agree to reallocate investigatory responsibilities under other appropriate circumstances. In such circumstances a complaint or charge will be treated as a deferred complaint or charge with respect to any right to review under §§ XX .10 and XX .11. It is not anticipated that most aggrieved individuals will separately file with both a section 504 agency and the EEOC. Since the substantive protections provided by title I and section 504 are now identical, an individual's rights against discrimination on the basis of disability can be vindicated under either statute. However, an individual who files a complaint with a section 504 agency alleging discrimination both in employment and services, a pattern or practice of discrimination, or who requests section 504 processing, will not preserve a private right of action under title I of the ADA, unless the individual also files a charge with the EEOC under title I of the ADA. Section XX .9␣Processing of Complaints or Charges of Employment Discrimination Filed With a Designated Agency and Either a Section 504 Agency, the EEOC, or Both Section XX .9 adds new procedures to the final rule to address the processing of complaints filed with a designated agency and with either a section 504 agency, the EEOC, or both. Generally, the EEOC and the section 504 agencies have primary responsibility for processing complaints of employment discrimination. Therefore, § XX .9 provides that a designated agency shall investigate and process a complaint only when: (i) it is either the only agency with jurisdiction to process the complaint; or (ii) it also has jurisdiction to process the complaint under section 504. If another agency has sole jurisdiction over the complaint under either section 504 or title I (and the complaint was actually filed with that agency under section 504 or title I), § XX .9 requires the designated agency to forward the complaint to that agency. If a section 504 agency and the EEOC both have jurisdiction over a complaint or charge of employment discrimination, the rule allocates complaint-processing responsibility according to the established pattern of the title VI/title VII rule, that is, individual complaints are forwarded to the EEOC and complaints alleging discrimination in both employment and in other practices or services of the respondent or a pattern or practice of employment discrimination are forwarded to the section 504 agency with jurisdiction. Section XX .10 Section 504 Agency Review of Deferred Complaints Section XX .10 describes the steps that shall be taken when the EEOC processes a dual-filed complaint or charge (either an individual complaint that is referred to the EEOC or a dual-filed complaint or charge that the EEOC processes) and a section 504 agency defers its investigation. Because the rule requires the section 504 agency to defer action until the EEOC resolves the complaint, paragraph (a) outlines the different ways in which any title I charge may be resolved, including litigation by the EEOC. Although the EEOC is the agency primarily responsible for the enforcement of title I, resolution by the Civil Rights Division is also included under paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) because, under title I of the ADA, when there is a cause finding pursuant to 29 CFR 1601.21, the Civil Rights Division has litigation authority for charges against State and local governments, government agencies, and political subdivisions. See 29 CFR 1601.29. The Civil Rights Division is also responsible for issuing right-to-sue letters in such cases. See 29 CFR 1601.28(d). Paragraph (b) of § XX .10 provides that, upon resolution of the dual-filed complaint or charge, the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division shall inform the section 504 agency of the resolution. Paragraph (d) provides that, upon written request by the section 504 agency, the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division shall provide the section 504 agency with the materials necessary to evaluate its resolution of the case, such as investigative reports. Paragraph (c) of § XX .10 provides that, upon receipt of notification from the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division, as appropriate, the section 504 agency shall determine what further action is warranted. Because, pursuant to the 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, the substantive standards to be applied to complaints of employment discrimination are now identical, it is anticipated that, except in rare circumstances, the section 504 agency's findings and conclusions as to whether a violation has occurred will be consistent with those of the EEOC and those of the Civil Rights Division, as applicable. In order to further promote consistency and avoid duplication of effort, the rule requires that the section 504 agency accord due weight to the findings and conclusions of the EEOC and the Civil Rights Division, as applicable. The term ``due weight'' is adopted from the title VI/title VII regulation, which is referenced in section 107(b) of the ADA. 28 CFR part 42, subpart H; 29 CFR part 1691. In giving due weight to the findings and conclusions of the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division, a section 504 agency shall give such full and careful consideration to the findings and conclusions as is appropriate, taking into account such factors as: (i) the extent to which the underlying investigation is complete and the evidence supports the findings and conclusions; (ii) the nature and results of any subsequent proceedings; (iii) the extent to which the findings, conclusions and any actions taken under title I are consistent with the effective enforcement of section 504; and (iv) the agency's responsibilities under section 504. Moreover, if the agency proposes to take an action that is inconsistent with such findings and conclusions, the section 504 agency is required to provide written notification of the action that it proposes to take and the basis for that action to the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, the Chairman of the EEOC, and the head of the EEOC office that processed the complaint or charge. This is intended to enable the agencies to identify and resolve any potentially conflicting or inconsistent standards before they are imposed and to prevent duplication of effort.
