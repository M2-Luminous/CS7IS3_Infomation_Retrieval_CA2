Our Army is always a place for the gathering of many young people. Being young soldiers determined to dedicate ourselves to national defense in modern times, whom should we worship? Historical experience and current needs in reality all tell us: We should take the heroic figures who dedicated their whole lives to national independence, people's liberation, and social progress as our examples, and should let these heroic figures firmly occupy the "star position" in our minds. The heroic figures of our party and our Army are outstanding representatives of the masses in their hundreds of millions emerging in the prolonged practice of revolution and construction. Some of them are national heroes who have made immortal contributions to national liberation and independence, and they include such proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping; some of them are revolutionary martyrs with iron will power, such as Yang Jingyu, Fang Zhimin, Ye Ting, and Jiang Zhujun, who were determined to shed their blood for the cause of the party and sacrifice their lives to show their loyalty to the party; some of them are combat heroes such as Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Yang Zirong, and Yang Yucai, who fought bravely and defeated the enemies with a fearless spirit; some of them are communist fighters such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, and Su Ning, who served the people wholeheartedly in the peaceful environment and dedicated themselves to the service of their country through diligent work; some of them are pioneers on the front of scientific research such as Qian Xuesen, Deng Jiaxian, and Qian Shaojun, who created miracles again and again in scaling the heights of modern national defense science and technology in their hard work over the past decades; some of them are physically disabled people who have healthy minds and make great contributions to the party's cause, such as Wu Yunduo, Shi Guangzhu, and Li Zhijun; and others are innumerous unknown heroes who never claim credit for their meritorious services, such as "living martyrs" Li Yuan, Jiang Yuduo, and Cao Faqing. The mentality, character, and will of these heroic figures give expression to the supreme realm of thought that communists should attain, and also represent the lofty virtues of the revolutionary soldiers. We can say that every hero is a banner. To study, live, work, and fight as the heroes did, we shall be able to establish the proletarian world outlook as soon as possible, realize the value of revolutionary life to the maximum, stand all tests in the course of reform, opening, and developing the socialist market economy, and always preserve our revolutionary youth. Emulating the heroes, creating heroic deeds, and taking the path of a hero is always the glorious tradition of this Army. In both wartime and peacetime, as soon as millions of young people join this Army, they begin to really worship and emulate the heroic figures, although some of them have just begun to understand the theory of revolution; their mentality also begins to rise to a lofty realm, and their behavior also becomes great. The course of many heroes' growth in this Army shows that they first worship heroes, then emulate heroes and also strive to become heroes themselves. Young people are undergoing the process of forming their world outlook, and their minds are rather malleable. In light of this characteristic of young people, we should guide young soldiers to admire heroic figures, continuously adjust their life orientation, and take the initiative in emulating the examples. This is a necessary condition and the most effective way to cultivate more heroes. For various reasons, the values cherished by young people are now becoming more diverse. In such circumstances, we should draw the attention of young officers and servicemen to worshiping and emulating heroes, and should encourage them to become heroes themselves. This will certainly play a significant role in prompting them to become soldiers with a lofty ideal of revolution, with lofty morals, good education, and a strong sense of discipline as soon as possible. Serving the people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this Army. Our soldiers are required to be ready to shed their blood and sacrifice their lives to fulfill their sacred mission, and this characteristic of the armed forces also requires us to worship heroes. In the years of war, no matter how busy the troops were in combat, production, and mass work, they continued to carry out the activity of emulating heroes and striving to become heroes. This is always an important part of this Army's political work. Under the new historical conditions, this Army is striving to realize the general goal of revolutionalization, modernization, and regularization, and to fulfill the sacred mission of providing security guarantees for reform, opening, and socialist modernization. We should still vigorously carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, continue to carry forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit advocated by Chairman Jiang. This should become a strong mental pillar for promoting this Army's comprehensive development. Therefore, admiring and emulating heroic figures and creating heroic deeds should become common conduct of contemporary revolutionary soldiers. This Army is the candle of innumerous heroes. In order to bring about more heroic figures under the new situation, leaders and political organs at all levels should fully use various effective educational forms, such as reading books, giving lectures, holding singing parties, arranging glory rooms, seeing good films, and listening to old comrades's talk about the tradition, to give wide publicity to the heroic figures in various periods and on various fronts so that our cadres and soldiers will always live in the atmosphere of revolutionary heroism, and more brilliant stars will rise to make the life in the barracks more vigorous.
