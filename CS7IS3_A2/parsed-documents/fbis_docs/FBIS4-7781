According to UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] spokesman Kris Janowski, 52 people have died and 249 had been wounded in the week-old offensive. Radio Sarajevo put the toll even higher: at least 73 dead and over 300 injured. Witnesses reported eight villages destroyed by Serb artillery in the southern part of the enclave, leaving some 1,500 people wandering around looking for shelter, the UN refugee agency said. Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in Sarajevo, said Serb forces had penetrated eight to 10 kilometers (five to six miles) into the southern part of the enclave and were continuing their attacks on the northeast and southeast sectors. There were conflicting reports on how far the Serbs were from Gorazde itself. Annink said they were 10 kilometers (six miles) away, but one military source speaking on condition of anonymity put them at just over three kilometers (two miles) from the southern suburbs of the town. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic spoke by telephone with the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Cristopher about the situation in Gorazde as well as with President Clinton's special envoy Charles Redman and UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi. At the end of a special meeting, the Bosnian Presidency issued a statement informing the Bosnian Army and population that "they have to be ready for all contingencies." "The situation in Gorazde and Bihac (another besieged Moslem enclave, in northwestern Bosnia) as well as the ethnic cleansing are proof that, unfortunately, the war is not over," the statement said. The fighting in Gorazde and Bihac comes as ceasefires are generally holding in Sarajevo and central Bosnia. Around 300 people marched in Sarajevo Tuesday to protest what they called the international community's indifference to Serb aggression.
