ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is issuing a final standard specifying safety requirements covering all logging operations, regardless of the end use of the forest products (saw logs, veneer bolts, pulpwood, chips, etc.). This standard replaces the existing standard at 29 CFR 1910.266, that had applied only to pulpwood logging, and thereby expands coverage to provide protection for all employees engaged in logging operations. The final standard addresses the unique hazards found in logging operations, and supplements other general industry standards in 29 CFR part 1910. The final standard strengthens and further clarifies some provisions of the existing standard, and eliminates unnecessary provisions. The revised standard also requires training for all employees in this high risk industry. OSHA believes this standard will significantly decrease the number of employees killed or injured in this industry. DATES: This final standard is effective on February 9, 1995. Employers must be in compliance with all requirements of the final standard by the effective date. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the standard is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of February 9, 1995. ADDRESSES: Send petitions for review of the standard to the Associate Solicitor for Occupational Safety and Health, Office of the Solicitor, Room S&hyph;4004, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210.
