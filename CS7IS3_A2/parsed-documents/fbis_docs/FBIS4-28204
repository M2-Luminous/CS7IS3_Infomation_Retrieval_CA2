Should we let them bite us, or should we protect ourselves with mosquito nets or with chemical sprays potent enough to kill them? This remark was made by Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister of the Royal Government, when he returned home from the roundtable. It is true that there are not many mosquitoes born out of the foamy mud or filthy water. To eliminate the mosquitoes from our houses, one of the most effective means is first for us to gradually fill up and do away with all the potholes and pits. If the mosquitoes that bite us are few in number, we just have to use our hands to slap them, and few of them will survive such a simple treatment. However, if they are too many and they keep harassing us, we will have to use not only nets but also chemical sprays to protect ourselves. The mere use of smoke coils or sticks will not be effective enough against them. The Royal Government has made all kinds of sacrifices to bring peace for the people. However, the Khmer Rouge have refused to accept peace through cease-fire. They have resorted to tricks just to rekindle the dying international interest in their existence. Right in the heart of the country, the Khmer Rouge have set up a newspaper [reference to PRUM BAYON NEWS, a twice weekly publication in Cambodian first appearing on the newstand in April 1994] to cause confusion in the people's mind as it has been working to prod its readers against the Royal Government. This newspaper has vociferously charged that the Royal Government is a warmonger. It is a kind of a stillborn journal... This newspaper is trying to undermine peace in society and to sabotage the trust between the people and the Royal Government. It loftily extolls the genocidal Khmer Rouge, making them appear already like an overlord in Cambodia. Many local situation analysts have stressed that the Royal Government's controlling apparatus is too lenient. We have tumbled to such a low state, and still we have allowed such a subversive Khmer Rouge newspaper to remain active! Shutting down the Khmer Rouge newspaper and driving the Khmer Rouge office out of Phnom Penh -- something we must do most urgently -- is already tantamount to eliminating most of the "breeding grounds" of these mosquitoes. Before anything else, the Royal Government should take this measure for the sake of peace in society. If it hesitates to conduct such a "surgical" action, the impact of the bad propaganda will surely cause rapid erosion in communal peace and will certainly bear very serious consequences.
