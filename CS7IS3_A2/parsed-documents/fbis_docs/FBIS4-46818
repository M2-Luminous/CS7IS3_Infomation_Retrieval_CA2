On the Polish side, it was signed by the chairman of the board of Poland's joint-stock TV company, W. Walendziak, and for Lithuania -- by the general director of radio and television, L. Tapinas. The treaty was signed for three years. It provides for a broad cooperation between the televisions of the two countries, including an exchange of programs and technical equipment. The earlier treaty had expired in October of last year, but, as the director of the Lithuanian television, S. Sondeckis, told LIETUVOS RYTAS, the televisions of both countries continued their cooperation even in the absence of a treaty and the Polish TV provided Lithuanian TV with invaluable informational assistance. Upon the signing of the treaty, the general director of Lithuanian radio and television, L. Tapinas, reminded that the Lithuanian RTV has signed cooperation treaties with the televisions of many European countries: "The treaty includes an item providing for a preparation of a special program in the Polish language by the Lithuanian television, and a similar program for Lithuanians in Poland by the Polish television. W. Walendziak emphasized that this paragraph on the programs for the Polish and Lithuanian inhabitants was very important. The programs for Lithuanians in Poland are to be broadcast from a regional station in Warsaw; there are also plans to establish a regional station in Bialystok.
