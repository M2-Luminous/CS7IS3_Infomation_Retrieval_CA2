A major task of the parliament upper chamber is the provision of efficient interaction between the State Duma, presidential structures, the government and regions. The chamber should "connect Russian federal power bodies with the authorities of territories, regions and republics," he said. In his turn, Eduard Rossel, staunch advocate of the idea of the Urals republic and president of the association of economic interaction of Urals regions and republics, voiced the expediency of territorial associations in the Federation Council. In his opinion, they should set up "regional parliament centers to unite local representatives of the State Duma and the Federation Council". He said the Urals association has been set up to include two republics and six regions. Rossel noted they have not held consultations with other regions on the creation of similar "parliament centers", but it is planned to hold a conference of representatives of all Russian economic associations in February to continue the creation of similar associations on their basis. Yuriy Boldyrev, a leader of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc, noted territorial factions will inevitably appear in the Federation Council due to different interests of republics, territories and autonomous formations and different political outlook. Some deputies sharply criticize the idea of territorial associations. Nizhniy Novgorod regional governor Boris Nemtsov said they "pose greater threat than political factions in the Federation Council". In his opinion, territorial associations will deteriorate differences between various Russian regions. Vladimir Shumeyko is negative about the associations. According to the constitution, the Federation Council shall be formed with representatives of executive and representative authorities of federation subjects and "it can include no factions or associations", he said. According to Shumeyko, the upper chamber should think of the way legislation is applied throughout the Russian Federation and the influence of laws on the fate of regions. Members of the Federation Council should be responsible people, almost "senators," stressed Shumeyko. Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Nikolay Ryabov stressed the danger of territorial associations. In his opinion, federation subjects can settle their differences through compromises and cited as an example the proposal of Viktor Stepanov to nominate deputies from republics, regions and autonomous districts deputies of the Federation Council chairman.
