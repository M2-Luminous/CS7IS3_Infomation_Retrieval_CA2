FR941019-2-00177 FR941019-2-00093 [Release No. 34&hyph;34828; File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;10] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Notice of Extension of Comment Period for a Proposed Rule Change Establishing a Fee Schedule for Certain Inter-Depository Deliveries October 12, 1994 On July 7, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;10) pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. DTC filed the proposal to establish a fee schedule for certain interdepository deliveries. Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the Federal Register on August 9, 1994. 2 In an earlier notice, the Commission granted an extension of the period for public comment on the proposed rule change until September 30, 1994. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34480 (August 2, 1994), 59 FR 40630. 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34594 (August 25, 1994), 59 FR 45317 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;10]. The Commission has received a request for an additional extension of the comment period on the proposed rule change and finds that the complexity and significance of the filing dictates a longer comment period to ensure that interested parties have sufficient time in which to conduct complete analyses of the proposal. Thus, the Commission finds good cause to extend the period for public comment on the proposed rule change until November 15, 1994. For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 4 4 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1994). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
