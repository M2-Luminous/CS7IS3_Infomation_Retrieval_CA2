Lawyers Association Determined To Uncover Lawyer's Killers WRITER BERATES GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO DIALOGUE, SETS TERMS In his 3,500-word article on page 5, Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn criticizes the government's approach to the proposed national dialogue which, he believes, would be useless if it were not an instrument of change and exhaustive reform. Stating that "national dialogue must start with political reform, or the right to change the ruler," he says that all signs indicate that the government wants one thing but the people want another. "We want it to be a triumph for the approach of democratic change, while they want it to be a tyrannical, terrorist setback that further establishes the present regime, with all its incompetence and corruption," he says. Husayn notes that nothing in the public policy or the ruling approach has changed since the call for dialogue was made. "The most fateful laws are still being passed in a hurry without serious discussion," he says, pointing out that instead of recognizing the role of the opposition, the government has tightened the noose around it by taking its free writers to military courts and harassing the Muslim Brothers. He affirms, however, that "we will not boycott the dialogue, unless it is proven beyond a doubt and before all that they are determined to conspire and hatch evil plots." Registering his party's objection to the formation of the committee in charge of preparing the national dialogue, Husayn sums up the terms of "collective national powers and parties." He emphasizes the need for a balanced representation of people from various intellectual inclinations in the proposed general congress for the national dialogue. For this purpose he suggests that the total number of representatives be limited to "200 members for example" to ensure a balanced exchange of views. He stresses that National Democratic Party members should not be favored over other parties, that representatives of major parties should be increased, that no major trade or professional union should be excluded, that universities should be represented, and that the Islamic current should be represented compatibly with its intellectual and political weight in the society. Moving on to the agenda of the national dialogue, he sums up the three self-evident principles by the following: To guarantee man's basic right to protect his body, dignity, honor, and money; to work out ways to put an end to election rigging; and to agree on collective objection to the use of armed force in political conflicts, or what he terms "the so-called civilian terrorism." "The general congress must openly announce from the first moment that it will not culminate in binding resolutions, apart from the three self-evident principles. If you wish to expand the scope of discussion and exchange of views, it is alright with us, so long as the world will follow what is going on via the central mass media," Husayn concludes. APPEAL TO MUBARAK TO USE DIALOGUE WITH ISLAMISTS In the 500-word "Quiet Message to President Mubarak" on page 9, Muhammad Isma'il says to Mubarak that the evil retinue around him has put an invincible wall between him and the people, as is evident from the wedge driven between the president and Islamists in general. "Some have harbored evil intentions toward Islam and Muslims; they were brought up and weaned on disbelief and infidelity. An opportunity was offered to them on a silver platter to release their suppressed poisons in the face of the Islamic revival, which we unfortunately failed to exploit. They used the country's ordeal to win your favor with their false slogans and insincere words," he writes. "Whoever told you, Mr. President, that Islamists have ambition to rule or to take your chair is a liar and an unethical hypocrite," he states. Explaining that emergency laws, arrests on suspicion, and scaring and framing the people have not succeeded in stopping terrorism, he pleads with the president "to try, even for once, the approach of dialogue and good counselling; use love rather than hatred, tolerance rather than spite, and sincerity rather than ill will." He proposes to the president to give scholars the chance to talk to Islamists first in jail and then outside of jail, and to give orders to stop torturing prisoners and improve their living conditions. He affirms that accepting dialogue or mediation with our sons will strengthen rather than weaken the government. WRITER SEES MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HISTORY AS COMMENDABLE A 400-word article by Ahmad 'Izz-al-Din on page 7 comments on "the security and media clampdown on the Muslim Brotherhood" and the repeated use of the term "secret organization" to refer to the organization. Referring to a report in the 3 June issue of the weekly magazine AL-MUSAWWAR, filed as NC1106202194 and add, he says that what the magazine terms secret documents of the Muslim Brotherhood were based on "a confidential memorandum written by Brigadier General M.R. of the State Security, hoping to present the Muslim Brothers as an easy prey to the regime to exterminate them." 'Izz-al-Din emphasizes that even if the information revealed in the magazine report was true, the Muslim Brothers' quest to impose themselves on the political map and their wish to avoid provoking the security apparatus could not be described as a secret action or as terrorism. "AL-MUSAWWAR's security report has unmasked some positive aspects in the secret group that are lacking in the public ruling party and other overt political powers. Among these is the fact that the elections of the secret organization are being done by free and secret balloting and that everyone will have an equal opportunity to run for the leading positions," 'Izz-al-Din says. The writer adds that it is alright to uncover more hidden facts about that secret organization, because "what the government sees as criticism we see as praise and what it sees as a vice we see as a virtue." He concludes: "If the government keeps up its current course, the Muslim Brothers will gain more prominence and popular support. They will even walk the streets and call: This is the secret organization; who wants to join?" MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SPOKESMAN DENIES DISAGREEMENT WITH LABOR PARTY An unattributed 120-word report on page 7 says that Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, official spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood, denied a report published in the "last" issue of the AL-'ARABI newspaper, which quoted him as saying that "the Labor Party does not represent the Muslim Brotherhood and we disagree with Ibrahim Shukri." Al-Hudaybi explains that the newspaper distorted his words and that he did not say that there was a disagreement between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Labor Party. He affirmed that what he said was: "With all due respect to Ibrahim Shukri and the Labor Party leaders, the party--as stated by its leader Ibrahim Shukri--does not represent the Muslim Brotherhood on the committee in charge of preparing for national dialogue." REPORT SAYS SECURITY FORCES `LIQUIDATED' ISLAMISTS A 120-word report by 'Adil al-Bahnasawi on pages 1 and 7 says that security forces used armored cars to bulldoze the house in which four members of the Islamic Group were hiding in Tama, when these forces failed to arrest them. The four were "liquidated" after the house was bulldozed completely. The report adds that the security forces, in a separate incident, took four Islamists from jails in Asyut and three students in a police car to a cemetery in Tahta, where they were tied-up and shot dead. LAWYERS ASSOCIATION DETERMINED TO UNCOVER LAWYER'S KILLERS An 800-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and Khalid Yunus on pages 1 and 7 cites Ahmad Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna, secretary general of the Lawyers Association, as he affirms at a press conference that the association's crisis is "purely professional" and that the association was only acting upon its established principle to protest the violation of the rights of one of its members to live. In the report, al-Banna affirms that the association will keep up its efforts until the names of the officers who were responsible for the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani are publicized. "Unless the government takes the necessary legal measures, we will lodge a complaint with the UN Human Rights Commission to launch an investigation," al-Banna said. He added that an official in the American Middle East Watch Human Rights Organization will meet with the Association members to discuss the case. Al-Banna stressed that the government cannot dissolve the association's council and that a court ruling in al-Sadat's time emphasized that it is unconstitutional to dissolve the council.
