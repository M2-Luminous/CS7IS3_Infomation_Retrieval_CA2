The aggressor has continuously pounded civilian targets in Tesanj, Maglaj, Sije, Mravici, Matuzici, Jelah, Kalosevic, and Miljanovci. The shells have killed over 20 civilians, and wounded about 100 innocent people. The entire 30-kilometer-long defense line has been pounded with hundreds of shells, but the worst situation was in the operational zone of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade in the region of Plana, Lijesnica, and (Nekoli), and in the operational zones of the 203d Glorious Motorized Brigade Doboj-Bosnia, the 110th Glorious Brigade HVO Usora, and on the southern sector of the the 200th Chivalrous Brigade in the region of Kraljevo Brdo, Bandera, and Borik. Let us add at the end of this report that today it is eight months that this region has been besieged, this region where people are dying of hunger and deprivation. We appeal to all who can and want to help these suffering people to send in food and medicine.
