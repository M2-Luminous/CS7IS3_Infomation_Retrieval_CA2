An offensive, which has included restructuring, sales channel reorganization, the introduction of new cars, etc., is beginning to bear fruit. The full-fledged offensive of import cars has begun. The domestic new car market between January and August dropped off 8.3 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. However, imported cars have increased by as much as 12.4 percent. The biggest reason for this significant growth is the import of cars produced abroad by domestic manufacturers or, put another way, the increase of reverse import cars. According to results from January through August, these have expanded by 27,826 units--more than double the amount compared to the same term of the previous year. Contributing to this is the start of imports of models such as Toyota's Scepter wagon, Honda's Civic coupe, Mitsubishi's Diamante wagon, etc., that had not been imported into Japan before. However, imports of the so-called gaisha [foreign cars] (true imports), which exclude the reverse importation cars, are also steadily increasing. According to the results from January to August, these have increased by 0.2 percent compared to the same term of the previous year, reaching 104,593 units. Contributing to this is the fact that, since about last year, several true import carmakers have begun to put some strenuous efforts in capturing the Japanese market. Behind that is the fact that Yanase abandoned import sales of Volkswagens at the end of last year, and beginning this year tried selling the Opal. Volkswagen Audi Nippon (VAN), in the middle of 1990 tried to construct a sales system of 100,000 units per year, but opposition was generated between it and Yanase, who wanted to sell Volkswagen as a rare luxury car, and in the end, Yanase quit selling VW's. This move could be described as symbolic in Japan's import car market. Foreign automobile makers are no longer trying to sell cars in Japan as though foreign cars are equivalent to luxury cars but are trying to sell many cars while standing on the same playing field as the domestic makers. Says Rover Japan President Peter J. Woods, "When I found out that Yanase was going to abandon sales of VW, I thought that Japan's import car market map would change significantly. I immediately reported to my home country (England) and drew up various countermeasure strategies on the aspects of product and price." On the price front, it implemented a "fair play policy" in February of this year which is what it calls restoration of profits due to the strong yen difference. It lowered vehicle prices targeting three models, such as the "Rover Mini series" on the weighted average of 13 percent. It has successively introduced a total of seven new models such as the automatic Discovery, the Rover 200/400 series, among others. At the end of 1992, its sales bases were transformed to become 100 percent dedicated sales. Forbidding parallel sales with other cars like Peugeot and Renault, it aimed to strengthen sales capacity at each base. By the combination of these effects it has recorded a 35.5-percent increase over the 8,793 units of the same term of the previous year in its results from January through August. In the future as well, "We plan to introduce new models during the period from 1994 to the beginning of 1995. Since the `fair play policy' was considered with a five- to six-year interim period, I believe that people will feel that models introduced in the future will be quite inexpensive," says Mr. Woods. Further, beginning in November, the Discovery RV will begin to be sold at Honda Motor dealerships under the name of Crossroad. It is cooperation that would not be possible without Honda Motor, which is investing 20 percent in Rover itself. Until now the strength of the Germans with VW, Mercedes Benz, and BMW has been overwhelming in Japan's import car market. In 1992, they held 60 percent of the import car market. However, going into 1993, the share of the German side dropped to 48 percent. As mentioned above, VW lost its major dealership of Yanase, and in January to August suffered a reduction of 41.5 percent compared to the same term of the previous year. Further, due to the domestic sales slump, sales of the luxury cars Mercedes and BMW dropped 9.1 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively. U.S. Cars Also Finally Make Serious Bid By contrast, the ones winning a significant increase in share are those on the U.S. side. Honda USA, Toyota, Chrysler, and Ford are improving. Whereas their share had been only 18 percent in 1992, it has reached 30 percent in 1993. Of the foreign-owned makers, Chrysler had a dramatic 3.2-fold increase compared to the same term of the previous year. That company's recovery in the United States is also remarkable and it has clearly become stronger in the Japanese market as well. Its import sales arm, Chrysler Japan Sales, which should be able to turn its balance sheet from continuously red to black ink by 1996, began to embark on various measures last year. First, the company's structure was rationalized. Its employees, which numbered 107 in April 1992, were reduced to 30, less than one-third, by September 1993. Then it quit investing in directly managed dealers, directly managed plants and PDI (predelivery improvement) centers. It had Seibu Automotive Sales take on all the directly managed dealerships, of which there were 48, and at the same time, by increasing the amount handled by Honda Motor, the number of sales bases was increased from 1,000 at the beginning of 1992 to just over 1,800. Furthermore, 100 percent of PDI, which was being performed at three locations, was concentrated at the Honda Motor Co. Tochigi plant. It is performing strategic pricing and the introduction of new models very enthusiastically. The Jeep Cherokee, which it had been selling at 5.35 million yen until last year, was reduced in January 1993 to 3.72 million yen--a discount of as much as 1.62 million yen. "Until 1992, U.S.-specification cars had been brought over and headlights, turn signals, fenders, emissions sensors, etc., were being replaced. Starting with 1993 models, it began mass production of cars for export with English, Australian, and Japanese specifications which had steering wheels on the right-hand side, so about all that was necessary to do in Japan was to put on the Japanese seals," according to Osamu Nagata, business planning department manager at Chrysler Japan Sales. It was possible to achieve a large cost reduction by changing the complex manual operations that were being done in Japan to mass production at its U.S. plant. Moreover, he says, "We want to reduce the difference in price between domestic and foreign products. We want to compete at a price that compares favorable even with other domestically produced RV's," indicating a that there was also a strategic motive. And then, this price was determined "at the end of 1992, calculated at 110 yen to the dollar," says Mr. Nakata. In addition to this, the fact that three types of the new models of Grand Cherokee were introduced beginning in January has also led to increased sales. Also in the future, says Mr. Nagata, "we will soon begin sales of the 3.5 liter displacement Vision (commonly called the LH)." Further, it is thought that in the United States the low-priced compact car Neon dubbed the Japanese car killer will be introduced in 1995. Ford's move to increase its strength in Japan is also vigorous. It is showing a 53.9-percent rise in the period from January to August. Contributing to this is the elevation of its power by expanding its personnel at Ford Japan which is in charge of import sales. In the year and a half since the beginning of last year, it added between 70 and 80 employees so that now there are about 110. And, says Ford Japan Advertising Liaison Headquarters Manager Hiroaki Tanabe, "We have taken a policy since 1991 of gradually bringing costs and follow-up service to be on a par with domestically produced cars." Prices are revised in autumn of each year and it is common for them to rise, but Ford has lowered prices in both 1991 and 1992. The 3.8 liter Taurus wagon, which was 4.15 million yen in 1990, was reduced to 3.986 million yen in 1991 and 3.78 million yen in 1992. Furthermore, since dealers had been conducting direct import sales, the Explorer RV that had been selling at 5.25 million yen was switched to Ford Japan importation, and the price was reduced by 1.26 million yen to 3.99 million yen. Also, in April 1993, it built a parts depot (parts center). Until now, most parts had to be gotten from the United States, but this has made it possible to execute more prompt follow-up service. "In the first half of 1994, we are planning introduction of right-hand side steering wheels on the Probe, Mondeo, and the three Mustang models. Further we will introduce right-hand side steering wheels on the Taurus and the Explorer by 1997," says Mr. Tanabe. The bulky GM is also beginning to stir. In its results from January to August, it was the only one among the Big Three to have a decrease, off by 12.4 percent. Much of this is due to a delay of four to five months more than expected in the receipt of the Chevrolet Camaro, which had undergone a full model change. Registration of the Camaro began in August, and has expanded greatly at a 46.8-percent increase over the same month of the previous year. According to Michael Dougherty, president of Japan GM, "We will not launch a campaign of restoration of the profits from the high yen difference, but when one considers the future trends, there is no doubt that prices will end up dropping." It also plans to introduce a new Cadillac. Moreover, concerning the Saturn, which has been a big hit in the United States, he says, "Currently, GM's Saturn project team has come over and is studying the Japanese market. We are examining the idea of establishing a Saturn channel for sales as was done in the United States. We want to introduce a right-hand drive car at about the same price as other domestically made cars in the mid-1990's." The full-fledged offensive of the true import cars is building up steam with the passing of each day. As Japan GM President Dougherty points out, "It is inappropriate for the original import car share into Japan to be merely 4 percent," and, indeed, the share of import cars into Japan's market is extremely low compared to Europe and the United States. He adds, "It is exceedingly difficult to build a dealer network in Japan because of keiretsu, etc. "Moreover, when introducing products, one had to go through the Ministry of Transport, which took time and effort, and we were not able to achieve good results. However, recently, with the beginning of development of a Saturn with a right-hand side steering wheel, among other things, GM itself is beginning to turn its attention toward the Japanese market," according to Mr. Dougherty. In Rover President Woods' view as well, "There are also trade imbalance problems, so there will probably be a growth of about 40 percent in true import cars in the next four years." For the domestic market, growth of which is said to have ground to a halt, the threat of the import cars will prove to be a double punch. The struggle of Japanese cars will continue for quite some time.
