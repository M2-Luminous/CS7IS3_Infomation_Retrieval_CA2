FR941006-0-00038 FR941006-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Air Force 32 CFR Part 806 Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program AGENCY: Department of the Air Force, DoD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of the Air Force revised its rule to update Air Force procedures for the Air Force Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Program. This revision provides guidance for making records public. It tells how to process FOIA requests and tells the public how to request copies of Air Force records using the FOIA. It outlines requirements for For Official Use Only (FOUO) material. The intended effect is to provide current information on Air Force policy and procedures for the disclosure of records to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Anne P. Rollins, SAF/AAIQ, 1610 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330&hyph;1610, telephone (703) 697&hyph;3492. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule implements 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and DODD 5400.7 (32 CFR Part 285) and DOD 5400.7&hyph;R (32 CFR Part 286). Because this part implements a higher authority directive, it is not published as a proposed rule for comment. The Department of the Air Force has determined that this rule is not a major rule because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. The Secretary of the Air Force has certified that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, because this rule does not have a significant economic impact on small entities as defined by the Act, and does not impose any obligatory information requirements beyond those imposed by DoD. This rule revises Air Force Regulation (AFR) 4&hyph;33, Air Force Freedom of Information Act Program, 31 July 1992.
