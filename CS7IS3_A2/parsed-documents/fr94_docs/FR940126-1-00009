FR940126-1-00009 FR940126-1-00005 For areas potentially qualifying as critical habitat, NMFS is requesting information describing: (1) The activities that affect the area or could be affected by the designation, and (2) the economic costs and benefits of additional requirements of management measures likely to result from the designation. The economic cost to be considered in the critical habitat designation under the ESA is the probable economic impact ``of the [critical habitat] designation upon proposed or ongoing activities'' (50 CFR 424.19). NMFS must consider the incremental costs specifically resulting from a critical habitat designation that are above the economic effects attributable to listing the species. Economic effects attributable to listing include actions resulting from section 7 consultations under the ESA to avoid jeopardy to the species and from the taking prohibitions under section 9 of the ESA. Comments concerning economic impacts should distinguish the costs of listing from the incremental costs that can be directly attributed to the designation of specific areas as critical habitat. Data, information, and comments should include: (1) Supporting documentation such as maps, bibliographic references, or reprints of pertinent publications, and (2) the person's name, address, and association, institution, or business. Dated: January 18, 1994. Herbert W. Kaufman, Deputy Director, Office of Protected Resources. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1634 Filed 1&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;M
