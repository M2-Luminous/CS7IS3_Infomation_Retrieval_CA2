Over the past year, the province has expanded its microwave and optical fibre cable lines by 1,837 kilometers and 946 kilometers, respectively. In addition, international satellite communication has been put into service between Weihai city of Shandong to Seoul of Korea. Some 15,000 long-distance telephone lines have been opened, increasing the number of such lines in the province to 33,000, 81 percent of which are automatically controlled. All cities and 67 counties in the province have established program-controlled telephone systems, and program-controlled switchboards with 395,000 lines were opened last year. Consequently, the number of telephone users in the province has risen to about 1.37 million. Officials from the provincial posts and telecommunications department said that now more than 50 percent of the towns and villages have opened automatically-controlled telephone lines. Some 81 post offices had been computerized by the end of last year. The postal and telecommunication services have been expanded greatly, with mobile telephones, digital communication, radio tracking and credit card phones available in most areas in the province. According to official statistics, the postal savings of the province hit a record of more than 5.3 billion yuan (about 609 million U.S. dollars) last year, ranking second in China's postal service. Officials said that more than 3.1 billion yuan (about 356 million U.S. dollars) have been invested in the construction of postal services over the past year, four times the 1992 sum.
