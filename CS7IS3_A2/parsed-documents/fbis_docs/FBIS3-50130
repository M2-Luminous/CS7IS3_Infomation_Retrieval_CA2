Perhaps not the way he thought. It can certainly be seen as a fact that last week's Prague summit was the final blow to the Visegrad Four, and it seems completely improbable that this forum of regional cooperation could be saved in its current form. Actually, there is not much reason to save it in its current form. All along, Visegrad remained a dream and it never became anything like it had been intended or what it could have been if Prague had also wanted it. However, this way, it did not turn into a regional power center or a framework of political and economic cooperation -- at the most, it was a political saloon, a discussion club, where the region's leaders passed some time together. This could not have had much practical use; it did not stop the economic links between the three -- later four -- Visegrad countries from breaking down, while the nations in question have not come closer together emotionally or politically, either. The main reason for this must be sought in the fact that, rather than seeing each other as partners, the governments of the given countries saw each other as rivals, or even as a burden hindering their march toward the West. The only positive results of this cat-and-dog friendship arose almost completely independently of the participants, sometimes even against their wishes. They are very lucky that the West continues to treat the Visegrad countries as a group, and this has been to their definite advantage so far in their integration efforts. The Prague summit brought important new elements into this situation. First of all, through offering the Partnership for Peace, Washington (although it still wants to see the four countries together) has resigned itself to the probable amplification of the rivalry and to an increased regional differentiation. Secondly, the Prague meeting also made it clear that the Czech Republic is canceling even the existing rudimentary forms of the Visegrad cooperation. The emerging new situation favors the strong, and according to all indications, Prague feels strong just now. It would be pointless to dispute the Czech Republic's right to take a separate course from its neighbors, and to form its international relations independently of these countries, solely in accordance with its own interests. If Prague breaks with Visegrad -- so be it. However, the others should, by all means, realize that the Czech Republic is trying to do this in such a way that, without it, nothing should be left of Visegrad. Naturally, this intent is perfectly understandable from Prague's point of view -- a Visegrad without Czechs would be a serious counterbalance or alternative to Prague and the Czech way in Europe. Up to now, in the Visegrad Four, everything has happened the way Prague wanted it; simply as a result of the decision-making mechanism based on consensus. Prague also shaped Visegrad's image to its current form -- namely to be without character. Now, for the first time, the time has come to say no to Prague. It is simply not true that, in the current situation, Central Europe does not have any other common issues but free trade, which is the only issue urged by [Czech Prime Minister] Klaus. Naturally, for Central Europe to be able to represent its particular interests, a Visegrad group that no longer has the Czechs (and whose place the Slovenians, for example, would obviously be happy to take) should radically change its views. Much more imagination, goodwill, trust, and tolerance would be needed. All the factors that are missing in this region. However, this situation might change slowly because the circumstances might compel the affected nations in this direction. So far, the main objection against closer Central European cooperation has been the argument that it would force the states that are trying to get access to the western integration to wait too long. In the meantime, however, the same situation has arisen even while regional cooperation was being disarrayed. By now, it has become clear that Central Europe will have to wait a long time for European Union membership and for NATO membership. However, we will still have to carry on living somehow until this happens. For this reason alone, Central Europe is doomed to cooperate; in fact, a more effective regional cooperation would actually strengthen the region's position in the process of negotiations with the West. If Prague realizes this fact, it is good. If it does not then the others will still have to make a step. Even without Prague.
