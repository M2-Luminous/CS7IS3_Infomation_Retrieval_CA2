The number of deaths resulting from overcrowding at the Jamarat on Monday afternoon reached 270 cases including 6 Saudis, 11 Egyptians, 2 Sudanese, one Yemeni, 6 Algerians, one Jordanian, 7 Moroccans, 5 Turks, 8 Nigerians, 18 Indians, 6 Bangladeshis, 44 Pakistanis, 6 Indonesians, one Iranian, one Ghanian, one Afghan, one Dutch, one Mauritious, one Denmark and 143 of unknown nationalities until this date. The names of the dead persons which were found out until Thursday have been communicated to the Saudi Press Agency to carry them through the media both inside and outside the Kingdom, the source said. The source said hundreds of thousands of people headed for Jamarat on Monday afternoon thereby neglecting the instructions given to them by Mutawifs and broadcast by the mass media over the previous ten days. He added that most pilgrims raced to the Jamarat to finish this final ritual early even before noon and many of them were carrying their luggage on their backs which led to the overcrowding, the falling of some and tripping of others in addition to the haste by all. Despite the existence of huge bridges built by the state to facilitate the movement and despite continuous expansion work on the roads leading to the three Jamarat, the large number of security personnel around the area and early warnings announced on loud speakers in various languages, terrible overcrowding occurs at each Jamrah and lives are lost. The source stressed that if we count the deaths of a city with two-million population in 15 days under normal circumstances, we will find more deaths than the cases which occurred during this Haj season in Mecca and the holy places. And if we take into consideration the number of pilgrims who performed pilgrimage this year, which is more than 1.5 million people, we will find that the percentage of deaths during this season was a mere 0.05 percent which is a normal one. The source wondered what is with those who race to defame and doubt everything that the Saudi Government has offered and still offers to pilgrims every year when the Kingdom has spent billions and exerted intensive efforts to provide comfort for pilgrims. The source said the motives of those who exaggerate the facts and figures and wrongly insult the Kingdom because of their hatred and sickness of the heart which reappears for the slightest of reasons, were known and so are the sides which recruit those hired persons in various arenas who will be sad to hear that the Haj season has succeeded to a great extent, thanks to Allah, and the Moslems who came to perform Haj have done so and returned home safely. The source concluded that for those whose lives were taken by God while they were performing rituals to him obediently, we ask Allah to have mercy on them, send them to heaven and count them among the pious martyrs.
