We wish to reassure him here that 'Arafat's jihad call will not achieve for him more than he can achieve at the negotiating table. Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] did not achieve much when he was calling for jihad just a few miles away from Palestine, let alone doing that from Johannesburg at the far end of Africa. [passage omitted] In the view of the majority, jihad is no longer jihad because most battles are between brothers, for personal vendettas, or foreign battles fought on Islamic territory. With the weakening of the leadership and its credibility, the word jihad has become weaker. Rabin, therefore, should rest assured that Abu-'Ammar's call will not move the people of South Africa, just as it did not move others. The real jihad was that of the unarmed people who risked their lives to target the head of an Israeli soldier with their stones. What came before was just military operations by regular armies. Even the other organizations which declare jihad in the name of Islam, have two problems. The first is that, like Abu-'Ammar, they make the call from distant places like Tehran, and the second is that they declare jihad as a part of the same organization which brings them together with communist groups at the same table. They cannot carry out their jihad from a place a thousand miles away nor can they call what they are doing jihad when they seek the assistance of communists.
