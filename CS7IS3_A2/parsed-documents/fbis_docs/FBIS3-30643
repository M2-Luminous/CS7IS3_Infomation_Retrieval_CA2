This is the first Slovak visit at the level of foreign minister to this country since the division of Czechoslovakia. Bulgarian National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov paid a working visit to Bratislava in April last year, Slovak President Michal Kovac was on an informal visit to Bulgaria. Having come for a holiday at the Black Sea in the summer of 1993, Mr. Kovac met President Zhelyu Zhelev, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov. Some time before President Zhelev and President Kovac had talks in Brussels where they attended the funeral of King Baudouin. The separation of Slovakia and the Czech Republic gave rise to certain problems of bilateral relations: The older Bulgarian-Czechoslovak agreement should be either updated or a new agreement should be signed, President Zhelev said after his meeting with President Kovac in Sofia. Dr. Zhelev stressed that "there are no political or any other obstacles to resolving the problem rapidly and in the best possible way." Slovakia sees a friend in Bulgaria and although we are not neighbours, we are bound together by the Danube, our historic contacts and Slavdom, now that the totalitarian regimes, we have a common goal: Integration with the European structures, Slovakia's President Michal Kovac told reporters at the time. "Slovakia believes that Bulgaria is an important stabilizing factor in the Balkan region," he stressed. We would like to have the status of observers in the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, on the other hand Slovakia is ready to support Bulgaria's participation in different projects within the framework of the Central European Initiative, Mr. Kovac said. Both sides expressed their desire to create, at state level, prerequisites for the activation of Bulgarian-Slovak relations in the field of economy, tourism and culture, and to promote political cooperation at international level. Mr. Kovac invited the Bulgarian president to pay an official visit to Bratislava. Bulgaria and Slovakia are planning to sign agreements on the avoidance of double taxation, on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments, on culture and on trade. A Slovak Cultural Centre was opened in Sofia in October 1993. In November Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov received Mr. Jozef Dravecky, charge d'affairs of Slovakia's embassy in Sofia. According to the official statement, it is the sides' shared opinion that there are very good prospects for the development of cooperation between Bulgaria and Slovakia. "Slovakia has great interest in the region. We want to restore the level of our good contacts that existed before," Mrs. Vlasta Jonasieva of the Slovak Trade Ministry said in may last year. The Bulgarian and Slovak experts share the opinion that the volume of trade between Bulgaria and Slovakia in 1992, amounting to $28 million, is awfully small. "Slovakia has not lost its interest in Bulgaria," Mrs. Jonasivea said in an interview for the Bulgarian Press.
