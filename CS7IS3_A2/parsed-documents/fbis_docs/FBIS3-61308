We must be unsparing in the help we offer to our kinsmen who long for their homeland and long to return and claim their heritage. In these hard times it is extremely difficult not to migrate from one country to another and from one village to another. However, it is fitting that we extend a helping hand to our kinsmen in areas where the flames of war are burning where there is environmental disaster. The Migration Department under the Ministry of Labor provides such aid and operates for the purpose of rendering specific assistance to our Kazakh relatives who desire to return to their homeland. We have a duty not only to bring our kinsmen home, but to supply them with residential housing and with work. In so doing we must bear in mind the situation of our government, with its tightened purse strings and difficulties in local economies. For that reason, having looked into the above circumstances, our President has set quotas (numbers) for those migrating to Kazakhstan. Thus, a quota is set for 1993 of 10,000 families moving to Kazakhstan. It is well known that limits are placed today among independent nations on the tendency towards uncontrolled migration and that migration processes are advanced only under the limitations of the laws established by each country. Thus at present the return of Kazakhs living outside of Kazakhstan to their homeland is carried out through the Migration Department. For that reason, Kazakhs living outside the country communicate directly with this department, make known what oblast in Kazakhstan they wish to migrate to, tell what their needs are, and come to an agreement with the department. It is possible that not only individual families, but a clan, a village, or a settlement will get together and jointly write a letter. If they establish direct connections with that department, specific help is given to those migrating. For example, the expenses of shipping their goods are met. However, documents confirming travel expenses for this purpose (ticket stubs, receipts) must be shown. Migrants are sent to the appropriate settlement according to their own request or according to the instructions of the Ministry of Labor. Enterprise heads of the area where they go provide them the needed assistance. They must provide them with housing, or, if this is impossible, they must provide them with a plot of land to build a house and with a loan needed to buy construction materials. However, the amount of the loan should not exceed 5 million rubles. In rural areas, they are given a cow and 10-15 sheep, according to what is economically possible. Separate from this, a seasonal payment-in-aid is paid to the head of a family of migrants at a rate 15 times the average lowest salary and to the remaining members of the family at a rate 7 times the lowest average salary. Divisions of the Migration Department have been established in every oblast. Those migrating can apply to the migration division in the oblast directly regarding any special problems they encounter. We believe that the situation has been brought under control and a stop has been put to the confused flow of too many newcomers. Indeed, foreigners have equal rights with Republic citizens under the law to buy housing. It would seem to be necessary, while correcting and improving law in this area, to specify under what circumstances foreigners have a right to buy housing and when they do not. As is shown by the practices of other democratic countries, every country has full rights to carry out a migration and visa policy convenient for itself. Limitation of those coming to a country is also not contrary to international law. It appears that the documents of all of those migrating are to be delivered for review by workers of the Migration Department through the divisions of this organization. What this means is that such things as illegal registration and housing purchase will not be allowed. There are areas in migration where we do "the best we can." For example, some migrants understand their return to their homeland differently and want an apartment in the center of Almaty out of turn or demand a free house in the vicinity of the capital. These things, in fact, do not happen. Up to the present the Migration Department has done a number of good things: it has assisted 3,000 families from Mongolia this year, 300 from Iran, and 5,000-6,000 from CIS countries. Plans are for the migration of a thousand families from Iran and Turkey in the future. At present the department is devoting special attention to evacuating Kazakhs in regions afflicted by war or conflict. The reasons are understandable. Shortage of financing is creating barriers to the development of Migration Department services. The fates of so many Kazakhs and the beating of a hot heart longing for the homeland are connected with migration. For that reason full financial support is needed for this areas. It would be proper that, in addition to counting tasks accomplished, we look to the future of such immigration for a moment. We note that our reception of migrants is still without reproach, compared to how Germans returning to the homeland are received there. There are so many things we should do in this area. I am hoping for a time when we will receive our returning kinsmen by doing everything possible for them like a truly civilized and cultured countries. So said Nurlan Raqymzhanov, deputy chief of the Migration Department. Some of our kinsmen, while they know how to speak Kazakh, do not know how to write Kazakh using the Cyrillic script, or they lack the needed specialties. In addition, when we bear in mind many peculiarities and differences in customs of our Republic, there should be centers to acclimatize and teach migrants. At the very least it would be proper to organize courses lasting three-four months. [Policy] directions are needed for the entire migration system. One thing I want to mention at the end, lest any misconceptions be created, is that there is no prohibition preventing our kinsmen from migrating on their own without informing the department. However, it would indeed be good to remember that migrating through the department is considerably more convenient.
