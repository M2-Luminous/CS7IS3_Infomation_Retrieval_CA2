C. Chen and Sofia Wu] [Text] London, Feb. 16 (CNA) -- The Central Bank of China (CBC) opened a representative office in London Wednesday as part of its effort to promote financial exchanges between Taiwan and European countries. CBC Governor Samuel Shieh flew to London earlier this week to preside over the opening ceremony. Many British politicians, bankers and business executives, including former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the deputy governor of the Bank of England, attended the ceremony. The new CBC office is located in London's financial district and adjacent to the Bank of England. It is the CBC's second overseas office. The bank opened a similar office in New York last year. The office will help manage CBC's foreign exchange deposits in Britain and other European countries as well as strengthen contacts with major British and other European banks, said Yang Chin-lung, director of the London office. London is one of the world's most important financial capitals. "Our London office is expected to help train qualified international money managers and accelerate Taiwan's financial liberalization and internationalization," Yang added. With the addition of the CBC office, Taiwan now has six financial institutions in Britain. The Taiwan provincial government-owned First and Chang Hua Commercial Banks have opened branches in London. The Bank of Taiwan, Hua Nan Commercial Bank and Chinatrust Commercial Bank have representative offices here. Meanwhile, Taipei Bank is scheduled to open a representative office in London in March.
