Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-21JAN94-RUSSIA/US Government, Opposition, Press React to Clinton Visit SUMMARY Russian President Boris Yeltsin and government officials hailed the 12-15 January visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton as demonstrating that U.S.-Russian partnership had reached a new, more mature phase where everyday, businesslike dealings, rather than sensational achievements, were to be expected. Politicians outside the Russian Government generally had less upbeat assessments ranging from lukewarm to hostile. Reaction from the press ranged predictably across the spectrum, with progovernment newspapers emphasizing the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons and the Partnership for Peace initiative as positive achievements and the nationalistic and procommunist press criticizing U.S. support for Yeltsin and his reform policies. END SUMMARY Summing up President Bill Clinton's visit as reflecting "equality, mutual benefit, and accounting for each other's interests," Russian President Boris Yeltsin hailed the summit as a new stage in U.S.-Russian partnership (Russian TV, 14 January). Although Yeltsin cautioned that a "too upbeat" assessment did not reflect the "nature of the frank and businesslike discussions" and said that there "were and will be disagreements," he stressed that the visit had been "very fruitful" and that "most importantly" there was "goodwill" and "common decisions defined by partnership." Listing some of the results of the summit, Yeltsin echoed the words of the Moscow Declaration signed at the summit on 14 January in stressing that U.S.-Russian relations have "finally moved into the phase of mature, strategic, global partnership in all spheres during these talks." Russian Government Other government officials, also highlighting the theme of partnership, gave similarly high marks to the summit: -- After the first round of talks, Presidential press spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov told journalists that the talks had taken place "in an atmosphere of genuine partnership" with each side acting "on the premise that peace and stability in Europe and worldwide is impossible without Russia and the United States" (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 13 January). -- Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that the "main sensation of the summit is the absence of a sensation," stressing that the "we are proceeding to institutional and systematic partnership." Kozyrev, who singled out the agreement signed on 14 January for the sale of enriched uranium as a notable result, also stressed that the summit achieved an economic partnership, stating that this did not mean "short term credit" or "humanitarian aid" but "negotiations with a long term perspective and realization that Russia is a great economic power" (Interfax, 15 January). -- Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov called the talks "the most substantive, businesslike, and concrete" of all the summits he had attended. He also stressed economic partnership, noting that President Clinton had put forth a package of "specific measures" that could help Russia "gain a greater foothold in world markets" and ease Russia's economic relations with former Soviet republics (ITAR-TASS, 14 January). Other Politicians' Assessments In contrast to the government officials, leaders of several parties represented in the new Duma gave the summit assessments ranging from lukewarm to hostile: -- Speaking before the summit, reformist opposition leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy said the meeting would be simply a "pleasant exchange of opinions" (Interfax, 11 January). Apparently disagreeing with Yavlinskiy, from whose electoral bloc he was elected to the Duma, Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, formerly head of the Supreme Soviet's international affairs committee, said the visit was "evidence of U.S. respect for our great country." He also expressed hope the president would take advantage of the visit to "familiarize himself even more deeply with [Russia's] problems" (ITAR-TASS, 13 January). -- Centrist Democratic Party leader Nikolay Travkin told Interfax that he expected little from the summit, saying that the best thing Washington could do for Russia would be to recognize it as "an equal partner," and adding that "we do not need any tips."(Interfax, 11 January). -- In contrast, Russian Communist Party (CPRF) leader Gennadiy Zyuganov called the visit "uniquely important and timely as our political situation has changed" and it is "necessary [for President Clinton] to get acquainted with it" (ITAR-TASS, 13 January). -- Reflecting possible pique that he was not invited to meet with President Clinton, ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy both before and during the summit described the visit as "useless," "unnecessary," and "pointless." He said that the visit discredited the U.S. President since "Russians are going to see he has come to support a team of bankers---the Gaydar government." Zhirinovskiy called the president's failure to meet him "a mistake." At the same time, he contended that, since Russians know that "all this disarray [in Russia] was organized by the West," he would gain votes by the snub, adding that it indicates that "I am the only honest and clean politician" because the leader of the country "mainly responsible" for helping the democrats "undermine" Russia "does not want to meet me"(Interfax, 11, 13 January). Partnership for Peace Despite their upbeat assessment of the summit as a whole, Yeltsin and other government officials gave a more nuanced reaction to the results of the NATO summit and the Partnership for Peace proposal: -- Yeltsin told the 14 January press conference that he "actively supported" the Partnership for Peace initiative as a "good formula" that ruled out a "country by country" expansion of NATO, claiming that it contained "a primordial element of Russia-U.S. joint creative work." However, Yeltsin appeared to place conditions on any NATO expansion, saying that if Russia or other countries at some point joined NATO they should do it all at once--" precisely together in one package"--to create "security for everyone." Yeltsin also stressed his view that the Partnership for Peace was only one step--although an "important" one--in "creating a security system from Vancouver to Vladivostok," noting that Russia would not "forget" the other collective security systems in Europe, above all "the well-tried institutions of the UN and CSCE" (Russian TV, 14 January). -- Kozyrev characterized the Partnership for Peace as an "important step forward and a serious test of the partnership between Russia, the United States, and other NATO states." Emphasizing the "new quality of partnership and not new membership in NATO," Kozyrev said everyone should "concentrate on partnership," "fill it with specific content," because now "it is too early to say how the period of partnership will end." Kozyrev admitted that one option was to expand NATO, adding that Moscow "did not rule this out." However, returning to statements he has made in the past, he said that other possible options include creating broader security systems and the consolidation of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and he called for "parallel" efforts to be taken in "all of those directions" (Interfax, 13 January; ITAR-TASS, 15 January). -- Kostikov called the Partnership for Peace a "politically attractive declaration," but said it "needed more substance" (Interfax, 13 January). -- Defense Minister Pavel Grachev continued to claim that he did not "understand" the "aspirations of [Central and East European states] to defend themselves from Russia by membership in NATO," saying that Russia supports a "genuine, all-European system of security" that would be defined by "collective actions" rather than by "belonging to blocs." He stressed, however, that Russia's relations with NATO should be "richer" and develop across a "broad range of interaction," adding that in January Russian defense specialists expect to study a plan for cooperation with NATO (Radio Rossii, 16 January). Media Reaction Press commentary on the summit devoted much attention to the tripartite agreement on nuclear weapons as well as the Partnership for Peace initiative. The progovernment press generally stressed the maturing of the U.S.-Russian partnership while the nationalist and communist opposition papers predictably criticized U.S. support for Yeltsin and reform. The proreform, independent Nezavisimaya Gazeta, whose chief editor has often severely criticized Yeltsin personally, carried favorable commentary on the summit. Progovernment Press. Commentary in the pro-Yeltsin Izvestiya and the government newspapers Rossiyskiye Vesti and Rossiyskaya Gazeta focused on the achievements in the nuclear and security areas. The Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda was particularly upbeat in its assessment of these issues: -- A 15 January report in Rossiyskiye Vesti hailed the advent of a "phase of mature strategic global partnership in all spheres" that Moscow and Washington have "now indeed entered." The article went on to praise the trilateral accord on Ukrainian nuclear weapons for imparting "new substance" to U.S.-Russian cooperation toward "strengthening strategic stability and security" and lauded the Partnership for Peace initiative as evidence of "harmony between Russia and the United States," as refuting "the argument of unequal security," and precluding the "possibility of new demarcation lines" dividing Europe. -- Commentary in Izvestiya generally played up the nuclear agreement and the Partnership for Peace and gave less attention to bilateral economic issues, although a 15 January article concluded by saying that the "main attention" of the talks had been devoted to the "reform program." In a discordant note, however, the 12 January Izvestiya carried a report by Melor Sturua contending that the Partnership for Peace proposal "essentially," though not by design, is "placating Zhirinovskiy" and arguing that postponing the admission to NATO of East European countries "both objectively and subjectively" strengthens "not the Russian president but his neofascist opponent" by in effect making a concession out of fear of an extremist backlash. -- Although a 12 January Krasnaya Zvezda article did broach the concern that NATO membership might become an "instrument of blackmail," noting that there was the temptation to use the power of "big brother"--a role it said that NATO plays--to attempt to "pressure" the Russian leadership, in general the Defense Ministry's paper assessed the summit favorably. In a 13 January article, prominent commentator Aleksandr Golts affirmed that the U.S.-Russian relationship had "indeed reached" a stage of "mature strategic partnership" where breakthroughs are unnecessary. Claiming that the United States and Russia had taken a "realistic look" at each other and after "sober assessment" had concluded that they need each other, Golts lauded the Partnership for Peace plan for being "primarily" concerned with "Russia's legitimate interests in the security field." Opposition Press. Commentary in the nationalistic and procommunist Pravda and Sovetskaya Rossiya generally followed the negative tone they set in their coverage of the April 1993 Vancouver summit, minimizing or criticizing the effectiveness of U.S. aid and hinting that U.S. support for Yeltsin is part of an anti-Russia plot: -- An 11 January report in Pravda speculated that the U.S. delegation's "baggage" would "once again" contain "more advice and political declarations than specific economic programs or more, importantly, funds to implement them." The report contained a litany of complaints about U.S. aid, grumbling on the one hand about the "derisorily small" sums involved and on the other hand that such efforts are misdirected. The commentary used U.S. grain sales as an example, saying that these constituted a "fix like narcotics" that "in the opinion of many economists" had "shattered the health of Russian agricultural production." This approach is similar to that adopted by the newspaper's commentary on the April 1993 Vancouver summit when it calculated that the U.S. aid agreed upon at the summit amounted to only "ten dollars for each Russian." The 11 January article also castigated the U.S. reaction to the Russian elections, claiming that the U.S. desire that Russia should not "put on the brakes" but "continue the policy of reforms" struck a "discordant note" against statements by Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin that the "course and speed of reform" needed to be "urgently" revised. The article charged that such discrepancies "reinforce suspicions" that the reforms are "advantageous to the U.S. rather than to Russia." -- A pre-summit article in Sovetskaya Rossiya, which appears increasingly to reflect the influence of the CPRF, complained that "it is now totally clear" that America is at best "only prepared to make gestures involving charitable aid," noting that "even this is limited to gestures that will yield greater dividends on the purely propaganda level." The article cited U.S. support for Yeltsin prior to the September-October conflict with the Russia legislature to claim that the U.S. administration "unconditionally approved" Yeltsin's orders to open fire on the legislature, hinting that the U.S. administration might have had more than an "indirect" responsibility for the 3-4 October government attack on the parliamentary headquarters. A 15 January article cited statements by U.S. and East European officials about NATO which it said "cannot fail to elicit profound alarm." Claiming that NATO became "totally redundant" immediately after the elimination of the Warsaw Pact and the "self-destruction" of the USSR and should have been disbanded then, the article charged that the Partnership for Peace is only the "latest phase" in Western policy of "forcing" Russia "out of its traditional spheres of influence." The article dismissed the Moscow summit as mainly an exercise in "diplomatic protocol." Independent Press. The reformist newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, despite its chief editor's usual antipathy to Yeltsin, gave good marks to the summit. Other independent newspapers pointed out the summit's lack of impact on domestic economic uncertainty, but some balanced this against the achievements of strategic cooperation: -- A 15 January Nezavisimaya Gazeta article said nothing "new" in U.S.-Russian relations was demonstrated at the summit but explained this by claiming that bilateral relations are "as good as they can possibly be." The article nevertheless went on to elaborate on the economic results of the summit, saying that the most outstanding achievement might be the lifting of most of the "discriminatory economic restrictions" on Russian goods entering the U.S. market. The article commended Yeltsin for stressing that Russia needed collaboration with the West not "humanitarian aid," and said that by renouncing help from others Russia is putting itself in "the same rank as developed countries." Even chief editor Vitaliy Tretyakov, often a harsh critic of Yeltsin, claimed that the visit demonstrated that "now matter how" Russia's role "in the world might be assesses," the summit was "still a visit by the head of one superpower to the capital of another superpower" and thus demonstrated "mutual respect, recognition, and mutual acceptance of . . . parity." -- A 12 January article in the independent Segodnya similarly claimed that although U.S. officials "have presumably understood" that they are "incapable of influencing" the Russian domestic situation, they "continue to support Yeltsin" in the interest of "global security." Although the article noted that the "strategic partnership" is "far from ideal," it nevertheless claimed that the "level of confidence" between the U.S. and Russian leadership "has no precedent."
