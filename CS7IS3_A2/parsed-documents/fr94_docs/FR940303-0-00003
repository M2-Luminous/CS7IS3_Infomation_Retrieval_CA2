FR940303-0-00003 FR940303-0-00001 The Citrus Administrative Committee (committee) met November 16, 1993, and unanimously recommended this action. The committee meets prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis for citrus fruit regulated under the order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Section 905.140 (7 CFR 905.140) provides the terms and conditions under which handlers can ship fruit in gift packages exempt from handling regulations in effect under §§905.52 and 905.53 of the order. Certain gift fruit packages are exempted from such regulations, since they contain fruit of mixed varieties and non-fruit items, and thus, would not meet the grade and size requirements of the handling regulations. Prior to the effective date of the interim rule (58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993), handlers could only ship one or two gift packages per day exempt from such regulations, depending on the circumstances, to individuals and distributors. The interim final rule increased the number of gift packages of fruit which handlers can ship under this exemption provision, enabling handlers to ship an unlimited number of packages of gift fruit to individuals and distributors, provided certain safeguards are met by the handler of the fruit. These safeguards specify that each gift package must be individually addressed to the person using the fruit, and that gift packages shipped to any gift fruit distributor must either be individually addressed or marked ``not for resale''. The interim final rule was effective on December 9, 1993, and published in the Federal Register (58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending January 14, 1994, and no comments were received. This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to relax the exemption provisions for gift fruit shipments as specified. Such relaxation will enable handlers to ship more packages of gift fruit to meet consumer needs, exempt from grade and size requirements issued under the order. This action is in the interest of producers, handlers, distributors, and consumers, and is expected to increase returns to Florida citrus fruit growers. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on Florida citrus fruit producers and handlers, since it will permit the industry to make additional gift fruit available to meet consumer needs. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee, and other information, it is found that the relaxation as set forth below will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 905 Grapefruit, Marketing agreements, Oranges, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Tangelos, Tangerines. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 905 is amended as follows: PART 905_ORANGES, GRAPEFRUIT, TANGERINES, AND TANGELOS GROWN IN FLORIDA 1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 905 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674. 2. Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 part 905, which was published in the Federal Register at 58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993, is adopted as a final rule without change. Dated: February 24, 1994. Robert C. Keeney, Deputy Director, Fruit and Vegetable Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4819 Filed 3&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P
