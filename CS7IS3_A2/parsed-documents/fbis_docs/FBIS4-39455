Our country became a symbol of detente between East and West, a bulwark of peace against war. Since the demise of the Soviet Union, democratic Russia has shown great interest in preserving neutral Austria's traditional peace role. "Stay as you are -- a neutral country in the heart of Europe, which, with its active policy of neutrality, has made an important contribution to peace in Europe for decades and will continue to do so. You are an asset for more security in Europe!" This conviction is advocated by one of Russia's great intellectual pioneers, Professor Vitaliy Churkin, director of the Europe Institute in Moscow. In an exclusive interview for NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG Prof. Churkin appeals to us Austrians not to let ourselves "be persuaded by anyone" to give up our neutrality because it is outdated and does not have any value in peace times anymore. The opposite is true. In particular in the middle of Europe's gigantic upheaval our neutral Austria continues to play "a central role in Europe's newly developing security system." In the interview with NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG, Russia's great European strategist cites three reasons why Austria should "keep its active neutrality policy": Military Asset Neutral countries are states with low armament. Thus, they are "demilitarized zones" without super armament. They do not emanate any military danger. Neutral states with few weapons therefore do not pose any danger of war and mean more security for all Europeans in East and West. Strategic Asset Neutral countries like Austria are also buffer zones. They are located like buffers between areas of tension, conflicts, and wars -- for instance on the fringe of the war hell in the Balkans. If the neutrals were taken out of the new Europe, enormous contradictions, which still exist on our continent, would threaten to clash directly -- without buffers, without safeguards, without brakes. The results would be the escalating danger of direct confrontations in Europe. Diplomatic Asset "Europe still needs venues for meetings, for dialogues, and for mediation, such as neutral Austria," Prof. Churkin insists. If such diplomatic oases of neutrality did not exist, one would practically have to invent them to banish war in Europe once and for all. Prof. Churkin also sees a central role for neutral Austria in the newly developing security system in Europe. Russia's intellectual pioneer for Europe stresses that the new peace system must be supported diplomatically above all by the CSCE. Even though it is lagging behind in development, it should play the main role. NATO should become the backbone, but is "still too highly armed" and must transform itself "more quickly than in the past" from a military alliance to the supporter of a new security system. "Austria should become a center of the new global security system in Europe," Vitaliy Churkin told NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG in an exclusive interview. He does not yet want to commit himself to details. However, he advocates that Vienna become the seat of important institutions, such as a European Security Council or a military committee. Vienna is already the CSCE center for the prevention of conflicts, disarmament, security, and for more trust between East and West.
