"All this can be easily checked against bank documents. As for Aleksey Zuyev, elected deputy of the State Duma from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, he never worked for GMM and no work agreements were concluded with him. The position of "adviser to the president," he indicated, has never existed in the company...." According to our information, GMM will take action against Mikhail Leontyev and the newspaper SEGODNYA tomorrow. At this stage the firm plans to hold a series of consultations with the Central Bank, which has suspended GMM operations. Mr. Shakhovtsov, head of the Central Bank banking supervision section, has said that in the absence of legislation on trust companies, the operation of GMM pertains equally to that of a trust and of a banking company. In Zhirinovskiy's headquarters, it was said to our request for comments on the situation that the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia absolutely did not care about GMM's problems, and that the party was busy devising plans to destroy Germany, which had refused its leader an entry visa.
