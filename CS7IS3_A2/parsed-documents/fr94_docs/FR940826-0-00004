FR940826-0-00004 FR940826-0-00001 The language in §§905.146, 905.147, 905.148 concerning Certificates of Privilege is being revised for clarity, and procedural safeguards are being added to §905.147(c) dealing with suspensions or denials of Certificates of Privilege. This rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to finalize the revised exemption provisions for special purpose shipments, as specified. The Department's view is that this rule may have a beneficial impact on growers and shippers of organic citrus fruit. Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. chapter 35], the information collection requirements that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0094. This action will reduce the reporting burden on approximately 95 receivers of special purpose shipments of Florida citrus completing a section of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form, taking about .04 hour to complete each report. After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the Federal Register [59 FR 26927, May 25, 1994] will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 905 Grapefruit, Marketing agreements, Oranges, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Tangelos, Tangerines. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 905 is amended as follows: PART 905_ORANGES, GRAPEFRUIT, TANGERINES, AND TANGELOS GROWN IN FLORIDA Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR Part 905 which was published at FR 59 26927, on May 25, 1994, is adopted as a final rule without change. Dated: August 22, 1994. Eric M. Forman, Deputy Director, Fruit and Vegetable Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21085 Filed 8&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;02&hyph;P
