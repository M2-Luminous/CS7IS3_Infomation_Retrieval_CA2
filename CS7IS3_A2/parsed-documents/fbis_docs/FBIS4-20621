In 1992, Toyota introduced a new 1.6 l DOHC 4-valve lean burn engine to Japanese market, which was adaptable to medium class vehicle and vehicle with automatic transmission. In this paper, a comparison is made between Toyota's previous lean burn engine and the new one. Further description is given upon fuel economy and exhaust emission performances of new lean burn engine, which are achieved through technologies such as a new intake port design and a new lean mixture feedback control system with combustion pressure sensor. 1. Introduction Reduction of fuel consumption has been attracting much attention in viewpoint of energy saving and prevention of global warming. In such a background, many engines adopt the system in which the air-fuel ratio is controlled in the window gate of 3-way catalyst. This system is very effective in reducing the exhaust emission, but leaves a room for improvement in terms of fuel consumption because the air-fuel ratio is controlled at the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. A lean burn engine is attracting attention as a means to reduce both the exhaust emission and the fuel consumption.[.sup]1,2[/] Toyota Motor Corporation has long been studying the lean burn engine and has introduced several lean-burn engines[.sup]3,4[/] into the market since 1984 (Figure 1). Figure 1. History of Toyota Lean-Burn Engine Development In this paper, we will clarify the problems with the previous lean burn engines and report a new lean burn engine we have developed for solving such problems. 2. Basic Construction of Lean Burn System Figure 2 shows the principle of satisfying the requirements of low fuel consumption and NO[.sub]x[/] emission in the lean burn engine. When the conventional engine is operated with a lean air fuel ratio, the NO[.sub]x[/] regulation standard cannot be satisfied within the allowable torque fluctuation limit. If the following problems are solved, improvement of fuel consumption can be attained while satisfying the NO[.sub]x[/] regulation standard within the allowable torque fluctuation limit: (1) Combustion improvement in lean mixture conditions (2) Precise control of air fuel ratio in lean mixture conditions Figure 2. Principle of Lean-Burn System 3. Outline of Previous Lean Burn Engine and Existing Problems 3.1 Outline of Previous Lean Burn Engine Figure 3 shows the construction of the 4-valve, 4-cylinder, 1587 cc engine system for Europe (satisfying German exhaust emission control annex 23) used as the base for development. This is different from the conventional three-way catalyst system in the three following points: (1) Intake port with a swirl control valve (SCV) (Figure 4) With a partial load, the SCV is closed to make the intake air flow only in the helical passage to generate a swirl to attain lean burn, while the SCV is opened to attain a high output, with a high load. (2) Sequential injection control The injection timing is optimized to satisfy both the specified torque fluctuation and NO[.sub]x[/] emission. (3) Air-fuel ratio feedback control in lean mixture area by a lean mixture sensor A lean mixture sensor for detecting the air-fuel ratio from the oxygen concentration is adopted. It also serves as the O[.sub]2[/] by switching of the input circuit when the load is high. Figure 3. Previous System Construction Figure 4. Previous Intake Port 3.2 Fuel Consumption Improvement, NO[.sub]x[/] Emission and Problems Figure 5 shows the relationship between the NO[.sub]x[/] emission and fuel consumption in each test mode. The vehicle used for the test was a manual transmission (M/T) vehicle in European specification with an equivalent inertia weight of 1.25 ton. In the FTP-75 and EPA-HWY modes specified in Annex 23, the NO[.sub]x[/] regulation standard was satisfied while the fuel consumption is improved by 10 percent or more compared to that with the three-way catalyst system (stoichiometric mixture system). There, however, exists the following problems: (1) Enlargement of lean mixture area In the new EC mode (maximum speed: 120 km/h), NO[.sub]x[/] emission is relatively high and the fuel consumption improvement effect is relatively low. This is because the volumetric efficiency with closed SCV is low in the high speed area and relatively richer mixture is required to obtain the enough output. To reduce the NO[.sub]x[/] emission and improve the fuel consumption in the high speed range, it is necessary to enlarge the lean mixture area by increasing the intake air flow when the SCV is closed. (2) Reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] emission In the domestic 10-15 mode test, the fuel consumption is improved by about 10 percent as compared with the stoichiometric mixture system, but the NO[.sub]x[/] emission does not satisfy the standard. At present NO[.sub]x[/] purification by the catalyst is impossible in the lean mixture area, reduction of the NO[.sub]x[/] emission from the engine itself is necessary to realize the lean burn engine on a vehicle with automatic transmission (A/T) while satisfying the domestic standard. Figure 5. Comparison of NO[.sub]x[/] and Fuel 4. New Lean Burn Engine 4.1 System Outline The outline and performance of the new lean burn engine are to be reported here. The engine used for the test is planned to be mounted on M/T or A/T vehicle with an equivalent inertia weight of 1.25 ton while satisfying the domestic emission control standard (in 10-15 mode). Figure 6 shows the new system composition. The differences from the previous system are as follows: (1) Enlargement of lean mixture area by adoption of new intake port (2) Reduction of NO[.sub]x[/] emission by a new air-fuel mixture control system using a combustion pressure sensor (3) Improvement of fuel consumption in stoichiometric mixture area by adoption of electrically controlled EGR system (A/T vehicle) Figure 6. New System Construction 4.1.1 Structure of New Intake Port and Its Performance In the lean burn engine, improvement of combustion was realized by high in-cylinder turbulence such as swirl. The previous swirl intake port was designed to increase air flow velocity by restricting the cross section of the intake port (see Figure 4). In consequence, it was very difficult to satisfy both high volumetric efficiency and combustion improvement at a high engine speed when the SCV is closed. To overcome this problem, a new intake port for 4 valves has been developed as shown in Figure 7. This port consists of a helical port and straight port which are almost separated. The helical port has a projecting wall for swirl generation. A two-hole type injector is adopted and placed downstream the SCV. With a partial load, the SCV is closed and the intake air flows mainly through the helical port to generate a swirl. A part of the flow is led through the connecting passage between the helical port and straight port and generates a high speed flow for atomization of the fuel on the straight port side. While the fuel was atomized and homogenized by a strong swirl (swirl ratio: 2.2) in the previous intake port, the new intake port adopts the fuel supply system with relatively low swirl ratio of 1.7 to 1.8 to realize lean burn. As a result, the constriction of the intake port can be relaxed to attain high volumetric efficiency when the SCV is closed, and to increase the intake air flow by 45 percent. Figure 7. New Intake Port We have compared the performance of the new intake port with that of the previous intake port. Figure 8 shows the comparison of the partial load performance in the lean mixture area with that of the previous intake port. The combustion performance is equivalent or superior to those with the previous intake port. It has also been found that the improvement of the lean mixture limit is effective for the improvement of the limit of dilution of the mixture by the EGR gas. Figure 9 compares the lean mixture area. The lean mixture area is greatly enlarged by adoption of the new intake port, and is wide enough to cover a practical cruising area in Japan. It also shows that the full load performance is much improved. Figure 8. Lean-Burn Performance Figure 9. Comparison of Lean Mixture Area and Full Load Performance 4.1.2 Lean Mixture Limit Air-Fuel Ratio Feedback Control With Combustion Pressure Sensor The target air-fuel ratio in the feedback control with the lean mixture sensor should be set with a margin on the rich side from the lean mixture limit in consideration of dispersion of the sensor or engine and the weather conditions (Figure 2). Reduction of this margin will enable the NO[.sub]x[/] emission to be reduced. For this purpose, a new air fuel ratio feedback control system using a combustion pressure sensor has been developed. In this system, air fuel ratio is controlled to maintain the torque fluctuation at the specified level by detecting the lean mixture limit or torque fluctuation limit directly from the combustion state. Figure 10 shows the structure of the combustion pressure sensor. The combustion pressure is transmitted from the diaphragm to the force detecting device via the ceramic rod and hemisphere. The force detective device converts the pressure into the voltage by the piezoelectric effect. This signal is output after amplification by the built-in amplifier. Figure 10. Structure of Combustion Pressure Sensor In this system, the combustion pressure sensor is installed only at cylinder No. 1. The control method is explained below. (1) Calculating the torque substitution value (T) The value substituting the torque can be calculated according to the following equation by measuring the combustion pressure sensor signal near the end of the intake stroke (P[.sub]0[/]) and at the specified crank angle in the expansion stroke (P[.sub]1[/]-P[.sub]4[/]) as shown in Figure 11. T = _a_[.sub]1[/](P[.sub]1[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) + _a_[.sub]2[/](P[.sub]2[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) + _a_[.sub]3[/](P[.sub]3[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) + _a_[.sub]4[/](P[.sub]4[/] - P[.sub]0[/]) where _a_[.sub]j[/] is the pressure-torque conversion coefficient with the crank angle as the parameter. Figure 11. Study on Torque Substitution Value Figure 11 shows the good correlation between the torque substitution value obtained by this method and the brake torque. (2) Calculating torque fluctuation [_D_T] Calculate the average of the absolute difference between the preceding and current torque substitution values over N times of measurements. (3) Air-fuel ratio control Fuel injection time TAU is corrected according to the result of comparison between _D_T and criterion _b_. F[.sub]i[/] = F[.sub]i - 1[/] + _g_(_D_T - _b_) TAU = F[.sub]i[/]-TP _g_: Constant (positive value) F[.sub]i[/]: Fuel injection time correction term TP: Basic injection time Figure 12 shows the feedback controllability by this method. This figure shows the case where the lean or rich signal is input forcibly. Figure 12. Feedback Controllability In either case, the degree of convergence to the target torque fluctuation level (criterion _b_) has been confirmed sufficient. Criterion _b_ here is determined according to the allowable surge level actually felt on the vehicle. As a result of the lean mixture limit feedback control, it has become possible to reduce the NO[.sub]x[/] by about 30 percent as shown in Figure 8, with the fuel consumption ratio remained in the same level. 4.1.3 Electrically Controlled EGR System The EGR driven by a stepping motor has been adopted for A/T vehicle to improve the fuel consumption in stoichiometric mixture area frequently used in acceleration (Figure 13). Figure 13. EGR Valve Structure As compared with the conventional EGR system, the new system has good EGR controllability near to the limit. And it allows EGR to be possible even in the high load area while the intake manifold pressure is low, because new system does not need a vacuum source for valve operation. As a result, improvement in fuel consumption is obtained as shown in Figure 14. Figure 14. Effect of Electrically Controlled EGR System 4.2 Effect of Fuel Consumption Improvement As compared with the conventional three-way catalyst system engines, the new lean burn engine has been confirmed to bring about improvement of the fuel consumption by 9 to 11 percent, both in the 10-15 mode and at a constant speed of 60 km/h as shown in Figure 15 while satisfying the NO[.sub]x[/] regulation standard. Figure 15. Effect of Fuel Consumption Improvement 5. Conclusion (1) A new intake port satisfying both lean burn and high output up to the high intake air volume area has been developed. (2) The NO[.sub]x[/] emission has been reduced by introduction of lean combustion limit feedback control using the combustion pressure sensor, allowing application of the lean burn engine to the 1.25 ton class and A/T vehicles. (3) The electrically controlled EGR system adopted in the A/T vehicles has successfully reduced fuel consumption in the stoichiometric mixture area. References 1.
