The demands encompasse a total of 12 items including deregulation of pension fund and off-shore markets and consolidation of licensing for advisors handling investment trusts and other regular investments. The question is, will such external pressure succeed in opening a way into Japanese financial markets which are considered closed in nature compared to those of other advanced nations and where the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is said to exercise immense authority? This short series of articles examines the nature of the U.S. demands, problem areas of the Japanese systems, and the outlook for deregulation. The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ) presented a report to the Japanese and U.S. governments which stated, "The interests of many Japanese citizens are being compromised in the management of pension funds." The ACCJ has prepared several documents of this nature since last year distributing them not only to agencies in Japan such as the MOF and Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW), but to the U.S. Treasury and influential members of Congress in a stepped-up effort to open the Japanese pension fund market. The foremost issue presented in these documents is the demand that investment advisers be allowed to participate in the management of public pension funds. The ACCJ assertion is concise. Presently, Japanese public pension funds can be managed only by trust banks and life insurance companies, but the documents assert that investment advisory firms which specialize in the management of stocks can manage such funds in a manner which provides a higher rate of return. Fiscal year 1992 returns on the welfare pension fund came were 5.86 percent (return on designated pension based on current market value) when managed by trust banks and 5.5 percent (return based on dividends paid on general accounts) when managed by life insurance companies. In contrast, investment advisers produced an average return of 6.65 percent. A portion of the public pension reserves of the national pension fund and welfare pension fund are managed by the Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation (PWSC). The PWSC borrows funds from the Funds Management Division of the MOF and contracts with life insurance companies and trust banks for the management of the funds. The total funds to be managed in fiscal year 1994 is roughly $23 trillion yen. If the rate of return were to improve one percent, assets would be enhanced by 230 billion yen. There are three ways to secure funds to stabilize long-term fiscal administration of pension funds. They include reductions in benefits, increases in insurance premiums and enhancement of returns through better management of funds. ACCJ stresses, "Enhancement of returns through better management by using investment advisers benefits the public, but revision of benefits or insurance premiums will not be in the interests of the public." An official of the MHW obliquely glared at the deregulation request from the U.S. side and cynically remarked, "I can't imagine that the MOF will cave into the request to allow participation by investment advisors in the management of pension funds." The MHW had requested approval to contract with investment advisors in connection with this fiscal year's budget request, but the MOF rejected the request. The MHW asserts that it would be illogical to approve the request under external pressure, in view of the disapproval in connection with the budget request. The excuse used by the MOF in rejecting the request was, "There is the question of maintaining safety in view of any absence of guarantee on the principal." Officials at the MHW were dissatisfied with the explanation saying, "It lacks persuasiveness." The reason is that although provisions do exist for inclusion of guarantees on principal in contracts with trust banks, such provisions are not included. The PWSC calculated the results of long-term management in order to demonstrate the ability to safeguard principal even when it is not guaranteed. The basis for calculating the returns from FY73 to FY93 was to devide dividends by the value of all stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during the period. The average annual rate of return for the 20 years was 9.65 percent and the assumption is that such a rate provides for coverage of any short-term risk. During the 20-year period, there were three years in which year-to-year declines in returns were suffered, with the largest decline being at 27.4 percent, but the long-term effects of such declines were minimal. If rates of return are calculated in five-year cycles, only two declines were found to have taken place and the rate of the decline was minimal at 7.1 percent. One informed official leaked behind-the-scenes information when he said, "It appears MOF officials reached the conclusion that pension fund markets may be opened in connection with the Japan-U.S. summit held in February." Reportedly, a memorandum had been prepared listing the assertions of the Japanese and U.S. governments to clarify the disputed points concerning the opening of pension fund markets. Suspension of the negotiations has resulted in a postponement, but it appears that the intention was for both governments to discuss the issue on the basis of the memorandum and for the prime minister to arrive at some sort of agreement during his visit to the United States. U.S. sources say, "The United States has prepared retaliatory legislation for the financial services sector and the European Union is ready to take coordinated action." They also point out that unlike the automotive issue, very few people would be injured as a result of the participation of investment advisors. The question now posed is, what actions should be taken to increase the source of pension benefits in the face of an aging society? It appears the MOF faces some difficult options.
