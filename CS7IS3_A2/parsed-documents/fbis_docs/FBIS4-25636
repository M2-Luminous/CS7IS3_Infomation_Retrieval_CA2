"The Chinese government and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY respect press freedom in Hong Kong," he said. "The problem of offending the Chinese government has never emerged." Speaking to journalists after the opening of the Dragon Boat Festival, Mr Wang said the Chinese government had often assured Hong Kong that it would enjoy press freedom after 1997. "Even if the news criticises the Chinese government, it is all right." But he said press freedom did not mean that journalists could fabricate reports. Commenting on the case of Xi Yang, the Ming Pao journalist who was sentenced to 12 years jail in Beijing in April, he said every journalist had to abide by the law. "If anyone, including journalists, offends the law, he will be punished," Mr Wang said. He also said the recent dispute between the ATV management and the editorial office was an internal ATV matter. "It is not related to press freedom," he said.
