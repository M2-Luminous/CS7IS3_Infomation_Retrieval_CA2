The Moslem-led Bosnian forces Sunday tried to cut the road linking the Croat-held enclaves of Vitez and Busovaca, but were pushed back by Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces, according to UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman. Clashes continued Monday with street fighting reported in the village of Buhine Kuce, on the southeastern outskirts of Vitez, according to HVO officials in Zagreb. The officials, quoted by HINA news agency, said the latest fighting had left at least eight dead and 35 wounded. Meanwhile, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and his Croatian counterpart Franjo Tudjman held further talks near Bonn Monday morning on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The talks, which began Sunday evening, were being held behind closed doors amid strict security. In Sarajevo, the airport remained closed to all but UNPROFOR flights Monday after renewed shelling of the tarmac Sunday morning. The shelling, attributed to the Serbs, delayed Izetbegovic's departure for Bonn. Speaking at the NATO summit in Brussels, US President Bill Clinton warned Monday that the western alliance should be prepared to implement threats of intervention in Bosnia if the situation there did not improve. Action and not rhetoric was needed to stop the "strangulation" of Sarajevo and other UN-declared "safe areas" in Bosnia, Clinton said on the first day of a two-day North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit. "Those who attack Sarajevo must understand that we are serious," he said, pointing the finger at the besieging Serb forces. France and other countries have been lobbying for NATO air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs, as threatened in August, to stop the shelling of Sarajevo. Meanwhile, one of the French humanitarian organisations engaged in providing relief aid to Sarajevo, Premiere Urgence, said Monday it would stop sending convoys to the Bosnian capital because besieging Serbs now demanded 50 percent of all aid provided in exchange for allowing trucks through. Speaking in Sarajevo, the new representative for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Kris Janowski, Monday outlined the plight of 75,000 Moslems trapped in another flashpoint -- Mostar, in the south of the country -- saying they were forced to live "like rats" in cellars under constant bombardment. Janowski, who had just returned from the city where Moslems and Croats are engaged in fierce fighting, said the Moslem-held city's eastern enclave had neither electricity nor drinking water. Inhabitants had to run a gauntlet of snipers to get water from the Neretva River which divides the city and the two warring sides, and it had so far proved impossible to get Croat authorization to bring in a water-purification unit. Food and medicine relief was getting through, but the Croats were doing their best to prevent the Moslems from getting other goods, including oil, the spokesman also said. Fortunately, the winter had so far proved mild, he added. Meanwhile, Sarajevo's OSLOBODJENJE newspaper Monday published an article praising the work done here by UN commander General Francis Briquemont, who recently asked to be relieved of his command after criticizing UN action. The "upright officer," who has spend six months here, could not agree to remain as a neutral observer, the paper said.
