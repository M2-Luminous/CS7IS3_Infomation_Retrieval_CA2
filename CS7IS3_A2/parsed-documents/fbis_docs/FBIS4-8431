The aggressor is intending to launch a massive onslaught from the direction of Ustipraca at the Gorazde defenders at (Borovik). With combined tank and infantry attacks with artillery support from (Vojkovici), the enemy is trying to capture the strategic points on this part of the free territory. According to all the information available, this would be the starting point for the chetniks to break through -- from the direction of Ustiprcaca -- the defense lines at the very access point to Gorazde. We also have information that the aggressor used chemical agents in the attacks on the defense lines. The aggressor has also used artillery to fire on convoys of refugees fleeing the burnt villages that the aggressor has captured in the offensive so far. We do not yet have information on the possible massacres of refugees heading for the town. The situation in Gorazde is extremely dramatic. Throughout the day the chetniks from the surrounding hills, from the right bank of the Drina River, fired with snipers, M-84s, and 82-mm mortars at the area of (Vitkovici), and from (Lug) the chetniks [words indistinct]. Many civilians have been killed and wounded. According to the latest intelligence information, the Serbian-Montenegrin fascists are carrying out extensive preparations for an even more intensive offensive on the free territory on the left bank of the Drina River. The full force of this offensive will be directed from the direction of Foca and the valley of the Praca River at (Ostanica), Orahovice, Bare, Jabucko Sedlo, (Trogrlo), and Ustipraca. The commanders of the latest chetnik offensive have been hurriedly bringing in new mercenaries, cutthroats, and other scum to this region.
