We have seen very horrible pictures from the occupied territories. Now, does that mean that this is the end of the negotiations with Israel, the end of the peace process? ['Arafat] Firstly, with all efforts with the Arabs, with the Muslims, with the nonaligned movement, with the Europeans, we want to have a strong resolution in the Security Council. Eleven days have passed without being able to achieve this result. I ask: Why? Because there is U.S. opposition, and U.S. support now of the Israeli point of view, especially concerning Jerusalem and concerning the international protection, the mechanism of this international protection. [Birand] Mr. Chairman, will you be going back to the negotiating table after this resolution? ['Arafat] I was informed by Mr. Christopher about the invitation which was offered to us by President Clinton. We are not against it, but first of all we have to protect our people. We have to give them tranquillity and security. [Birand] Yes, so if I understand correctly, you need from the Israeli side protection. ['Arafat] From the international, not only from the Israeli side. [Birand] And then you will start again negotiations, after you achieve this protection and after the UN Security Council passes a resolution? Is that correct? ['Arafat] Not only that. Are we going only to take pictures like the last time, or will we implement what has been agreed upon? Everyone is informed about the maneuvering of the Israelis. Till now they did not.... [pauses] They are trying to make time and not to implement what has been agreed upon and what has been signed in the White House. [Birand] Palestinians are accusing you of naively believing the Zionists. ['Arafat] This is not a personal matter. Of course, we all have opposition, and we are proud of our democracy, and everybody has the right to express openly his point of view against our will. As [name indistinct] has mentioned, God bless he who criticizes me. [Birand] Do you think that the peace process might again be revived, or do you think that it is over now? ['Arafat] You see, what is important now is that we are in need of international involvement, especially from the [word indistinct] Russia and the United States; from the European Union; and from our brothers, the Muslims; from our brothers, the Arabs; from our brothers, the Nonaligned Movement; from all our friends all over the world. We need their support, their strong and complete support so that our people can feel safe, secure, and the tranquillity of the peace process will be [word indistinct]. [Birand] Thank you very much.
