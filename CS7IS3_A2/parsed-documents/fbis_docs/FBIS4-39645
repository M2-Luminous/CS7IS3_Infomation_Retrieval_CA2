The Russian delegation is led by roving Ambassador Yuriy Dubinin. He arrived in the Ukrainian capital together with Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy. The admiral told ITAR-TASS on the eve of the trip, that the sides were able to switch over during their talks in Moscow and Sevastopol from verbal declarations to the concrete discussion of the difficult problem of drawing up a complete list of all the warships and other surface craft, and deciding where the Black Sea Navy and the Ukrainian naval forces should be based. This work will be continued in Kiev. He noted that the parameters, according to which the warships should be divided between the two sides, were already been determined. Working parallel with military experts are economists and financiers, who are estimating the cost of the ships and of the fleet's infrastructure. Their conclusions will be submitted to the two delegations. Gromov believes that both sides will table their own drafts during the negotiations. He does not rule out differences on individual matters, but believes that it is necessary to do everything to achieve mutual understanding.
