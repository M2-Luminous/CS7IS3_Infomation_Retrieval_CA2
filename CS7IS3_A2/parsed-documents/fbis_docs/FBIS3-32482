Lage, who is on the third day of his official visit to Brazil, gave a news conference that was attended by more than 20 domestic and foreign reporters at the Cuban ambassador's residence in that country. The vice president commented on the meeting with Franco at the Planalto Presidential Palace, saying they broached many issues related to the development of their countries' political and economic relations. He stressed that the Brazilian president reiterated his criticism of the U.S. blockade against the Caribbean island and the so-called Torricelli Law. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim expressed the same criticism yesterday. Although no agreements were signed during his visit, Lage said big possibilities had been opened to increase their bilateral ties. He explained that Cuba offers facilities to foreign investment, especially in the tourism sector. Businessmen who invest on the island, he pointed out, will recover their investments quickly. Lage and accompanying delegation will travel to Rio de Janeiro early tomorrow morning, where they will meet with local businessmen and political personalities.
