[Alarcon] I believe it brings them closer and has to do so more each day. Unfortunately, in this world where interrelations are growing, models are transposed, and concepts and preconceptions are disseminated by the movies and other means of mass media communication, many times when one thinks of a parliament, what comes to mind is some gentleman giving an address, or a group of people who debate issues, talk, are experienced in rhetoric, are persuasive, etc. This is purely a formal aspect, and I would add adjectival aspect, of what a parliament should be from the socialist or people's point of view. This is why I insist in calling it a system of the people's government, because the key is precisely to attain, as much as possible, the people's direct participation in their government. This is why out there some people still speak of the so-called representative democracy, which is a fiction because it limits the actual role of the people the moment they elect a representative to congress or a parliament. Many times, as you know, the one who wins the election is the one who has the greatest financial resources, the one who can afford television advertising, the one who can buy votes; in the end, the one who has the most power. How many times are the people part of the work of that legislator? How many times do the people have anything to do with what the legislator does? They see their legislator on television giving an occasional address or hear from him during an electoral campaign. In our case, we seek, have to seek, and can achieve, precisely because of the characteristics of our society, making the relationship between the voters and their government or parliamentary system as constant as possible, as daily as possible, as real and natural as possible. I believe that this is possible -- pardon the redundancy. It is possible in a true socialism and it is impossible in other societies. [Batista] I would like to discuss the issue of the forthcoming union meetings. You were saying that the delegates have been asked to get involved in these meetings, to be present. They are going to be very busy. Many people wonder, because they see that the ANPP meets twice a year for two days of work at the Convention Center. However, our delegates are not professionals; they are comrades who have other jobs. With this I want to say that our people have to understand that that delegate is a working individual and that the ANPP works all year long. I would like you to expand on this. [Alarcon] I believe that what you say is true. Many examples could be given, such as when the ANPP discussed the issue of energy on June. Prior to this, we had created a special committee to oversee that issue. This committee organized a series of nationwide activities, not only the meetings it held as a committee -- the member delegates of that committee -- but an entire program of meetings of the provincial and municipal assemblies, and also at the People's Council level. Among their activities nationwide -- not every deputy visited every site -- they visited various production centers and major institutions involved with the issue of energy. They held a total of 8,081 visits where they met with workers, enterprise managers, technicians, etc., to discuss local energy problems. Figure out how many hours, how many work days those delegates spent on this issue before the ANPP spent one work day on its discussion. I believe that, in terms of man-hours, it is more than any discussion on any issue by any parliament in the world. [Batista] There is one thing that worries me. You have been explaining, as did Pedro Ross, that we need these debates on economic problems. What level of information are the masses, the workers going to receive about the main aspects to be discussed? Or are they going to find out at the time of the meeting? Is there a plan to begin to disseminate information to the people on the main issues to be discussed? How is this going to be carried out? [Alarcon] The comrades of the labor movement are preparing to organize this program from their perspective. We believe that it is important for each of these debates to be accompanied or preceded by information presented by their respective leaderships: in other words, a series of facts or opinions by the leaders at each work center, which should be explained to the workers, logically, prior to the beginning of the process of assembly. This is a very specific, locally oriented effort. There are going to be tens of thousands of these meetings. However, they should be properly organized. We have insisted on this to the delegates. It is not a matter of meeting for the sake of meeting but to prepare the meeting well, adequately to collect the information and necessary data so that everyone has a better chance to understand the specific situation they are going to debate. [Godoy] Has a date been set for the special meeting of the ANPP to continue discussion of the national finance situation? [Alarcon] The response is short: Not yet. [laughter] [Batista] Finally: At times one reads in the newspapers and hears in the radio that 1993 was the worst year of the special period. Does this means that 1994 will be better? What is your opinion? [Alarcon] I believe we should make every effort to ensure that 1993 keeps its title in history as the worst year, the most difficult we have ever confronted. I believe that it lies within us, with the exception of natural calamities or unforeseen events. We live in a world full of new and unpredictable problems; but assuming that nothing extraordinary of a natural or manmade nature occurs, we are able to affirm that beginning with 1994, modestly, step by step, without spectacular results, we will be able to reverse the situation Cuba has been facing. I believe that there are many fields in which this is possible. Once again I must mention the sugarcane harvest. It is possible to achieve a more efficient harvest through the committed efforts of all those involved in this activity and everyone not directly involved but who can support it. There is the whole movement of the sugarcane and nonsugarcane farming cooperatives and the entire effort to increase food and cane production through them. There are also efforts to reduce the budget deficit, the subsidies that these sectors receive, and thereby to help heal our national finances. This is another specific example. There are also prospects in other sectors in which the Cuba is making progress, such as tourism which is growing at a faster rate than that seen in other countries catering to tourism. In other words, there are real possibilities within our reach. However, the key to ensuring that 1994 will be better lies in our will to achieve this and in everyone's capacity to organize and channel that will. I believe that we have returned to the same theme, the underlying theme, the core issue of our entire conversation. The key lies in organizing and channeling the collective effort of the people in specific and general terms in each place; the trust in that people, which has provided abundant proof of its capacity to resist. I am convinced that when the end of 1994 approaches, we will be able to look back and see that through our efforts we are effectively overcoming the crisis.
