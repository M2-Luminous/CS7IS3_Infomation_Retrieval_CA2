FR940602-2-00125 FR940602-2-00080 Applicants' Representations 1. The Funds are open-end management investment companies. Each Fund other than Fortis Fiduciary Fund and Fortis Growth Fund is organized as a series investment company and is authorized to issue its shares in more than one series. Fortis Fiduciary Fund and Fortis Growth Fund currently are authorized to issue only one series of shares. The Adviser serves as the investment adviser of each Fund. The Underwriter serves as the principal underwriter of the shares of each Fund. 2. The Fortis Money Fund series of Fortis Money Portfolios offers one class of shares at net asset value without the imposition of a FESC or CDSC. Each of the other Funds offers one class of shares at net asset value plus a front-end sales charge (``FESC'') in connection with investments of up to $1 million. Investments of $1 million or more are not subject to a FESC, but rather a CDSC, which is permitted by the Prior Order. 1 1 Fortis Advantage Portfolios, Inc., et al., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 19264 (February 11, 1993) (notice) and 19320 (March 9, 1993) (order), that permitted applicants to eliminate the FESC, and impose a CDSC, on sales of shares in the amount of $1 million or more. The CDSC may be in an amount of up to 1% and will be imposed only on shares redeemed within a period of up to 24 months after purchase. A. Variable Pricing System 1. Applicants, on behalf of themselves and future investment companies for which the Adviser, or any person controlled by or under common control with the Adviser, may serve as investment adviser, or for which the Underwriter, or any person controlled by or under common control with the Underwriter, may serve as principal underwriter, request an order that would permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of shares and to assess a CDSC. The order would supersede the Prior Order and would permit the Funds to impose CDSC schedules that may be different from the one described in that order. 2. Under applicants' proposal, the Funds could offer classes of shares either: (a) Subject to a FESC (with respect to investments of less than $1 million) or a CDSC (with respect to investments of $1 million or more) and subject to a 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan (``Class A shares''); 2 (b) subject to a CDSC (expected to range from 4% on redemptions made during the first two years following purchase to 1% on redemptions made during the sixth year), a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan with a service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% and a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75% of average daily net assets, and an automatic conversion to Class A after a certain period of time (``Class B shares''); (c) subject to a CDSC (expected to be 1% on redemptions made during the first two years following purchase), a rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% and a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75% of average daily net assets (``Class C shares''); (d) subject to a FESC, a rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets (``Class D shares''); (e) subject to a FESC (with respect to investments of less than $1 million) or a CDSC (with respect to investments of $1 million or more) but not subject to rule 12b&hyph;1 fees (``Class E shares''); 3 (f) without a FESC or CDSC, but subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily net assets, for purchase exclusively by investors meeting such minimum investment and/or other eligibility requirements established by applicants (``Class Y shares''); and (g) without any sales or service charges for purchase exclusively by the Adviser, the Underwriter, certain agents and affiliates of the Adviser and Underwriter, and officers, directors, and employees of such entities (``Class Z shares''). The Funds also may establish one or more additional classes to be sold with different sales loads and service and distribution fee structures. 2 Applicants contemplate that existing shares of the Funds will be designated Class A shares upon implementation of the multi-class structure (except that existing shares of those Funds that do not currently have a 12b&hyph;1 plan will be designated Class E). 3 Applicants anticipate that Class E shares would be implemented for each of the Funds that currently have no rule 12b&hyph;1 plan. If a Fund offers Class E shares, all existing shares would become Class E shares. Sales of Class E shares would be available only to those investors who were holders of a Fund's shares at the time of implementation of the multi-class structure. 3. Class B shares of a Fund held for a specified number of years will convert automatically to Class A shares of such Fund at the relative net asset values of each of the classes. 4 For purposes of calculating the holding period, Class B shares will be deemed to have been issued on the sooner of: (a) The date on which the issuance of Class B shares occurred; or (b) for Class B shares obtained through an exchange, or a series of exchanges, the date on which the issuance of the original Class shares occurred. 4 Applicants currently contemplate that Class B shares will be the only class of shares that automatically convert to another class of shares, except that upon the initial offering of Class Y and/or Class Z shares of any Fund, applicants may provide that shareholders of such Fund who would qualify for investment in Class Y or Class Z shares would automatically convert into Class Y or Class Z shares, as applicable. 4. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares are also Class B shares. However, for purposes of conversion to Class A, all Class B shares in a shareholder's Fund account that were purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares (and which have not converted to Class A shares) will be considered to be held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares in the shareholder's Fund account (other than those in the sub-account) convert to Class A, a pro rata portion of the Class B shares then in the sub-account also will convert to Class A. The portion will be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's Class B shares converting to Class A bears to the shareholder's total Class B shares not acquired through dividends and distributions. 5. A class of shares will be exchangeable only for shares of the corresponding class of other Funds. all exchanges between Funds will comply with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act. 6. The classes of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and will be identical in all respects except: (a) Each class would have a different designation; (b) each class may bear any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan payments related to that class (and any other costs related to obtaining shareholder approval of the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan for that class or an amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan); (c) each class may bear expenses determined by the board of directors to be allocated to that class, which are set forth in condition 1 below; (d) only shareholders of the affected classes would be entitled to vote on matters pertaining to the rule 12b&hyph;1 plan relating to their respective class in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1; (e) each class would have different exchange privileges; and (f) classes that impose a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee may convert into another class.
