Premier Edouard Balladur wrote to European leaders arguing that the two issues should come within the compass of the WTO, a communique by Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said. The communique, released after a ministerial meeting chaired by Balladur, said the WTO should "deal with issues affecting international trade such as the environment and workers' rights." Setting up an environment committee has already been agreed, but many countries, in particular developing countries, are opposed to creation of a committee on social issues, including workers' rights. In the communique, Longuet said it was Europe's duty "to promote economic and social development and to defend human rights, in particular those of the individual at work" when setting up international trade rules and mechanisms.
