In his view, Russia alone can guarantee stability in the region. "The Crimea cannot be rescued outside an alliance with Russia or peaceful reintegration into our historic Motherland," he said. Bagrov also said that a campaign designed to discredit the Russian Party of the Crimea and himself as a candidate had been launched in the runup to the presidential elections that are scheduled to be held in the Crimea on January 16. He complained that once he refused to drop out of the presidential race or call on his supporters to vote for another candidate, "certain political forces resorted to psychological terror" against him threatening to kill him, his family and friends. The Russian Party leader thinks that the opponents of a Russian Crimea will not stop at criminal methods. He said: "I had to call officially on the state authorities of the Crimean Republic, Ukraine and the Russian Federation to prevent turning the Crimean general elections into a pretext for political terror or violence which could provoke an explosion or armed conflict."
