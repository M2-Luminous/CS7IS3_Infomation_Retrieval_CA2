The main purpose of the negotiations is to air views on the conditions for resuming talks set by the United States--these include the enforcement of macroeconomic measures such as tax reduction, and the setting of objective criteria to measure the degree of market liberalization. The negotiations are expected to deal with a range of issues, including a possible compromise agreement to set objective criteria only on government procurements. Efforts to converge views will be hastened at working-level negotiations so that the framework talks may resume before the Japan-U.S. summit in July. The government will send Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy vice minister for foreign affairs, and Suzaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister for international trade and industry, to the preliminary negotiations in Washington, and they will begin informal meetings with U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor and Deputy USTR Charlene Barshefsky to find a breakthrough to the impasse in the framework talks. They will hear specific explanations of three U.S.-demanded conditions, including macroeconomic measures and clarification of the purpose of the framework talks, and will present Japan's responses to them. They will probe to uncover the real intention of the United States, whose position on macroeconomic measures can be interpreted as having softened somewhat. The focus of the negotiations will be the search for a compromise on the question of setting objective criteria. Since U.S. President Clinton declared "we are not seeking numerical targets," Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa has proposed setting "some kind of quantum [ryoteki] criteria which would not lead to actual numerical targets." Negotiations will concentrate on this issue, though also discuss ways to expand imports of foreign commodities and services into Japan. Of the three priority areas of government procurement, automobiles and auto parts, and insurance, Japan feels government procurements is one in which deregulation on access procedures has made progress, and see agreement near to realization. Japan is expected to propose the idea of setting criteria in the area of government procurement first. It will also try to steer the United States toward a compromise by presenting a "step-by-step approach" to deal with the question of setting criteria in the areas of insurance and automobiles and auto parts. As far as macroeconomic measures are concerned, Japan will seek the understanding of the United States by announcing its intention to continue reducing income taxes into next year and beyond. The United States is concerned lest the current delay in finding a breakthrough in Japan-U.S. economic relations leads the dollar to lose value further and long-term interest rates to rise. The U.S. attitude toward Japan appears to have softened on the surface at least, but Japan wants to know its "true intentions" under the surface. It also wants to exchange information to help determine whether demands are acceptable.
