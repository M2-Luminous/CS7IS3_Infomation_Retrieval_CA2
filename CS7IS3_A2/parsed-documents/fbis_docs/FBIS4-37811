Ruling party stalwart Alick Aluvihare was sworn in as minister of Public Administration, the job he refused Friday after his Shipping and Ports ministry was given to a newcomer. Officials said Wijetunga's United National Party (UNP) had been concerned over opposition moves to woo Aluvihare ahead of presidential elections due later this year.
