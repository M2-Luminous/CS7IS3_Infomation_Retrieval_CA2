The Crimean economy has been drawn into the general economic crisis that has gripped all the former CIS countries, but this crisis is particularly dramatic in Russia and Ukraine. Inflation is galloping ahead in Ukraine; it is a particular feature of the Ukrainian economy, a particular feature of its leadership because of specific stances taken by the leaders and senior officials in the Council of Ministers and the bank, the people who make these kinds of decisions. Last year, as you know, the Russian ruble depreciated to one-tenth of its value and the karbovanets to one-hundredth of its value. When you have this kind of depreciation of the currency, you get a very rapid drop in the standard of living for workers in the public sector, first and foremost, and the pensioners. Social tension increases sharply. The incomes of Crimean people have diverged from, and not overtaken, those of their neighbors across the Kerch strait, from Krasnodar Kray. All of this has given rise to great discontent with Crimea being part of Ukraine, to calls for Crimea to join the ruble zone and so on. Analysis of the situation of Crimea demonstrates, moreover, that Crimean industry and agriculture were set up first and foremost to trade with Russia and Crimean industrial enterprises. Crimea has a lot of top-class enterprises that received large sums of capital investment even in the stagnation years and are now lying idle. These enterprises were oriented towards trading with Russia and obtaining materials from Russia. As economics minister, I have already had several trips to Kiev for consultations with the leadership of Ukraine on the reforms in Crimea. It is clear to us that any steps we might take can only be done with the good will of Ukraine. Moreover, certain steps were very well received by Ukraine, not well in the sense that somebody approved these steps in themselves, but in the sense that there was a view that these kinds of things needed to be done in Ukraine -- in particular, currency regulation. The fixed rate of the karbovanets is a colossal obstacle to getting Ukraine out of crisis. And now, as far as I know, Ukraine itself has made a decision to move to a floating exchange rate. Crimea is a unique region in terms of its natural resources and its geographic situation, and we certainly need bolder economic solutions for Crimea, in my view. [Gavrilov] That means you're saying there could be a free economic zone set up here, like many that have been set up. I believe such proposals have, in outline, been made? [Chernyavskiy] Yes, we have come across such projects. You couldn't really make the whole of Crimea a free economic zone, because these zones are set up in areas where there are open spaces away from the inhabitants. Well, Crimea has developed industry and developed agriculture cooperatives actively with Ukraine and we are therefore not looking to set up a free economic zone. We are talking about the possiblity of implementing economic reforms more rapidly than Ukraine in the areas of currency regulation, of having a more active program of attracting foreign capital into Crimea. Many investors say they would put money into Crimea, but the stability question wipes out their intentions. Crimea and Ukraine have a difficult relationship on the question of allocating central credit resources to Crimea. One could generalize and say credit allocation in Ukraine is not quite normal and is reminiscent of Russia at the start of 1992. All in all, everything in Ukraine reminds me of our Russian history of two or three years ago. However, in the area of finance and credit, Russia has made tangible steps forward in those years and has to some extent succeeded in setting up and stabilizing a new finance and credit system. I see that in Russia now there is no great difference between the Central Bank of Russia bank rate and that of commercial lending rates. In Ukraine there is this difference. [Gavrilov] A lot of people are now talking about the Saburov team, Saburov's Moscow team, and you're a full member of that team. Can you tell me, please, what this team is? Is it people who just happen to be there or are they all people of like mind who knew each other before? [Chernyavskiy] This idea arose because President Yuriy Meshkov invited Saburov in effect to be prime minister of Crimea, and Saburov then decided to invite in several people from Moscow to be able to implement a certain agreed policy. [Gavrilov] Do you notice the effect that people say that Moscow invaders are coming in to get Crimea's economy to pick up? One hears rejoinders that "they" have lived in Moscow with their offices of economists and academics. [Chernyavskiy] Professionally, I don't personally believe anybody is pushing me in Crimea, and it has always been the case that there have been a lot of people in the natural sciences coming here. If you're talking about economic centers, economic institutions, one's own economic school, there is none of that in Crimea. [Gavrilov] Tell me, is it going to be hard for you and your Moscow friends to come here and work? [Chernyavskiy] Yes, of course, it has been quite a drastic step and, of course, it is very difficult work. Moreover, we have taken a very big drop in income because officials are poorly paid in Crimea by Russian standards. For the time being I still see my mission in Crimea as interesting. [Gavrilov] You won't run away? [Chernyavskiy] That's a good question. When we came to Crimea in February, I and probably all members of the team started to look at Crimean problems from the standpoint of Crimea and... [broadcast of interview ends] [Gavrilov] That was Crimean Economics Minister Andrey Chernyavskiy.
