The chances of an agreement before the summit are "50-50," the Finance Ministry official said when briefing reporters on the two- day talks that started Tuesday. The working-level talks which he described as an agreement-drafting session will continue until midnight, and both sides are to meet again in Washington next week, the official said. "We won't reach agreement today," he said, noting that the two sides remain "far apart" especially on objective criteria, Japan's "keiretsu" mutual stockholding business relations and the "third sector." Insurance business is one of the three priority areas under the bilateral talks to create a new trade framework, along with automobile and auto parts, and Japanese Government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. "Both sides must compromise," the official said, dismissing any intention on Japan's part of yielding unilaterally in seeking agreement in the insurance field before the summit. On objective criteria, both sides presented their proposals which were at "the opposite ends" of the definition agreed upon in May to restart the stalled framework talks, the official said. The May agreement was to adopt both quantitative and qualitative yardsticks for each of the negotiation sectors instead of imposing overall numerical targets. Regarding the issue of the third sector that combines the benefits of both nonlife and casualty insurance businesses, Japan is rejecting U.S. demands for postponement by five years of Tokyo's lifting of a market ban. Japan currently allows only foreign-affiliated insurers to sell third-sector policies but is considering lifting the ban on Japanese insurers in two years under a law revision scheduled for submission to the Diet next year for the first time in five decades. The third sector is expected to remain on the table "until the last moment" of an overall accord on the insurance business, the official said.
