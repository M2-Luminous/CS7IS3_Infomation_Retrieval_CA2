FR941219-1-00039 FR941219-1-00015 3. Pendulum Impact Test Section 1&hyph;18(f)(2) of NGV2 sets forth a pendulum impact test which evaluates a container's ability to withstand a sharp external blow. NHTSA is proposing to adopt the pendulum impact test in NGV2 with some minor modifications. The agency's adoption of these performance requirements and test conditions is set forth in sections S7.9 and S8.9 of this notice's regulatory text. NGV2 specifies that ``The tests shall be made on the points of the container which are regarded as vulnerable. The points regarded as vulnerable are those which are most exposed or weakest having regard to the shape of the container and/or the way in which it is installed on the vehicle.'' NHTSA has decided to propose modifying this provision since it is not objective. Instead, the agency is proposing to require that the pendulum impact test be conducted at ``any point and any angle.'' NHTSA anticipates that to be able to certify compliance with the requirement, manufacturers would direct the test impacts to the container's most vulnerable points. Such a test procedure would be consistent with the regulatory language specified in Standard No. 301's moving contoured barrier test. The agency requests comments about whether such a test condition would be appropriate for pendulum impact testing of CNG containers. 4. Drop Test Section 1&hyph;18(g) of NGV2 sets forth a drop test, which evaluates a container's ability to withstand a blunt external blow. NHTSA is proposing to adopt the drop test in NGV2 with some minor modifications. The agency's adoption of these performance requirements and test procedures is set forth in sections S7.10 and S8.10 of this notice's regulatory text. As with NGV2, NHTSA is proposing to specify that a container be dropped at ambient temperature without internal pressurization or attached valves. In the test, the container is held in a horizontal position with the container's bottom 3.05 meters (10 feet) above the surface onto which it is dropped. Today's proposal, consistent with NGV2, specifies that the surface onto which the CNG container is dropped ``shall be a smooth, horizontal concrete pad or flooring.'' NHTSA notes that this definition of the surface is not fully objective. As an alternative, the agency is considering specifying that the surface be made of concrete that is at least four inches thick. NHTSA requests comments on this alternative, and on how the surface could otherwise be more objectively defined. G. Bonfire Test Fuel In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the fire for the bonfire tests be generated by No. 2 diesel fuel. This fuel type was proposed so that the standard would be consistent with the bonfire test in NGV2, which specifies this type of fuel. NGVC, CGA, AAMA, and Norris commented that the agency should specify a different fuel to generate a bonfire that is more environmentally sound. CGA stated that the large amounts of smoke that would be created by burning diesel fuel are contrary to the environmental objectives of developing CNG vehicles. NGVC and Norris suggested using a CNG or propane grill for the test. In the final rule, NHTSA decided to specify the use of No. 2 diesel fuel. The agency explained that it was aware of the environmental problems associated with this type of fuel and would further study whether other fuels should be used to generate the bonfire test. However, the agency stated that until it could determine that a different fuel is an appropriate (e.g., generates a fire of comparable heat and intensity) replacement for No. 2 diesel fuel, that fuel will be specified for generating the bonfire. NHTSA has decided to propose to amend the bonfire test conditions to allow alternative types of fuel, given the environmental difficulties resulting from No. 2 diesel fuel. One alternative would be to allow manufacturers to conduct the test with any fuel that generates a flame temperature equivalent to that of No. 2 diesel fuel. Under this alternative, any fuel that generates a flame temperature of 850 ○ to 900 ○ C (the flame temperature of No. 2 diesel fuel) for the duration of the test, would be permitted. To verify the flame temperature of 850 ○ to 900 ○ C for a period of 20 minutes, or until the container is fully vented or fails, three thermocouples would be located on the container's bottom, 102 mm above the fuel surface, as measured before the fire is started. The thermocouples would be placed so that one would be at the center of the container's bottom and one on each side of the container where the dome and sidewall intersect. NHTSA requests comments about the appropriateness of this alternative, including the use of flame temperature to define ``equivalence'' among fuel types. Would a different fuel characteristic such as Btu/lb be more appropriate? If a commenter believes that an alternative approach would be more appropriate, it should submit the test procedures associated with such an alternative. H. Labeling Requirements 1. CNG Containers a. Labeling information. In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to require that container manufacturers certify that each of their containers comply with the proposed equipment requirements by permanently labeling the container with the following information: The symbol ``DOT'' to constitute a certification by the manufacturer that the container conforms to all requirements of the standard; the date of manufacture of the container; the name and address of the container manufacturer; and the maximum service pressure. The agency stated that labeling the container would provide vehicle manufacturers and consumers with assurance that they are purchasing containers that comply with the Federal safety standards. In addition, the agency believed that the proposed requirement would facilitate the agency's enforcement efforts by providing a ready means of identifying the container and its manufacturer. EDO, NGVC, Thomas, NYCFD, and Volvo GM addressed the proposed labeling requirements. EDO and NYCFD stated that the label should include the maximum fill pressure at a location close to the fill receptacle. NGVC recommended that a blank area for the container installation date be included in the label to be filled in by the installer. Volvo GM stated that only containers manufactured after the standard's effective date should be entitled to display the DOT symbol. Thomas stated, without elaboration, that the labeling requirements of NGV2 should be adopted. NHTSA's proposal did not include certain information specified in NGV2, including the type of container, inspector symbols, trademarks, manufacturers's part number, and serial numbers.
