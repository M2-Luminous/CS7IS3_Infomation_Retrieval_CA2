FR940404-0-00098 FR940404-0-00023 As amended, the final rule provides two remedies for individuals in the community who may wish to contest a decision to deny placement of their telephone number on an inmate's telephone list. The first option is for the involved inmate to file the aforementioned Administrative Remedy request. The second option is for the person in the community to write to the Warden requesting reconsideration of the decision. A statement to this effect has been added to the rule. See ยง540.101 (a)(3). 7. Costs Comments regarding costs of ITS telephone calls include the following four areas of concern: a. Charging inmates for calls. Some commenters objected to inmates paying for their calls directly, claiming that it was unfair for inmates to have to choose between making telephone calls and purchasing other items in the commissary. The Bureau's response to these objections is set forth above in the Response to Public Comment section entitled ``2. Replacement of Collect Call System'', part b. In addition, these comments disregard the fact that the Bureau's telephone regulations have always stated that inmates are responsible for the costs of their calls. See former ยง540.104. It is only recently, however, that the Bureau has had the technical capability to bill the inmates directly. One inmate commenter apparently prefers to pay for his calls directly, as the costs of ITS direct-dialed calls are generally less expensive than operator-assisted collect calls. This commenter reported that his family had experienced serious difficulties because of the large telephone bills from collect calls and stated that ``[a]t the time, I had money in my commissary account. Not enough money to pay for the calls at the extremely high collect call rates, but certainly enough to pay for them at dialing direct rates.'' b. Charging a flat rate. Some commenters objected to the flat rates charged for ITS direct-dialed calls. Inmate comments discussed taking advantage of discounts offered by various telephone service companies. One commenter, a telephone service company, claimed that the proposed rule provided insufficient information to determine how the Bureau will support the billing configuration. The final rule has no impact on the type of service necessary to support the ITS. As currently designed, local telephone calls placed on the ITS use telephone services provided by the local telephone company. Domestic long distance telephone calls are placed on the U.S. Government's FTS2000 network. The FTS2000 network is a telephone service provided through a contract between the General Services Administration and U.S. Sprint. The Bureau is an authorized user of the FTS2000 network. The FTS2000 network offers no time of day or day of week discounts. A correctional institution is a unique environment. Unlike the general public, inmates have limited control over when they may gain access to a telephone. It is therefore desirable for correctional management reasons to provide all inmates with the same rate, regardless of what time they might be able to access a telephone. In addition, a flat rate helps manage use of the telephone, since there is no longer any advantage to placing a call at a certain time of day. This helps to reduce tensions between inmates during the evening, when, under the former collect call system, rates are lowest. Inmates can also anticipate their cost for the call, regardless of when they may have the opportunity to place the call. The charge to the inmates for the use of the ITS is designed to cover the costs of the ITS, including the cost of the telephone service, the salaries of employees hired to maintain the system, the cost of the lease and maintenance of the ITS software and equipment (excluding recording equipment), and the cost of any necessary supplies. In most cases, the resulting flat rate for direct-dialed calls placed on the ITS is considerably less expensive than the same collect calls, even before taxes are added to the collect call costs. For example, from the institution where the majority of inmate comments on this rule originated, a seven-minute collect local call costs $1.25. The same local call, if direct-dialed on the ITS, would cost $.50, a savings of $.75. Similar savings are evident on costs of long-distance calls. For example, again from the institution confining the majority of inmates who submitted comments, a seven-minute collect long-distance call to New York City costs $3.62 in the daytime, $3.06 in the evening, and $2.92 on the weekend. The ITS cost for the same call, regardless of time or day, is $1.75, $1.17 less than the lowest available collect call rate. Some inmate commenters compared ITS rates with costs of telephone calls available in the industry through local carrier discounts, etc. The Bureau reminds these commenters that such discounts are not available in Bureau institutions and therefore, it is more appropriate to compare the ITS rates to the collect call rates rather than to these discounted rates. c. International calls. Some inmate commenters acknowledged that they were unable to make collect calls to their families in certain foreign countries. One commenter complained, however, that it costs more to place ITS international calls, specifically to Norway and Colombia. This commenter apparently does not dispute the fact that ITS calls to these countries are generally less expensive than collect calls. Rather, the commenter's complaint was based upon speculated costs for discount direct-dialed services not available to inmates. As noted above, the only true comparison that can be made is between the costs of collect calls and ITS direct-dialed calls. These comparisons easily support the Bureau's belief that ITS calls are generally less expensive. A recent survey comparing the costs of ITS calls and the costs of collect calls from three institutions to several countries, including Norway and Colombia, supports the Bureau's position that the ITS calls are generally less expensive than collect international calls.
