In an interview with reporters after the closed-door session of the upper house of the Russian parliament on Monday, he said that the head of the temporary authority Vladimir Lozovoy, appointed by the president, is not competent enough for his post. Aushev said that due to Lozovoy's position as head of the administration, the presidential decree on returning Ingush refugees to the Prigorodnyy District is not being fulfilled. Aushev also said that the Federation Council decided to prepare a resolution where it will propose to the president to introduce changes in the decree on a longer state of emergency. He believes it necessary to introduce special rule on the territory of the Prigorodny District where all power would go over to the head of the administration, as well as to withdraw all North Ossetian armed units from the District. "Only federal law enforcement bodies can provide calm in the zone," believes Aushev. He said that North Ossetian President Galazov has a different view on these problems and is against the return of Ingush refugees. The president of North Ossetia, deputy to the Federation Council Galazov, supports the president's decree on the whole, but criticizes some of its provisions. In an interview with Interfax, he said that in line with the decree, the help that is being rendered to the republic through the temporary authority will continue depending on how constructive talks are between North Ossetia and Ingushetia. No one is able to determine the degree of a constructive dialogue. To place such conditions means a lack of common sense, he said. He believes that those who drafted the document asked the president to sign the unfinalized document. Galazov expressed regret that the proposals and remarks on the draft decree sent by representatives of North Ossetia were not taken into account.
