Before the consolidation of the democratic government of Nelson Mandela, relations between Brazil and the RSA were not very good because the Brazilian Government opposed the racist apartheid regime. Now that it is gone, it is expected that trade relations between the two countries will triple in the next five years. This was reported by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim: [Begin Amorim recording] Without doubt, our trade potential with the RSA is very big. This potential was repressed on account of the sanctions against the RSA and our own opposition to the apartheid regime. Now, with a majority government and a fully democratic government elected by the people's votes, our expectations have improved enormously, mainly because the RSA's economy will undergo important transformations that probably will open new business opportunities. [end recording] The Brazilian Government has invited RSA President Nelson Mandela to visit Brazil this year. The RSA Government however, has yet not officially confirmed Mandela's visit to Brazil.
