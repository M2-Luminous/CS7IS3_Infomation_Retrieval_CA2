During an analysis of the current harvest in three eastern provinces, Lage, who is also member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, said that the final stage of this harvest (extended until June in certain regions of the island) demands great determination and strength from all workers, according to GRANMA. "As never before, we need to meet our sugar production target [comprometida]," said Lage, who referred to the serious and costly limitations imposed by a lack of certain basic inputs, including spare parts for sugar harvest machinery, such as cane harvester-loaders [combinadas caneras y alzadoras]. After explaining the causes for the reduction in electricity production in the country, he urged technicians, specialists, and leaders of the sector to seek local alternatives and solutions to maintain, even under the worst of conditions, an acceptable supply of sugar cane for the industry. Cuba last year registered low sugar production (4.2 million tons) due to weather conditions and other problems, and is intent on increasing production to market and barter it abroad for multiple material resources that are indispensable to improving the economy.
