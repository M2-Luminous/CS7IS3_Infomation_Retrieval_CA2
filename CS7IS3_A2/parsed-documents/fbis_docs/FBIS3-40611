This short time is not enough to evaluate a newly elected government's efficiency. Even though during this short period Benazir Bhutto has achieved many things, the results of these achievements have not reached the people. Therefore, even knowing that not much can be achieved in one month, the people are dissatisfied and worried. Perhaps they are wondering if they will benefit from the change in the government. If there are benefits, when will they reach the people's level? The People's Party was successful in the general elections in October, and was also successful in getting its party's people elected as the speaker and deputy speaker in the National Assembly. This was followed by the success of Mr. Farooq Laghari in the presidential election. All of these have important political ramifications. Because of these successes, the prime minister is in a position now to focus on implementing her election promises to work for the country's security and the welfare of the people. If we look at it in this context, we must say that these successes will benefit the people. That is why the People's Party members are expressing joy at these accomplishments. However, the people, who are already expressing joy at the success of the newly elected government, are also expressing some minor disappointments. Perhaps all of this is because the people have been stuck in the vortex of inflation and unemployment for a long time. They want to get out of it immediately. They have high hopes for Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her government. They are becoming restless about fulfilling their expectations as soon as possible. The situation demands that the newly elected government, in addition to implementing additional parliamentary victories and plans, also take immediate steps that help the poor, the middle class, and salaried people. These steps should be clear and to the point, so that an average man can feel and understand their importance and benefits. Prime Minister Bhutto called a meeting of economic experts soon after her election, and expressed concern over the continued increase in prices of essential items. She instructed them to find ways to control these prices. The results of the steps they took should have been felt by the people by now. The people will be satisfied with these results only when inflation is reduced. They will learn about them when they go to purchase their daily necessities in the market, and find that they do not have to pay more than they did yesterday. As a first step, there should be stability in prices. The next step should be reductions in the prices of necessary items. The people are not ready to listen to the government experts' excuses about the economy, unless it will result in the stabilization of prices in the first phase, and reduction in the second phase. Those who earn a few hundred or a few thousand rupees a month understand their economy much better than any economic expert, because the experts earn heavy salaries and benefits. They discuss economic philosophies in fancy offices, furnished with expensive furniture and rugs, located in posh buildings. They are removed from the facts of life, and are unable to understand the real problems of the poor. In addition to controlling inflation, employment opportunities should also be increased. To this end, the restrictions and the hiring freeze government and semi-government agencies and departments should be removed. People should be hired on the basis of their abilities and experience to fill the vacated positions. At the same time, mid- and long-range plans should be made to create new employment opportunities. These are the immediate steps that will result in people being satisfied, and they will feel that the change in the government is benefiting them.
