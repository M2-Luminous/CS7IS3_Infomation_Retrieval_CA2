FR940617-0-00120 FR940617-0-00026 Finally, some of the comments regarding the definition of nonroad engines and the issue of grandfathering examined whether grandfathering subjects an engine to dual regulation (i.e., regulation both by the state as a stationary source and by EPA as a nonroad engine). There is no such risk in this instance because EPA has not subjected any engines manufactured before the effective date of this regulation to regulation as new nonroad engines. Such engines, if they are regulated at all, are regulated under title I programs. Moreover, it should be noted that the vast majority of these engines are no longer new nonroad engines. Thus, even if they are viewed as preempted nonroad engines, they are subject to in-use regulation by states. As discussed below in section VI. U. (definition of new), states are not precluded from regulating the use of nonroad engines. Nothing in section 209 of the CAA prohibits local pollution control districts from regulating the operation of nonroad engines, such as the hours of usage, sulfur limits in fuel (state fuel restrictions may in some cases be precluded under section 211), daily mass emission limits, and title I operating permits. In addition, local districts can impose a permitting fee consistent with the costs incurred for various operational expenditures, such as monitoring usage and administrative functions. EPA believes that utilization of this option will assist local districts in achieving their targeted emission levels. Moreover, states are not prevented from requiring retrofitting of nonroad engines, as long as such requirements do not amount to a standard relating back to the original design of the engine by the original engine manufacturer. As discussed below, EPA believes modest retrofit requirements may be required after a reasonable amount of time, such as at the time of reregistration or rebuilding. Moreover, after a sufficient time has passed after an engine ceases to be new, for example, after the end of the useful life of the engine, a state may institute more significant retrofit requirements. As the court stated in Allway Taxi v. City of New York, 340 F. Supp. 1120, 1124 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd , 468 F. 2d 624 (2d Cir. 1972), section 209 ``was made not to hamstring localities in their fight against air pollution but to prevent the burden on interstate commerce which would result if, instead of uniform standards, every state and locality were left free to impose different standards for exhaust emission control devices for the manufacture and sale of new cars.'' The Act does not intend preemption of regulations, like regulation of the use of nonroad engines or modest retrofit requirements after an engine is no longer new, that ``would cause only minimal interference with interstate commerce, since they would be directed at intrastate activities and the burden of compliance would be on individual owners and not on manufacturers and distributors.'' Id. EPA has added an interpretive rule in the form of an appendix to these regulations summarizing its views on these issues (see Appendix I to subpart A of part 89: Internal combustion engines manufactured prior to the effective date of the nonroad engine definition). This interpretive rule does not supersede, alter, replace, or change the scope of these regulations. The appendix is intended to be interpretive guidance and is not final agency action subject to judicial review. Based on comments received from several of California's local air quality districts, the Agency is concerned about the impact of the nonroad definition on the unique situation that exists in these areas, that is, the current local regulation of certain engines as stationary sources which, as a result of the nonroad definition, will become nonroad engines subject to emission standards promulgated only by EPA. According to the commenters, classification of these engines as nonroad by EPA may negatively affect the ability of local districts to achieve targeted emission reduction levels. To some extent, the grandfathering in of certain engines, discussed above, addresses this concern by ensuring that engines regulated prior to the effective date of this rulemaking continue to be regulated in the same manner. Nevertheless, this may not, in all situations, allay concerns regarding the overall impact that classification of these engines as nonroad will have on an area. The Agency believes, however, that any additional concerns that may exist following the effective date of this rule can be addressed by local air quality districts through their regulation of nonroad engine operations. 5. Equating Nonroad Engines With Nonroad Vehicles and Equipment EPA received one comment on the October 4, 1993 notice that opposed the revised definition of the term ``nonroad engine'' because, according to the commenter, the definition equated nonroad engines with nonroad equipment. This comment states that, by defining nonroad engines in terms of their use ``in or on a piece of equipment,'' EPA exceeded its authority because, according to the commenter, the CAA only authorizes EPA to regulate nonroad engines and vehicles, not nonroad equipment. This comment argues that EPA does not have equal authority over off-highway mobile cranes, which are nonroad vehicles, and lawnmowers and string trimmers, which are nonvehicular nonroad equipment. This comment asks EPA to acknowledge that it lacks authority to regulate nonroad equipment.
