Is it formally a part of Georgia, a part of the Russian Federation, or is it a fully sovereign state, albeit one that has not been recognized by anyone in the world? [Ardzinba] Abkhazia is, in fact, a sovereign state and it is worth pointing out here that the Abkhazians have a tradition of statehood that goes back to the 12th century. We want to join the family of democratic countries: Our parliament accepts all the norms of international law and has ratified all human rights. Unfortunately, the path toward the recognition of Abkhazia on the international arena is a long and complicated one. We have to proceed along it; however, we have already succeeded in taking the first step. [Gorecki] How would you personally assess Russia's policy toward Abkhazia? On the one hand, your biggest neighbor has sent a contingent of peacekeeping forces while, on the other, it is imposing a blockade upon Abkhazia and restricting the supply of electric power to five hours a day.... [Ardzinba] Russia is behaving in a strange manner toward us and I view the steps taken by Moscow as harmful and unjust. Following a war that lasted many months, in which people were killed, villages and towns destroyed, and material losses amounted to approximately 2 trillion rubles, our country wants peace. In order to ensure the latter, we have turned to Russia and international organizations for help. We were counting on the fact that world opinion would condemn Georgia as the aggressor and impose sanctions upon it. Meanwhile, although Georgia is constantly violating the terms of the Sochi agreement (that formally brought the war to an end -- W.G.), repressive measures are being taken against us. Why is this happening? Please ask the authorities in the Kremlin. [Gorecki] How do you view Abkhazia's future? What are the main problems facing your republic? [Ardzinba] Until we sign an agreement with Georgia on the regulation of bilateral relations and receive political guarantees that peace will be maintained, we will not view the war with this state as being over. We, for our part, are ready to negotiate. The most important problem is, of course, the normalization of daily life and the strengthening of Abkhazian power throughout the republic. Once the Russian Federation has lifted the economic blockade, our fundamental task will be to conclude a bilateral treaty with it. In the near future, the draft of the new constitution of the Republic of Abkhazia will be submitted to the Supreme Council. The general public will decide upon its final form in a referendum.
