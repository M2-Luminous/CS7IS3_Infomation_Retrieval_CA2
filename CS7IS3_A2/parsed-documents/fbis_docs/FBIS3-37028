He warned, however, that the strike can cause deaths among UN servicemen, specifically members of the Ukrainian battalion. "Despite the opinion of the Ukrainian leader, I dare say that this problem needs to be discussed and thought out," Dmytro Pavlychko said. "Russia is trying to scare the world saying that NATO air forces' intervention in Bosnia's problems would mean a war against Russia. But if the world community continues to tolerate murderers, this can end up in the extermination of Muslims. If we stand by this view, we are acting in an inhumane way. I am in favor of returning to this problem at the level of top responsible political leaders of the great powers," Dmytro Pavlychko emphasized. It is worth mentioning that Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in a conversation with journalists in fact supported Russia's stand refusing to interfere in the affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
