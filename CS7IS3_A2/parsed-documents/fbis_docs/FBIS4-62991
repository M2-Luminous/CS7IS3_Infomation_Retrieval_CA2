Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari told Russian journalists before setting off on his visit to Moscow. During this talk, Martti Ahtisaari was asked: "Is the Karelian question on the agenda at this time?" In reply, the president said that it all depended on what was meant by the Karelian question. If the thrust of the question is directed at ties between Finnish provinces and Karelia within the framework of cooperation between the neighboring regions of our countries, then we can have a sensible discussion about this topic. Is Finland assuming the role of an intermediary in the conflict between Russia and Estonia? If both sides propose such a role to us, Martti Ahtisaari stated, we will have to examine whether or not we have the prerequisites for this task. During his visit to Russia, the president intends to listen attentively to everything that is said to him on this subject.
