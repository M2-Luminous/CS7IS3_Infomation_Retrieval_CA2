President Martti Ahtisaari's statement came after the governmental committee on foreign affairs recommended that neutral Finland should be associated with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation programme. Finland will, however, restrict its participation to peacekeeping operations, search, rescue and humanitarian functions and environmental protection. A government statement stressed Monday that Finland was not seeking any new defence solutions by way of the NATO Partnership for Peace. The government has not decided when the documents will be signed, but foreign ministry sources said that Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto is likely to sign the programme in Brussels early next month.
