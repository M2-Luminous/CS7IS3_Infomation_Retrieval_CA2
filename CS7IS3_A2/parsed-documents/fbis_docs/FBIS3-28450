Speaking at the seminar, F. Limo, member of the national executive committee of the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania, said that the work is of weighty significance as it was published at a time when socialism has suffered a setback in Eastern Europe and a serious politico-ideological struggle was taking place on the international arena. He stressed: The cause of the collapse of socialism in some countries was made clear by the great chuche idea. The collapse of socialism was a product of the conspiracy between the imperialists and counterrevolutionary forces and a result of the ideological and cultural infiltration of imperialism and the corrosive influence of the right opportunist idea. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work fully laid bare the reactionary nature of the sophism of the imperialists and renegades of socialism who accused socialism of being "totalitarian", "barracks-like" and "administrative and commanding". The speakers at the seminar said it is an immortal classical work which dealt a decisive blow at the moves of the imperialists and renegades of socialism by fully laying bare the reactionary essence of the sophism of the enemies of socialism and gave firm conviction and courage to the people by powerfully demonstrating the justice of the cause of socialism. A letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted at the seminar.
