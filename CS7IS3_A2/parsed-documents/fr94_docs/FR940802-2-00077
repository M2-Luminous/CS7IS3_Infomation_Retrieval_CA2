The contract water is diverted from the San Juan River near Waterflow, New Mexico, via a weir and backwater pumping system. Water is stored in a small reservoir at the San Juan Generating Station. The existing water service contract was executed in 1968, amended in 1977, and expires in 2005. Reclamation is the lead Federal agency to ensure compliance with the NEPA for the proposed action.
