FBIS4-4635 "dreas064_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 3 Apr 1994 South Korea Ways To Not Link Exchange Examined Ways To Not Link Exchange Examined SK0304025694 Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean 3 Apr 94 p 1 SK0304025694 Seoul HANGUK ILBO Korean BFN [By correspondent Chong Pyong-chin from Washington] [Text] It was learned on 2 April that the ROK and the United States are prudently examining a method of not linking the exchange of special envoys of the North and South to the third round of high- level DPRK-U.S. talks. In the past, our government had adhered to the position that the exchange of special envoys is a precondition for holding the third round of high-level DPRK-U.S. talks. A high-ranking government official accompanying Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to the United States to seek ways to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue said on 2 April: "In a series of talks between high-ranking U.S. officials and Foreign Minister Han, the United States presented such a proposal. In this connection, our side said that we will prudently examine this after consultations with our related ministries." This official pointed out: "With the announcement of the statement by the chairman of the UN Security Council [UNSC], the North Korean nuclear issue will go from the level of ROK-U.S., North-South relations to the UN level of multi-faceted consultations. Therefore, the United States felt that the exchange of special envoys of the North and South should no longer be a stumbling block to resolving the nuclear issue." This official added: "During the discussions at the UNSC, the Chinese side also indicated that since it will actively play mediator so that North Korea can accept reinspection of its nuclear facilities, the demand that the exchange of special envoys be a precondition for the high-level DPRK-U.S. talks should be withdrawn. Since the exchange of special envoys of the North and South is one of the methods to guarantee North Korea's nuclear transparency, if the nuclear transparency is guaranteed, our government's view which regards the exchange of special envoys as a prerequisite for the DPRK-U.S. talks, can be reexamined." In this connection, another high-ranking government official said: "The North-South issue must be resolved at a higher stage. If the nuclear issue is resolved, the exchange of special envoys will also be realized naturally." He hinted that the examination on not linking the exchange of special envoys to the high-level DPRK-U.S. talks is being carried out positively.
