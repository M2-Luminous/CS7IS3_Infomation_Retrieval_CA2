Chief Secretary Anson Chan told a Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce luncheon that the kind of fair, impartial government that executives now take for granted in this bastion of free enterprise could vanish if reforms are not made soon. "If we were to abandon our efforts to achieve such arrangements, we would be retreating from honest administration and responsible government -- and the costs would be considerable," Chan said. "The business community could no longer be certain of a level playing field in which political patronage played no part," she added. Patten's campaign to extend democracy ahead of 1997 has been cooly received by Hong Kong business leaders, who fear that China's angry response to the initiative will harm their corporations' bottom lines. Patten has put some of his reform proposals before the Legislative Council for passage into law next month, prompting Beijing to warn that British companies will bear the consequences of his actions. The governor was due back from an official visit to London on Tuesday.
