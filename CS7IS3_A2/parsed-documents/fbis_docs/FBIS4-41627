If I am at work, I think I may do the same, and then I will get on with ordinary matters." According to Leonid Kravchuk, the question "What will you do if you find out you have been elected president" is a problem for the other candidates for president. For all his brilliant imaginings about the presidency, another candidate does not know what steps to take, while Kravchuk has been taking these first steps for two and a half years; therefore, he does not have this problem, he says. Leonid Kravchuk sees his priority actions in the event of his election to president of Ukraine as implementing his program, while making use of all of the best points from the programs of the other candidates for this post, and also the formation of a government. Leonid Kravchuk considers his cooperation with Vitaliy Masol, Ukraine's prime minister, to be "normal," observing that Masol is not a "closed book" to him, because they once worked together. "Of all the contenders for the post of president of Ukraine, only I know him, and therefore I do not have a 'Masol problem.' If someone else is elected, however, then he will have this problem," Leonid Kravchuk said.
