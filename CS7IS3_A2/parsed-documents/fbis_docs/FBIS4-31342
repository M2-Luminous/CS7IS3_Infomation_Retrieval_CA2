The SNS will run the autumn early election campaign in coalition with twelve small parties, according to a decision by delegates at the 6th SNS conference yesterday. "In (ex-premier Vladimir) Meciar's opinion it will be better if the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will run on its own and other nationalist parties will form a coalition with the SNS," SNS Deputy Chairwoman Eva Slavkovska told CTK on Saturday [4 June]. Although HZDS popularity dropped five percent from April, a May opinion poll showed it to be the most popular party with support running at 21 percent. The SNS is not afraid of competing for nationalist votes against the HZDS since the two parties had agreed on a correct line, something that would make post-election cooperation easier, Slavkovska said. The coalition bloc, provisionally called the Slovak Popular Bloc (SLUB), is to include the Christian Social Union (KSU), the Slovak Soldiers' Association (ASV), the Confederation of Political Prisoners (KPV), the Slovak National Democratic Movement (SNDH), and other nationalist parties and movements. Father Anton Hlinka, a former VOA and RFE employee who returned to Slovakia after the November 1989 revolution, and Julius Binder, who led the construction of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric project, have lobbied for the bloc. The conference decided to abolish honorary chairmanships of Vitazoslav Moric, Marian Andel, and Jozef Prokes, who, unlike the SNS Chairman Jan Slota, favor a coalition with the HZDS. However, the decision was not influenced by Slota, Slavkovska said.
