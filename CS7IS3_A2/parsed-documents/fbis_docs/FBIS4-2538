He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, attended the conference and made a speech. He said: The party's united front work is extremely important to the new historical period. Major indicators are: The scale of the united front work is even wider, tasks even more important, and [words indistinct]. Thus, the united front work can only be strengthened rather than being neglected. The goal of the united front work lies in mass unity and mass alliance. By unity and alliance, we mean making friends with people on all sides. To make friends in an even better way, cadres on the united front are required to have new methods and new knowledge that are commensurate with the economy and trade. Without the knowledge on market economy and on new and high technology, it will be very difficult for cadres to do the united front work well. United front cadres must not only study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialism with Chinese characteristics but also study the theory on market economy and the knowledge in various other aspects so that they can raise the united front work in the new period to a new level.
