This was announced at a briefing at the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry on 18 January. Tamara Kucherenko reports the details: [Kucherenko] [passage omitted] So what does the trilateral statement provide for? This is how Oleksandr Chalyy, head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's agreements and law directorate, replied to a question from journalists: [Begin Chalyy recording] This document outlined and took up political obligations in respect of (?the course) of disarmament: Ukraine will only disarm when the last missile on its territory is gone. Legally I cannot see how this process can even begin in purely technical and formal terms on the grounds of this statement alone. The obligations in the statement are very general. If we look at the package of documents relating to START, however, the obligations there are very specific. In other words, you and we all have to understand that if START I is not ratified, the actual implementation of the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine within the framework of some general obligations and of this statement alone is impossible. That is to say, the statement -- as I understood the president's statement -- means that the issue of START and the Lisbon protocol must by all means be conclusively settled at the Supreme Council. Without this, the implementation of this statement is impossible even from the standpoint that it is in need of financing. And who keeps a hold on the budget of Ukraine? It is the parliament that adopts the budget. So this is a document on implementing the [Ukrainian Supreme Council START I ratification] resolution, and I believe that without the parliament assessing the relationship between the resolution and the statement, we will not be able to ratify START I. There is the desire of the executive power, which has taken certain steps and is proposing today to (?view this in the long term). But do these steps correspond with the general reservations in the resolution? Perhaps the parliament will now retract some reservations contained in this resolution. But this is the parliament's right. [end recording] [Kucherenko] Another question raised by journalists at the briefing was that of compensation for the nuclear warheads removed from Ukraine. Specifically, is the payment of $175 million not too little? Oleksandr Chalyy says: [Begin Chalyy recording] The United States will work together with Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to increase this aid specifically allocated to nuclear disarmament. So one should not understand 170 [as heard] as the final figure. Moreover, I believe it can by no means be final. No, it is not. This is how we understand it. [end recording] [passage omitted]
