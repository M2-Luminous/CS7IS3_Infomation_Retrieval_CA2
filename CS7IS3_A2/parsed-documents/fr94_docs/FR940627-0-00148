PAH and NPAH speciation is not required for F/FAs in the methane (CNG, LNG) and propane (LPG) families, or for F/FAs in the atypical categories of other fuel families. Chlorine-containing atypical F/FAs are subject to the dioxins/furans speciation requirements. d Manufacturers of atypical products must examine all emission fractions for the measurement and identification of potential atypical species. e Only applicable to F/FAs required to measure evaporative emissions. f Evaporative emissions are to be generated using an evaporative emission generator as described in Section VI.C. g The only basic emission required to be measured for evaporative emissions is total hydrocarbons.
