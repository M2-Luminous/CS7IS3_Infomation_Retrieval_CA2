In responding to reporters' questions after attending a Spring Festival gathering hosted yesterday by the New Territory District Board, Guo Fengmin said: The Chinese side has preliminarily studied the fourth new airport financial plan forwarded by the British side. Because the new airport issue involves so many aspects, the Chinese side is now conducting in-depth studies of certain questions, some of which require a further exchange of views with its British counterpart. China and Britain will first exchange views at the experts level to pave the way for the Airport Committee meeting. Guo Fengmin pointed out: Sometime back, people from the Hong Kong British side said that the Chinese side virtually did not forward any comprehensive views on the new airport issue, and recently there were also people who said that the plan submitted by the British side has fully met the demands of the Chinese side. Is this not self-contradictory? Because the Chinese side has not forwarded any comprehensive views, from where did the so-called plan that has "fully met the demands of the Chinese side" come? He said: During the Airport Committee meeting last August, the Chinese side had systematically forwarded its opinions, and the British side only presented its plan after a lapse of nearly six months -- from August up to the present -- so it is rather obvious who is delaying. Guo Fengmin expressed his hope that substantive progress will be made by the meeting of the Defense and Security Experts Subgroup of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group next week. He also criticized the British side for dragging things out too long over this matter. He said: Some people are now deliberately creating the impression that the Chinese side is delaying matters, but in fact, that is not true. It is also the British side which has delayed for several years the discussion of the question of land used for defense and military purposes.
