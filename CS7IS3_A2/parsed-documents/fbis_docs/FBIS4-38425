Speaking at a conference of the regional section of his party in the Krasnodar region, southern Russia, on Saturday, Gaydar said that the major problem is that the government's economic programme offers little hope for the future. He stressed that the government's course provides for the preservation of the status quo which excludes any prospects for economic growth. Gaydar presented the delegates with a 33-page programme of the Russia's Choice bloc.
