This can be achieved only through a balanced tax system perceived as fair and transparent by most taxpayers. The ANC therefore wants to move away from the ad hoc approach of the past towards a coherent, consistent and predictable tax policy. We are therefore not going to rush in and change the system or introduce new taxes just for their own sake. The constitution provides for a financial and fiscal commission to be created. It will be asked to provide government with advice on tax reform to bring about such a desired tax system. The ANC will retain estate duties, donations taxes and transfer duties -- each being taxes on the transfer of wealth. These may well have to be rationalised, perhaps in the form of one capital transfer tax. Wealth taxes should not be confused with a capital gains tax which is a tax on income or profit -- albeit from the sale of a capital asset. It is unfair to differentiate between that and "normal" income, because people who can obtain their income in the form of a capital gain would then not pay any tax on it. An analysis of the tax system as a whole will have to explore the desirability and feasibility of introducing a capital gains tax. The commission will also have to advise government on the details of such a tax. Democratic Party In general, the answer is "no". However, in SA [South Africa] there is often a misdirected focus on a specific tax or taxes. What is far more important is the total amount collected in taxes and the level of government spending as proportion of GDP. The share of our economy being appropriated by government is already uncomfortably high, but it is unlikely that it can be reduced rapidly. The danger is that it is allowed to increase further. Economic growth is fundamental, and taxation should not hinder growth. A market orientated, enterprise-driven economy in which private property is respected, in which enterprise is recognised and encouraged, in which people are entitled to be rewarded for initiative, risk and hard work, and in which it is recognised that the private sector, not government, best creates wealth in an economy which will prosper. Wealth and capital gains taxes are likely to be counterproductive. Freedom Front SA needs entrepreneurs who produce wealth. Wealth will be produced if the producer can enjoy the fruits of his efforts. High taxes are no incentive to take risks or work harder. Lower taxes will stimulate growth. ANC plans for reconstruction and development do not provide hope for lower taxes in future and strengthen the perception that they will exploit all other possible type of taxes. There is no doubt an ANC-dominated government will levy a wealth tax. If, however, they want to encourage growth, this should be introduced at a low rate. Redistribution should take place in a manner that does not discourage investment. The solution does not lie in the introduction of new taxes but the better utilisation of present tax income. Although SA has no formal capital gains tax, estate duty acts as such a tax. We do not favour any further capital gains tax. It would not contribute much to revenue and would be difficult to administer. And inflation would make it difficult to determine the real value of a capital gain. Inkatha Freedom Party The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] is not in favour of either a wealth or capital gains tax. Generally speaking, the IFP is against increasing the already high tax burden. High taxes serve not only to destroy entrepreneurship and initiative, they also encourage the hoarding of resources and thus stunt potential for growth. While the IFP is keenly aware of the need to narrow income and wealth disparities between population groups, we are not convinced that either a wealth or a capital gains tax will prove effective in achieving this objective. Importantly, the implementation of either tax, while having negligible effect on total revenue collected, will have a negative impact on the ability of this country to attract foreign investment. One of the few benefits of such taxes would be their symbolic value. However, the frightening away of investment is a high price to pay to create the illusion that there is a redistribution of income and wealth. Further, a capital gains tax is neither equitable nor "fair". For it to be equitable and fair, all capital gains would need to be taxable. Such an approach is needed especially since the rich -- having access to better credit facilities -- can always avoid asset sales which attract taxes. The middle and lower classes, on the other hand, are most likely in times of need to be forced for sell their assets and thus incur the tax. Secondly, SA does not have the administrative capacity to successfully implement a capital gains tax system which would, in turn, demand greater tax administration without actually substantially increasing government revenue. National Party The NP [National Party] does not support a wealth tax because that would amount to double taxation -- the wealth in the hands of a person or company has been taxed before by way of income tax, estate duty and indirect taxes. Capital gains tax is something that could be considered, but it should be done very carefully because it could discourage investment. Pan-Africanist Congress The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] of Azania will use wealth and capital gains taxation to address extremes of wealth and poverty. Wealth taxation and capital gains tax will be part of a broader economic strategy. Capital gains and wealth taxes, far from being punitive, are distributive and reconstructive in the short and medium term. In the long term, the capital and wealth base will be sufficiently broadened to ensure taxation is borne by the Azanian society as a whole.
