Chairman Henadz Karpenka said that the primary PNZ task is to nominate candidates for the future elections to the Supreme Soviet. Henadz Karpenka also said that the PNZ will urge pre-term elections and changes in the structure of the Belarusian Council of Ministers. The PNZ chairman expressed full support for the strike which was scheduled by the Free Trade Unions to begin on 15 February. The reason for this is the Council of Ministers' unwillingness to hold talks with trade unions and adopt a mutually acceptable resolution. According to Karpenka's words, the PNZ held consultations with trade unions last Saturday [29 January]. With regard to the economic situation in the country, Henadz Karpenka stated that its change will be accompanied by a sharp worsening of the people's living standard. H. Karpenka said that presidential elections are necessary; however, they should be organized not by the Supreme Soviet, but by the people. PNZ Deputy Chairman Alaksey Karol, while commenting on the dismissal of Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, stated that this [dismissal] has strengthened the authoritarian basis and brought a shift toward an authoritarian style of governing and the monopolization of power in the government's hands.
