He will stay on as a member of the executive council for agriculture in the provincial legislature. Mr. Bartlett was sworn in last night [Wednesday] with six others in Pietermaritzburg by Judge Allan Howard, Justice President of KwaZulu/Natal. He will resign as provincial leader at the NP's federal congress in Pietermaritzburg on 4 June. Danie Schutte will most probably succeed him. Mr. Bartlett said last night that it was time for new blood in the party. "Renewal has always been one of the NP's strong points. I have been considering resigning for the past year. With the election now something of the past, this is the right thing to do. I am now 63 years old and it is time for a younger person to take over," he said.
