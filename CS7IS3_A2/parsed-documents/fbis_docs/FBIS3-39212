Zhelev said he hoped adherence to the Partnership, the U.S.-led NATO intitiative to strengthen military cooperation with East European countries, would eventually lead to Bulgaria becoming a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. In a speech at NATO headquarters here Zhelev stressed that "Bulgaria's arguments in favour of participation in NATO contain no elements whatever which might be seen as directed against Russia." "On the contrary, we support the democratic and reform-minded forces in Russia and sincerely wish them success." In reference to the resurgence of Russian ultranationalism fronted by extremist deputy and demagogue Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Zhelev said he hoped NATO "will be in a position to find adequate ways and means of involving Russia in European security while keeping at bay the imperialist ambitions cherished by aspiring dictators." Bulgaria became the eighth East European country to join the Partnership, with Latvia due to become the ninth later Monday. Evoking the Bosnian war Zhelev added: "The conflicts on our doorstep are an immediate challenge to our national security...laying an unbearable burden on our reforming economy" in fallout from the United Nations sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.
