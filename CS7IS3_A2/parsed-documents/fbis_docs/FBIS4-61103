"We will continue doing everything to help the implementation of the agreements," he said. In his words, the PLO and Israeli leaders have managed to reach the agreement with the international support on the part of Russia and the United States, the co-chairmen of the peace process, as well as active mediating efforts of Egypt. The recent Moscow visits of the PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin boosted the ceremony. Kozyrev stressed this is not his first visit to Egypt and described as "friendly" the relations between Russia and Egypt. He said he has brought a personal message of Boris Yeltsin to Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. "The Russian initiative to convene the Mideastern peace conference of the Madrid type remains valid. Its implementation at a corresponding stage would enable an additional impetus to the whole Mideastern settlement process," Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS in response to a question about the prospects for the Madrid-2 forum. "We suggested this at a time when the Arab-Israeli negotiations faced certain difficulties. There was a need for initiatives to unblock the deadend. At the same time, we considers an agreement on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho -- first treaty a priority," he said. After the agreement is signed, Madrid-2 may become an important step towards peace, said the Russian foreign minister.
