They judge that an environment in which this system will become popular with the average family has begun to be ready such as national subsidies for establishment of home solar power systems starting this fiscal year, and have decided to embark on sales. The roof-incorporated system developed by Tomiken and Sharp directly incorporates solar battery modules (condenser and generator) in the roof, and has the characteristic of increased stability compared to the method of attaching them on top of existing roof tiles. There are five levels of power, ranging from 1.8 kilowatts to 5 kilowatts. The price is from 4.7 million yen to 9 million yen. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is trying to popularize home solar power as a link in using clean energy. Beginning this fiscal year, they will give a public subsidy of 900,000 yen for 1 kilowatt in the construction of general housing. Moreover, surplus power during the daytime can be sold to electric power companies. The plan is to market it together with an air cycle construction method developed by Fukubi Chemical Industries (Fukui city) which coaxes out energy savings through air circulation since "a solar power system alone still leaves a sense of being relatively high in equipment cost compared to the amount saved from electric power rates" (Chairman Tominaga).
