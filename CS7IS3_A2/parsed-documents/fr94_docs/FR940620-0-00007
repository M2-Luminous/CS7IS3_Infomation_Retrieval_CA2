FR940620-0-00007 FR940620-0-00002 One international baking and research institute generally supported the change. It requested a reprint of the Combustion method be published in the Journal of the AOAC International. Six additional comments were received in the form of requests for reprints of the Combustion method as published in the Journal of the AOAC International. Final Action Accordingly, FGIS is revising Part 801 of the regulations, Tolerances for Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) Analyzers, to incorporate by reference the AOAC International Method 992.23, Crude Protein in Cereal Grains and Oilseeds Generic Combustion Method (1992). List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 801 Administrative practice and procedure, Grain Export, Incorporation by reference. For reasons set out in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 801 is amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for Part 801 continues to read as follows: Authority: Pub. L. 94&hyph;582, 90 Stat. 2867, as amended, (7 U.S.C. 71 et seq .). PART 801_[AMENDED] 2. Section 801.7 is revised to read as follows: ยง801.7 Tolerances for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) analyzers. The chemical reference protein determinations used to reference and calibrate official NIRS instruments shall be performed in accordance with ``Comparison of Kjeldahl Method for Determination of Crude Protein in Cereal Grains and Oilseeds with Generic Combustion Method: Collaborative Study,'' July/August 1993, Ronald Bicsak, Journal of AOAC International Vol. 76, No. 4, 1993, and subsequently approved by the AOAC International as the Combustion method, AOAC International Method 992.23. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from Director, Quality Assurance and Research Division, Federal Grain Inspection Service, 10383 North Executive Hills Blvd., Kansas City, MO 64153&hyph;1394. Copies may be inspected at the above address or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., 7th Floor, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20408. (a) NIRS wheat protein analyzers. The maintenance tolerances for the NIRS analyzers used in performing official inspections for determination of wheat protein content shall be # 0.15 percent mean deviation from the national standard NIRS instruments, which are referenced and calibrated to the Combustion method, AOAC International Method 992.23. (b) NIRS soybean oil and protein analyzers. The maintenance tolerances for the NIRS analyzers used in performing official inspections for determination of soybean oil shall be # 0.20 percent mean deviation from the national standard NIRS instruments, which are referenced and calibrated to the FGIS solvent oil extraction method, and for determination of protein content shall be # 0.20 percent mean deviation from the national standard NIRS instruments, which are referenced and calibrated to the Combustion method, AOAC International Method 992.23.
