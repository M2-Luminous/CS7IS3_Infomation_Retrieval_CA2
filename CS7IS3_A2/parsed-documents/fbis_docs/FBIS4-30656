This was announced by Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino. The principles include the applicability of international laws and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which goes into effect this year, to establish the extent of national maritime jurisdiction. Another is the adoption of the medium-line principle, whenever applicable, which set boundaries between two designated points. And the third is the adoption of (?uncertified) creative option. Undersecretary Severino said the principles were agreed upon in the two-day talks in Manado last week and further talks would cover the area including the Celebes Sea and Cape San Agustin in the southern Philippines. Severino said designating borders could help prevent the occurrence in which Filipinos are arrested for fishing in Indonesian borders without a permit.
