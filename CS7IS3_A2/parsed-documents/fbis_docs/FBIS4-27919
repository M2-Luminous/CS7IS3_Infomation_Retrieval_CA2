FBIS4-27919 "dreas109__a94021" FBIS-EAS-94-109-A Daily Report 30 May 1994 ANNEX Japan MCA Surveys Water Quality Standards MCA Surveys Water Quality Standards 942A0278A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 30 May 94 p 34--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0278A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] In administrative inspection conducted by the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] regarding water quality preservation measures such as for rivers and lakes and marshes used for tap water and industrial water, it was learned on 29 May that water quality measures are as inadequate as ever, such as local self-governing bodies not proceeding with pollution source surveys for underground water where pollution is spreading nationwide. The MCA reviewed water quality preservation standards in the Environment Agency and recommended on the 30th that they strengthen pollution prevention measures such as designating pollution sources. The recent administrative inspection was implemented by the MCA from April to July 1993, and in addition to rivers, sea areas, and underground water as the target of inspection, they surveyed for the first time the upgrading of comprehensive water quality preservation measures. MCA surveyed areas where pollution of underground water has been confirmed due to the effects of harmful substances such as trichloroethane that is being used in semiconductor washing and dry-cleaning. Among the 56 districts surveyed, local governments are conducting soil surveys to designate pollution sources in only 28 districts. The attainment rate for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in rivers, lakes and marshes, and sea areas nationwide was 59.6 percent in fiscal 1975, but rose to 75.2 percent in fiscal 1992. It has become a hit-the-top situation in just the past few years. MCA has inspected the Environment Agency for designating pollution sources, recommended that they hasten measures, reviewed the types of water quality to be the objective of use and the criteria for preservations standards, and is demanding that the time to reach the standards be shortened. At the same time, they are strengthening on-the-spot inspections and are seeking strict measures for businesses that violate the drainage standards.
