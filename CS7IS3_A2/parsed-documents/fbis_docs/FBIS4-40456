[Anatoliy Chubays] These words epitomize the essence of what the party sees as a goal for Russia as a whole and what the party has to offer as Russian values. [ passage omitted on Chubays expanding on the importance of the above concepts] [Correspondent] Anatoliy Borisovich, the party has changed its name from Russia's Choice to Russia's Democratic Choice.... [Chubays, interrupting] Yes, there were long and heated debates about the name. As a result, I believe a very correct version was chosen. Many people said that we should not do that because the word democratic had lost its attractiveness, and many people did not respond to it any longer. But I agree with those who argued that we should not try to recruit supporters from among those who are not our supporters. We have a position and a policy and our own view of things which we offer to anyone who is ready to listen to it. Yes, we support the democratic choice. We supported it when it was popular and continue to do so after it has lost its popularity, perhaps. Generally speaking, a true politician should not seek popularity, but popularity should find its politician, the one who does not change his position even in difficult conditions. That is why the new name Russia's Democratic Choice appeared. [Correspondent] Upon whom do you rely most? [Chubays] A report at the party congress [held 12-13 June] was devoted to just this question. We were told about a large-scale sociological study of those who voted for the Russia's Choice, that is, those upon whom we rely. What transpired was that if a general image of supporters of the Russia's Choice were drawn, it would show an educated person, though not necessarily a doctor or candidate of sciences. It could be a well-trained worker, or engineering and technical personnel, aged 25 to 45-50, as a rule. This person understands that the country and the economy are in a difficult situation; nevertheless, he does not think that everything has collapsed catastrophically, that life is over, and that the only thing to do is to commit suicide. This person is inclined to believe in himself, in his own capabilities, and has certain grounds for this, like education, positive thinking, and so on. In other words, this is the strata that has saved Russia and our economy through its work. So this sociological study we were told about is very encouraging. It shows that the party relies upon the people to whom the future belongs. [Correspondent] Why should a vice premier, who has problems up to his ears, want to deal with party affairs? [Chubays] I will not hide that I was a little sceptical, especially looking at our numerous parties, which are mushrooming and disappearing without having really changed anything. I will tell you frankly that the congress itself, the people who gathered and the serious, substantial, and committed way the congress' real work was done had a very strong effect on me. There were fears that it could turn into some kind of democratic tea party, with senseless discussions of procedural matters, like why Article Five or Six of the Charter uses a comma instead of an and or why this wording was chosen over another. However, it turned out that the overwhelming majority of the people who gathered at the congress and who devoted themselves to the cause are people who understand very well what is really important and significant, people who are ready to devote themselves to this work. Being fully aware that, on the whole, this work is unlikely to be a bed of roses, and many can even expect to be hurt because many of them have difficult relations with local authorities, people came, nevertheless, and people are and will be working. They have already had the experience of last October and March 1993 and many other events which they have lived through in Russia where they work and live. Looking at these people, one understands that this is not empty talk, not a ticket to an ego trip, but a real cause which requires real strength and work. That is why I worked, work now, and will continue this work despite all my government duties. [Correspondent] When do you think a breakthrough will come and in what shape? When will the country see a better life? [Chubays] Naturally we discussed this issue. I must say, though, that the congress discussed such noneconomic issues as military reform, relations with CIS countries, the countryside--a lot of attention was paid to this. As regards your question, there is the following view: If the policy that is being implemented in Russia today, the government's and the president's policy, retains a reformist component of the kind represented by the latest package of presidential decrees, experts from the Russia's Choice believe that there is quite a real possibility that 1994 can become a year of stabilization and 1995 can become a year when the Russian economy starts overcoming the crisis. [Correspondent] What other steps should be taken to make reforms irreversible and then to bring if not prosperity then at least a certain amount of well being the shortest possible way? [Chubays] A lot has to be done. First, the legislative base of reforms is still very inadequate, that is, the very word, legality, we mentioned earlier. Today, unfortunately, the largest part of economic foundation is made up of presidential edicts, not laws. After six months of work the Duma can scarcely credit itself with any major legislative decisions. But this is very important because law is a kind of stable long-term foundation on which stable economic relations, stable investments, and so on can be built. [Correspondent] Does the president support you? [Chubays] One must mention that Yegor Gaydar has discussed with the president more than once our work within the framework of Russia's Choice. The president supports our activity, and the party supports a reformist president, something that was stated officially at a news conference. I am convinced that if Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is a candidate in the 1996 presidential elections, Russia's Democratic Choice will be a party which will unequivocally support Yeltsin's candidature. [Correspondent] Are you going to nominate a candidate of your own? [Chubays] But Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is our candidate.
