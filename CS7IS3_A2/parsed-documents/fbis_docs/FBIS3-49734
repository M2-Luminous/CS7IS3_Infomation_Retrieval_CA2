The prime minister first briefly assessed the Prague talks. We have chosen the following essential part of his remarks: [Begin Meciar recording] We assume that, in connection with the Partnership for Peace, neither the United States nor NATO countries are trying to create any new division line in Europe. This is an opportunity and a chance for all. NATO membership is a matter of extraordinary responsibility, a matter of further development. The Partnership for Peace does not guarantee direct [NATO] membership, but gives a chance to take part in preparations for it. We see and understand that the Partnership for Peace is a big step forward. The Slovak Republic is an active member of the North Atlantic Committee for Cooperation, and, within this institution, it became a member of several of its bodies. The Partnership for Peace means a qualitatively new contribution to security in Central and East Europe and is qualitatively different from the present incorporation into the North Atlantic Committee for Cooperation. The Partnership for Peace contains both political and military aspects. It envisages joint military excercises, training, intervention, modeling future relationships, and membership in NATO. The Partnership for Peace is not an automatic guarantee of security. However, it envisages the possibility of consultation with other countries in the event of a military threat. The declaration from Brussels is also important to us. It is namely a declaration that NATO expects and welcomes as its future members countries neighboring it in the East. This is a new element, and, on the basis of this stance, the talk is no longer about a yes or a no for membership; the talk is only about when and how. This is a marked qualitative shift forward. A framework declaration concerning the sequence of steps needed to join the Partnership for Peace was adopted at the Brussels summit. We assume that those who subscribe to the Partnership for Peace will have to take on themselves the following pledges: First, they will pledge to observe the principles of democracy, human rights, and minorities' rights. In Europe there are two alternative concepts concerning the rights of minorities, one being the concept pushed through by the Council of Europe and the other being the one pushed through by the Hungarian Republic, the latter being directed toward collective rights. President Clinton and his entourage confirmed that the rights involved are individual human rights, as the [word indistinct] of collective rights as such is unacceptable. In this respect, this is exceptionally important international political support for the stance taken by the Government of the Slovak Republic. Second, these countries must pledge that they will unconditionally accept the principle of the inviolability of borders. The remaining topic of discussion for us is the southern border. We are holding talks with the Hungarian Government specifically about the adoption of this principle. Our position on this matter is thus reconfirmed and is advantageous to us. The next thing envisaged is civilian control over the Army and the transparency of the military budget. NATO countries and the countries that will become members of the Partnership for Peace should sign an agreement to this effect. [passage omitted] [end recording]
