Gen. Mile Novakovic, heretofore the commander of the general staff of the Serbian army of Krajina (SVK). Martic appointed to that post Milan Celetkovic, whom he previously promoted to the rank of general. Few people know the background of this decision. It is worth mentioning that a few days earlier diplomatic circles in Belgrade showed a sudden growth of interest in Gen. Novakovic. Specifically, who were all those who took note and passed on his statement, routine to say the least, that "an attack on the RS [Srpska republic] signifies at the same time an attack on the RSK [Serbian republic Krajina]," and what could it mean? Two Unknowns Although he has been at the center of Krajina military and political life for quite some time now, Gen. Novakovic is not particularly well-known to the general public. As an officer in the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army], he served in Zagreb, then he waged war in Banija. With the rank of colonel he commanded "Tactical Group 2" in Operation Corridor, and he distinguished himself with the breach at Debar-Kula. After the Maslenica action of the Croatian Army [HV] on 22 January 1993, Gen. Novakovic began to wage war in the second half of the Serbo-Croat conflict. However, things have not really been going well for him, especially not with the Croatian offensives in Medak pocket. Although the army that he commanded displayed maximum readiness for reprisal (shelling Karlovac, Zadar, Sisak, and even the suburbs of Zagreb -- Lucko), this was a political decision, not a military one. Especially since all of that had no direct consequences regarding the Croatian thrust into the villages under Velebit, nor regarding the fact that many small towns in Krajina were also shelled in return. Because of all that the Krajina Radicals like David Rastovic have called for Novakovic to be brought to account. The thesis that Krajina is actually governed by a military junta accountable to no one was in the same context. Gen. Novakovic evaded specific answers and political explanations as well as he could. But since this was the time of a fierce showdown between Martic and Goran Hadzic, his refusal to appear in the RSK Assembly in Plitvice, where debate of the defeat in the villages under Velebit was inevitable, was interpreted as siding with Hadzic. It is difficult to judge the extent to which the general staff commander at that time actually came into conflict with the head of the Krajina police at that time. It is evident that both signed the cathartic letter of support to Slobodan Milosevic when the concubinate of Socialists and Radicals collapsed. If little is known about Gen. Novakovic, still less is known about his successor, Gen. Celetkovic. Born in the village of Mokrin, near Kikinda (in a family of colonists, it is assumed), he was also an active officer in the JNA. The information service of the SVK reports that he took part in all the significant battles in western Slavonia and in operations in the Sava Valley section of Bosnia (Derventa and Bosanski Brod). Before his appointment to commander of the SVK general staff, he held the post of commander of the 18th Corps of that same army. What little unofficial information could be obtained about Gen. Celetkovic indicates the following: He is an operative, an officer who gets around (he has held posts in the JNA and the army of the Srpska republic), and he has been in the SVK only since 1993. The Bridge on the Sava Martic's decree to make the change in the top military leadership of his self-proclaimed state has echoed like thunder. Since there was no substantiation except the call for a discretionary assessment of the chief of state on the basis of the constitution, only speculations remain. Gen. Novakovic and his team have gained a reputation as negotiators. That is, following the failure of the secret Krajina-Croat negotiations in Norway, there were a number of separate truces at the level of military delegations between various parts of Krajina and Croatia. On those occasions it was impossible to avoid granting certain guarantees to the other side and accepting certain obligations to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], which was the intermediary. The inspiration for this expedient came from Belgrade, since the time had come for a process of normalization of relations between the Croatian and Serbian regimes. The Krajina people, however, frightened even earlier that they would be "sold out," (this is illustrated by the success of the Krajina SDS, Milan Babic and the SRS [Serbian Radical Party] in the election there), showed that they had a mind of their own. Especially since even the subsequent visit of Zeljko Simic to Zagreb had no calming effect at all. As Milosevic's handpicked man, Martic was given the task of refuting the doubts and avoiding unfavorable agitation. He thus visited Dr. Karadzic in Pale, and showed as a guest much greater belligerence on behalf of Serbian unity than his host concerning the NATO ultimatum; it was even so great that the leader of the Bosnian Serbs had to relativize it. However, the ultimatum also weakened Belgrade's negotiating position with Zagreb to a fair extent. There was, then, a need to show Dr. Tudjman (and incidentally the UN as well) that the Serbian president is still making the rules of the game himself, at least in Croatia. The choice fell on the bridge over the Sava at Nova Gradiska. Two objectives were achieved by taking control of that border crossing (when the RSK ministry of internal affairs chased away members of the Nepal battalion of the UNPROFOR): entirely unlimited communications between the Srpska republic and Krajina in that region (intimidation of the UN with the threat of reprisals) and demonstration of `sovereignty' vis-a-vis Croatia (a demonstration that Martic must also be taken into account as Serb-Croat relations are normalized). It seems that Gen. Novakovic was not inclined toward that operation. That is, he probably knew better than anyone how much stronger the Croatian Army has become in the meantime and how large a role the UNPROFOR has played in the fragile truces which he concluded, although it is possible that he was denied clear instructions. It is no wonder, then, that Serb-Croat hostilities in the northern Dalmatian theater escalated once again with the crisis over the bridge on the Sava, nor indeed that there should have been threats from the "insulted and surprised" peacekeeping forces that they would take back control of the bridge even if it takes force. It is assumed, moreover, that regardless of his belligerent statements concerning the NATO ultimatum, in the light of all that Novakovic was not prepared to aggravate relations on domestic terrain. When there is big trouble, he is not particularly charismatic at all. That is why he was removed, and his place has been taken by a man who carries out orders without question, but who knows quite well what is going on. One thing is certain: Novakovic, involved in negotiations up to his neck, did play his role. Just like Veljko Dzakula at one time, he was unable to avoid becoming entangled in the resolution of specific problems, forgetting that in these parts this is a matter for top-level policy and shrewd combinations. After all, it may be an accident, and then again maybe not, that "assumption" of control of the bridge at Nova Gradiska, just like Dzakula's first arrest in Japaga, near Pakrac, was entrusted to a man in whom Martic has confidence -- Krsto Zarkovic.
