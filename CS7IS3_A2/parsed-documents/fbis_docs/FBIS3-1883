The spokesman stressed in a statement, as the first official reaction from the presidential side, that "the State Duma (the lower house of the parliament) becomes a participant in lawlessness." "The responsibility for this act of moral violence fully rests on the State Duma, primarily the parties that initiated and supported the blasphemous deed for the first time in the history of world parliamentarianism," Kostikov said. Khasbulatov and Rutskoy as well as four other opposition leaders, who were arrested in the bloody attack on the parliament building, or White House, in early October last year, left Moscow's Lefortovo Prison Saturday afternoon, in accordance with an amnesty decision adopted by the State Duma last Wednesday. The presidential spokesman said that "it is an outrage upon justice and a rejection of public opinion and the opinion of the president elected by popular vote." "Haste and insistence with which the State Duma worked to achieve the immediate implementation of its resolution, and actually to conceal the evil done to Russia, testify to its encouragement of political extremism instead of striving for civil peace and accord," he added. Kostikov stressed that "the Russian president reserves the right to act in accordance with his constitutional powers in the illegal situation which has shaped up."
