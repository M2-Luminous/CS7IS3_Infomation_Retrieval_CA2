The role of large and medium state enterprises is to do everything possible to smooth and shorten the break-in process. He added: China's reforms will be promoted if large state enterprises carry out the central government's reform programs and measures in an exemplary manner. The "Special Seminar for Managers of Large State Enterprises," cosponsored by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the State Economics and Trade Commission, was inaugurated on 21 February. At the seminar, 40 managers from 40 large state enterprises from all across the country studied in depth the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the major reform programs to be launched by the central government this year, as well as discussed the difficult and crucial points related to the establishment of a modern enterprise system. Vice Premier Li Lanqing chaired today's discussion. He began the discussion by saying he was very happy to attend and listen to views on behalf of Premier Li Peng. Then Zhao Zongnai, deputy director of the Organization Department, gave a briefing on courses studied at the seminar. He was followed by Vice President Li Yunmao of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, President Chen Jie of the Beijing Peony Electronics Group, Party Secretary Gao Rumao of the Datong Mining Bureau, Deputy Party Secretary Xu Kaicheng of the Jinshan Petrochemical Corporation, and Deputy Party Secretary and Vice President Zhao Guangjie of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who gave reports on their understandings gained from the study. After listening to speeches by seminar representatives, Zou Jiahua praised the Organization Department and the State Economics and Trade Commission for cosponsoring the seminar which has benefited its participants. He said: During the great historical period of reform and establishment of a socialist market economic structure, many of the previous measures for a planned economy are no longer in use and are replaced by brand new rules and regulations. Therefore, our primary task is study; managers of large and medium state enterprises in particular must study diligently. Enterprise managers should first study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; second, new rules, regulations, and policies; and third, new knowledge and skills. In organizing study classes, it is necessary to mobilize all forces that can be mobilized to manage classes, including party schools, educational academies of cadres, and training centers of various departments, local governments, and enterprises. Particular attention must be paid to managing short-term intensive study and training classes oriented to entrepreneurs of the new period. We must comply with General Secretary Jiang Zemin's instruction on more time for study and less time for socializing, never relaxing our efforts at study regardless of work schedules. This is the basic requirement of entrepreneurs in the new period. Zou Jiahua stated: Presently the State Council is selecting 100 enterprises for pioneering the reforms, and is studying measures to further improve the external environment of enterprises. However, they should pay greater attention to their internal environment, continue to implement the "regulations" for changing the operating mechanisms of enterprises, and strengthen their internal management. The new measures for the reforms adopted by the government aim at helping state enterprises transform their operating system, enabling the enterprises to utilize their advantages to take part in market competition. Party organizations and leading cadres at all levels in enterprises should enhance their confidence, increase ideological work, and unite and lead the vast numbers of workers and staff to work hard together so that our large state enterprises will shine once again in market competition. Wen Jiabao was present at the discussion.
