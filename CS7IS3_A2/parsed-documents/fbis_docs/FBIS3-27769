The Defense Ministry's decision was made at the Navy's request. The Navy will have a total of nine submarines when these three submarines are introduced. The plan to purchase the additional submarines was confirmed recently and approved by the president. The Navy is planning to build the three submarines in the ROK in technological cooperation with the German maker HDW Company beginning this year. It has been learned that the additional submarines to be purchased by the Navy will be equipped with more ultramodern electronic devices and stronger offensive weapons than those carried by existing 209-type submarines. A naval officer said on 30 January: "The decision to purchase three additional submarines was made because it was determined that six submarines are not enough, considering the fact that North Korea has 25 submarines and neighboring countries, including Japan and China, also have strong submarine capability." The Navy purchased three 209-type submarines at a cost ranging from 140 billion to 150 billion won each and is supposed to purchase three more by 1998. The additional submarines to be purchased by 2001 have a displacement of 1,200 tonnes, a surface speed of 14 knots, and eight 12-inch torpedo tubes. These submarines are considered to outperform North Korea's Whiskey-class and Romio-class submarines.
