It did not, for example, settle the "social dumping" issue resulting from the disparity of workers' salaries in developed and developing countries. Although developing countries will in time evolve into markets for European goods and services and will increase European employment, Catala writes, entire segments of the European production system may have disappeared by then because of competition from low-salary countries. Despite U.S. support, France failed to convince Uruguay Round participants to include a "social clause" in the future World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations, in part because even some of its neighbors, such as Portugal and Great Britain, never ratified the similar International Labor Organization's child labor agreement. Catala concludes that despite the successful outcome of the Marrakesh meetings, the loss of jobs and the competition from low-salary countries will continue. According to an unattributed editorial in the 15 April Paris daily LE MONDE, the Marrakesh agreement also failed in other ways. The editorial claims the WTO cannot be considered a complete success because many important industries still remain outside its purview. Additionally, the final agreement will not be easy to implement and will require "singular obstinacy" to substitute multilateralism for the present bilateralism in a world where trade relations are dominated by the most powerful countries, notably the United States. More importantly, however, the entire Uruguay Round has been marked by the rapid rise of influence of developing countries, which almost unanimously fought the adoption of a "social clause" requiring workers' rights to be respected. Despite their solidarity over this issue and the fact that they successfully blocked its adoption, developing countries will not benefit equally under the new GATT trade liberalization, the editorial comments. The poorest countries that have been unable to attain food self-sufficiency ought to fear an agreement that will result in higher grain prices. For these countries, the editorial concludes, despite promises from richer countries, "Marrakesh can only have a bitter taste." Pascal Riche, writing in the 15 April Paris daily LIBERATION, claims that while Marrakesh marked the end of the international trading system in existence since the end of World War II, it also failed to establish fully the policy of multilaterlism in trade negotiations. While multilateralism is the official rule, Riche points out, trade negotiations are now so difficult that countries can only handle them on a bilateral or regional basis. The United States, for example, chose to create the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and engaged in bilateral negotiations with Japan over market access. Even the Uruguay Round, which was "theoretically" negotiated by 117 countries, was finally signed in bilateral fashion, the result of long discussions between Europe and the United States. Market rules, Riche writes, are gradually giving way to "arrangements, pressure, and threats." It is logical to expect that a new WTO will be able to settle differences. However, the United States is intent on restraining the WTO's independence and development, Riche contends, since it has already announced it will not renounce its unilateral trade sanctions measures, the "Article 301 and super 301" of U.S. trade law. Moreover, pessimistic Europeans recall that when the fourth round of GATT negotiations in Geneva in 1954 gave birth to an "international cooperation organization," the United States "quickly transformed it into an empty shell." More optimistic observers, however, note that the United States "no longer rules over the world as it did 40 years ago' and that well-conceived institutions have their own dynamics, Riche concludes. (Rosa M. x36287) DENMARK RAPID GROWTH SPURRING LABOR MARKET POLICY CHANGES--Two articles in the 12 April edition of the Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE provide examples of actions being taken to ease labor market rigidities as the economy begins to show signs of overheating. The first article reports that Labor Minister Jytte Andersen has announced she is making contingency plans so that the government can act quickly at the first sign of labor bottlenecks in the private sector. Part of her plan is to set aside 100 million kroner to reintroduce worker relocation grants for unemployed individuals willing to relocate to new jobs, a program discontinued in 1989 because of a drastic cut in job openings. The head of Denmark's employer association backed Andersen's initiative and cited her pledge to plug up past loopholes in the program "so the unemployed will be forced to move--both geographically and job-wise." A labor union leader also expressed support for the program but cautioned that the bottleneck problem had more to do with job type than geography and that more would need to be done to ease the pressure on wages which had undermined international competitiveness in the mid-1980's. Andersen said that she is also looking at other measures, such as increased job retraining, to increase labor mobility. The second article describes actions to counter labor bottlenecks already existing in the public sector. Here even more, government policy is largely blamed for problems. A new law granting workers paid leave of up to one year for training sabbaticals or child care has resulted in a sudden shortage in many occupations, especially nursing. Currently, some 1,700 nurses are on leave, forcing hospitals to hire Swedish and Norwegian health workers to fill the gap. There is also a danger that this situation will be repeated in schools and welfare offices. As a result, emergency legislation was approved on 11 April to require that leave applications be submitted six months before the leave is to begin. In addition, a pact signed by local governments and employee associations will aim at avoiding labor shortages. Here too, job retraining will be implemented to alleviate labor bottleneck pressures which could derail recovery. (Roger B. x36508) (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE 12 Apr 94 pp I 2, III 1-2) LABOR-MANAGEMENT STALEMATE KILLS LAYOFF NOTICE BILL--Labor Minister Jytte Andersen is giving up her attempt to get the National Labor Confederation (LO) and the Danish Employers Association (DA) to agree on a legislative proposal on "mass layoff" warnings. According to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE reporter Peter Andersen, the labor movement is fighting against implementation of an EU regulation stipulating a 21-day notice before large-scale layoffs are effected; under current Danish law, employers must give 30-days notice. In talks chaired by Andersen, the LO said it was willing to accept a 21-day notice before layoffs could be officially communicated to workers but demanded a further 77-day delay before the action could be carried out. This would entitle workers to a total of eight weeks' pay from the time of preliminary warning. The Employers Association rejected this demand, claiming Denmark has no right to go beyond provisions in EU directives. While talks will resume later, the article's author sees little hope of a bill emerging before the next election, which must be held by 10 December. In the absence of new legislation, employers and unions will probably have to resolve the issue in individual contract agreements. It is believed that labor will ultimately have to compromise heavily on its 77-day demand, the article reports. (Roger B. x36508) (Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in Danish 16 Apr 94 p III 1) FRANCE COMMENTS ON FEDERAL RESERVE APPOINTEES--Jacques Hubert-Rodier, writing in the financial daily LES ECHOS, noted that the two economists appointed to the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank by President Bill Clinton will probably have no effect on the bank's policies. Rodier describes the two, Alan Blinder and Janet Yellen, as more pragmatic" in fighting inflation--more like "doves" than "hawks"- -than those they replace. Although their appointments may allow Clinton to leave his "imprint" on monetary policy at the bank since the two are considered close to presidential economic adviser Laura d'Andrea Tyson, Rodier argues it is still difficult to determine how they can change the balance within the bank's board. The views of the head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, who in the eyes of the markets really controls the central bank, remain generally preponderant. Moreover, the main decisions of the bank are made by a larger group in the Open Market Committee which includes, besides the seven governors, five of the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 25 Apr 94 p 4) CLINTON'S COMPUTER INDUSTRY 'SUBSIDIES' NOTED--President Bill Clinton's administration has confirmed its taste for industrial policy and close government-industry cooperation, according to LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES Washington correspondent Jean-Marie Macabrey. Macabrey charges Clinton is subsidizing the computer industry, citing the announcement by the U.S. Department of Defense that it will supply $587 million over five years to computer companies to increase U.S. capacity to produce flat screens--a key computer component used in aircraft and portable computers and now produced mainly in Japan. Furthermore, Macabrey notes that more help is forthcoming from the U.S. Commerce Department, which is charged with promoting these products abroad, and from U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who is trying to force open recalcitrant markets for them. To forestall criticism, the U.S. Government is justifying its initiative on the basis of national security, Macabrey states. However, the project has commercial goals: to establish a U.S. presence on a market 95-percent controlled by the Japanese. Macabrey adds that this is not Clinton's first attempt at industrial policy. Clinton has aided the U.S. military industry to convert to civilian production and has collaborated with U.S. auto manufacturers on developing an automobile by putting idle government laboratories at their disposal. Macabrey concludes that if the flat-screen experience is any indication, Clinton will repeat the strategy in other industries dominated by the Japanese, such as in robotics and high-tech ceramics. (Dian I. x336286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 2 May 94 p 6) UAP TO RECEIVE FR3 BILLION FROM STATE--On 22 April, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery confirmed that the government would increase the capital of the Paris Insurance Union (UAP) by around 3 billion francs (Fr) to facilitate its privatization, according to an article in LES ECHOS. The article cites unnamed banking sources as stating that the capital transfer will be in the form of short-term stock options for shareholders, allowing them to purchase new shares at the public offer price. In this plan the government, which hold 50.2 percent of the company's shares, will then cede back its options to members of a core shareholder group. According to the article, UAP president Jacques Friedmann wanted around Fr5 billion to recapitalize the company. He has said on several occasions that his company no longer had a margin of maneuver. Friedmann also indicated that UAP still intends to complete its European insurance network by acquisition. The article adds that the government hopes to receive some Fr20 billion from UAP's privatization. Some 86 million shares will be sold on the market, of which 43 million will be in the form of a public purchase offering. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 25 Apr 94 p 25) GOVERNMENT GIVES SHIPPING LINE FR900 MILLION--According to Claude Barjonet, writing in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Transportation Minister Bernard Bosson has confirmed that in 1994 the government will give Fr900 million to General Maritime Company (CGM) in a capital infusion which is much larger than expected. Moreover, for 1995 and 1996 the government intends to give the government-owned shipping line even more, the sum of which Barjonet speculates will be several hundreds of millions of francs. In the fall of 1993, Bosson had publicly confirmed that CGM President, Eric Giuily, was asking for Fr500 million to help his financially-strapped company. But this sum would not have compensated for 1993 losses of Fr450 million after a loss in 1992 of Fr689 million. Giuily therefore convinced Bosson that the capital infusion must be more "ambitious," allowing the company not only to pay off its debts but to substantially strengthen the company's coffers. Barjonet concludes that Giuily should be very happy about the "pugnacity" with which Bosson defended CGM's interests within the government. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 29 Apr 94 p 7) EDITORIAL ON AIR FRANCE, EU AIR ROUTE DECISION--LES ECHOS chief deputy editor for economics, Patrick Lamm, reacting to the recent EU Commission decision which requires France to allow TAT airlines to compete with Air France subsidiary Air Inter and operate routes out of Orly Airport, writes that the French Government is cornered between the intransigent wish of Brussels to develop airline competition in Europe and the necessity to maintain peace with labor unions at the financially troubled Air France. Lamm notes that the government has once again been "nailed" by Brussels in the name of free markets. He adds, however, that the French Government seems determined not to open its domestic air routes to competition and that it has already announced it would bring the issue before the EU's Court of Justice. The Commission's decision could be foreseen, Lamm claims, and is based on former Prime Minister Michel Rocard's promise in 1990 to open French domestic routes to competition in exchange for EU Commission approval for Air France to buy UTA airlines. However, the problem was when to open them. The government at that time thought it could control any competition by authorizing small companies to operate on a few routes which would not challenge Air France. The French Government has even more of a problem with the EU Commission, Lamm contends, since it must also have the Commission's approval for the Fr10-billion capital transfer it wants to make to Air France. Although the two issues may not be linked, it is difficult to escape seeing one as a bargaining chip for the other. The government's predicament is exacerbated by the fact it must be played out under the watchful eye of Air France labor unions who, despite the support that they recently gave to Air France President Christian Blanc's reorganization plan, keep a gun to management's head. Meanwhile, competition is increasing. The French airline company TAT is 49-percent owned by British Airways and if allowed to compete out of Orly, Air Inter--now operating on these routes--would lose important market share on very profitable routes. (Dian I. x36286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 28 Apr 94 p 13) ECONOMIC RECOVERY QUESTIONED--In an editorial in the 28 April Paris weekly L'EXPRESS, Yann de l'Ecotais questions whether the 2.0- percent economic growth "predicted by almost all economic experts" for 1994 and the 2.4 percent envisioned for 1995 will ensure a massive economic recovery, even if they denote considerable improvement. A progressive recovery will be slowed down by a number of factors, according to de l'Ecotais. The first stems from the importance of the German economy, whose expected low 0.5-percent growth this year and only 1.5-percent growth in 1995 will reduce exports to that country and affect the French recovery. Secondly, high unemployment, the reduction of public debt in a lumber of countries, and a very slow increase in household incomes, resulting in cautious consumer spending, will dampen the recovery. Thirdly, economists have been too optimistic in the variables they used to assess future growth. According to these economists, de l'Ecotais writes, oil prices will remain low, European short-term interest rates will further decrease, as will long-term rates after first registering an increase, and no international large-scale crisis will emerge. Additionally, according to de l'Ecotais, the reaction of French unemployment to the economic recovery does not match that of other countries. Nothing guarantees that France's GDP this year will rise twice as much as expected, to reach the level necessary for a drop in the unemployment rate. Finally, "burdensome regulations and excessive compulsory withholdings" limit any benefit that France might obtain from an improved economic situation. (Rosa M. x36287) (Paris L'EXPRESS in French 28 Apr 94 p 4) DANGERS OF PRIVATIZATION DISCUSSED--While government-mandated privatization is by now generally accepted, opposition is slowly developing, according to Airy Routier writing in the 14-20 April Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. A Socialist Party (PS) leader, the former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, has criticized conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's privatizations and has charged that through them, he has shaped an "oligarchy" which would "weigh heavily" on France's future. Additionally, Routier cites Elie Cohen, researcher at the National Center for Scientific Research, as expressing his disapproval of Balladur's privatization methods, despite Cohen's support for privatization itself. Cohen questions the government's use of the income produced by these privatizations. Rather than being used to reduce the deficit and aid government-owned companies, the income has been applied to current budget expenses. Fabius characterizes the use of this revenue as a near-sighted policy that postpones problems by covering them up. Routier charges that Balladur's method entails his choosing conservatives to head privatized companies and putting Socialists in charge of firms whose privatization is impossible in the short term. Additionally, he has established extensive cross ownerships in privatized companies--for instance, the National Bank of Paris (BNP) will hold 15 percent of the Paris Insurance Union (UAP), which will hold 15 percent of the BNP--which may create interlocking interests that will eventually weaken the French economy through lack of monitoring and absence of sanctions on the part of shareholders. As a countermeasure, Routier states, the Socialist group of the National Assembly has asked its members to purchase shares in all the privatized companies, to ensure that small shareholders lead the fight for more transparency and equal treatment within these companies. (Rosa M. x36287) (Paris LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR in French 14-20 Apr 94 pp 14-17) GERMANY TRUST AGENCY TO RESTRUCTURE, DOWNSIZE--Starting in January 1995, the Trust Agency will be split into a Federal Office for Special Unification Tasks (BVS) and several entities in which the Federal Government will hold a partial or total interest. The BVS, the legal successor to the Trust Agency, will be charged with enforcing the terms of purchase contracts for Trust Agency holdings. It will oversee what was once the GDR government's Commercial Coordination (Koko) foreign trade operation and administer the remaining holdings of the GDR's political parties. After two years, the BVS will be integrated into the Federal Office- for the Regulation of Unresolved Public Holding Questions (BARoV). Meanwhile, two government corporations, the Shareholding Management Company (BMG) and the Trust Agency Realty Company (TLG) will take over the Finance Ministry's proprietary interests. The BMG, a holding company, will oversee the privatization or liquidation of the roughly 100 firms still held by the Trust Agency, operate the Agency's five limited partnerships, and help close down some firms engaged in mining and nuclear power production. The TLG will administer the Trust Agency's landholdings in urban areas. The Trust Agency anticipates needing a staff of 3,700 to operate these new entities, with a possible reduction to 2,000 by the end of 1998. The Bundestag budget committee, however, is pressing for a limit of 2,000 starting in 1995. An initial post-unification plan to divest government holdings in Trust Agency enterprises has not been realized, except for the impending privatization of the Trust Agency East Europe Consulting Company. (Charles W. x36473) (Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE in German 20 Apr 94 p 17) Government Contracts Boost Eastern German Economy-The Federal Government increased public contract awards to eastern German firms from 7.5 billion German marks (DM) in 1992 to DM17.5 billion in 1993, according to a report by the Ministry of Economics. Over 90 percent of the Federal Government's 1993 orders for construction projects in eastern Germany went to firms native to the region, especially small- and medium-sized companies. The government also provided over DM6 billion in federally-funded road and railway work. Federal spending on such contracts accounted for about 6 percent of eastern Germany's 1993 economic output. According to the report, the increase in awards resulted mainly from the official preference given to eastern German firms in bidding for projects. Under this policy, which is due to expire at the end of 1995, federal contracts may be awarded to eastern German firms even if their bids are up to 20 percent higher than those of their western German competitors. The federal program, however, has been hindered on at least two fronts. First, few western German laender have joined the Federal Government's effort to funnel official orders to eastern Germany: only Hesse and Berlin have done so thus far. Second, eastern German firms continue to lag behind their western counterparts in the important information and communications technologies market. Although this gap closed somewhat in 1993, it continues to put eastern German companies at a competitive disadvantage in a high-demand sector. (Charles W. x36473) (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 26 Apr 94 p 3) WISMUT URANIUM DAMAGE LESS THAN THOUGHT--According to Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer, the environmental damage caused by the GDR- Soviet uranium mining company Wismut is more limited than originally thought. New federal studies estimate that only about 180 square kilometers of territory in Saxony, Thuringia, and Saxony-Anhalt were contaminated by Wismut's mining operations. Early post-unification projections estimated that such contamination had affected around 1,500 square kilometers. The Federal Government's projection of a 10-15 year cleanup program costing DM13 billion should nevertheless be regarded as a "lower limit," according to Toepfer. Some DM3 billion has already been spent on projects such as moving uranium ore dumps and flooding abandoned mineshafts. Clean- up financing is subject to revision in cases where local governments acquire Wismut real estate, and a complete decontamination of GDR- era sites is still going to take years, if not decades, in Toepfer's view. Moreover, the president of the Federal Office for Nuclear Protection recently reported the discovery of radon contamination in some Wismut structures and the documentation of some 7,000 cases of lung cancer in one-time Wismut miners. The government is not prepared to concede, however, that the radon gas in the mines, as opposed to the radioactivity in the ore, is the cause of the high lung cancer rates. (Charles W. x36473) (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 22-23 Apr 94 p 5) GREECE EMBARGO THREATENS ECONOMY, GRANTS--An article in I KATHIMERINI claims the possibility of punitive measures against Greece by the European Court of Justice because of Greece's embargo against the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) is compounding the difficulties affecting the Greek economy, such as high inflation, huge deficits, overindebtedness, and weak productivity. Sanctions could translate into fines, as well as demands for damages from the companies that used to export goods to the FYROM. Worse still, sanctions could include withholding of EU "Delors II package" grants, a move with unpredictable repercussions on the Greek economy. In addition, the economy could not be trusted to meet the standards required for EU convergence, which are based on the assumptions of this year's budget. The article contends that Greece's relations with the EU have entered a critical period and that the EU will probably in the future treat Greece more with severity than tolerance. (Rosa M. x36287) (Athens I KATHIMERINI in Greek 17 Apr 94 p 51) VIOLATION OF EMBARGO CHARGED--Northern Greece customs authorities are conducting a detailed investigation of border crossings- -especially at the Promakhonas point, one of the main exits to Bulgaria, through which almost all Greek exports to the Balkans are made--after a number of exporters charged that some businessmen are violating the embargo Greece has imposed on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). According to the charges, illegal exports to Skopje include raw materials, yarn, packaging materials, and metals. Exports go through Bulgaria, where product descriptions are altered, reportedly with the acquiescence of Bulgarian authorities. (Rosa M. x36287) (Athens I KATHIMERINI in Greek 15 Apr 95 p 21) NEW TAX BILL EXPECTED--The new tax bill, which was recently submitted to the Chamber of Deputies, provoked a strong reaction even on the part of social and professional classes that traditionally support the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), according to an article in I KATHEMERINI. The government, under pressure to modify a number of the bill's provisions, such as raising the limit of workers and retirees' tax-free income and abolishing the taxation of earnings from mutual funds, is reportedly determined to stand its ground and is expecting to derive the following revenues from the bill's provisions (in drachmas): 1. From businessmen and professions: 120 million 2. From builders: 10 billion 3. From farmers: 5 billion 4. From property (cars, real estate, boats): 10 billion 5. From abolishing tax-free housing loans for second residences: 3 billion 6. From tax on incomes over 15 million drachmas: 5 billion 7. From taxes levied on large companies and mutual funds: 80 billion 8. From real estate transfers: 2 billion 9. From value-added taxes on certain vehicles: 13.6 billion 10. From tax evasion countermeasures: 170 billion 11. Total: 418.6 billion An article in ELEVTHEROTIPIA adds that the new tax bill is not the best that could have been proposed. It will not result in fair taxation, will not decisively stop "Greek national sports" such as tax evasion, and may even prove unfair in a number of cases. However, it does attempt to correct the tax differences that divide Greeks into "dumb taxpayers" and "clever tax evaders."

These organizations blame the Ciampi government for the GATT's total lack of concessions to Mediterranean products. They claim the government did not want to listen to the farmers' concerns and never took the problem to heart, even though protecting these products would not have required great sacrifices since they they have small markets. As a result, the organizations now foresee the loss of 100,000 jobs over the next five years, a further drop in profits, at least a 20- -percent reduction in production of beef, milk, and grains and a further decrease--from 30 to 50 percent--in the price of farmlands. Furthermore, any benefit derived from importing cheaper South American products will be absorbed by intermediaries such as processors and distributors rather than farmers and consumers. At the same time, the burden of production costs remains, Confagricoltura General Manager Arcangelo Mafrici stated. With cheaper South American products and 20-percent fewer exports to Third World countries imposed on Europe over five years, more agricultural products will remain in Europe, lowering prices and reducing production. Coldiretti President Paolo Micolini said that to survive, Italian farmers must become better educated, produce high quality and fresh products, and raise more products indigenous to the country. Above all, the agricultural industry must cut production costs. This is possible, Micolini claims, despite the fact that the government cannot fix prices. Instead, it can reduce indirect taxes, make favorable credit available, strengthen services--especially transportation--and invest in research.

According to Prodi, France's telecommunications company Alcatel, which along with Italy's Pirelli company is interested in purchasing large shares in STET once it is privatized. Prodi clearly stated, however, that he sees no reason why Alcatel should be allowed to control an Italian telecommunications company when Italian companies cannot do the same in France. "I have been very clear on this," Prodi said, and dashed any hopes that Alcatel or Pirelli could gain control of STET by adding that manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and providers of telecommunications services cannot own the same company. Although he can understand Alcatel's interest in STET, as well as Ericsson's and AT&T's, Prodi said he cannot understand why they are creating such a commotion over Italian but not French telecommunications companies. In the interview Prodi also discussed plans for other privatizations. His comments are summarized below: * SIP: Italy's National Telephone Company may be dismantled, with part of it incorporated into STET. * ILVA: The privatization of the steel company is scheduled to be completed within a few weeks, since the banks have agreed to convert part of the credits into capital, and therefore future share purchasers will no longer have to purchase 100 percent of the company. * GS-Autogrills: Privatization of the chain of highway restaurants and shops is expected soon because the chain has been opened up to new bids and Prodi expects quick and adequate bids to come in. * Food Industry: Privatization of this sector is expected to be more difficult, because the just-completed privatization of the Cirio-Bertolli-De Rica group has been severely criticized by the Italian Federation of Trade Unions (UIL) for having been sold separately to FISVI and Cragnotti. * Alitalia: The public airline company will not be privatized at the present time because the company has just changed management and is being reorganized.

Fossa said that during the recent electoral campaign all the parties promised to address the problems of small companies and these firms hoped the new government would not forget them. Fossa was particularly impressed with Forza Italia's program to support small business, saying it coincided almost word for word with proposals contained in a document released by Confindustria in November. Fossa listed some measures needed immediately to keep companies from going under. They include extending export credit insurance to small companies, especially since exports seems to be the only part of the economy that is currently growing and small companies are not allowed to use the traditional channels of export credit insurance; removing the tax on reinvested profits; more flexibility in the use of labor, including short-term employment; refinancing Law 317, which allowed many companies to undergo technological innovation; shifting the indebtedness of small companies from a short to a medium- and long-term period "to give them a chance to catch their breath"; and standardizing taxes on company bonds not listed on the stock market.

Assistal, comprised of 1,200 small- and medium-sized companies legally authorized by the Ministry of Posts to install and maintain commercial switchboards, complained to the Antitrust Commission SIP is illicitly using its position of strength as the sole provider of basic telephone services to keep out competitors. Although the telecommunications industry has been completely deregulated, SIP continues to use its privileged position to dominate the market. Because it is the sole provider of basic telephone services, SIP knows who the potential new users are and will explicitly tell those customers that new installations and maintenance "will proceed smoothly" as long as they use SIP for both services. According to Assistal, SIP's behavior automatically excludes private companies from competition. It believes SIP should act as other public utilities do, that is, provide their service "to the front door" of companies and then let the free market dictate the rest. Only this way can companies operating in the same industry have a chance to compete fairly. According to the complaint, SIP should be given one of two choices: either it act solely as a public utility company or it privatizes and acts like other private companies in the telecommunications markets, under the same regulations. It should not be allowed to do both. Continuation of the present situation, Assistal stressed, will adversely affect employment in the telecommunications field, leading to a loss of 12,000 jobs within a couple of years. SIP is slated to merge with four other public telecommunications companies into a single company, Telecom Italia, to be privatized later this year.

The takeover means that the Santander group is now Spain's largest bank, placing it ahead of close competitors such as Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and Banco Central Hispano (BCH). Banco Santander President Emilio Botin has also announced his decision to retain Banesto management, currently headed by Alfredo Saenz who has been in charge of Banesto's reorganization during the past four months. According to the article, the acquisition has meant that the Deposit Insurance Fund (FGD) has been able to recover 313 billion pesetas of the total 505 billion pesetas that it will cost to financially reorganize Banesto. The remainder of the cost will be picked up by the state through the Bank of Spain. Purchasing Banesto has given Banco Santander several advantages. It will now have a controlling interest in Spain's media industry since Banesto owns part of Antena 3 TV network, the centrist daily newspaper EL MUNDO, and the publishing house Grupo Zeta. In addition, Banco Santander will acquire Banesto's network of branches located in towns of fewer than 50,000 people and its participation in foreign investments. Santander will also now control 2.1 trillion pesetas from former Banesto deposits in addition to its own deposits of up to 4.5 trillion pesetas. It will lead the Spanish banking world in terms of increased assets, which are now valued at 17 trillion pesetas. However, the Banesto acquisition presents Banco Santander's management with a more narrow margin for financial maneuvering and operations than before because Santander will also be inheriting heavier operating costs from Banesto.
