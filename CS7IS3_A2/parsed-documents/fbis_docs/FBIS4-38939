The Russian Foreign Ministry informed the Latvian Embassy in Moscow about the decision by a note, handed in on May 30. The agreement on the most favored nation status between Latvia and Russia is a positive factor for increasing the competitiveness of Latvian products, officials said Wednesday. The motion will increase the mutual goods turnover between both countries. Export of goods to Russia was very disadvantageous to Latvia after March 15 when Russia raised import tariffs on a series of products. Russia is still the largest Latvian trade partner. Export of Latvian goods to Russia comprises 30 percent of its total export. Russia also expressed a hope in the note that Latvia will ratify the signed agreements on the Russian troop withdrawal and the social rights of Russian military retirees and their families in the near future, the Latvian Foreign Ministry reported.
