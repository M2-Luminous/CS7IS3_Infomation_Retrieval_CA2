The protests that are planned to begin on 25 May in various parts of the country are to be supported by KNSB union federations and regional structures. This decision was adopted after the Executive Committee had reached the view that at the moment no parliamentary majority exists and that the country has no legitimate government able to adopt responsible decisions.
