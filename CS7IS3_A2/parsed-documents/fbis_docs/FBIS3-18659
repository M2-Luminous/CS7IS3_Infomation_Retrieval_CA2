These discussions will take place based on Wednesday's [2 March] instruction from the EU commission to Van den Broek to continue his efforts to solve the dispute between Athens and Skopje. The Greek Government spokesman described the EU's stance as "undoubtedly positive," and added that the Commission's stance gives weight to the political aspects of the issue, something the Greek Government has insisted on since the beginning. However, a problem appeared yesterday in Prague during a high level CSCE meeting on the Skopje issue. According to reports, the U.S. delegation, seconded by Britain and Turkey, insisted on describing the Greek measures against Skopje as a violation of human rights. In this way, they are seeking to invalidate the Greek veto of Skopje's CSCE membership. As is known, the Greek Government has already made its intentions to retract the CSCE veto, provided Skopje meets the three Greek conditions for a resumption of the dialogue. [passage omitted]
