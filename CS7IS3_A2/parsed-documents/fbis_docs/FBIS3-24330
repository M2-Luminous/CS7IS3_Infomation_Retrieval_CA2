There was an average of two murders and three suicides each day last year. Brigita Everse, the head of the Public Health Statistics Division of the Ministry of Welfare's Health Department, told DIYENA today that the total number of murder victims last year was 639, which was 215 more than in the previous year. The number of suicides rose by 171 (a total of 1,090 suicides). The number of accidental deaths, including homicides and suicides, increased by exactly 1,000. Last year there were 5,485 accidental deaths. Meanwhile, the birth rate is declining. The number of children born in 1993 was 4,246 less than in 1992. In all, 27,323 children were born last year (not counting stillbirths). Psychologist Janis Gulbis says this is a result of the dramatically lower standard of living. In his opinion, 85 percent of the Latvian population is living on less than the minimum subsistence budget. There are many cases in which people have nothing to eat for a long time, and this is driving them to suicide and crime. People are much less likely to seek medical treatment than before. Because of this, their illnesses are often neglected until they are severe enough to be fatal. Besides this, medicine and medical treatment are too expensive now.
