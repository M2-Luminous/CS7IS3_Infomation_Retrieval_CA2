UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said that it will be necessary to extend Onusal's mission after 31 May when its mandate concludes. This is before the inauguration of the government elected during the 20 March elections as there is no prospect that by that date the peace agreements will be met. UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali made reference to the Salvadoran situation barely one week before the end of the electoral process indicating that although there have been some difficulties due to the delay in the delivery of voting documents in former conflict ridden areas, Onusal is negotiating with the authorities on the solution of this problem.
