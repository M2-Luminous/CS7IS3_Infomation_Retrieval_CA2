Endara made the announcement during an improvised news conference at his private office at the Presidency of the Republic. According to Endara, Fernandez has the requisite experience to make a positive contribution to the administration of justice. Fernandez, who is the current National Police director, replaces Lopez, who resigned due to "strictly personal reasons" on 3 January. Lopez said at the time he would remain in the Supreme Court as long as his work as Civil Court magistrate required it and until his replacement was appointed. "Fernandez is a great lawyer who has won the Panamanian people's trust," Endara stated. The president added that he was confident Fernandez' appointment as Supreme Court justice would be ratified by the Legislative Assembly in March, given the official does not belong to any political party. Fernandez is a lawyer and has already occupied the positions of Superior Court magistrate in Penonome and as circuit judge. Regarding Fernandez' replacement as National Police director, Endara said he has no person in mind for the position but that he believed the new police director should be a "civilian." The president added: "This is a problem I have to resolve as president. I have to find a person to direct the police, and I believe the position has to be filled by a civilian. At least during my government, I want that person to be a civilian who is apolitical. I have not found the person yet, however." The chief executive asked the media to propose names for the position of police director, "because I do not have anyone now." For his part, Supreme Court President Arturo Hoyos has said he agrees with Fernandez' appointment to replace Lopez. Hoyos added that legal institutions should be headed by people who are not linked to political organizations. The official made those statements when he answered reporters' questions on the situation in several judicial organizations. Although he chose not to refer directly to the situation at the Attorney General's Office, Hoyos said: "Precisely, my election to the presidency of the Supreme Court shows the magistrates desire the Judicial Branch to be headed by a person who has no ties to any political party." "This is our stand on the issue," Hoyos stated when he was asked about the possibility of finding a solution to the situation that is negatively affecting the Attorney General's Office. The Supreme Court president added that, evidently, the Attorney General's Office and the Judicial Branch have to have the people's understanding to be able to work expeditiously. Regarding other topics, President Endara spoke sparingly when he commented on the current political situation. He denied, however, that the 12 January cabinet meeting had been cancelled due to the electoral negotiations between the Arnulfist Party and Molirena [Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement.] Endara said that the meeting had been canceled because all the issues in the agenda had been covered, "and as we are all busy, I did not think it was necessary to call the cabinet to a meeting."
