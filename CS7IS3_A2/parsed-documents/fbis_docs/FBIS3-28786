Without technical accounting factors, the budget will post the first year-to-year contraction in 39 years. -- The Finance Ministry plans to issue deficit-coverning bonds for the first time in five years to make up for revenue shortfalls stemming mainly from 6 trillion yen tax cuts.

As a result, the ratio of dependence on public borrowings rises to 18.7 percent from 11.2 percent in fiscal 1993. -- The general operating expenditures will rise only 2.3 percent but public works-related outlays will rise a relatively high 4.0 percent. -- Defense spending is up 0.8 percent for the lowest rise since fiscal 1960 and official development assistance (ODA) will rise 4.0 percent. -- The draft fiscal investment and loan program allocates 7.0 percent higher outlays to finance housing, public works and other projects.
