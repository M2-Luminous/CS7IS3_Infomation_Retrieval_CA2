FBIS4-40 "cr00000023194001" 21 April 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-054-CAMBODIA CAMBODIA: Paper Airs Border Problems, Influx of Vietnamese CAMBODIA: Paper Airs Border Problems, Influx of Vietnamese SUMMARY: February and March editions of the Phnom Penh daily REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA reported continuing problems with Vietnam over the demarcation of the Cambodian-Vietnamese border and with the influx of ethnic Vietnamese, who allegedly engage in illegal logging, fishing, and farming. The paper indicated that local officials are considering measures to address these problems. Reflecting Cambodian concern over border issues with Vietnam, the 12 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA quoted State Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior (MOT) Khan Savoeun telling Mondolkiri provincial officials that "a national security force and a provincial security force would be formed as soon as possible" for duty along the border. According to the paper, Khan Savoeun went on to say that "all issues pertaining to missing markers along the border must be revisited." In line with Phnom Penh's attempt to deal with the influx of ethnic Vietnamese, an article in the 27 February REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA reported that the new Cambodian immigration law--which draws on laws in effect during former Sihanoukist, Lon Nol, and State of Cambodia regimes--"will give the MOT full authority to expel illegal immigrants and protect the livelihoods of those in Cambodia legally." The article cited an unnamed MOT official as saying that the law "is not just for Vietnamese, but applies to all foreigners." The paper noted that 5,000 Vietnamese are waiting in boats along the SRV border. The article said that these people--many of whom fled Cambodia following Khmer Rouge attacks in 1993--claimed to have documentation verifying Cambodian citizenship, long-term residence in Cambodia, and fluency in Cambodian, adding that they expect to return when the new law is promulgated. The paper cited an unnamed analyst as saying that the new law "should solve the Vietnamese settler problem" but that negotiations will have to be held with SRV immigration authorities to return illegals to the SRV. A 3,000-word article in the 5 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA that extensively quoted a Pursat Province subdistrict official's remarks on the continuing influx of Vietnamese immigrants served to underscore longstanding ethnic Khmer fears of Vietnamese encroachment. The official, according to the article, estimated that his jurisdiction's population is about 80 percent Vietnamese and that 60-70 percent of them are undocumented. The article ended with the observation that the ethnic Khmer in the subdistrict live in poverty "while the Yuon [pejorative for Vietnamese] live in proper houses and accumulate lots of money." Complaints about a Vietnamese influx were also given front page coverage in a 10 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA article. The article quoted an unnamed Kandal Province agriculture official as saying that immigrants are "farming dozen of hectares" of prime land in Koh Thom District, opposite the SRV's Ben Tre Province. The article was accompanied by a photograph of boats lashed together below a headline that read "Chrei Thom and Prek Chrei: Khmer or Yuon Territory?" The article cited the agriculture official as saying "there is no sign that the Vietnamese have stopped coming," although Kandal's governor has negotiated extensively with Ben Tre authorities on the problem. According to the article, Vietnamese families in Prek Chrei Subdistrict outnumber the Cambodians nearly 10 to one, "and that doesn't include those living on boats." The article added that Vietnamese living there grow peanuts and corn and take the crops back to Vietnam. The article went on to cite a Khmer villager as complaining that all the good, flat land has been taken by the "Yuon" while the Khmer are left with the marginal, hilly areas. Noting that the majority of the Vietnamese settlers have Cambodian identity cards, the article cited a villager as blaming local authorities and the military for this situation and as saying that many Khmer natives "have been forced to leave because they can't live with the Yuon." The 12 March article also reflected Cambodian fears about Vietnamese encroachment. The apaper quoted an unnamed Mondolkiri Province police official as claiming that "hundreds of Yuon nationals are illegally logging 40 kilometers inside Cambodian territory" and that "armed units are protecting them."
