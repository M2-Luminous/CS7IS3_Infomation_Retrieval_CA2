Gupta: "Major Naxal Groups Forge Unity"] [Text] Patna, March 21--In a significant development, the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), and the CPI M-L [Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist (Party Unity), two of the most militant Naxalite organisations in Bihar, have joined hands with the powerful CPI M-L (People's War) group of Andhra Pradesh to float the All India People's Resistance Forum (AIPRF). The Maharashtra state unit of the CPI M-L (People's War) has also become a constituent of the AIPRF. While all these Naxalite groups function underground and operate in a clandestine manner, they have over the years built open and legal mass organisations for the peasant, workers, student and youth as well as women fronts under various names. The AIPRF, is scheduled to be the apex co-ordinating body of more than 50 such frontal organisations active in different states. The CPI M-L (People's War), for instance, has built a variety of mass organisations in parts of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Karnataka. The MCC, on the other hand, has a number of mass organisations in Bihar, West Bengal and claims to have some influence also in Assam, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. The CPI M-L (Party Unity), reportedly, has a substantial presence in the coastal parts of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Punjab and Delhi, apart from its bases in the South-Central Bihar. The Rayatu Koolie Sangha, the frontal organisations of agricultural labourers and peasants in Andhra Pradesh built by the People's War group, inform AIPRF sources, enjoys membership in lakhs. In Bihar, the now-banned Majdoor Kisan Sangram Samiti (MKSS), agree most observers, has a substantial following. The MCC, on the other hand, has floated a semi-legal mass organisation, "Krantikari Kisan Committee," in the rural parts of Bihar. The AIPRF, according to inside sources, has been built to pave the way for a concerted initiative to co-ordinate the local struggles of its constituent bodies and give it an all-India character. This apex body of the major Naxalite organisations, is scheduled to hold a conference at Calcutta on March 21, to give final shape to its manifesto. On the following day, the AIPRF plans to hold a massive rally at Calcutta to give a glimpse of the strength of the militant peasant struggles being waged under their leadership in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and the forest areas of Dandakaranya. The draft manifesto of the AIPRF, presently, in circulation among its constituents, states that its main objective is to "build and develop powerful anti-feudal and anti-imperialist struggles towards the goal of a new democratic India." But most probably, this new platform would be utilised by the underground Naxalite groups to articulate its views on major political issues before a larger national audience. Moreover, as the draft manifesto indicates, the AIPRF seems to be desirous of forging a common front with diverse on-going movements to defend the rights of tribals, Dalits, women and for the protection of environment waged by various non-Maoist formations. Interestingly, the movement against the Sardar Sarovar Dam, more commonly known as "Narmada bachao andolan," has been singled out for special mention in this connection. The growing opposition to the recently-concluded GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] treaty among various sections of the Indian population also seems to have encouraged these Naxalite organisations to search for a larger arena for united struggle. No wonder, the draft manifesto of AIPRF, puts stress on building united struggle with all those forces opposed to the Dunkel draft. The draft, however, at the same time, terms the opposition of Janata Dal, CPI [Communist Party of India] and CPM [Communist Party of India-Marxist] to the Dunkel draft, as only "nominal," and thus perhaps, excludes them from the purview of joint action. Asked to differentiate itself from the IPF [Indian People's Front (leftist group)], and affiliate of the CPI M-L [Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist] (Liberation), the AIPRF sources point out that whereas IPF is an electoral outfit, the new organisation will have no truck with parliamentary politics. It may be noted that the CPI M-L (People's War), MCC and CPI M-L (Party Unity), in fact, boycott elections.
