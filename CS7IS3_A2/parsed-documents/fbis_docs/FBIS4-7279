FBIS4-7279 "dreas083__a94004" FBIS-EAS-94-083-A Daily Report 29 April 1994 ANNEX Japan * Ichiro Ozawa Discusses Diplomacy, Politics * Ichiro Ozawa Discusses Diplomacy, Politics 942A0095A Tokyo THIS IS YOMIURI in Japanese Apr 94 pp 40-55--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0095A Tokyo THIS IS YOMIURI Japanese CSO [Interview with Ichiro Ozawa by Takeshi Sasaki, Tokyo University professor; moderated by Shoichi Oikawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN political bureau chief] [Text] Demolishing the "Village Society" of Politics [Oikawa] Now that the political reform bill has been passed, with that in mind, I'd like to hear your views on several broad topics, such as the sort of politics you would like to see in the future, and the problems that Japan faces. First, I'd like to discuss Mr. Hosokawa's performance at the Japan-U.S. summit. For previous summits, the issues were worked out at the administrative level in advance, and then the heads of state would then formally agree on them. But this time the talks ended without an agreement because a dispute over specific quantitative targets. This was an unprecedented development. For the first time, Japan unequivocally said "no" to a U.S. demand. Since you have always attached a great deal of importance to Japan-U.S. relations, we would like to hear your evaluation of the recent talks. [Ozawa] With the changing current of history, the end of the Cold War, and the necessity for a new world order, the Japan-U.S. relationship is bound to change. Therefore, given that Japan must now become more independent, we are in a much more difficult position than we were during the Cold War. Japan must transform itself from a baby safely ensconced in a cradle to a full-fledged adult with the ability to make decisions and to act independently and responsibly. But I notice that some elements in the mass media suggest that saying "no" was a good thing. Perhaps the Japanese people also derive some satisfaction from that, but they should not. After all, a normal relationship involves saying "no" sometimes, and saying "yes" at other times. What I'm concerned about is that our relationship of trust might crumble because of this, and that would be unfortunate. I have learned from experience that, since the United States is a nation that values principles, the Americans will understand if we tell them that their demands are illogical. They think that it is perfectly all right for us to say "no," or to express our opinions. They understand. But when we're asked, as a member of the international community, if we're doing our best to solve the domestic market and national security problems, and other problems, we can't respond with confidence that, "Yes, we are." That's the current state of affairs in Japan. Shouldn't we establish a system that will allow us to answer "yes" to those questions? If the Americans get the impression that we're not doing enough, that we're saying "no" to avoid inconveniencing ourselves, and dodging our responsibilities, then the relationship of trust between Japan and the U.S. will be destroyed. [Sasaki] Along those lines, the media seem to be insinuating that we should be pleased that Japan said "no," and also that we're being asked to shoulder an extremely heavy responsibility, without distinguishing between the two concepts. It is my belief that we have taken on an extremely heavy responsibility. The economic problems have remained unsolved for several years. These problems appear to be the same now as they were around the time of the "bubble." But the positions of both nations and the climate in both nations have been changing. What are your views on those trends? [Ozawa] As far as politics is concerned, the coalition has been likened to stained glass or a mosaic, but I think it is much more flexible than Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] governments ever were, and that Hosokawa can now demonstrate quite a bit of leadership. Strange as it may seem, a coalition government is more effective than government by one powerful party. The people are unhappy with postwar politics or, rather, LDP politics, and they sense that its usefulness has ended. Once you sense that public sentiment is on your side, then it's time to make drastic changes in politics. I think that Hosokawa fully shares that sentiment, and that it is the driving force behind his efforts. The fact that he said "no" at the Japan-U.S. talks, and that he was the first one to do so, gives those talks an import beyond that of previous summits. Also, as far as the economic situation is concerned, it is true for many reasons that there isn't much leeway now. But it was the business community that got carried away and created the bubble, and now it has to face the consequences. It would be inexcusable for corporations, which must accept the responsibility for what they have done, to attempt to get taxpayers to foot the bill. But that aside, we need to find a way to reactivate the economy by using more innovative methods and by allowing more freedom in economic activity, and in other areas as well. We cannot build the stable economic society that we will need in the future with our stifling, regulated, bureaucratic society. Nor can we, when we make changes, let it seem as though we are making them because the United States is demanding that we open our markets. This is Japan's own problem. Of course, I'm not saying that we should emulate American society and have totally free competition. To maintain a certain amount of fairness, we need regulations to protect the weak. But there are far too many regulations. Neither individuals nor corporations understand independence, and it doesn't occur to anyone to take responsibility for his own actions. This is just an example, but the banks made loan after loan, creating the "bubble," and now they want their debts to be paid with the government's--the taxpayers'--money. How selfish can you get? Therefore, if we're going to have situations like this, how can we expect Japan to have a prosperous, stable economy in the next half-century, the 21st century? Japan must voluntarily decide to reduce the number of regulations, and to allow more freedom in economic activity, and more individual freedom. Basically, that is the course we must choose. [Oikawa] The United States has given particular emphasis to these problems, and has referred to Japan's bureaucracy as a "cancer." Make Better Use of the Bureaucrats [Ozawa] You have to expect resistance when you try to change a system that has existed for a long time. But the real problem isn't a matter of the bureaucrats' resistance. I think it's wrong to say that their recalcitrance prevents us from making any changes. The problem is that the livelihoods of so many ordinary people depend on these regulations. For instance, automobile inspection costs a lot of money. If we simply eliminated automobile inspection stations, aside from the safety issue, the people they employ would suffer. Or, if we simplified the distribution system, those who make a living from it would really be in trouble. Problems like that are much more serious than bureaucratic resistance. During the Cold War, there was no need for either politicians or bureaucrats to make substantive political decisions. For all practical purposes, their work consisted solely of preparing budgets and making allocations as fairly as possible. For the most part, all they needed to do was to go along with decisions made by the United States. In that sense, what they were doing was not politics. The same could be said of the bureaucrats. They devoted all their time to elaborate regulations and subsidies. So, when we propose deregulation, pure and simple, the bureaucrats object because their work would be taken away from them. Here we have a group of talented people who have studied hard to pass the government examinations. I think we can solve this problem by having the bureaucrats use their talents in other ways, such as to work on major political problems, and to determine Japan's future role in the international community. [Sasaki] In the area of foreign policy, the details of discussions at the Japan-U.S. summit about the problem of nuclear weapons in North Korea have not been disclosed. However, is it reasonable to assume that a great deal of progress was made through the prime minister's recent visit to the United States? [Ozawa] Yes. If we focus only on the comprehensive talks on economic problems, what everyone seems to be saying is that they didn't go well or, in contrast, that Japan finally said "no," which was a good thing. But I think the fact that at those talks, Japan and the U.S. came to an agreement about their basic positions on the North Korean problem, is of extreme importance. Wasn't that the first time that Japan's prime minister clearly stated his position on an issue like this one? [Sasaki] I realize that you're thinking about how to change the ways policies and decisions are made, practices that arose under the 1955 system, and are still with us. However, I would very much like you to comment on the policymaking mechanism. Perhaps the recent political reform measures might be viewed as "input." The way in which the voters express their opinions about politics has changed to some degree. But what happens once they have expressed their opinions, and how do they benefit from that process? We still have no idea to what extent the problems of the Diet, first of all, and of the cabinet, the administration, and the administrative system will be resolved. In some ways, it seems that we still have the status quo. First, I would like to ask you about how the Diet is run. There must be a difference between the way it has been run since the change of government and the way it was run during one-party rule. Leave Diet Debates to the Politicians [Ozawa] Well, I really shouldn't criticize others, but politicians still cling to the 1955 system, to the postwar system mentality. Therefore, the LDP, which ran the government for a half-century, is a more unyielding opposition party than the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] ever was. On the other hand, the coalition parties, the ruling parties, which were formerly in the opposition, still haven't realized that they are now in a position of leadership. There are remnants of the postwar system on both sides. This situation will not change overnight, but I think politicians' thinking is changing very quickly. For that reason as well, I believe that the coalition was a good idea. If we were still working under the 1955 system, then we couldn't have resolved any of the problems we have, such as the Uruguay Round, political reform, or the recent tax cuts. Even if the LDP had had an absolute majority, it still couldn't have done these things. We've been witnessing great changes, substantial ones, and there will be more to come. There is a lot of talk about a dual power structure, but the reason for that, in my personal opinion, is the divide between the ruling party and the administration. Traditionally, the bureaucrats have written all the scenarios and all the scripts. Officially, at least, we had the LDP's policymaking organization on one side, and the administration on the other. It was hard to tell which was which but somehow, the system worked. Since the ruling party normally supplies the heads of all government ministries and agencies, who are almost always ruling party politicians, the ruling party should take responsibility for both politics and administration. In the Diet, monitoring should be done by the opposition. The ruling party has an administrative staff in possession of a wealth of information and reference materials, so it is the opposition that should check up on the government. The Diet should make better use of that monitoring function. If the ruling coalition approved, the administrative staff could be abolished. But I really think that politicians should be the ones to conduct Diet debates. If they did, the Diet would be reborn in the voters' eyes and, most important of all, if politicians devoted more of their time to study and to improving their knowledge, the bureaucrats would certainly become more malleable. Politicians are looked down on because they talk nonsense. Therefore, political parties could assume some of the burden of election-related activities, thus saving 20 or 30 percent of the energy politicians expend on them. I would like to see politicians doing more independent study, at least when they are in Tokyo. Then, they would be able to engage in debates with the bureaucrats; and debates between the ruling party and the opposition could be held in the Diet. [Oikawa] Could you say specifically when and how you plan to make these things happen? [Ozawa] I sincerely hope that we can get started at the next Diet session. Diet Debates: Opposition Versus Bureaucrats [Sasaki] It does seem that debates between political parties are actually taking place in the Diet, but I get the impression that the debates are between the bureaucrats and the opposition. Japan's Diet debates involve a tremendous amount of detail, don't they. [Ozawa] And all they talk about are trivial matters. [Sasaki] The administration is the focus in these question-and-answer sessions. [Ozawa] Normally, the opposition is supposed to monitor the ruling party. But the traditional mindset of the Japanese people lumps the ruling and opposition party in the same category, and views the bureaucrats as the real authorities. That is why both the opposition and ruling parties want to hear what the bureaucrats have to say. I'm saying that this sort of mentality is unacceptable. I don't object to the bureaucrats' having the bulk of authority. But the idea behind politics is that the politicians chosen by the people should have the ultimate responsibility. If everyone is content with listening to the bureaucrats' explanations, then what we have is not politics. Therefore, I am anxious to shift to a system within which the politicians and the political parties chosen by the voters accept responsibility. [Sasaki] In other words, we have the bureaucracy, and the political parties form another group. Conflict between the ruling party and the opposition seems to be extremely fragmented and peripheral. That's what you'd like to change. [Ozawa] Yes. The bureaucrats constitute a large government, and the political parties and politicians remind me of a noisy, argumentative, disorderly mob. It's ridiculous for the ruling party to be submitting questions to the bureaucrats. It's the ruling party's government, after all. [Sasaki] There is a great deal of public interest in decentralization. Exactly where will this issue be debated? No matter what the central government does, we're never going to see decentralization if someone doesn't get the local authorities moving. Clinging to a Regulated Society [Ozawa] The Japanese say that they want deregulation, but I doubt that most of them really do. Life is easier in a regulated society. Local governments feel the same way. They complain about the inconvenience of petitioning, but they would be scared to death if we said, "Here's the authority, here's the money. Now you handle everything." This fear permeates all of Japanese society. People talk about decentralization, and it's true that the central bureaucracy doesn't want to give up any of its authority, but local governments don't really want decentralization. In that sense, a deregulated, independent society would present difficulties for everyone. The business world complains about the annoyances and inconveniences of bureaucratic control. Its members complain to us, too. But when they come upon hard times, they run to the authorities, begging to be bailed out. If they declared that they didn't need the help of the bureaucracy, then nobody would argue with them. But as soon as they have a problem, they rush to the bureaucrats. That's why the bureaucrats shout at them. This mentality prevails in the business world, and that includes its top-ranking members as well. So, if politicians and bureaucrats were able to concentrate on more important assignments, many of the details could be entrusted to local government. [Oikawa] These ideas have been discussed in various settings for some time, but nothing seems to come of them. Even the reports issued by the Council for Administrative Reform have been limited to topics that the bureaucracy finds acceptable. [Ozawa] Without question, making reforms in the manner which I have suggested will be extremely difficult as long as things are running smoothly. For instance, no one is going to think seriously about the tax burden for welfare as long as things are going well. Recently, when we were addressing the problem of a Citizens' Welfare Tax, we were asked, "Why this, all of a sudden?" But our society is aging rapidly. If we told people that Japan's economy is in serious trouble, then they would start thinking seriously about this problem. If you ask people to think calmly about the problem of the tax burden, you will find that more than 50 percent agree with us. Both politicians and administrators were bewildered by the sudden outbreak of the Gulf war. But in the future, our politicians will face an increasing number of problems that require them to make decisions. When those problems arise, they will have to be considered seriously. Then, I think politicians and bureaucrats will be forced to change. And for that change to take place as smoothly as possible, politicians must become aware of the necessity to change. You can write out a schedule and convince yourself that it will work, but, I assure you, it won't. At least, that's what I think. [Oikawa] The Hosokawa cabinet came into power with political reform as its main mission. A political reform bill was finally passed, The Uruguay Round was brought to a successful conclusion. Now the cabinet is attempting to overhaul the tax system, and it looks as though that problem will be resolved, too. There are many policy problems that need to be addressed. Which do you think should be given priority? Responsiveness to International Situations [Ozawa] There are domestic problems that need attention. But basically, since the international community is in a tumultuous state of transition, the first thing we should do is to establish a system that can respond to these changes. In a sense, that too is political reform. The electoral system reform bill, which should be concluded soon, may provide an impetus. Once that has been done, we should act quickly to reform politics. That means setting up a system within which politics gives rise to responsible decisions, which are then implemented. In order to accomplish that we need to form at least two groups capable of governing the nation. I wouldn't even mind if there were three of them. An international crisis may arise that ignites domestic problems. The sooner we create such a system, the greater the likelihood of our being able to respond to such crises with agility. That is our most pressing task. How will we do it? What should our priorities be, and how will we decide? Those questions can be answered by whoever is running the government at the time. If the voters cannot accept what that government does, they can vote in people who support their views. That's how democracy is supposed to work. With Japanese-style democracy, no decisions get made, but we cannot go on this way. [Oikawa] In other words, the first priority is to establish a political system within which decisions get made. [Ozawa] Yes, and I cannot emphasize this enough. Other problems can be dealt with individually, through discussion. [Oikawa] I would like to move on to political reorganization. I am convinced that the implementation of the new electoral system will trigger another political reorganization. The possibilities are numerous. Could you tell us your thoughts about that? Also, I've heard that Hosokawa may make a move, perhaps even during the current Diet session. Could you discuss that as well? Political Reorganization Will Happen Quickly [Ozawa] I am in general agreement with Prime Minister Hosokawa's perspective on this subject. We now have 300 small electoral districts. This plan was previously proposed by the government. Everyone has gotten used to that scheme, so when the Diet passes it, everyone's thoughts will focus on the new district system. Every politician will be thinking about strategy -- what district he should run from, and how he can win. Therefore, I think political reorganization will proceed more quickly than the media has predicted. [Oikawa] Your comment about political reorganization proceeding more quickly than the media predicted is very interesting, but I would like you to say a little more about the process. [Ozawa] At this point, I have no idea about what the process will be. I am surprised that the situation is moving forward much faster than I thought it would. However, if you're asking about the main factor involved in political reorganization, it will certainly be the elections, since elections are the arena where every politician must fight his battles. There's no other way to put it. At the same time, what will be completely different from old-style politics is that Japan must assume more independence to keep abreast of the tumultuous changes in the international situation. We must decide for ourselves what to do and what not to do. The difference in opinions on this subject may be another factor. When there are people in the same party who are at opposite poles on an issue, it will be very difficult for that group to remain intact. Traditionally, the LDP has included people with a wide range of views, from leftists to rightists. One might characterize the coalition in the same way, but the point I am trying to make is that the current configuration, with the coalition on one side and the LDP on the other, is by no means the final one. I have a feeling that there will be more upheaval. [Oikawa] So, you're saying that the end result is not going to be the current LDP versus non-LDP configuration, and even if that remains the key configuration, some will leave the non-LDP side, and some LDP members may join it.... [Ozawa] Probably. The media has an easy time of it--to them, everything is LDP or non-LDP, black or white, yes or no, but that's not what's really happening. I think there will be new determining factors, factors that play a much more important role than the traditional ones in establishing the new order. [Oikawa] The LDP versus non-LDP concept is a leftover from the 1955 system, isn't it. [Ozawa] Yes, that's right. [Sasaki] Another subject that looms large in the mind of the public is our living standard and, in particular, economic problems. The 1955 system has been linked with one type of economic structure or system. Deregulation will certainly be a factor, but in a more general sense, changing Japan's economic structure will lead to a conflict between those who favor the status quo and those who want politicians to show leadership by making major changes. How much will that conflict affect political reorganization? Developing New Industries [Ozawa] To put it simply, I think that the business world and politicians who specialize in economic policy will divide into two opposing camps--those who wish to retain the system we have now, and those who want to change it. Positions will be determined by opinions, and there will be a conflict between those who want to respond to the changing times and those whose view is, well, more historical. During the postwar years, Japan resurrected its economy and succeeded in achieving significant economic growth, but the limits of that process have been reached. From now on, it will be difficult to achieve economic prosperity through quantitative expansion. Therefore, unless we generate a technological revolution and use the intelligence and expertise of the Japanese people to produce high-value-added products, Japan will not be able to survive. But corporations, lacking foresight, invested huge amounts of money in facilities and are now struggling to survive. Their facilities are capable of producing twice the current demand. They are carrying 10 percent more employees than they need. They are at a loss as to how to solve these problems. They can abandon their facilities, but not their employees. So, we have to find an economic structure, a standard of living, that will allow a mature society to survive without the quantitative expansion that has been taking place. Since, as I mentioned earlier, industry is saddled with a 10-percent personnel surplus, it must develop new industries and technologies. The government should become actively involved in this problem. Corporations must, of course, also restructure. "Experts" on economics make irresponsible pronouncements like, "Japan leads the world in high technology," but that's not true at all. Japan leads the world only in applied technology. Very little basic research is being done here. We are far behind the United States. We must change our way of thinking and create a system which allows Japan to take its rightful place in the world by using our own inventiveness to create high-value-added products, and by undergoing a continual technological revolution. The government must support these endeavors. Furthermore, if economic growth remains at a low level even after corporate restructuring, the economy will, for a time, cease to function smoothly. Then, the government will have to tackle structural problems by, for instance, providing housing in major metropolitan areas, and social capital in other regions. It's not just hammers we need--Japan's investments in information, culture, education (whole areas like those) are lagging far behind other nations. So, while we establish a stable society, the government needs to increase its investment in these areas in order to create overall demand. By doing so, Japan will increase its assets to the level enjoyed by Europe and the United States. During this period, it will probably have to borrow money by issuing government construction bonds. We should get started on this project with a clear vision in mind. While the government is working on these two projects, it will also have to address three other major issues: how to manage a welfare state on its way to becoming an aging society, how to select the appropriate welfare system to adopt, and how to determine the taxpayers' burden. [Sasaki] Which segments of society will help you lay the foundations when the time comes? Which ones will support these ideas? Freedom With Fairness [Ozawa] With the establishment of the present government, the traditional Japanese voting patterns have ceased to exist. Previously, labor unions supported the opposition, and non-unionists the ruling party. Urban residents supported the opposition, and agricultural and rural districts the ruling party. I think that from now on our citizens will vote for politicians who share their views on issues that affect them directly. Some will want our regulated society to stay the way it is, and others will want more freedom. These will probably be the major trends. Our regulated society was designed with fairness and balance in mind. For instance, currently we have the problem of general contractors and their methods for bidding on construction projects. Why did Japan adopt a designated bidding system? Because if we hadn't, the big corporations would underbid midsized and small companies, and the latter would be ruined. The United States has had free competition ever since its founding. There, the winners survive. That's how it's always been. This is a political philosophy. Americans claim that Japanese society is totally controlled by regulations and by bid-rigging. I'm not suggesting that we should have total freedom like the Americans. We have to maintain fairness. But we must have a little more freedom in the areas where we compete internationally. That will, in a way, lead to the opening of our markets. The point I wish to make is that we should allow open competition in areas that warrant our doing so, without violating the principle of fairness. If there is more freedom, we will see more innovation. If we don't do that, we won't be able to compete. The Japanese must first get used to that idea and then give it serious consideration. I also think that we should deregulate as long as we are not compromising fairness and equality, and by that I mean we should encourage people to act independently and responsibly. [Sasaki] May we assume then, that, in other words, when political groups are formed, a sort of social reform could be considered a unifying factor? [Ozawa] Yes. The same idea applies to national security and international relations. Freedom means independence. When we're given freedom, that means that we have to act responsibly. So, we must become independent as a nation, and as individuals and corporations, too. We have to allow a little more autonomy. The difference between this philosophy and the one that maintains that we can manage quite well with the present system will influence political alignment. [Oikawa] Specifically, how will these ideas influence the politics of the future? If the 1955 system is to be dismantled, and more freedom is allowed, as you just described, how will that affect the reorganization of political parties? [Ozawa] Both the LDP and the opposition have become complacent in our regulated society. The more regulated a society is, the more susceptible it is to structural corruption and collusion. It is better not to have regulations. The disadvantage of regulations, which are devices used to ensure fairness and equality, is that they become entangled with power, and can easily be a breeding ground for collusion and corruption. These problems can be corrected. Contemplating a more serious problem, what to do about Japan's future, might open people's eyes to the regulation problem; and this is a problem of political reform. [Oikawa] So, you're saying that opinions on Japan's national goals and its role in the international community will diverge, and that the view that Japan should become self-sufficient within a new, constantly changing, international situation, will have advocates and opponents, and both will influence political reorganization? [Ozawa] Yes. Future reorganization will be based on policy considerations like these. What kind of policies do we want? What kind of nation do we want? What kind of politics do we want? What sort of international contribution should we make? Differences in views on these subjects will play a much more important role in reorganization than they have in the past. [Oikawa] I understand that you favor a basic security law which would include provisions for Japan's international contribution. Would you like to mention specific suggestions for such a law? The Need for a Basic Security Law [Ozawa] Even if two groups with differing philosophies are formed, we need to have total agreement between them, arrived at after thorough discussion between the two about international relations, especially national security. When our Constitution was drafted, the need to include these subjects was not anticipated. Therefore, we must declare Japan's desire to be a peaceful nation and to support and abide by UN policies, by drafting a basic security law, in order to make these things absolutely clear to all our citizens. There will have to be agreement between political parties on these issues, since they are of vital importance. We cannot be in conflict over these matters. [Oikawa] With the establishment of a new electoral system, questions have arisen about how elections are to be conducted, such as whether two or more parties can join in supporting one candidate, or whether a candidate can be backed by only one party. No More Multiparty Backing [Ozawa] Apparently quite a few politicians and Diet members don't understand the new election law. The public doesn't understand it either. With the revision of the election law, political parties will designate candidates, both in the small electoral and proportional representation districts. Therefore, multiparty backing or cooperation, the idea of the "recognized group," will cease to exist, although some people don't seem to be aware of that fact. Candidates must be supported by one party. Candidates supported by Shinseito or the SDPJ will remain Shinseito or SDPJ candidates, and that's that. Of course, unaffiliated candidates may run for office. If, under the new system, we were to obtain the support of, for instance, the SDPJ, the DSP [Democratic Socialist Party], Komeito, and Rengo, then that would give us an advantage. We would win. But even if members of the SDPJ, Komeito, and the DSP ran under that sort of banner, that is, even if they had multiparty support, they couldn't win one-to-one against the LDP. At least, that's what I think. Therefore, we have to fight the election battle as one political party, and not depend on cooperation or multiparty backing. I don't mind if Shinseito, Komeito, and SDPJ continue to exist as separate parties, and I'm not saying that it is a bad idea. But if we don't change our ways in the next election and put all our efforts into the election as one party, then we're not going to be able to win. On the contrary, if we do manage to accomplish this and do a good job of it, I think that it will be very easy for us to obtain the approval of the voters. [Sasaki] I, too, think that ultimately what we need is a changing of the guard. When new people enter the world of politics, the approach to politics and the decisionmaking process will change. Could you tell us about your views on candidacy? [Ozawa] This is an idea I got from Great Britain. I would like politicians to seek public subscription. I'm a second-generation politician, and I've heard a lot of criticism about politicians' backgrounds. Second-generation politicians and former bureaucrats seem to be special targets for criticism. If politicians take a test and pass it, then that sort of criticism will disappear. If it is acceptable to everyone, I'd like to have a system where, when a new group is formed, it seeks public subscription and can survive by doing that. When that happens, politicians currently in office will beg to be exempted from the examination. It would be terrible if they all failed (laughter). [Oikawa] Currently, the members of the ruling coalition, the SDPJ, Shinseito, Komeito, Japan New Party, DSP, and Sakigake have significantly different views on the direction this nation should take. Various rumors have been spread, among them that the Shinseito and Komeito have formed a bloc, that the Japan New Party probably won't join it, and that Sakigake might not, either. [Ozawa] I don't see any need to think about which party is good and which isn't, or which politicians are good and which aren't. For instance, I'm satisfied with Hosokawa as the captain, even if a new group is formed. I have no idea how others feel, but what is wrong with his supporters forming a group? There are basic philosophical differences within the coalition, but those exist within the LDP as well. I think that if a new group is formed within the coalition, no matter which party it turns out to be, that the coalition can be run without serious dissension. [Sasaki] You have been active for a long time in postwar politics. What praise or criticism do you have for that era, and what do you think your role has been as a participant in postwar politics? Conservatism Means Changing With the Times [Ozawa] The basic philosophy of postwar politics is often referred to as the "Yoshida Doctrine." But my interpretation of that doctrine is different from that of most LDP members, particularly those who preceded me. I view the Yoshida Doctrine as a plan that was established to ensure Japan's survival as a nation after its defeat. Therefore, I think that the idea that the Yoshida Doctrine should be followed through all eternity, and that it should remain the governing philosophy of the LDP or of conservative politics, is wrong. Given the choices we had at that time and later, during the Cold War, the Yoshida Doctrine was the appropriate policy for Japan's revival and future growth. Today, when major changes are occurring, those who believe that the Yoshida Doctrine should be followed to the letter, and the changing situation should be ignored, are not really conservative politicians. Conservatism does not mean preserving longstanding abuses. It is even stated in the Five-Point Imperial Covenant that the principles of true conservatism are responding to the changes that occur over time, making needed reforms for the benefit of the people, and doing away with the abuses of the past. Don't misunderstand me when I use the word "conservative." The word took on another connotation during the postwar era, when we had conservatives versus reformists. I'm talking about the true meaning of conservatism, in a broad sense. The time has come for us to change politics. During the past 40-odd years, the old way of thinking served its purpose. Politicians emerged in response to the needs of that era and, as I said before, there was no need for them to concern themselves with international politics or extraneous matters. They needed to concentrate only on economic recovery, and were able to rely on the United States in all matters concerning national security. They endeavored to distribute the nation's wealth equitably. Politicians who were able to accomplish such goals came onto the scene. That was good enough. So, it is not their performance that is at issue. But if the question is, "Can we go on this way?" then I'd have to say no. The old system just won't work any more. The Japanese have a special talent for working out a consensus -- the best possible solution for the majority. Wealth should be fairly distributed. The idea behind democracy is for those with divergent interests to reach a consensus, and we still need that aspect of democracy. But we must turn our thoughts to the living standard of our citizens, our economic activity, and the survival of our nation. It is those issues that politicians must address. We have entered an age in which politicians need a great deal of foresight. [Sasaki] Is Prime Minister Hosokawa's position on these issues very close to yours? [Ozawa] Yes, in that is he an advocate of responsible reform. I, too, have called for responsible reform, and worked to achieve it. Hosokawa has a good grasp of the times and of the tasks that he must accomplish. [Sasaki] In Hosokawa's writings, I sense his strong commitment to his political activities. Perhaps, one might call that leadership. Are leadership and responsibility the most important requisites for a leader? The Need for Leadership [Ozawa] I've said many times that Japan's politicians have managed quite well in the past without making any decisions. But from now on, there will be an increasing need for Japan to make responsible, independent decisions. Therefore, we will need prime ministers and other high-ranking officials who can demonstrate leadership and accept responsibility for their words and actions. When I speak about my philosophy on this subject, the media and others accuse me of wanting to create a powerful nation, but they are completely wrong. That's the sort of argument you hear from people who haven't divested themselves of Japan's "village society" mentality. What are we going to do if our prime minister doesn't make any decisions, doesn't say anything? Japanese society will be ruined. The prime minister must make responsible decisions independently and implement them. If he makes a mistake or if he loses voter support, then he'll just have to resign. The person who replaces him will do what he thinks is best. That is what democracy is about. It is not about simply accepting the position and making no decisions whatsoever, which is what the arguments of those who object to this way of thinking imply. [Oikawa] Another thing, is there a possibility of a tie-up between the ruling coalition and part of the LDP? No Tie-Up With the LDP [Ozawa] The philosophy behind the reforms we've been working for, in other words, the reform of postwar politics, parliamentary politics, is based on creating a system within which two or more groups capable of assuming the government vie for power, which alternates between them. Such a system would bring an atmosphere of tension to politics, and would bring about democracy in the true sense of the word. In parliamentary politics, it is natural for the ruling party and the opposition to talk to each other, and I have no objection to that. But that is not what I'm talking about. Parties should be formed for political reasons. This tie-up could not possibly happen. Why did we go to the trouble to form another key group? Our efforts would become meaningless. If that's what we had wanted, we could have stayed in the LDP. Therefore, I think it's fine to cooperate with the LDP and to hold discussions with its members, and I think we should do that. But they will remain our rivals. We should compete with the LDP for control of the government, but I cannot envision a political tie-up or coalition with the LDP. In terms of the cabinet it would be a coalition, I guess. [Oikawa] In the March issue of THIS IS YOMIURI, we carried a discussion between Michio Watanabe and Jun Eto. A save-the-nation coalition cabinet which would include Watanabe was proposed. What is your impression of Watanabe? [Ozawa] I think that Watanabe has a good grasp of the trends within the mainstream of the LDP. His views on the electoral system differ slightly from mine. But I find myself in agreement with his views on dealing with the international community, Japan's future direction, and his belief that the taxpayers should bear an appropriate share of the burden for supporting our aging society. [Oikawa] In conclusion, I'd like to hear your analysis of your own career. Earlier, you emphasized the qualities that a leader should possess: leadership and responsibility. Do you envision yourself in a position of leadership, in the cabinet, that is? The reason I ask this question is that, in Tanaka and Takeshita-style politics, the person who controlled the largest faction didn't become prime minister. He would exert his influence by supporting suitable faction members. That's the way LDP politics was run at the end of the party's reign. Now that you are secretary general of Shinseito, an extremely influential position, some people interpret that as a dual power structure. Would you comment on that? [Ozawa] Whoever heads the administration must demonstrate leadership. At the same time, such leadership can be exercised to advantage only after the public recognizes it. Therefore, Hosokawa is an appropriate leader for these times. I don't think that I am suited for such a position and have no ambitions in that direction. But since you mentioned Tanaka and Takeshita, let me say that my present position differs from theirs. I'm not hiding behind the scenes, I'm the secretary general [daihyo kanji] of Shinseito. That corresponds to the secretary general [kanji-cho] of the LDP. Since I have been asked to take care of the party's personnel matters, I intend to do just that as long as I'm wearing this badge, no matter what. For instance, Tanaka wasn't personally involved in party personnel matters, nor was Takeshita. Since I officially hold a position of responsibility in this organization, I find this comparison strange. [Oikawa] You've been described as aggressive, and even as a fascist by one group in the LDP. What is your response to such comments? [Ozawa] I make a habit of saying and doing what I think is right but, in Japan's village society, no one speaks out. No one in a prominent position speaks or acts responsibly. Through the years, everyone has sought consensus and safety in numbers. In that light, what I say and do is unusual. I do not enjoy being the target of criticism, but if the Japanese and Japanese society don't change, we won't be able to survive in this new era. Since the voters have elected me, I owe it to them to speak responsibly, as must anyone in my position, secretary general. Let me use a figure of speech, or an example, to illustrate what I mean. Minobe [former governor of Tokyo Prefecture] once said, "If even one person is opposed, I can't decide anything." This is the same thing we hear all the time--from the LDP, from everybody. How in the world are we going to make any progress? There are 120 million people in this country. What is going to happen if we say that we won't do anything if even one person is against it? Anyone in a position of responsibility must make decisions. I encourage exchanges of opinions, of course. It is impossible to avoid decisions simply because there is opposition. If I'm accused of going against the traditions of Japan's village society, then I can't deny that, nor can I behave otherwise. The voters will be my judges. [Oikawa] Thank you for giving us so much of your time.
