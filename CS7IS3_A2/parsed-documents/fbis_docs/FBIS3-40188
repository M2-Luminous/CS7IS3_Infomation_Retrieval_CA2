Forty persons, including scholars and officials from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, and Turkey, as well as Chinese scholars, officials, and entrepreneurs, attended the meeting. To help the reader understand the relevant situation, we now introduce below the gist of the speeches, made by Xu Dan, deputy director of the China Contemporary International Relations Institute; the important statements made by (Kasianov), director, and (Aleinov), deputy director, of Kazakhstan's Strategic Research Institute, which is directly under the president; as well as the papers read out at the meeting by Zhao Chunguang [6392 4783 0342] of Mongolia's Northeast Asia Institute: I. China's Reform, Opening Up to the Outside World, Economic Situation China's reform and opening up to the outside world has been going on for 15 years. It has caused fundamental changes in China's socioeconomic features, and has caused us to find the path of building socialism with China's characteristics. With Deng Xiaoping's important speech while inspecting the south in 1992 as the starting point, in China's economic development and its reform and opening lup to the outside world, there has appeared a vigorous momentum with the following characteristics: First, China's economy has entered a new long period of high-speed growth. Last year's Gross National Product (GNP) was 12.8 percent higher than that of the year before, and industrial production grew 20.8 percent. It was the year with the biggest growth since China's opening up to the outside world. In agriculture, a bumper harvest was wrested--a 3.7 percent increase over that of the year before last. In the first half of this year, the GNP grew 13.9 percent compared with that of the same period last year, and the gross value of industrial output grew 25.1 percent. In agriculture this year, summer grain set a high-output record. This momentum of high-speed growth did not happen by chance: It rests on the foundation of the results obtained by the three-year economic readjustment began in 1989. In this period there were bumper agricultural harvests in successive years, there was a big improvement in the capacity for supplying energy and raw materials, there were successive years of a surplus in foreign trade, there was a big increase in saving deposits, and successes were obtained in all economic reforms. In addition, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech on his southern tour at the right time and the holding of the 14th CPC Congress gave China's economic development a looser and more comfortable policy and environment. Second, a major breakthrough was achieved in China's economic reform. Last year's 14th CPC Congress proposed that the goal of China's economic reform be to establish a socialist economic system. This is a complex piece of social systems engineering, and its main parts are: 1) Accelerate the pace of economic reform and estalish a modernized enterprise system, so that the enterprises truly establish a modernized enterprise system, so that the pace of price reform and establish a unified open, orderly competitive market system; 2) accelerate the transformation of government functions and establish a macro regulation and control system that meets the demand of socialist markets; and 3) accelerate economic legislation and establish a legal system that meets the needs of the socialist market economy. Third, China's opening up to the outside world has entered a new historical stage. In the past it was mainly the southeast coastal region that was opened up to the outside world; now the opening up has expanded to riverine and border cities and to interior provincial capitals and cities, forming a new pattern in which from east to west, from south to north, with provincial capitals as the center, the opening up to the outside world radiates to surrounding areas in all directions. In 1992 China's import and export trade totaled $165.6 billion, a 22 percent increase over that of the year before. Foreign businessmen invested $1.116 billion in China; 470,000 of the three kinds of enterprises were approved for registration, exceeding the total for the past dozen or so years. In the first half of this year, China's import and export trade totaled $77.81 billion, a 13.4 percent increase over that of the same period last year. This shows that China's political stability, social stability, and economic development filled with vitality have made foreign investors better understand that China is an ideal place for investment. Currently, in China's economy, while there has been rapid growth, there have also appeared some fairly prominent problems, which are mainly manifested in: First, the scale of investment in fixed assets is too large, and there are too many newly built or rebuilt projects, causing a drop in macro investment results. Second, the financial and banking situation is fairly grim, and the contradiction between low financial income and high financial outgo has added to the difficulty of an imbalance between financial income and outgo. Third, the restraining factor of "bottlenecks" is prominent, that is, there is an overall strain on transport and communication, and the supply of raw materials does not meet the demand. The shortage of funds adversely affects the normal production and business activities of many enterprises. Fourth, price rises are too high, and the pressure of inflation has increased. The Chinese government's policy for solving these problems is not, as in the pst, to adopt overall retrenchment, but rather, is, through deepening reform, changing mechanisms, optimizing structure, and improving returns, to ensure and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. II. The Situation After Central Asian Countries Became Independent and the International Effect The countries of Central Asia have been independent or more than a year, and in most of them the situation is fairly stable; based on our observations, the factors causing this stability are many-sided. First, these countries have powerful leaders. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan have swiftly put into practice the presidential system, and the leaders enjoy fairly high prestige in their own countries; constitutions have been formulated, and the "democratic system" under the leadership of a president has been put on a legal basis. Second, for economic reform a policy of steady progress has been adopted, and "shock therapy" is not practiced. While reforming, each country has put into practice a social security system, thereby alleviating the difficulties in life encountered by urban and rural residents in the course of reform, and ensuring social stability. Third, each country has put in practice a policy of nationality harmony; in formulating this policy, the government, in the country's economic and political life, takes into consideration the balancing of interests among the nationalities and the maintaining of a harmonious coexistence of the nationalities. Fourth, a religious policy suited to the national condition has been put into practice. The people of Central Asia have now obtained the freedom of religious belief. Religions can be freely propagated in Central Asian countries, but the government of each country clearly stipulates that religious forces cannot participate in governmental and political affairs, and cannot adversely affect the political stability of the country. Because of the above conditions, the situation in the past more than one year has basically been one of stable development. However, the Central Asian countries are in a transitional period in which there is a turn in the situation, their economic difficulties are quite serious, and politically there are many latent factors for instability. Continued stability and development in the future will depend on great efforts by the governments of these countries. After becoming independent, the Central Asian countries are daily enhancing and expanding their international position and influence, and Central Asia is becoming a region of interest and action by the international community. This is also determined by many factors: 1) Central Asia is located in that part of the world that binds together the European and Asian continents; it is the link between East and West, and its geographical position is extremely important. 2) Central Asia is a "treasure house of natural resources"; here there are abundant petroleum, natural gas, nonferrous metals, and other mineral resources. Some countries abound in cotton, and people call them "white gold countries." 3) Surrounding Central Asia are some important countries with diferent social systems and different ideologies and religious beliefs. The Central Asian countries are building closer contacts and developing relations of friendship with these countries, thereby playing an important role in balancing the various forces. 4) The economic level of Central Asia is that of the developing countries, and it is an important force in the international community for maintaining peace and promoting justice. III. Prospects for Cooperation Between China and Central Asian Countries Central Asia is a close neighbor of China's, and there are three Central Asian countries that border China; they are linked by common mountains and rivers, and the nationalities cross borders. As early as before the year 2000 or so, there will be a "Silk Road" that will directly link China and Central Asia. The Chinese government has rapidly established formal diplomatic relations with these countries, and has invited their leaders to visit China; has established a basis on the five principles of peaceful coexistence to develop relationships of equality and mutual benefit, good neighborliness and friendship; and has signed in many fields documents for carrying out contacts and cooperation. In many aspects there is an identity of interests between China and the Central Asian countries, and there could be a further deepening of cooperation and a wider development of relations. A. In the political aspect, the identity of goals between the Central Asian countries and China gives hope for maintaining peaceful, stable internal and international environments. This is because the Central Asian countries now face many arduous tasks: politically, they must consolidte independence; economically, they must overcome the serious difficulties encountered after independence; internally, they must give impetus to reform, open up to the outside world, and ensure the tranquil life of all people in the country. All of this must be done under conditions of international peace. China is deepening its reform and expanding its opening up to the outside world. Therefore, with China's and Central Asia's security interests being identical, they can cooperate hand in hand, both striving for the long-term security of their own lands and working in common to create world peace and a rational new order. B. In the economic aspect, the complementary nature of China and the Central Asian countries is very large, and the potential for them in this respect is far from being displayed. The superiority of the Central Asian countries lies in their abundant natural resources, a certain industrial base, and a gradually forming vast market. Their weak point is that they have a one-product economy, and they must import from abroad articles for use in industry and articles for daily use, and must import foreign capital and technology to develop processing industries and to exploit natural resources. At the same time Central Asia is an inland region; it lacks seaports, and its land communication depends on enhancement of its cooperation with surrounding neighbor countries. Because it has had more than 10 years of successful reform and opening up to the outside world, China has established a diversified industry with complete categories. It has a very strong capability in its processing industries, and it can export large amounts of light industry and textile, electronic, and daily-use products. Its building, mining, agricultural and plantation technologies have entered the world ranks, and it possesses the conditions for wider economic cooperation. The economic and trade cooperation between China and Central Asia is just beginning, and it may be conjectured that there are vast prospects for its development. China is accelerating its opening up to the outside world and its construction of its western inland and border regions, with the focus on developing the infrastructure for communication and transportation. In the next three years China will invest 8 billion yuan in newly building or rebuilding the railroad network in its northwest region. From now until the year 2000, China will build some trunk lines of a high-grade national highway that will crisscross the country east, west, south, and north. This will be advantageous to China's internal unblocked transportation, and will be even more convenient for enhancing its cooperation with neighboring countries. China and Central Asia also have more conditions to put into effect a joint communication network, thereby causing the renewal of the Silk Road to become a reality. C. In international affairs, China and the Central Asian countries have many common points. We belong to the developing countries and our fundamental interests are identical. The contacts, talks, and meetings of leaders of our countries prove that, on many major international issues, the Central Asian countries and China have identical views and positions and have similar stands. The position and role of Central Asian countries in international affairs are growing daily, and the relations of cooperation in foreign affairs between China and the Central Asian countries are becoming closer and closer. In the new structure of the pluralistic world, China and the Central Asian countries both qualify to become active participants in establishing a just and rational new international order. In brief, China and the Central Asian countries in political affairs should become models of countries with different social systems coexisting in peace for long periods of time and being good neighbors and friends; in culture, science and technology should become friends who learn from each other and who advance together; and in international affairs should become positive forces for maintaining peace and stability and for extablishing a just, rational new world order.
