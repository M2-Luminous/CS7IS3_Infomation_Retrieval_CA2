"I have not issued and will not issue any orders to the officers and warrant officers as to whom they should vote for," Baltin said. He believes the Army should be out of politics and servicemen should vote "as their conscience and mind tell them." The situation in the Black Sea Fleet and in the city of Sevastopol where the fleet headquarters is located remains calm, the press centre of the Black Sea Fleet told ITAR-TASS via telephone. The city is being patrolled by the police and the Navy. Joint patrolling was launched a month ago to clamp down on the growing crime in the Crimea. No closed polling stations have been set up for the Navy this time. Navy officers who are residents of the Crimea will vote at their local polling stations, deputy head of the Black Sea Fleet personnel department, said.
