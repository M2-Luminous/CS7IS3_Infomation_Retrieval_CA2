In a local radio programme monitored in the neighbouring Serb town of Banja Luka a proclamation was read accusing Izetbegovic of a policy of war with the creation of an Islamic state, a jamahiriya, in Bosnia-Herzegovina as its main objective. "The policy carried out by Izetbegovic so far has brought us to the verge of a catastrophe ... we could have separated from each other and remained in peace with the Serbs and the Croats, but they started to stir us up, to teach us that we are of Moslem origin and that particularily the Serbs have been our century-old enemies", the proclamation reads. Emphasizing that they wanted neither an autonomy nor a jamahiriya the Moslems from Tesanj called on their countrymen in Bosnia- Herzegovina to stand up against those who are for the continuation of bloodshed which will result in their eradication. "Do not let them push us into a prolonged war against the Serbs", the proclamation states calling on the Islamic fundamentalists to leave the Tesanj area and to let the local Moslems continue to live in peace with or besides the Serbs and the Croats. "We shall reach an agreement with the Serbs, let us not allow the fundamentalists to change our language and our culture", the Moslems from Tesanj said adding that they did not wish to prevent those who wanted to continue fighting for the "crazy ideas of a state founded on Islam". The proclamation is the most direct confirmation of numerous indications in the last few months about the resistance of the local Moslems from Tesanj to Izetbegovic's policy. There are also reports about agitations within the 110th Brigade of the Bosnian Croat Army (HVO), stationed in the Tesanj area, whose representatives contact units of the Bosnian Serbs more and more frequently with the aim of reaching a peace settlement. These efforts have so far not yielded results because of the resistance of the Islamic fundamentalists dominating the Moslem units, loyal to Izetbegovic in the Tesanj area.
