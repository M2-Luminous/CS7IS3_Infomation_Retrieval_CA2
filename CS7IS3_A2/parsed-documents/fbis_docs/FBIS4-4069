The Guangdong government has since late last year implemented the instruction given by the state to stabilize grain and oil prices to guarantee supply which was generally in a stablestate across the province. The grain stock was so abundant that the price was kept at about RMB [renminbi] 100 for every 50 kilograms of rice. As now is a time when the rural grain supply is temporarily in short supply and the summer grain crop is about to be put into storage, the provincial government decided to fill the market with 50 million kilograms of reserved grain to ensure an adequate food supply while 250 million kilograms of grain allocated by the state to the province isalso in place in the market.
