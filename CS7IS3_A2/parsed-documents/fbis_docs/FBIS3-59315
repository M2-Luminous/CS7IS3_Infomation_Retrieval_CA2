As compared with 1990, in 1992 only 187 kilometers of railway lines were added while the maritime transport capability of the Ministry of Transportation decreased by over 4,100 vessels. Coming into 1993, because of the limited increases in the capabilities of transport equipment over the past two years and the sustained high speed of economic expansion, the problems with constrictive "bottlenecks" have become ever more prominent. Extremely Limited Growth in Transportation; Obvious Changes in the Mix of Products Being Shipped From the beginning of the year to date, impelled by the continued strong economic expansion, transport demand has continued to swell, while the reciprocal transport output has stalled and not increased, or increased only microscopically. In the period from January to August, railway haulage amounted to 1.036 billion tons, an increase of only 1.7 percent over last year; maritime transport haulage increased only 2.6 percent, while the specialized transport units under the highway transport departments showed a decrease in output. This was in sharp contrast with the increases in the national economy. There were obvious changes in the mix of products being shipped. The shipment of investment type products increased greatly, while the quantity of the types of products normally shipped fell sharply. According to statistics for January to July, there was an average increase of over 10 percent in shipments of metal ores, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, non-metallic ores, mine construction materials, cement, chemicals, and industrial machinery, while there was a corresponding large decrease in shipments of phosphates, foodstuffs, cotton, fertilizers and farm chemicals, livestock, and farm sideline products. The decrease in volume was over 15 percent for all of the above products except for foodstuffs which decreased only 2.3 percent. The shipment of coal, which represents over 40 percent of total railway transport volume also fell 1.4 percent. Such decreases have seldom been seen in recent years. Regional volume of maritime transport of investment type products also showed very prominent increases: according to statistics, for the first half of the year alone, regional maritime transport of steel products, gravel, cement and similar goods increased al almost 30 percent over the totals for the same period last year. Passenger Volume Up Greatly, Ratio of Long-Distance Travelers Increases Since the spring of this year, and following the peak of the Spring Festival period, the off-season did not turn off and the peak season kept peaking, so that by the end of August, the volume of railway passenger travel had reached 703 million trips, an increase of 21.9 percent over the same period last year, with medium and long distance trip volume representing over 80 percent of the total. The average distance traveled rose from 315 kilometers in 1992 to 334 kilometers this year. By the normal practice of previous years, this would be the equivalent of running an additional 1000 passenger cars in the first half of the year. Gap Between Supply and Demand Widens, Transport Crisis Worsens Over the past several years there have been only limited increases in equipment capabilities and the exploitation of latent capabilities through renovation has just about exhausted its potentials, and the capacity for guaranteed shipment has fallen off greatly. According to concerned departments, the first half of this year represented one of the most severely critical periods in the history of the railway industry. The railway freight car demand-fulfilled rate has averaged only a bit over 60 percent; the gap between trunk route haulage and upper limits has been about 40 percent, both of these being some 10 percentage points below the normal year's averages. It has become difficult to guarantee shipment of materials for some major projects and national command type plans, such as coal shipments for the entire nation's chemical industry. The May command contract plan called for shipment of 162,000 tons while the actual shipment plan allowed for only 87,000 tons but less than 80,000 tons was actually shipped. For the iron and steel industry nationwide, the external cause of shortfalls in deliveries of steel contracted by the state was attributed to transportation problems in 62.3 percent of the cases of short deliveries. Especially in the south-east coastal areas this year, masses of passengers and freight required transport southward, causing the crisis situations along the already over-capacity Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Shanghai rail lines to become even more spectacular. Only a little over one quarter of the demand for freight shipment south to Guangdong can be fulfilled. Many of the factories and the mines along the trunk routes have already limited production or stopped production because they are unable to obtain guaranteed shipment. The crisis in passenger transport is also critical: along the trunk lines, the passenger car passenger overload rate is commonly above 50 percent. Some localities have been forced to use freight cars to clear out laborers awaiting transport. At present, while concentrating on the construction of basic railroad facilities, we should also work diligently to expand transport capabilities within a short period of time, concentrate on getting the railroads to organize their dispatching and establish a railway style of working, work diligently to increase the full-load, non-stop transport of railway freight cars and medium and long distance passenger transport, further cut back on short haul freight and short trip passenger transport, with the aim of having the railways continue to concentrate on the development of high volume, long distance, non-stop transportation.
