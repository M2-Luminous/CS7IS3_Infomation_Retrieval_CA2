FR940902-0-00073 FR940902-0-00010 Commenters requested that Private Industry Councils and other job training councils, as well as those who administer JTPA, be included in capacity building activities. It was also requested that the inclusion of front-line staff be made more evident. It is the Department's intent that capacity building and technical assistance activities be targeted to all personnel who staff and administer JTPA at all level of the system. Section 628.325(c)(1) is revised to include PIC's and other councils, as well as other related human service systems provided for in section 205(a) of the Act. The word ``administer'' is added to the definition of capacity building at §626.5, and ``front-line'' staff are included in §628.325(c)(2)(ii). Comments were received requesting further clarification on the use of funds for the upgrade of Management Information Systems (MIS). Section 628.325(c)(2)(iii) provides for the use of the 33 percent of the 5-percent incentive funds authorized under the JTPA amendments for the purchase of hardware and/or software only if directly related to capacity building and technical assistance activities of the National Capacity Building and Information Dissemination Network (Network). These 5-percent funds may not be used exclusively for MIS; §628.325(c)(2)(iii) sets forth specific guidance on the purchase of hardware/ software. Funding for MIS redesign is addressed in Training and Employment Information Notice 2&hyph;92, which provides for the use of PY 1992 6-percent incentive funds for MIS upgrading and re-design. Some commenters continued to express concern that the non-duplication provision in section 202(c)(3)(B) of the Act could seriously hamper State and local flexibility in developing products and delivering training. Section 628.325(c)(2)(iv) of the final regulations specifies that State and local capacity building efforts are to be coordinated and integrated with the National Capacity Building Information Dissemination Network (Network), pursuant to sections 202(c)(3)(B) and 262(c)(3)(B) of the Act. In order to maximize funds available, the Network will build, to the extent possible, on what already exists in the system. Through its clearinghouse, it will make information accessible to the JTPA system on current and planned Network products so that duplication of effort may be avoided as States and SDA's plan their capacity building agendas. Non-duplication should be viewed by the system as a means for maximizing scarce resources and not as limiting the flexibility of States and SDA's to tailor Network products to their own needs and/or to produce and train on similar or related products when local circumstances so dictate. Some commenters requested that the regulations mandate that the 33 percent of 5 percent incentive grant funds available to the States for capacity building be passed to the SDA level for capacity building and technical assistance activities. The final regulations continue to strongly encourage Governors to use these funds for the development of staff capabilities at all levels, and particularly for front-line staff, through a comprehensive capacity building and technical assistance strategy. While neither the Act nor the regulations require that funds be passed directly to the SDA's, the final regulations, at §628.325(c)(2)(ii), offer a variety of State options for ensuring coverage of SDA and front-line staff. Section 628.205 encourages Governors to share capacity building plans in advance with SDA's and requires that capacity building plans be included in the GCSSP. More specific information was requested as to what related human service programs are covered under section 453 of the Act. Section 628.325 (c)(1) and (d) includes those programs listed in section 205(a) of the Act among those human service programs. Several commenters requested clarification on the allowable uses for incentive funds by SDA's, specifically asking if there is any limit on the amount of incentive funds used for capacity building and if incentive funds can be used solely for administration. One commenter suggested a maximum limit of 30% on the use of incentive funds for administration in order to insure that their primary use focuses on training and capacity building. The Department intends to allow the SDA's flexibility in determining how their incentive funds are best utilized. Section 627.440(c)(2) specifies that incentive funds may be used without regard to cost limitations. However, a new paragraph (5) is added to §628.325(b) specifying that SDA's should use incentive funds for capacity building, technical assistance and services to eligible participants. The former paragraphs (3) and (6) in §628.325(b) which dealt with this topic are removed; the remaining paragraphs are redesignated accordingly. Further clarification on SDA capacity building responsibilities is also found in §628.420, the Job Training Plan. A technical correction is made at §628.325(c)(1) to include the citation of section 262(c)(1)(B) of the Act. SDA Designation Process The interim final regulations, at §628.405, clarified the SDA designation process. The language in the supplementary information section indicated that SDA designations are to occur every 2 years, consistent with the preparation of the 2-year GCSSP and the SDA job training plan. This information is incorrect and will be addressed in the context of discussing the comments received in this area. The regulations also: established minimum criteria to be used by the Governor in considering discretionary SDA designation requests under the provisions at section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act; provided clarification on the handling of competing SDA designation requests under section 101(a)(4)(A) of the Act; and defined the terms ``substantial portion'' and ``substantial part'' of a labor market area for the purposes of SDA designations under section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii) and (B) of the Act. A few commenters noted that there was nothing at section 101 of the Act nor §628.405(a) that indicates that SDA designations are required to occur every two years, as indicated in the preamble of the interim final rule. The concerns expressed in the comments were that to mandate that SDA's be designated every two years would be disruptive and would serve to increase the number of SDA's rather than decrease them as intended. The commenters are correct that there is nothing in the Act nor the regulations that requires that SDA's be designated by the Governor every two years. The preamble did not clearly convey the intent of the interim final regulations. The intent of the preamble was to indicate that SDA designations, when they occurred, were to coincide with the 2-year cycle for the GCSSP and the local job training plan. This was to clarify that SDA designations could not be made for an off year of a 2-year period covered by the approved GCSSP and local job training plans. Section 628.405 is amended to more clearly convey this requirement.
