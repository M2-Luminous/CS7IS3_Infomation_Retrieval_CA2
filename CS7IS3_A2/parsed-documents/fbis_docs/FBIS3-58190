At the same time, he reiterated that Greece does not accept any dialogue over the name of Skopje and added that it expects [Macedonian President] Kiro Gligorov to give practical proof of relaxing his intransigent positions. Among other things, the government spokesman said: [Begin Venizelos recording] We will exercise this presidency while bearing in mind the Community's practices and the true correlations of forces being formulated within the framework of the EU's institutional bodies and while adhering to the goal of European integration. Greece has already declared that it expects the Skopje government to follow some self-evident and fundamental dictates of international law. It expects the removal of national emblems that are Greek, an end to hostile and irredentist propaganda, and amendment of the preamble as well as Articles 3 and 49 in the Skopje constitution. I repeat, these are not demands by Greece but obligations stemming from international law with which every state -- and moreover every UN member -- has to comply. [end recording]
