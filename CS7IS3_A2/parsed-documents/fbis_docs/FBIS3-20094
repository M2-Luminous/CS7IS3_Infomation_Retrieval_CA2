Both central banks are in closer agreement than ever regarding their views and goals. This was stated by the presidents of the two central banks, Jean-Claude Trichet and Hans Tietmeyer, at the financial forum in Frankfurt. This event, which dealt with the French capital market and German- French cooperation in the financial sector, was organized by Paris Europlace and FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. In Paris Europlace more than 100 public and private organizations have united with the goal of making Paris internationally more important as a financial center. Speaking to about 500 leading domestic and foreign financial experts, the central bank presidents stressed that it is particularly important to present the policy of stability in a credible way. The newly created European Economic Institute is comprehensively supported in its work by both central banks. Trichet expressed readiness to give those countries of the European Union, which might need it, time to fulfill the necessary criteria of convergence during the development toward a European monetary union. When describing the current German situation, Tietmeyer warned against postponing necessary decisions. More flexibility on the labor market must be a priority issue at the moment, Tietmeyer said. Only then can the high unemployment be reduced. The latest wage agreements show that this is now seen more clearly than in the past. However, one is still hesitant about corrections. Both central bank presidents agreed that extending the fluctuation ranges in the European Monetary System, with which a crisis was mastered in August 1993, was a correct decision. Trichet called for a pragmatic and realistic method of action if the mechanism were to be changed again one day. Tietmeyer said that a potential date for narrowing the fluctuation ranges cannot yet be predicted. The advantages and disadvantages of such a measure must be weighed carefully. "I believe that, for the time being, one should be content with keeping the exchange rates de facto stable," Tietmeyer said. He promised that the Bundesbank will continue to examine whether there is leeway for further reductions of the interest rate. "However, this must not endanger the necessary further progress concerning stability," he added. He promised a continuing "policy of a calm hand." At a time of nervous markets the Bundesbank must and will keep to its course, he stated. [passage omitted]
