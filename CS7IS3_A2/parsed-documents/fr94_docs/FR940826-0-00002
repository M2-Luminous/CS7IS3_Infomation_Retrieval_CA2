FR940826-0-00002 FR940826-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 905 [Docket No. FV93&hyph;905&hyph;5FIR] Oranges, Grapefruit, Tangerines, and Tangelos Grown in Florida; Finalize Revised Special Purpose Shipment Exemption Provisions for Organic Citrus Fruit AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule to redefine the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' to mean those persons who handle citrus fruit which is certified as organically grown under Florida law, and requires such persons to certify that they will limit shipments of such fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruit. This final rule more precisely defines organically grown Florida citrus fruit, and is designed to increase the market for organic shipments. The rule was unanimously recommended by the Citrus Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Caroline C. Thorpe, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: 202&hyph;720&hyph;5127; or William G. Pimental, Southeast Marketing Field Office, USDA/AMS, P.O. Box 2276, Winter Haven, Florida 33883; telephone: 813&hyph;299&hyph;4770. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 87 and Marketing Order No. 905 [7 CFR Part 905] regulating the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 growers of these citrus fruits in Florida. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural growers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. A minority of these handlers and a majority of the growers may be classified as small entities.
