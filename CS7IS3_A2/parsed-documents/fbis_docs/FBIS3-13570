The source said that the detainees include 8th Division Commander Staff Brigadier General Salah al-Juburi and a number of middle-ranking officers and retired officers. A system for the control of retired officers has enabled the Iraqi Government to impose a procedure on them under which they have to report daily and sign the registers at military industrialization offices and Olympic Committee offices where they have to appear nominally for work every day, and under which they are not allowed to leave Baghdad or Iraq. This system is supervised by 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, son of the Iraqi president, a responsibility previously shared with him by Husayn Kamil al-Majid, who has been forced by illness to stay home. Meanwhile, a state of alert continues for the fifth day at the entrances to and in the main streets of the capital where cars are searched and the identities of passengers and pedestrians are checked.
