Drafing Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Brodie Rich, Project Manager and LT J. M. Losego, Project Counsel. Background and Purpose This new drawbridge presently opens on signal. Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr. requested that the Coast Guard conduct a study to determine whether scheduled openings would improve traffic conditions in the area. The bridge owner (Florida Department of Transportation) recommended hour and half-hour openings on weekdays and 20-minute openings on weekends during the season to reduce traffic delays. A Coast Guard evaluation of the proposal concluded that the very light highway traffic levels for this six-laned roadway and the frequency of bridge openings did not justify the proposed opening schedules. However, in order to eliminate back-to-back openings during the tourist season which create traffic congestion, a 15-minute opening schedule appears to be warranted. Discussion of Proposed Amendments The Coast Guard tested a 15-minute opening schedule between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily from December 1, 1993 through January 30, 1994, pursuant to a published Notice of Deviation (58 FR 65668; December 16, 1993). No comments were received in response to the Notice of Deviation. The results of the test indicated traffic backups created by back-to-back openings were reduced. The proposed rule would allow for a 15-minute opening schedule to cover the period from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily during the season (November 15th through May 15th).
