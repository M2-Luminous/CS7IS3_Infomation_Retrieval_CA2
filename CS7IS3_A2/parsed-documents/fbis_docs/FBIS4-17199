In the Balkans. Midnight and another, the 100th, check point along the "lifeline" from Belgrade to Knin, capital of Serbian Krajina, or to Pale, capital of the [Bosnian] Serb Republic. There are guys two meters tall standing there in camouflage gear, their eyes tired and their faces no longer wearing a smile. It is passport control. But there are Serbian anti-vehicle obstacles. The weather is damp. A Serbian fighter holds out his hand for the passport. Light begins to penetrate the night. "Hello, brother!" say the border guards, old people, and even children. We have been together, we Russians and Serbs, throughout time. You will remember "Anna Karenina." Where does Vronskiy go at the end of Tolstoy's novel? We have a common history, common memories, and even common enemies. That is the way it was. That is the way it is.... But how will it be in future? Here is an excerpt from a recent interview in the Russian press by Mr. Kozyrev: "Frankly, I am amazed how we suddenly fell in love with Yugoslavia and the Serbs, whom for over 40 years the communist regime simply could not abide. I can remember from my childhood a caricature of Tito wielding a blood-stained fascist ax. I did not for some reason think about the historical roots at the time. If we pursue a one-sided policy toward Yugoslavia, we take, for example, the side of Orthodoxy, what, in your opinion, will be the reaction of Russia? The reaction of those who are themselves Muslims or who are drawn toward Islam?..." We arrive! The foreign minister of a still great Russia is absolutely ignorant of History with a capital "H," which for some begins with Tito but for others begins much earlier. That first-rate diplomat Baron Dibich, who was sent to Serbia in the seventies of the last century on the orders of the tsar, wrote: "The uprising of the Serbs and their struggle for independence is a fact of great significance to Russia. The well-being of these two peoples is interlinked. Russia's misfortune means Serbia's ruin, while Serbia's ruin is Russia's misfortune. Russia will never be able to count on another people if it leaves Serbia in the lurch." However, Kozyrev, on visiting Belgrade for the first time, delivered speeches on indestructible historical links, but, on returning home, signed up to "the new political realities." We supported the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia without the participation of the Serbs. While declaring our love for them, the Serbs, Churkin was in Washington among the leaders of Croatia and Bosnia. There is no need to spell out how this was interpreted by the Serbs. Russia, having advocated sanctions against Yugoslavia, does nothing to get them lifted. If anyone lifts these sanctions it will be the United States. And then Russia will have nothing to do in the Balkans for 50 years or so. We Russians or, more precisely, the Russian Foreign Ministry, are either unaware of what is actually happening here in the Balkans or are deliberately screwing up our eyes to avoid seeing the truth and taking the situation in hand. Judge for yourselves. First, Churkin states that the Russian contingent of Blue Berets will never enter Sarajevo. A few days later and our guys are there. It is alleged that Washington did not notify Russia in advance of the bombing of Gorazde. Untrue. Our Foreign Ministry did know. At least Warren Christopher says so. Back to Kozyrev: A few days after his amiable conversation in Moscow with Karadzic he reminds his counterpart from Sarajevo, Silajdic, that Russia is not only a Slavic country but one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Such words were not expressed to Karadzic. All the propaganda clamor about Russian diplomacy's successes is designed for naive souls. The game has long been played on another field. The Serbs, by the way, are not so naive. They are simply tactful, and the proverb "Christ is in Heaven but Russia is on Earth" remains in their blood. It is no wonder that Karadzic should state after his visit to Moscow that "Russia is not, as is mistakenly thought in the world, such a defender of us as America is of the Muslims." There is no provocative subtext here, merely bitter words. And headlines such as "Whose Side Is Russia On?" and "Is Russia Trading Serbian Land?" are now appearing in Belgrade newspapers. As for Kozyrev's latest visit to Belgrade, there were the standard calls by him to Warren Christopher both before and after. And after his return Churkin's scandalous statement that it is time for Russia to...cease all discussion with the Bosnian Serbs. Many people think that Russian diplomacy is doing quite a lot in the Balkans. At any rate, it is clear even to the uninitiated that it is "busy." But this "business" increasingly reminds one of the agitation of someone running ahead of a political steamroller, darting first to the left and then to the left to avoid being crushed. In actual fact we have, to put it mildly, no diplomacy at all in the Balkans today. It is like a piece of plasticine from which you can fashion whatever you like. Everyone fashions whatever they like out of it. Everyone save us, save Russia. The Serbs love us out of habit, through inertia. But for what do they still love us today?
