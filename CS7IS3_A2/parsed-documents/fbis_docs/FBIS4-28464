FBIS4-28464 "dreas112_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 North Korea Anniversary of 3 Jun ROK Uprising Marked Anniversary of 3 Jun ROK Uprising Marked SK0306113594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1022 GMT 3 Jun 94 SK0306113594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today says in a by-lined article on the 30th anniversary of the heroic June 3 uprising of the South Korean people that the South Korean students and people will continue to fight vigorously till they have swept away the aggressors and traitors and established a true independent and democratic government by inheriting the fighting spirit of the participants in the uprising. The June 3 uprising of South Korean students and people in 1964 against the aggressive and treacherous "talks" between the Japanese reactionaries and puppets was a just anti-imperialist, anti-fascist democratic resistance to do away with the foreign forces and traitors and restore the national dignity and sovereignty. Thirty years have passed since the uprising, but the desire of the South Korean people to live in an independent society free from foreign domination and interference has not yet been realized. South Korea still remains a U.S. colony and military base and its people fall victim to it. Because of the flunkeyist treacherous acts of the Kim Yong-sam group the U.S. political, economic and military domination over South Korea is intensifying and the people's sovereignty is violated ruthlessly. Having brought the North-South dialogue to a total freeze at the instigation of the United States, the Kim Yong-sam group committed without hesitation such never-to-be-condoned crimes as unilaterally nullifying the "joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" which was adopted and effectuated by the North and the South and announcing its renouncement. The reality shows that independence and democratization of the South Korean society and national reunification can neither be achieved, nor can the nation avoid suffering a nuclear holocaust if such flunkeyist traitors and war fanatics as the Kim Yong-sam group are left intact.
