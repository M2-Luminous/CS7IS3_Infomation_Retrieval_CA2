This follows a claim by Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] Regional Organiser Thabani Dlamini on Wednesday that more soldiers had been deployed in the violence-torn areas in spite of IFP objections. Mr Dlamini said soldiers had blocked the only access routes to hostels and people had been prevented from going to work. SADF spokesman Maj Christo Visser confirmed that troops in Katlehong had blockaded some routes on Wednesday to better control the movement of weapons. This had been done after discussions with the IFP and the African National Congress [ANC], he said. The SADF had also agreed to build another road for hostel dwellers, he said, but was unsure about its progress. Mr Dlamini claimed the ISD had proved an obstacle to the seizure of power by ANC self-defence units on the East Rand. He claimed SADF troops openly sided with the ANC and that the decision by the Transitional Executive Council to replace the ISD with soldiers confirmed the IFP's suspicion that the council existed merely to rubber-stamp ANC demands. In reaction, Maj Visser said the SADF was in the townships to help police stabilise the area. "The South African army distances itself from any political party and is there to serve the community as a whole. In our actions the SADF is apolitical, neutral and fair." He said claims of assault and harassment were sometimes made to discredit the defence force.
