The statement said the battalions had been stationed between the regions under the control of the self-declared government of Northern Iraq and Chamchamal region in the Karkuk Province. There are six officers among the forces, possibly affiliated to the Iraqi First Corps, the statement said, adding that due to the harsh economic conditions and political isolation of Iraq, the number of the personnel deserting the army is increasing in the country. According to the sources close to the SAIRI, the Iraqi forces would probably intensify their military pressures on the northern and southern population, in addition to increasing their threats against Kuwait on the coming days.
