Question: Andrey Georgiyevich, the situation in Russian science is common knowledge; Russia has already lost many great minds, and there will be more losses. Does the ministry have any plan or idea to save at least what is left? Answer: There is an idea and we are trying to implement it as much as possible. While funding of research was virtually unselective under the former socialist State, at present we are striving to adopt expressly this attitude, which is foreign to our science. The market has shown how much people are worth. Those who were failures before do not shine now either. Whereas active, talented scientists are not needy today. They have the opportunity to earn well, serve as consultants for projects and programs, providing their exert opinions. The State is unable to support economically all scientific groups. Not a single state, even the richest one, can afford such luxury. A strictly selective approach is used in the United States, Germany, Japan and other countries. The State funds one project and freezes another, since it believes that there are more pressing problems at a given time. It is expressly this direction that our ministry is trying to follow. In short, there are three directions in our idea. The first is to give economic assistance to implement major pioneering projects and research programs that could raise our science to the worldwide level. The second is to support selectively the strongest and most promising research organizations. The third is to provide financial assistance to outstanding scientists deserving of worldwide recognition, as well as to the most gifted representatives of the young generation. The RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] has already won a decision, according to which the State pays high-class scientists something like an increased grant. Of course, the money is not commensurate with the research results, but still it is rather substantial assistance. Question: But this applies to basic science, what is to be done about applied science? Answer: Applied science should be funded on the basis of return. If the project is promising, the State must fund it, but not as was done before. Question: Please explain. Answer: In giving funds to support some laboratory or some institute, the State is giving, so to speak, an advance. When a buyer pays for a completed project, a specific part of the proceeds, let us say thirty percent, must be returned to the State. Question: Is this something like a bank credit? Answer: Yes, but on preferential terms, without payment of high interest. At the present time, our ministry is trying to involve commercial banks in this matter. In simple form, the idea consists of the following: A commercial bank investing in the support of innovative projects offers considerable preferential terms to creditors and, in turn, enjoys certain benefits from the State. It should gain from supporting innovative work. Question: In Russia, State research centers (GNT) are formed at the initiative of the ministry. As a rule, these are known research institutes that enjoy worldwide recognition. However, some specialized research institutes involved in applied science are also included. And this is wise: industry cannot live without applied science. How many GNT are there in Russia? Answer: At present there are thirty-six. Question: But there are hundreds of specialized research institutes. It appears that most of them are either doomed to fail or compelled to look for work on the side, rather than in their own field. Plants do not have resources at the present time for high-grade technologies and related research. I think this is a very dangerous situation for industry. Answer: Of course, we are striving to support specialized science, which is carrying out highly effective and promising work. But first the authors of such work must submit to us technical and economic validation, results of marketing studies and a business plan. Then this work is submitted to expert evaluation and, if it has merit, it receives budgeted funding. But this applies to pioneer projects that hold great promise. And if a new processor is developed, it is a strictly commercial development and its authors should look for buyers themselves. Question: Who evaluates the technical and scientific level of a new development? Answer: There is the Russian Institute of Scientific Expertise. It has a data bank with information about outstanding scientists, and they are called upon to do this work. The names of the scientists are kept secret, even we do not know them. The opinion of experts about a specific project is given in the form of a recommendation. The final decision is made by the ministry. Then, if the project is approved, we turn to the Government, prove its timeliness and obtain funding. Under present conditions of the Treasury, this is not a simple matter. As for GNT, and the list will grow, we believe that they should enjoy not only preferential credit, but also preferential rates for fuel and electricity. I wish to stress that the GNTs status is not given permanently, but for only three years. If the project does not yield the promised effect in this time, the State stops funding it. Question: Do the experts have some responsibility for the results of their work? Answer: Yes, unquestionably. This is stipulated in pertinent documents. But I wish to make a comment. Let us assume that our developers created an excellent computer and the experts noted its high qualities. But who is going to buy it when the Japanese sell the same one for one-third of our price? Or, for example, the problem with sugar. People come to us and offer a new technology for producing sugar from starch, and this would solve the shortage problem. But, how much will the end product cost? We find out that it is much cheaper to purchase sugar abroad than to use this technology to produce it. What sense is there in funding such a project? Today there is no problem with the technical execution of some specific task. There is another problem, that of its cost. Is it economically expedient? Scientific technological progress occurs at the intersection of technology and economics. The ministry is approaching problems of funding science from expressly these positions.
