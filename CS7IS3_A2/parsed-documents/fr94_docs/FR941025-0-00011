FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elissa Schwartz, Senior Paralegal, (202) 906&hyph;7908, or Deborah Dakin, Assistant Chief Counsel, (202) 906&hyph;6445, Regulations and Legislation Division, Chief Counsel's Office, Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington DC 20552. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 21, 1994, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) proposed several technical corrections to revise, clarify, or remove obsolete or ambiguous regulations. 1 1 59 FR 18979 (April 21, 1994). The agency received three comments in response to the proposal. Two comments were submitted by trade associations and one comment was submitted by a private law firm. All of the commenters supported the proposal. I. Amendments Described in April 21 Proposal Today, the OTS is adopting the amendments in the proposal, as described below. Stock Loans Section 205 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) 2 amended section 7(j)(9) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and modified the reporting criteria and procedures of that section, thereby superseding existing section 574.5(b) of OTS's regulations. Rather than amend section 574.5(b) to conform to amended section 7(j)(9), the OTS has chosen to rescind the regulation because the statute is self-implementing and OTS finds it unnecessary merely to repeat the statutory language. 2 Pub. L. 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2236 (1991). Directors Through its final rule on regulatory review, 3 the OTS lowered the number of directors required for a Federal savings association from seven to five, consistent with the required number of national bank directors. An additional reference in section 552.3, which was overlooked in the earlier rulemaking, is now being changed to conform with the new requirement. 3 58 FR 4308 (Jan. 14, 1993).
