The communique envisages the registration of all Tajik refugees who are currently outside their homeland. After the registration the UN should start giving them aid on a regular basis.

The inter-Tajik talks will continue in Islamabad (Pakistan) and Teheran (Iran) in a month, the personal representative of the UN General Secretary for Tajikistan Ramiro Piriz Ballon said at a press conference.

Answering questions by journalists, Ballon said that he sees no contradiction in the fact that Russia has geopolitical interests in Tajikistan. INTERFAX learned that late on 19 April the Tajik Government delegation is to return to Dushanbe.
