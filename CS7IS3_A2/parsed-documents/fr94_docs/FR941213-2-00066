FR941213-2-00066 FR941213-2-00042 (26) Distribution of ETM+data is scheduled to begin by late 1998. How many scenes of ETM+data do you (i.e., your organization) expect to purchase the first year they are available? Assume cost per scene is not a factor in your decision. ␣Less than 5 scenes ␣5&hyph;10 scenes ␣11&hyph;20 scenes ␣More than 20 scenes ␣I don't expect to purchase any scenes the first year ␣Don't know How many scenes per year do you expect to purchase in subsequent years? ␣Same as above ␣More than above ␣Less than above ␣Don't know (27) Several commercial satellite systems are being built that will supply very high spectral and spatial resolution data. How will the advent of such systems affect your use of Landsat data? ␣Landsat data purchases will likely increase ␣Landsat data purchases will likely decrease ␣No impact on Landsat data purchases ␣Don't know (28) Regarding planning for future Landsat missions, please rank the following capabilities in ascending order (1 to 7: 1 being the most important) of their importance to you. X␣ Maintaining ETM+image characteristics X␣ Improved spatial resolution in the Pan band X␣ Improved spatial resolution in the spectral bands X␣ Shorter revisit interval X␣ Imroved spectral resolution (more bands) X␣ Active sensing (radar capability) X␣ Other (please specify) XXXXXXX (29) Utilizing Landsat data in the future may require improved technological capability in your organization, e.g., ability to apply radiometric and/or geometric corrections to raw data. Such a requirement ␣Would be a major difficulty ␣Would be a minor difficulty ␣Would be no difficulty ␣No opinion (30) What other types of land remote sensing data acquired from space-borne platforms are you currently using or plan to use? ␣Spot ␣Resours ␣ASTER ␣IRS ␣Other(s) (please specify) XXXXXXX (31) Please provide your recommendations to the Landsat Program Management regarding the status, effectiveness and operation of the Landsat system.
