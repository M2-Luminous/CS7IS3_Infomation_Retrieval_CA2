Articles and thoughts were intended to increase the knowledge of the Kazakh reader about aviation and to draw more of our young people into that specialty. I myself worked in the sector for more than 30 years, and I am now a pensioner. I make the following observations: while we are a very great people, a great nation, there are very few of our young people in civil aviation. There are in fact many reasons for this. We have now become an independent people, and we are proud of the fact that Kazakhstan is an independent nation. This is a joy and a delight. However, for us to be a sovereign nation in fact we will have to have our own specialists in every sector, that is our own architects, our own pilots, our own ministers of state. Recently there have been changes, even if small ones, taking place in civil aviation in the Republic. One of the best things about this is that at the head of it all is one of our own people, a man called Amantay Bazarbayuly Zholdybayev. We must tell the truth. Since the formation of the Kazakh Civil Aviation Administration, there has never been a Kazakh holding the post of chief of the administration.. Recently the editors of ZERDE asked me to talk with the new head of the Civil Aviation Administration, and to exchange views, so that the people would know who he is and where he comes from, and to prepare an article for the magazine about my interview. I am not a journalist, nor am I a reporter. While I wondered in my mind how I could do it, I realized that I had done a certain amount of work in the aviation sector, and that its inner workings were somewhat more familiar to me than to others, and, for that reason, I should go ahead and interview Zholdybayev and write the article. I considered it my duty to today's young people as someone senior and as a former aviation bort engineer [sic]. It has been said by others, whether out of envy or out of a grudge, that the new chief has only flown an AN-2 and knows nothing about other kinds of aircraft. We must understand the reason for this statement and its basis. People, who have control of their own lives and who have not been as successful as they could be, should not be terribly jealous of others. According to what I know, Amantay has indeed flown an AN-2. He has flown aircraft such as the AN-24, IL-18, YAK-40, Tu-154, and IL-76, and has gained experience at several levels. Not only has he flown these planes, but, hitherto, has been in various management positions. You can tell this from the conversation below. [Akhmetqaliev] Amantay, from the beginning we have been a people who have known how to fly to the heavens, into the heights, into the blue. The passage of time has permitted our becoming a sovereign country. May you be successful in your new post! The people do not know you as well as they should. For that reason would you first of all talk about yourself? [Zholdybayev] What can I say about my biography?... I came into the world at the end of the war, that is in 1944 in Atbasar City, Aqmola Oblast. After completing school I worked on the railroad for several years. From childhood I have wanted to become a flier. Led by that hope, at 18 I entered the Civil Aviation Flier Training School at Karasnokutsk in Saratov [Oblast]. After completing this school, I returned to Aqmola. I began my career as a flier by flying AN-2s. Later I flew AN-24s. In time I completed the Civil Air Line Academy in Leningrad, the present St. Petersburg. Refining my professional experience and knowledge in this area, I learned to fly other kinds of aircraft and to master them. In general the profession of pilot has its own difficulties. You know there is a school for the mastery of each type of aircraft. [Akhmetqaliyev] You were a pilot and now you manage pilots. That is an art in and of itself. It is difficult to do two entirely different things. For example, I was by profession a bort engineer. I never took part in administrative/managerial activities. [Zholdybayev] I agree. Professionals should manage pilots and the aviation sector in general. During the years 1980-1983 I managed the Semey airport, after that I managed Qaraghandy Airport. However, starting in 1987 I was first deputy chief of the Kazakh Civil Aviation Administration. Thus, I well understood the difficulties and responsibilities of the chief of the administration. However, I am far from saying that I know everything. This is because life makes new demands with each passing day. I think that we are learning as things come up. [Akhmetqaliyev] It is well known that all of our aircraft and other technology and equipment are an inheritance from the former Union. We are now establishing connections with other countries as an independent nation. These connections are through air routes. However, travelers will be selecting more convenient and more comfortable aircraft in the future. Our aircraft cannot be compared with Boeings from the United States. For that reason, are there thoughts about purchasing much higher quality aircraft from foreign countries? What kind of commercial steps are being undertaken? [Zholdybayev] I am in agreement, my friend. This area is already something difficult for us. This is because we are suffering the pressure of financial exigency. Like others, we would like to purchase the latest aircraft. However, our purse is [too] empty for this. In the beginning we thought to purchase foreign A-310 aircraft. This powerful aircraft is the best in several ways, and is jointly made by all European countries. Last year the Moscow International Sheremetyev Airport purchased four of such aircraft. They are now flying from Moscow to various countries in Europe and Southeast Asian. Judging by what passengers say, these aircraft are comfortable and convenient. The situation cannot remain as it is. Our financial situation will improve, and, if every thing works out, I think that there will be a day when our travelers will ride on these aircraft. [Akhmetqaliyev] You were talking about shortage of finances. However, one thing worrying most people regarding aviation is the continuing rise in the prices of airline tickets. What explanations do you have to offer and what understanding can you provide? [Zholdybayev] The continued rise in the price of airline tickets is not connected with us. This is not something which is under our control or influence. Influencing this above all are increases in the price of fuel and other needed materials, equipment, and spare parts. In addition, we have to buy all these things from others. We make none of them ourselves. For that reason anyone can understand the degree to which we are under the control of others. However, common people consider it our fault when the cost of airline tickets is high. We must understand them. This is because today's prices cannot be paid by every other person. However, in an era of rapid change such as the present, they have no choice but to fly. Nonetheless, it is anticipated that only when prices begin to go down and the market economy is stabilized will our ticket costs be controlled. [Akhmetqaliyev] Amantay, as you yourself know, we must prepare more specialists among our young people for civil aviation. What I would like to ask in that regard is this: do you have thoughts about having our young people study in foreign countries, in developed countries in particular? [Zholdybayev] Indeed, I have such thoughts. However, the financial difficulties just mentioned will not allow us to achieve them. This is because sending our young people abroad to study will require foreign exchange. We have very little foreign exchange at present. We have it for some purposes, but not for others. As I have said, there is a professional school in Aqtobe City at the level of an institution of higher education preparing specialists for civil aviation. It will train pilot-engineers, copilot-engineers, and air traffic controllers. Our young people interested in these specialties will not have to go far, but can, on the contrary, be trained there. They must pass tests in Kazakh to be admitted. However, teaching entirely in Kazakh is something for the future. Thorough preparation will be needed for that. The most important requirement for those seeking admittance will be the best possible health. After that literacy and knowledge will be important. There is one thing I wish to mention in this connection. I must tell the truth. Our young people have no great interest in aviation. They are more interested in the specialized occupations that they encounter on a daily basis than in aviation specialties. This is only to be expected. For that reason, if we would like to increase the number of our own specialists in aviation, we must begin professional training within the walls of the schools. It would be all the more wonderful if we, like the Japanese, were to teach kindergarden children what is an airplane and who a pilot is. However, our young people can go to the Institute for Preparing Civil Aviation Engineers in Kiev if they pass the entrance exams in Almaty. There is an agreement between ourselves and that organization regarding the preparation of such specialists. [Akhmetqaliyev] Will aircraft be sold to individuals in Kazakhstan? Recently we have heard a great deal about an aircraft called MAI-890. Will individuals be able to buy this aircraft? [Zholdybayev] In most developed countries aircraft are sold to individuals. However, these are not very large aircraft, but aircraft seating two-three or five-six persons. Other than owners of major industries who need such aircraft, no one, no matter how much commotion they make or how famous they are, buys large aircraft. This is because they know the price and place of everything well. In addition, all things created by the hand of a person with a clear intention, and with advanced conceptions must serve the good of man. However, as for the MAI-890 aircraft you recently mentioned, it is true that it is a small aircraft built for commercial purposes. It is an aircraft which would be very convenient for sportsmen, farmers, geologists, firemen, motor vehicle inspectorate workers, and for herdsmen working at a distance. One could learn to fly it in a day. It is made from very expensive metal and from high quality technology. Was not the MIG-29 military aircraft tested by our first cosmonaut Toqtar Awbakirov? The MAI-890 is manufactured by a section of that plant [where the MIG-29 is manufactured]. Though we are behind in other areas, we used to make powerful and high quality military technology. The MAI-890 was evaluated highly by the famous German test pilot Doctor U. Unger. After flying the aircraft, he said: I realize that this aircraft was created by pure experts. It is small, convenient, and comfortable but we are doing nothing in particular to sell it. This is because its initial price at the 1992 Moscow air show was 15,000 dollars. The price has now risen further. [Akhmetqaliyev] In soccer there are the players and the fans. That is to say, we have heard that along with managing you are still going off on missions and flying. Is not it difficult to perform two such responsible tasks at once. [Zholdybayev] It is true, I still go off on long flights with Tu-154s and IL-76s. I notice no difficulty. In my view, it is good to fly to keep up the level of one's skills. In one way this helps me understand things more deeply as I set myself to the task of managing.
