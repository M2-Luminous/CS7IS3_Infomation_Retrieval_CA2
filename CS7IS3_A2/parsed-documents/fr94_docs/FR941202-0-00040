FR941202-0-00040 FR941202-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 91&hyph;ANE&hyph;39; Amendment 39&hyph;9065; AD 94&hyph;23&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney JT8D Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that requires installation and periodic inspection of temperature indicators installed on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube and performance of any necessary corrective action. This amendment is prompted by reports of high pressure turbine (HPT) shaft fractures caused by oil fires that resulted from internal leakage of thirteenth stage compressor discharge air into the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fracture of the HPT shaft, which can result in uncontained release of engine fragments, engine fire, inflight engine shutdown, or possible aircraft damage. DATES: Effective January 31, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 31, 1995. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Pratt & Whitney, Technical Publications Department, M/S 132&hyph;30, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark A. Rumizen, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7137, fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Pratt & Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on January 24, 1992 (57 FR 2857). That action proposed to require the installation and periodic inspection of temperature indicators (temp tabs) installed on the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment scavenge oil tube, performance of any necessary corrective action, and to require the installation of No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment hardware modifications for certain engines. On July 19, 1993, the FAA issued a Supplemental NPRM (58 FR 40083, July 27, 1993) that reopened the comment period, due to comments received and the determination that the bearing compartment hardware modifications do not adequately prevent internal leakage of thirteenth stage compressor discharge air into the No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment. That Supplemental NPRM proposed to require installation of improved temperature indicators to extend the compliance time for installation of temperature indicators, and to eliminate the requirement to perform No. 4 and 5 bearing compartment hardware modifications, in accordance with PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5944, Revision 2, dated June 8, 1992, and ASB No. 6053, Revision 7, dated May 24, 1993.
