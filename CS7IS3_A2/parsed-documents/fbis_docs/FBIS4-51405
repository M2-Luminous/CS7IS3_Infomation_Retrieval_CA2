Vice Governor Xiao Zuofu presided over the meeting and Executive Vice Governor Wen Shizhen delivered a speech at it. Wen Shizhen said: We should vigorously grasp the implementation of the appraised "three definitiveness" plan for conducting organizational reform among 42 departments under the provincial people's government. We should strive to put the plan in place by the end of May and carry out the reform in line with the demands set in the plan in June. For this, he put forward the following demands in his speech: First, various departments should break down the existing functions of their own. Then, in line with the demands of developing the socialist market economy, they should analyze and distinguish the functions one by one so as to determine which should be enhanced, which should be weakened, and which should be transferred. Only by clarifying these issues can we define the size of internal organs and staffers in line with the principle of "assigning personnel according to the work". Second, by proceeding from the whole situation, various departments must adopt resolute measures to implement the staff size approved for internal organs and the number of posts approved for leading personnel. They must be determined to fulfill the simplifying tasks of organizational reform. Based on the existing number of sections and offices, we should simplify them by cutting 30 percent of them and chiefly reduce the organs that are conducting self-management and self-service. Third, we should vigorously make proper arrangements for the surplus personnel and be determined to broaden the channels of personnel transfer. We should also encourage organs' cadres to open economic entities, to rend an enterprise, and to find a job in enterprises and establishments. Personnel whose age is near to retirement will be allowed to retire from their post ahead of time. Meanwhile, we should clear up the TDY personnel of organs. Fourth, we should explore reforms for the managerial systems of cadres and enforce personnel exchanges. Fifth, we should vigorously promote the reform among establishments and units. Through the reform we should differentiate the leading system, organizational establishment, staff size control, and the systems of personnel affairs and distributions of these establishments and units from those of the party and government organs. Efforts should be made to cut the number of units and personnel who are living on "royal grains". While citing the issue of boosting the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, Wen Shizhen said: Currently, most large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have not been enlivened. Particularly under the new situation of accelerating the establishment of socialist market economic systems, the pace in enlivening these enterprises has been difficult. It must be noted that through the reform and construction conducted over the past many years, these state-owned enterprises have possessed strong and actual strength in the economy and laid a solid technical foundation. They have also possessed a large number of talented personnel outstanding in science, technology, and management. Under the new situation, only by truly doing away with the fetter caused by the out-dated systems; straightening out their ideas of development; and concentrating their efforts on shifting the mechanism, conducting reform and readjustment, opening markets, and enhancing the management; can these enterprises bring their tremendous potential into play and be fully brimming with vigor and vitality. In citing the issue of enhancing the organizational construction of the provincial people's government, Wen Shizhen said: The provincial people's government has decided, by regarding the implementation of the "three definitiveness" plan as a turning point, to carry out consolidation among its subordinate organs and to further enhance the organizational construction so as to enable the organs under the provincial people's government to meet the demands of developing the socialist market economy and to better perform their duties. He urged these organs to regard their leading body as a focal point in enhancing the organizational construction. Efforts should be made to establish a system under which organs hold responsibility for the attainment of certain objectives in work. He also urged them to unswervingly wage the struggle against corruption and the campaign of encouraging administrative honesty and to resolutely score new results in the struggle and campaign. These organs should intensively formulate regulations and rules in various fields and strictly enforce their work discipline so as to meet the demands of their new functions. They should also further emancipate minds, heighten their spirit, and implement their work in various fields in a down-to-earth manner. At the meeting, Vice Governor Xiao Zuofu announced the opinions of the provincial people's government with regard to appraising again the staff size of working departments and the number of the leading posts of internal organs. In his report, the deputy secretary general of the provincial people's government described the work plan of the guiding group in charge of enlivening the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. Attending the meeting were vice governors of the province, including Cong Zhenglong, Gao Guozhu, and Zhang Rongming; and responsible comrades from various departments and units under the provincial people's government--more than 200 persons in all.
