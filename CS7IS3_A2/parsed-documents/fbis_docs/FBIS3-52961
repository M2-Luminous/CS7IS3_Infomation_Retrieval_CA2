First, the House reviewed the minutes of its last session, and approved them after correcting some paragraphs. Then, it listened to a letter addressed to the brother speaker from the brother prime minister. The letter contains an apology for the government's failure to report to the House this morning, Monday, 10 January 1994, corresponding to 28 Rajab 1414 Hegira, as it should have done according to a House decision approved in a session held on Wednesday, 5 January 1994. According to the letter, the brother prime minister is currently indisposed. Following a detailed discussion of the letter sent by Prime Minister brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the House accepted this excuse, with the understanding that the House can still summon the government and that a new date will be set by the House to hold a general debate on the government's policy statement and the House's statement on it in an attempt to learn the extent and level of implementation of what was mentioned in the policy statement. The House also issued the following decisions: 1. The brother prime minister, deputy prime ministers, and all cabinet members can dedicate their time to their missions, powers, and specialities which are constitutionally and legally determined. However, they should not engage in the political forces' dialogue committee at the expense of their responsibilities and executive work. This is because such engagement will obstruct the interests of both the public and the state's official institutions. 2. The House endorsed the government's order to all the officials and employees of the state's administrative bodies, institutions, and organs to proceed with their own tasks, according to one's field of specialization and work. It also endorsed the principle of awards and punishments in this regard without leniency or favoritism. 3. The government needs to subsidize the following basic food commodities: Wheat, rice, flour, and oils, including edible fat, as well as sugar, children's milk, and medicines. The official prices should be shown on these commodities through Yemen. Moreover, there should be supervision of prices to know the extent of abidance by the official prices which are set by the state, represented by the Ministry of Supply and Trade. Legal measures have to be taken against those who violate the official price list for these commodities which are necessary for the living of the public. The House will resume work tomorrow, Tuesday, morning, God willing.
