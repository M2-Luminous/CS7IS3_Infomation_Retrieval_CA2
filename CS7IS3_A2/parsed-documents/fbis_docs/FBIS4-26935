The fact that Guangdong's price rise situation has tended to ease since April is the initial result of a series of regulatory and control measures; however, Guangdong's market prices remain at a high level, and by no means should we be careless about this. Jiang Shanli indicated that the scope of Guangdong's price rises in April and May were 19 and 17.3 percent respectively. Relatively speaking, they have tended to ease compared with the first three months of this year; however, the margin of rises remains very high, and is a threat to the province's reform, development, and stability. Jiang said that since the beginning of this year, Guangdong's relevant departments have adopted a series of measures to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, as well as price controls, and have scored initial results. The major provincial price checks that began in March have played an important role in halting excessive price rises. Jiang Shanli analyzed the characteristics of recent changes in market prices in Guangdong: First, the range of price rises has tended to ease; however, the general price level remains high. Second, the price rise range of foodstuffs and agricultural production materials has tended to ease, while the range of price rises for services is comparatively great. And third, the margin of price rises is on par with the national average. He reminded people that, presently, many potential price rise factors exist. For example, various places have raised power prices at every tier since the merger of dual-track power prices at the beginning of this year; consequently, users have found power prices on the high side, with production costs rising. The effects of the petroleum products price reform in May, the grain price reform presented recently, and the soon to be implemented price reforms for chemical fertilizers will gradually make themselves felt. At the same time, wage reform in the province's administrative units and institutions have been effective one after another only recently, and some of the wage increases will be diverted to the consumer market, so directly affecting market prices. Besides, some areas in the province suffered drought earlier and now there is flooding. Agricultural production is suffering losses, which will directly affect market supply and people's livelihood. This being the case, he required Guangdong's price administrations at all levels to increase the magnitude of the great price check and to work hard to realize 90 percent coverage in adding explicit price tags to commodities by the end of July, earnestly implementing various price regulation and control measures, and strengthening the consolidation of power prices to lower the level of power prices in rural areas.
