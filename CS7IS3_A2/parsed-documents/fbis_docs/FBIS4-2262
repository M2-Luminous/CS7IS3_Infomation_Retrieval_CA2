FBIS4-2262 "drchi068_p_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 Central-South Region Hainan To Sell Off All State-Owned Enterprises Hainan To Sell Off All State-Owned Enterprises HK0704113694 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 7 Apr 94 p 1 HK0704113694 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Wang Xiangwei] [Text] Hainan province, China's largest special economic zone, yesterday unveiled plans to sell off all of its 33 wholly and partly state-owned enterprises in an ambitious move to fuel economic growth in the region. The massive sale to foreign investors includes an airline, two airports, a major power plant and a highway, according to Sun Lijun, the provincial deputy secretary-general. The sale would be conducted through public auction and individual negotiation, from tomorrow until next Wednesday, in Haikou, the capital of the province, Sun said yesterday in Hong Kong. Sun said a 27 per cent stake in Hainan Airline would be sold to foreign investors. An official of the airline later confirmed the deal. He said the airline planned to raise U.S.$27m (about HK$210.6m [Hong Kong dollars]) through an international placement of 70 million B shares. The move, analysts said, would herald the opening up of China's domestic aviation market to foreign investors, and foreign carriers in particular. The news followed a weekend announcement by the Civil Aviation Administration of China that the country would invite foreign airlines to buy into domestic carriers this year. Earlier, the Chinese government said two major Chinese carriers, China Southern and China Eastern, would seek primary listings on the New York Stock Exchange this year or next. However, both Sun and the Hainan Airline official declined to say whether foreign airlines were involved in the deal. Established in October 1989 and restructured into a joint-stock company in September 1992, Hainan Airline has five Boeing passenger planes flying 15 domestic routes. Last June the airline started to trade 96 million legal person shares on China's screen-based securities trading system STAQ [expansion unknown]. Last year, the airline, with a staff of 450, made 67.06m renminbi (about HK$59.55m) in profits. The provincial government would not set limits on how much foreign investors could buy for most of the 33 enterprises to be sold, Sun said. "In fact, we will encourage them to buy the whole of the power plant and the airports we have put up," he said. The sale of the state-owned enterprises highlights the unconventional and controversial methods often seen in Hainan. In the late 1980s the province caused a political storm after it announced that it would lease 30 square kilometres of land to the Hong Kong-based construction company, Kumagai Gumi, to develop a free port. The controversy centred around the fact that the leases resembled those which had been drawn up in the 1890s when China was forced to cede territories to foreign colonial powers. However, the deal was eventually approved by Beijing in 1992. Sun said the provincial government had already drawn up a series of provisional regulations to govern the sell-offs and it would set up a permanent trading centre, open to Chinese and foreigners, this Friday where enterprises could be bought or sold. The centre, like a stock exchange, would operate on a membership mechanism in which enterprises that wanted to buy or sell would have to do so through members. The centre would have 21 members, most of them securities and investment companies. Enterprises would be able to sell both state-owned and non-state-owned assets, provided they were properly audited. Investors would be able to buy the management rights, land-use rights, and intellectual property rights of the enterprises. Sales would be finalised through negotiations or public auctions at the centre. The Hainan centre will not be the first in China. Shanghai, Sichuan and Hunan already have similar centres. But Hainan wants to become the largest and most sophisticated in China. Ren Junren, the deputy director of the Hainan Securities Regulatory Office, said the centre would consider admitting foreign securities companies and linking up with other centres across the country so enterprises in other provinces could be traded. Of the 33 enterprises to be sold, Ren said only a few were losing money and some companies had big potential. In addition to the airline, the Hainan Airport Joint Stock seemed to be a good buy, he said. The company runs two major airports in Hainan. The Sanya Fenghuang International Airport, with an investment of Renminbi [Rmb] 600m, is due to open on July 1, 1994. The airport, close to summer resort Sanya City, is designed to handle 1.5 million passengers a year and accommodate Boeing 747 passenger planes. Construction of the Haikou Meilan Airport, at a cost of Rmb3bn, is due to start later this year and open four years later. The new airport would replace the current Haikou airport which was converted from a military airstrip.
