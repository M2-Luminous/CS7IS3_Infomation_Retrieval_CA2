Reyes] [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) breakaway Manila-Rizal Regional Committee (MRRC), the Visayas Commission, "and other rejectionist groups" have expressed willingness to engage government in exploratory talks. In launching the Free Lagman Movement (FILEMON) yesterday at the University of the Philippines PCED [expansion unknown] Hostel, Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman disclosed his detained brother, acknowledged MRRC Chairman Filemon Lagman, had expressed willingness to represent the MRRC, the Visayas Commission, "and other rejectionist groups" in exploratory talks with government once he is released from jail. It will be recalled former National Unification Commission Chairman Haydee Yorac had lamented government could not begin talks with the CPP opposition forces so long as they were not united and did not declare their willingness to participate in the peace process as a separate entity from the mainstream CPP forces under Netherlands-based Jose Maria [Joma] Sison. "The problem government is facing right now is (how) to make a policy decision to release my brother, because when I last talked to my brother, he said his group is now willing to engage government in exploratory talks, with the possibility of developing into formal talks," the Albay congressman said. "Of course, initiation of these talks will be premised on two circumstances: first is his release, because you cannot talk peace from a detention cell, and the second is that government is itself willing to talk peace," he added. Visayas Commission Chairman Arturo Tabara concurred with Mr. Lagman's views, saying "Ine-express namin ang aming openness at willingness na makipag-usap sa gobyerno, pero dapat muna nilang palitan ang kanilang patakaran na makipag-usap lamang sa puwersa ni Joma (Sison) [We are expressing our openness and willingness to talk with the government, but their policy of talking only with the forces of Joma (Sison) should be replaced]." "Interesado kami sa isang negotiated political settlement, ngunit dapat munang patunayan ng gobyerno na iaaddress nila ang mga root causes ng conflict [We are interested in a negotiated political settlement, but the government has to prove first that they will address the root causes of the conflict]." Mr. Tabara lamented government continued to deal exclusively with the mainstream forces even if "the opposition represents a sizable force with both party members and seven (New People's Army) companies." Mr. Lagman agreed, saying: "Government has been talking with Sison for how many years now, and still has nothing to show in the way of substantial progress." "Why is this government so concerned against hurting the sentiments of the reaffirmist (Mr. Sison's) group by (not) talking with the rejectionists, if this group is not afraid of hurting government's sentiments?" The MRRC circulated an official statement, signed by MRRC Chief Carlos Forte (reputed to be Filemon Lagman's pseudonym), which said, "We condemn government's position of excluding so-called CPP factions in entering into peace talks with them." "The Ramos regime knows for sure that the Sison and (National Democratic Front vice-chairman for international affairs Luis) Jalandoni-led CPP panel does not represent the entire revolutionary forces in the country," the statement said. "It has long been disowned by the autonomous Visayas Commission of the CPP and now by the equally autonomous MRRC of the CPP," the MRRC continued, adding, "Our openness to enter into peace dialogue with government is not in exchange for Lagman's release." "First, it is our way of recognizing that revolution does not automatically mean war, and that a negotiated political settlement could also be effective in realizing a substantial part of our revolutionary program," they continued. "Second, it is also our way of recognizing the people's clamor to pursue far less bloody and violent means to attain their demands." Mr. Tabara implied a negotiated political settlement with the MRRC would automatically include the Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB), referring to the urban partisan unit as "the ABB of the Manila-Rizal region." Earlier, the Lagman brothers and the MRRC had disavowed any link to the ABB, which has engaged in assassination campaigns against government counterinsurgency officials and suspected criminals.
