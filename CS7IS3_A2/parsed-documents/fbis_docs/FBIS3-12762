We laid the foundation of the new Islamic regime on the basis of the strong faith of our nation and on the leadership of Grand Ayatollah Imam Khomeyni--the blessing of God be upon him--as well as on welfare, security, peace, health, and a life coupled with the spirituality of mankind. We have suffered many hardships in this respect. After a 15-year struggle, we now continue, more than in the past, our human and Islamic efforts in the Islamic Republic regime, and we have painted a very bright and dignified future. It is hoped that the two countries relations will expand further in the interest of the two nations. Expressing gratitude for the message sent by you, I wish from God, glorious is his glory, the success and health of your excellency and the prosperity of the Muslim Afghan nation.
