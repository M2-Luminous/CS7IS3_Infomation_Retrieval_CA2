Toshiba envisioning this market growth is going to strategize the business largely by employing 2 kinds of MCM semicustom products. When the LSI design rule reaches less than 0.5 �m level, it will become difficult to lower the cost of LSI in order to produce a single chip on Si. On the other hand, Toshiba sees that the price of MCM which has a strong market demand will fall, its development time will be shortened, and the market will expand steadily. Customization will allow for the reduction of cost and development time. The packaging and wiring will be partially regulated by the company, and the chip will be used like design methods seen in a semicustom LSI. Of the two types of chips, one will be made on a ceramic baseboard in consideration of low cost, and the other will be made by deposition of thin film in consideration of performance. The design kit was developed jointly with CAD vendors following the method of development seen in ASIC. As for testing at this time, although the issue must be resolved in the future, the bare chip on board was interfaced by using a special socket. The MCM market is expected to grow and the sales of MCM employing a semicustom design and manufacturing method have started. The demand for MCM is projected to grow to ¥3-4 trillion in the year 2000. In order to accommodate the demand, low cost and short development time are essential (figure 1). For this reason, the shape of baseboard and the part of wiring inside the baseboard were regulated, and two types of MCM employing a design and manufacturing method following the idea of semicustom LSIs were realized. The importance of price constraints was emphasized with one type of MCM which started selling in October, 1993. The importance of the performance constraint was emphasized in the other type of the MCM which will start selling in April, 1994. Active promotion will take place starting from April, 1994. In design rule before 0.5 �m level, a single chip had a cost advantage for compact high speed functions requiring multiple chips. However, in LSI with high end logic on board when less than 0.5 �m level reached, it is viewed that MCM may be advantageous in cost in many areas. Furthermore, because of system integration, various kinds of processors will be placed on board and then MCM will become more advantageous. Before 0.5 �m level is reached, in terms of cost and characteristics, a single chip had an advantage by employing next generation Figure 1. ¥3-4 Trillion MCM Market Growth By Year 2000. Figure 2. Increase of Cost in Single Chip After 0.5�m Level. processing technology. After about 3 years, cost and performance were improved, and products using MCM were never created. In leading edge high tech devices seeking high speed, the ratio of preprocessing cost was rather high, and packaging costs could be ignored, and were not included. ¥3-4 Trillion Market Expansion In Year 2000 The size of MCM market is doubling every year. Aside from the demand from military and supercomputer makers, the reason for this demand is: (a) a need for MCM is found in high performance WS (work stations); (b) the lower cost of MCM is seen instead of using LSIs with high end logic on board after the 0.5 �m level is reached in large scale logic. The reason for (a) is because of the demand for small computer systems in which high speed, large scale, and short development time are increasing. A typical example is the WS, which plays a key role in the MCM market growth. Because of the requirement of high speed over 100 MHz, it is difficult to interface with the chips on board due to the wiring delay. On the other hand, because of the desirability of incorporating MPU, which is leading edge technology, in the system, business can not afford to wait for progress in the development of single chip on board such as catch SRAM. Competition in product development is fierce, and a half year delay will be caught by other competitors resulting in a profit loss of fifty percent. Also because communication devices such as ATM will need high speed, MCM will dominate the market. Even in an inexpensive commercial product, if the device is used like a computer game with a RISC processor and high speed graphics accelerator on board, MCM will be necessary. For example, screen compression expansion chips used for multimedia need 50M - 200 MHz, 10[.sup]6[/] - 10[.sup]7[/] transistors. Difficulty Of Producing Lower Cost Single Chip Furthermore, when design rule reaches the 0.5 �m level, large scale circuits such as high end logic on board will not be cost effective and the use of MCM will become more advantageous in some areas. In order to clarify this relationship, take the example of a system which consists of A, B, C, & D chips of some generation (see figure 2). Simply making single chips by employing the same generation technology becomes expensive. That is to say, a single chip needs a certain chip area and system scale. After 0.5 �m level, the relationship between cost and chip area will cause the parallel shift to an upward (rising) direction. For example, in the era of future microprocessors in 0.35 �m level, there will be four layers of wiring. Presently, LSI makers are studying low cost processing, but the process needed to obtain high performance makes it increasingly difficult to reduce the cost. In large scale chips, even if the next generation minute processing is used, there are cases in which a single chip will not yield a low cost. Realization Of Low Cost And Short Development Time In order to respond to the MCM market, the characteristics of low cost and short development time which were not found in previous MCM needed to be realized in addition to high speed, large scale, and compactness. Here a general classification of MCM technology is described: (1) Manufacturing technology such as a baseboard; (2) Design and CAD technology; and (3) Testing (table 1). Mainly the technology of manufacturing and testing will influence cost, and technology of manufacturing and design and CAD will influence the development time. Table 1.

In addition to a low price baseboard, if the same baseboard is used in various areas by customizing, low cost will be realized for mass production. The manufacturing time is shortened by already prepared baseboards that are regulated. In design and CAD technology (2), a tool was developed jointly with CAD makers to be used by system designers with no previous experience in MCM development. By using this tool, system designers can design MCM in a short period of time. In testing (3), common socket and test equipment were semi-customized in order to test a bare chip in which MCM on board will be placed. Therefore testing cost was reduced. Two Types Prepared Using Ceramic Baseboard In manufacturing technology (1), the reason ceramic baseboard is more advantageous in terms of cost than a printed circuit board or thin film baseboard is because of remarkable price drop in multi-layer ceramic baseboards. Ceramic is also suitable for the high speed and high integration demanded by the market. For a low cost product, ``TAM10C Series'' (figure 3) using alumina (Al[.sup]2[/]0[.sub]3[/]) ceramic multi-layer baseboard, and for high speed products over 100 M Hz, ``TAM10Z Series'' (figure 4) combining ceramic and deposit of thin film of Cu/Polyimide were developed. In reality, MCM-L using printed circuit board is cheaper, but the wiring rule is difficult. Also, MCM-D using thin film technology is high in performance but it is expensive. The big gap in the difference in cost and wiring density is quite extreme, and a feeling of Rtoo short for a sash but too long for a beltS reflects the demand (table 2). Table 2.

By doing this, the experimental product was manufactured in about four weeks which shortened the time needed for traditional products by half. In MCM-D/C in which Cu/Polyimide thin film is deposited, the ceramic part is standardized, and can be prepared ahead of time. Because ceramic baking time is eliminated, manufacturing time is greatly shortened. Prepare For Design Environment Following ASIC In design and CAD technology (2), in order to effectively promote MCM, a design environment which is easy to use and needs less time was built. From input of design information to analysis of heat and delay, total flows of design are integrated. Figure 3. MCM-C Using Ceramic Baseboard... Figure 4. MCM-D/C Thin Film of Cu/Polydimide Is Deposited On Ceramic Baseboard... MCM design flow can analyze system design, baseboard design, wiring, and verification. Following the pattern of ASIC, a development support tool, ``MCM Design Kit'' was developed jointly with Cadence Design Systems, Inc. in US, Mentor Graphics Corporation, and CAD vendors. MCM is designed by using a wiring tool which CAD vendors have, a transmission line analysis tool, and a heat analysis tool. The design kit has a library which has design rules and chip heat and delay information, functions to allocate terminals automatically, and functions to estimate heat and delay easily. The future topic in design is to form a model of chip function. The product this time interfaces with gate level, but in the future if large scale interface is considered, a functional model will be desirable. However, although the functional model of main processor and peripheral chips has started its sales quite recently, it will require a long time and a great deal of labor to realize the goal. Already some companies have produced a functional model, but the product is quite expensive and it will take 2 to 3 years to penetrate the market. Prepared Special Socket For Bare Chip In testing (3), the special socket will be used for the testing of the bare chip. The bare chip test will influence the cost of MCM. Because if the production of MCM is idled due to bad quality, then the production of other chips will be idled, which propagates the production idling problems. Employing a burn-in test using a special socket, will reduce idling time caused by failure. Considering the promotion of products, there is a limit for one company to supply several kinds of chips, and we wish to produce MCM which incorporates several chips on board supplied by multiple LSI makers. To do this, multiple semiconductor makerUs KGD (known good die) will be necessary. In the US, a few companies such as Intel Corporation and Micro Technology Incorporated have just started to supply these. Looking at the chip, it appears more expensive than a sealed packaged chip, and the problem of KGD is more severe. It will take two-three years to gain wide recognition for the bare chip. In module testing, different types of necessary sockets are eliminated and because of semicustomization cost increases are controlled. Designated test patterns will be necessary to check chip failures from certain pins at assembly after MCM is made. On the other hand, if a chip which has a boundary scan circuit on board is used, the problem will be solved. The report on the automatic tool which generates a boundary scan test pattern that was standardized as IEEE 1149.1 at JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) has already been announced. In the case of placing chips which do not have a boundary scan, the method of testing will be a future topic to study. In reality, test patterns performed by users or machines verify pass or fail tests. Furthermore, in order to interface to high speed chips, the development of testers for high precision multiple pin devices will be critical.
