Chavan sought to mark a watershed in Indo-U.S. relations when he told the Lok Sabha on Wednesday [March 2] that New Delhi would have to find out what Washington's intentions are. Mr. Chavan chose his words carefully. When he said it was absolutely clear the U.S. was not interested in helping either Pakistan or India but its own self, the Home Minister was suggesting that U.S. objectives in Kashmir were neither the protection of human rights of Kashmiris nor the elimination of a decades-old feud between two South Asian neighbours. That raises the question how the U.S. seeks to further its own interests in Kashmir and what these interests are. Mr. Chavan's statement is unlikely to elicit more than a staid explanation from Washington that its objective is to ensure human rights in Kashmir and elimination of tension between Pakistan and India which has the potential of a nuclear conflagration. But such officialese will not help in lifting the cloud of misunderstanding that is creeping into Indo-U.S. relations. Mr. Chavan's statement should be read in the context of two others that Indian ambassador in Washington Siddhartha Shankar Ray made in recent weeks. The import of Mr. Ray's first pronouncement was that India is aware of the grey areas of America's human rights record and the nature of possible minority demands, but has refrained from mentioning them. The second statement was that the idea of holding a plebiscite in Kashmir is an absurdity. Together, these assertions mean, first, that none should pelt stones at others while sitting in a glass house and, secondly, that to be able to help common friends engaged in a feud, one must be aware of the ground realities to acquire the minimum credentials to be an honest broker. The Clinton administration is astonishingly out of touch with the realities in South Asia. Unless Washington wants a strategic base in an independent Kashmir, it is difficult to see why it must persist in making statements at the level of Mr. Clinton and Ms. Raphel the only consequence of which can be boosting the sagging morale of the militants. Mr. Chavan has asked Washington to explain its stand on Kashmir because Ms. Raphel questions the validity of Kashmir's accession to India and claims that she is reflecting the administration's view. At the same time, the U.S. charge d'affaires in New Delhi asserts that Washington's stand is different from what she says. The American explanation needs to be unambiguous. Unless it is so, doubts will grow about a carefully executed programme of disinformation to confuse India opinion-makers (politicians, media and professionals) and thereby weaken the Government's resolve to withstand extraneous pressure over Kashmir or non-proliferation. If the U.S. can demand Indian transparency over human rights in Kashmir, New Delhi can use a matching right to ask the U.S. to be transparent about its intentions in Kashmir. It is not polemics but a necessity, especially because the U.S. sense of involvement in Kashmir shows no signs of waning although its role as an honest broker has carried it nowhere. *
