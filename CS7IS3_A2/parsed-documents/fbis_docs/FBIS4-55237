His host was Senad Hadzifejzovic. [Izetbegovic] I think that this is a good agreement. Of course there were a lot of difficulties, particularly over the issue of cantons, but my first impression is that this was done well. I am particularly pleased by the solution envisaging the Neretva and central Bosnia cantons which will be typical cantons. Power will be shared in them and the Bosnian idea will be preserved in a way. I think that this is the best quality of the solution. Of course, the problem of implementation remains. I am afraid we could again have the problem of finding a way to implement the implementation [as heard]. I think that this indicates the preparedness of both sides to establish the principle of coexistence again. [Hadzifejzovic] Most of the media attention is focused on the post of the president and the upcoming changes. How do you comment on this as the current head of state? [Izetbegovic] I remain president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, a political body that should be a symbol of the state's survival as a whole. This is not a problem. I said yesterday and I sent a letter to our delegation in Vienna saying that this issue must not be an obstacle to the agreement. If a satisfactory agreement is reached in connection with cantons and other, in my view, more important issues, then this issue is not important. One also has to bear in mind that the president's term is restricted to six months and that a Bosniak has to become a president after the first elections. If elections are not held within six months there will be a rotation. This issue is not so important also because the vice president has great powers, i.e., main decisions will be made by consensus. [Hadzifejzovic] Does this mean that we will have the existing Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency alongside the rotating president and vice president of the Bosniak-Croat Federation? [Izetbegovic] Yes, if you remember, the constitutional law provides for this until the implementation of the new constitution and the Federation. It is necessary to preserve the Presidency as a political body that represents the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We should not take a step in the wrong direction by disbanding the existing state in favor of the Federation. We still insist on the survival of the republic as a whole and the existing Presidency represents the republic [word indistinct]. The future president of the Federation will represent only a part of the republic. This was already envisaged by the constitutional law. [Hadzifejzovic] Mr. President, in Bosnia-Herzegovina television newscasts we have, on several occasions, dealt with this question of the future organization of the federation as opposed to the current organization. There will obviously be state organs that will emerge following the first postwar elections, while there will also exist the state organs that stem from the agreement between the Bosniaks and the Croats. Do you fear that there may also be some problems in these circumstances? [Izetbegovic] No, I do not. It is a fact that the Assembly remains as a single entity. It has, however, as people say, this assembly has four faces. Nevertheless, it is a single entity. Sometimes it operates in one capacity; sometimes it does in another. There will be one government, not two. The presidency is to remain. I believe there will be no major problems in this respect if these powers are defined more narrowly. In other words, this current presidency has had to remain as a body that represents the republic. The problem of the army, of course--this fourth institution--the army is the most problematic issue. Hardly anyone has managed to merge two armies into one. This is an experiment we are going to try to carry out. I fear there will be difficulties. This process is going to be far more difficult than others. As for the rest, I do not think there will be any major problems. This is particularly so because there will be a single government. [Hadzifejzovic] What is your comment on the U.S. role in the signing of the Bosniak.... [Izetbegovic, interrupting] Their role was very positive and stimulating. Believe me, I think that, in part, their help is very direct. The fact that this took place in a U.S. Embassy helped in resolving some things. I have to reveal something. The negotiations were in serious crisis last night. Literally, they almost collapsed. I was talking to our delegation, to all the members. It was a long conversation, and the Americans mediated in such a way as to prevent the negotiations from stalling. Thank God, everything eventually turned out all right. As for my talks with Mr. Redman, let me tell you that these talks, relating to the next meeting of the contact group, are in progress. [Hadzifejzovic] Following this meeting, one can expect the next stage in the implementation of the Bosniak-Croat agreement. The position, the status, of Serbs in this future federation has been outlined? [Izetbegovic] First of all, the Serbs should accept this federation. In other words, what is going to take place on Friday at the meeting in Geneva relates mostly to the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state and, of course, our relations with the Serbs, as well as relations between the federation and the regions populated by Serb majorities--most of which are currently under the control of Karadzic's army. We will have to do something conceptually in order to save the country's unity. I believe that this is our priority interest: to preserve the external borders of the country. This is, in a sense, our interest. It will be our main goal on Friday. [Hadzifejzovic] Will this require some concessions on our part? [Izetbegovic] I cannot figure this out at the moment. It would not make sense if I were to reveal them at the moment. [words indistinct] what kind of concessions. I want to say that the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state will be the top item on this list of priorities.
