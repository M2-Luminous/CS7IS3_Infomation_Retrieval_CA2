FR941205-0-00007 FR941205-0-00002 Response and Disposition: Executive Order 12866 requires an agency to submit a draft proposed rule and an assessment of the potential costs and benefits of the regulation to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review if the agency or OMB considers the rule ``to be a significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of that Order. The Department of Justice considered the proposed rule to be a significant regulatory action and complied with the Executive Order by submitting a copy of the draft proposed rule and a summary of the reasons for the regulation to the OMB. See 59 FR 14784 (March 30, 1994). Executive Order 12612 requires a federalism assessment if a proposed regulation has ``substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.'' Whether policies have federalism implications depends principally on whether the policies would preempt state law or interfere with an area of regulation that is usually reserved to the states. If an agency determines that a policy has federalism implications, the federalism assessment must consider the costs or burdens the regulations would impose on the states and resources available to the states to offset the added costs or burdens. The Department and OMB determined that Executive Order 12612 did not require a federalism assessment of this rule. Regulations regarding immigration and alienage are an exclusive federal concern, and thus do not preempt state law or impinge upon areas of state regulation. Furthermore, Congress has enacted specific legislation governing the employment of aliens which authorized the promulgation of regulations on the subject. The rule also would not have a substantial direct effect on the states. While it is possible that asylum applicants not eligible to apply for work authorization might seek state benefits, the nature and degree of any such claims are at best an indirect effect of the adoption of new asylum procedures. Many asylum seekers have entered the United States illegally and are not eligible for most state benefits; and some state benefits, such as education, are available regardless of whether an applicant has work authorization. Meanwhile, the overall asylum reform effort should reduce the pressure on state public assistance benefits by more promptly granting asylum and work authorization to those deserving of these benefits and more promptly removing from the United States those who are not. Accordingly, there is no need for a federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 4. Filing Fee for Asylum Applications (8 CFR 103.7(b)(1)) Proposed Rule: The proposed rule would have amended 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1) to provide that a fee of $130 be charged for an application for asylum or withholding of deportation. Section 208.4(d) would have been amended to provide that an application be accompanied by such fee or by an application for waiver of fee in accordance with 8 CFR 103.7(c)(1). Comments: Comments supporting fees argued that asylum applicants should have to pay a filing fee if they can afford to do so, that the general public does not benefit from services provided by the INS, and that taxpayers should not have to bear the entire cost. Most comments, however, urged either elimination or reduction of the fee. It was argued that the proposed fee would unfairly punish persons seeking protection from persecution, treat asylum as a privilege limited to those who could afford it, discourage bona fide applications, and create a burden for the INS in administering the fee waiver provisions. Several comments claimed that the fee would be unfair in light of the proposed rule's limitation on an asylum applicant's access to employment authorization pending the adjudication of the asylum claim. Other comments stated that the amount of the fee was excessive: even if an applicant could not qualify for a fee waiver, he or she might still be unable to apply for asylum due to the overall cost, including those for an attorney, counselor, and interpreter, to complete the asylum application process. These comments unfavorably compared the proposed fee to those charged by The Netherlands ($25.00) and Australia ($30.00), the only countries that now charge an application fee, and suggested that a fee at this level would be more appropriate. Several comments also argued that charging a fee would not be economically efficient. Collecting the fee and administering a waiver system would create significant administrative costs. Adjudicating waivers, aside from being time-consuming, would increase personnel costs and paperwork, would add an additional step to the adjudication process, and would expose the INS to litigation over contested waiver decisions. If, as anticipated, a large number of applicants applied for and obtained fee waivers, the costs in administering the fee and the waiver might not even offset the relatively low amount of fees collected.
