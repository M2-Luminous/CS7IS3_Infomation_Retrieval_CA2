German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Chancellor Kohl interpreted the speculation about the new course of German foreign policy since unification as a demonstration of "distrust." The questions raised by Mr. Scheer on Bonn's attitude regarding the enlargement of the European Union and the geopolitical uncertainties linked to the move of the capital from Bonn to Berlin are legitimate. They put the finger on one obvious element: Franco-German relations have changed profoundly since German unification, in terms of both style and content. We are far removed today from the friendly relations between Roland Dumas and Hans-Dietrich Genscher. A less warm relationship has evolved between [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe and Klaus Kinkel; one which is marked by a coarser frankness. However, what has been lost in style has often been gained in efficiency. This was noticeable during the difficult GATT negotiations, where Bonn made a decisive contribution to the establishment of a compromise acceptable to Paris, and during the finalization of the European Union's joint position on Bosnia, whose only fault was that it came much too late. In terms of substance, the incidents which have peppered Franco-German relations in recent days underline the need to update the alliance sealed in 1963 by Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer. It is no longer a question of closing ranks in order to confront the threat from the East. If good Franco-German cooperation is necessary today, it is because it is impossible to confront today's challenges alone: How can unemployment be tackled in France and Germany without harmonizing the monetary and budget policies of both countries? How can the European Union make progress without defining the correct way of combining enlargement with deepening? These are all problems which call for straightforward explanations, not ritualistic invocations of the "unfailing" nature of the Franco-German friendship. It is true that the political timetable in both countries does not favor the smoothing out of accumulated differences. In the midst of a tough election campaign, Messrs. Kohl and Kinkel are tending to use a bit of muscle to rally the most conservative part of public opinion, which is very concerned about defending Germany's role in Europe and the world. In France, the differences in approach within the majority on European issues hinder the action of a government which has its eye set on the presidential elections in 1995. The Franco-German duo has certainly survived other disturbances in the past. However, the politicians would be well advised to calm a situation in which everyone has a lot to lose and not much to gain.
