It explains why the members of the initiating group united in the Liberal-Reformatory Alliance. The future party will propose its own program, based on the liberal doctrine which was and is the basis of modern Western civilization and embodies the essence of the liberal democratic reforms. Advocating the establishment of freedom in an atmosphere of law and order, the Liberal Alliance will strive to attain the goals of its program in the political, economic, and social spheres and will take action to strengthen the institutions of the civic society, to foster decentralized government, and to promote the encouragement, support, and legal protection of private ownership. The development of economic liberalism presupposes denationalization through the privatization of state property and the demonopolization of production. The initiators of the Liberal-Democratic Party want to create the kind of social environment in which the majority of people will live freely in an atmosphere of political and social stability. The reporters had many questions, and these were answered at the press conference.
