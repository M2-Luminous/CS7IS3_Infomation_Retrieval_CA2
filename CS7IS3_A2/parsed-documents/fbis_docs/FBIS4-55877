Surely the decision of the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] Sixth National Conference to exclude the children of active fighters against fascism and persons who have applied to join the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party] from holding leading posts in the SDS, along with other restrictions, goes beyond the bounds of what is reasonable? [Dimitrov] I have been able to state my view on this issue on several occasions, and I would like to make this clear. The conference was forced to make this decision because of circumstances that everyone knows about. In Bulgaria a crazy, untrue assertion is spreading and being repeated again and again, that half of those responsible for the communist rule are in the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], while the other half are in the SDS. It is understandable that no political force with any self-respect would, except on very rare occasions, place at its head, in its most representative organs, people who are wide open to attack. They may be the most conscientious people, they may be the most competent ones, but if they are open to attack, they will put both themselves and the political force in a bad position. I assume that this was the motive for the decision -- an honorable one, if one supports this thesis. [Neshkova] Nonetheless, surely one of the motives was to settle personal accounts within the coalition? [Dimitrov] Personally, I am against exclusive regulations and said so at the conference, but the conference was evidently inclined to adopt this decision on protective grounds. However, I want to make it clear that this decision has not changed anything substantial in the SDS. Of course, if the SDS wants to win, it will be very difficult for it constantly to have to explain why such-and-such or so-and-so is an exception to the rule, and so forth. [passage omitted] [Neshkova] You have declared that you oppose any mechanical means of evaluating future SDS election candidates and that if one of the proposed schemes is applied, Prof. Berov may receive a very high classification. [Dimitrov] This is not a completely reliable and sensible method of assessing candidates. I believe that some way can be found, and we already have enough competent people on whom we can rely. At the same time, I believe that it is sensible to discuss these candidates to obtain a sufficient guarantee. [Neshkova] What exactly does the decision to boycott parliament mean, now that the government is likely to be changed? [Dimitrov] Please allow the political force the right of surprise. The conference demonstrated a high degree of unity regarding the radical issues concerning the national situation, the ways of finding a solution to this situation, and its responsibility for finding ways to provoke early elections. [Neshkova] People are saying that the SDS "right wing," with which you are identified, won the upper hand. [Dimitrov] Responsibility means knowing what difficulties lie ahead and how they can be overcome. This is a very difficult position. [passage omitted] [Neshkova] Is it not true that the BSP has been greatly encouraged to act more independently, following the victory of the former Communists in Hungary, for example? [Dimitrov] I am sure that there are no grounds for this, because this is a historical process that at various times brought the former Communists to power in the former communist states. What is happening now in Hungary happened in Bulgaria in 1992, so that we are in front by a head in this historical cycle, and I am sure that very soon we will push things in quite another direction in Bulgaria.
