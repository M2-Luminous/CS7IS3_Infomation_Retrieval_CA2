The Haitian issue will be included on the agenda for talks that will be held in Caracas with U.S. Under Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. The sources also stressed that the United States has tried on several occasions to convince the Venezuelan Government to accept Haitian refugees. The UNHCR also has been negotiating directly with Venezuela on the issue, and Venezuela has replied that it is willing to grant temporary asylum because of the unique situation Haiti is now experiencing. Talbott will arrive in Venezuela on the evening of 2 June with a delegation that will include Alexander Watson, assistant U.S. secretary of state for inter-American affairs. Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador to Venezuela Jeffrey Davidow said: "Venezuela is the only Latin American country that is member of the Friends of Haiti group. Venezuela has always played an important role in the fight to return democracy to the island." The agenda of the Americas Summit, which will be held in Miami later this year, is another important issue that will be discussed. Unofficial sources noted that the Unites States is interested in proposing a "good government" policy; in other words, it wants to propose a fight against corruption.
