Petersen told a press conference he had raised the question of sanctions against the Croats at a meeting in Brussels Monday of European Community foreign ministers, but added that the matter had been sidelined by the massacre in Sarajevo and discussions on airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs. "The member states agree that the question of sanctions will be discussed soon," he said. "What we are looking at is either trade sanctions or, alternatively, the possibility of withdrawing the preferential status Croatia enjoys in its trade with the Community."
