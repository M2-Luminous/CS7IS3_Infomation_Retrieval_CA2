The official, who requested anonymity, said, "It is difficult for both donors and a recipient nation like Russia to sit at the same table." The official was responding to a news report that said President Boris Yeltsin hoped Russia will be allowed to join the G-7 group of industrialized nations. He made the remarks at a news conference with [the] German chancellor in Bonn. "Japan expects Russia to play a big role in resolving the Bosnia issue. Yeltsin seems to be pandering to domestic considerations in trying to show that Russia is a strong country and a big power," the finance official said.
