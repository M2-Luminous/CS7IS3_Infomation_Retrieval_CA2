Traditionally, the Attorney General's Office has only exerted disciplinary control over servicemen and policemen, punishing almost exclusively flaws in service and abuse of power. Based on a critical self-analysis, the office concluded this is not sufficient. That is why now, under the guidance of Deputy Attorney General Mauricio Echeverri Gutierrez, the Public Order Commission [Comission de Orden Publico] of that office is beginning a new strategy to try to exert a more preventive and immediate control. The bases of this new control program are the regional diagnostics on the public order situation in specific zones and the performance pacts in which citizens, the Armed Forces, and watchdog organizations participate directly. At the disciplinary level, the novelty of this program is that the Attorney General's Office is not only going to punish those responsible for an illegal action but also those who by omission allowed the illegal action to take place. So far, the Attorney General's Office has analyzed the public order situation in Santander's Middle Magdalena region, Uraba, south of Cesar, and Arauca. In Middle Magdalena, for example, said office conducted a study of the complaints against the police and found that most of them are related to irregularities during raids, arbitrary arrests, abuse during interrogations, flaws in intelligence reports, and harassment of civilians. "That analysis allows us to identify problems and recommend solutions to the police and Army so no more complaints are filed. The guarantee that our observations are heeded is that we do a follow-up every three months on the police in specific zones," Echeverri indicated. Among the recommendations suggested by the Attorney General's Office to the Armed Forces are: not to touch the scenes of battles where there are dead or wounded; notify immediately the appropriate authorities about the arrest of alleged offenders and raids; and allow the control corps to inspect the operations log. In the medium-term, the Attorney General's Office is going to insist that a national statute to conduct intelligence reports be drafted. "We cannot continue to conduct military or police operations based on rumors. That is why we must establish clear guidelines to prepare these kinds of documents," the official added. According to Echeverri, the new human rights protection program, which has an interinstitutional nature since control and security organisms participate in it, entails periodic checks. If citizens' complaints of abuses by soldiers go down that means the suggestions by said office are being heeded. "To avoid the distortion of the complaints, the Attorney General's Office pledges to evaluate and follow up every complaint to establish whether or not it is justified," designated Human Rights Ombudsman Hernando Valencia Villa said. Echeverri affirmed another of the virtues of this program is that permanent, direct, and immediate communications exist between the police and Army and control organizations to prevent problems. "The Army, for instance, has pledged to keep watchdog organizations informed of its operations. If they make an arrest or conduct a raid they pledged to report it immediately," the deputy attorney general noted. Echeverri and Valencia define this program as "a pact on a commitment between the Attorney General's Office and the Armed Forces." Another of the virtues of the new monitoring approach, according to Echeverri, is that the work by the watchdog organisms is decentralized because centralization has proven highly flawed. "The idea is to bring all the commands closer in a region and establish operations and control guidelines. We cannot talk here of an Attorney General's Office syndrome or of hampering military operations, but of all of us avoiding future problems for the Armed Forces," Echeverri added. The official indicated the program has been so effective that on the eve of the recent elections the Army, police, and Administrative Department of Security conducted a large-scale operation in Yopal because of reports the guerrillas were preparing a guerrilla offensive from there to hamper the elections. "The police," Echeverri noted, "in coordination with the Prosecutor General's Office and the Attorney General's Office conducted 50 raids, and only one complaint was filed involving a minor irregularity in the procedure."
