In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the regional people's government, said the state financial input is aimed at developing land resources instead of merely providing financial assistance to an underdeveloped area. He admitted that Tibet is the most economically underdeveloped region in China. However, he said, the central government and people all across the country have shown special concern and support for Tibet. The central government has stipulated a series of preferential policies towards Tibet and earmarked an enormous amount of money to help Tibet step up its economic development. In return, people of various nationalities in Tibet have also made great contributions toward safeguarding and building up this remote southwestern part of the country. According to Gyaincain Norbu, who was elected chairman in 1990, the central government has invested some 20 billion yuan (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet over the past 40 years. This has helped the region achieve sustained economic growth, national unity, and social progress. In 1993, Tibet produced 3.65 billion yuan (400 million U.S. dollars) in GNP, an increase of 8.1 percent over the previous year. The region registered fast development in agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, infrastructure construction and foreign trade. Gyaincain Norbu has stressed the importance of reform and social stability. "Tibet has no way out without further reforms or establishment of a socialist market economy," he said, adding that this is the key topic at the current session of the regional people's congress. He said Tibet's development depends on agriculture and animal husbandry, and the broad efforts of farmers and herdsmen. Only by developing these sectors and increasing the income of farmers and herdsmen, which make up 80 percent of Tibet's population, can reform, development and stability be guaranteed. The regional government will carry out the contract responsibility system, which enables farmers to make their own decisions in farm production and develop a diversified economy as well as township industries. Over the past few years, Tibet has invested over one billion yuan (110 million U.S. dollars) to carry out comprehensive agriculture development projects in the region's major valleys, such as the Yarlung Zangbo, Lhasa and Nianchu river valleys so as to build these areas into the region's bread baskets. The regional people's government has also planned a number of new construction projects, among which infrastructure will be the top priority. Hydroelectricity is the region's major power source and it has great potential for geothermal, solar and wind power development. Tibet is busy building such key construction projects as the Yamzhog Yumco power station and is renovating highways from Qinghai to Tibet and from Sichuan to Tibet, as well as the Bangda airport, he said.
