Speaking at a press conference in Bishkek on Thursday [27 January], the president emphasized that the arrival of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and the visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin planned for February "would assist with settlement of the issues concerning support of Kyrgyz industrial enterprises which directly depend on economic relations with Russia." "If we break these relations, there is a risk for the Kyrgyz to go back to their traditional nomadic life of cattle breeders," the president pointed out. For the time being, it is impossible to resolve the current economic issues, like supplies of equipment and fuel material and lubricants, without the assistance provided by Russia. This also threatens the future of agriculture. In connection with this, the president emphasized that double citizenship would conform with the interests in preserving the economic potential of Kyrgyzstan, since this would help to maintain the working potential of plants where most workers were Russians. He refuted the assertion that this might lead to destabilization of inter-ethnic relations. Commenting on the changes in the Russian Government, the Kyrgyz president said that the situation should not be exaggerated. "The reforms in Russia will continue since now they are irreversible," Akayev pointed out. In his opinion, Chernomyrdin was the man who could carry out the policy of economic reforms in Russia.
