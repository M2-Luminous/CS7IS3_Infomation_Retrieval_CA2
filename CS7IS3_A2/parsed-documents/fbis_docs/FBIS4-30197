Such a great honor was also granted some time ago to Mrs. Om in Okchon-ri, Kim Chaek City, Kim San-ok in Wonsan City, Kangwon Province, and Choe Kyong-ok in Pyongwon County, South Pyongan Province, on their 103rd, 101st and 100th birthdays. The number of centenarians is ever increasing in Korea where the most ideal health policy centred on the popular masses is in force. Entering this year, many folks greeted their 100th birthdays, among them Chong Chae-myong and Pak Yong-sun in Tokchon City, South Pyongan Province, Kim Chang-yong in Onchon County, South Pyongan Province, Kim Kyu-chul in Sonbong County, North Hamgyong Province, An Sang-o in Naknang district, Pyongyang, and Mrs. Kwon in Hoeyang County, Kangwon Province. Deep, indeed, is the loving care of Comrade Kim Chong-il for them. Regarding the increasing number of centenarians as a great pride of the country, he sent birthday tables to all of them and took various measures so that health care institutions throughout the country might look after their health with special care. In recent years, gerontology departments have made their appearance in the hospitals of the provincial universities of medicine and all the macrobian people throughout the country have been registered again and their health checked up. The registered long-livers enjoy medical care at central hospitals, wherever they may live. The state allots a large amount of fund to the recovery of their health. To cite an example, in February, Yi Pong-hwa, 94, in Hyuam-tong, Sadong district, Pyongyang, had his pneumonia cured at the Red Cross General Hospital of Korea through a 50-day free medical treatment that costed the state money equivalent to the two-year wages of an ordinary worker. The constant increase in the number of macrobian people in Korea is attributable to the popular policies of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government, the rapid development of health services, effective use of many mineral springs, the systematic improvement of the people's living, the custom of respecting the old folks that prevails in the society.
