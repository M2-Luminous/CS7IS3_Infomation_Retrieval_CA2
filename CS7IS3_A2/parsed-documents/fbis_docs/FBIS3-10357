It would not, however, be an exaggeration to say that this decision is very important to the Brazilian economy because it eliminates a threat that could strain our relationship with the United States. The much-talked-about lack of international credibility Brazil enjoys for not fulfilling its promises was denied in a note issued by Kantor, who not only recognized but also praised the Brazilian Government's efforts to modernize its patents law. Contrary to what many believed -- this daily among them -- President Bill Clinton's administration showed signs of understanding the reform process Brazil is experiencing, within a democratic framework, to be able to regain its place in the world market. In fact, it would not only be unfair but also politically inadvisable to impose retaliatory measures against Brazil precisely when it is trying, in the midst of all sorts of obstacles, to open its economy. As is obvious, the U.S. decision is the result of an intensive nine-month negotiation. There were times when it seemed impossible that the United States would not resort to the so-called Super 301 trade law to force Brazil to adjust to the patterns considered correct for the protection of industrial or intellectual property. As was even reported, Kantor is tired of Brazilian explanations that the approval of the specific draft bill was in Congress' hands, which led U.S. officials to believe the Brazilian Government had no political will to change the country's previous stance regarding patents. Even at the worst moments, Brazilian diplomacy did not become discouraged and kept open the direct as well as the indirect communication channels with Washington through the Foreign Ministry and the embassy. Brazil's position was clearly stated: If, after almost seven years of the Uruguay Round of talks, guidelines regarding intellectual property were established and the government officially promised to sign them during the April meeting in Marrakesh, there should be no controversy with the United States on the subject. All that needs to be done is adopt the regulations negotiated at the international level, which is what Brazil intends to do. Kantor's note significantly asserts that "Brazil has demonstrated its leadership role by promptly implementing Uruguay Round measures regarding intellectual property." This represents an undoubtable step forward because it clearly means that the United States accepts that international economic relations be established according to GATT regulations -- or those of the World Trade Organization (OMC) that will replace the GATT, without intending to impose its own regulations. Consequently, it is assumed that Washington will accept that international organization's ruling in case of controversies. Those who eternally uphold conspiracy theories will say that the United States will reach "secret agreements" with Brazil. In addition to being offensive to our two democracies, the argument sounds ridiculous. Is a secret agreement necessary for sovereign countries to promise to abide by international regulations and procedures? We must mention the contribution Kantor's decision has made to the success of the conference scheduled to be held in May in Washington where President Clinton will meet the democratically elected Latin American and Caribbean chiefs of state. Solving conflicts through negotiations is essential for the proposal of the economic integration of the continent's countries to make progress.
