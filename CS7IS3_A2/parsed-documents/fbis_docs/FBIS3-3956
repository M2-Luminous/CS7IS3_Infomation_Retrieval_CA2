"I think it's a storm in a tea spoon," Patten told reporters after Sunday's press disclosure that London had quietly drafted key changes to the Letters Patent before the Legislative Council had a chance to debate them. "Nothing has been done secretively," he said, adding: "I have to say as arguments go, this one is an extremely dead sheep." The changes, approved in July by the Privy Council in London, notably limit the number of directly elected Legislative Council seats to 20 in the run-up to Hong Kong's handback to China in 1997. The change is part of the second and final half of Patten's controversial political reform package, which legislators are to debate and adopt before mid-July. Several pro-democracy politicians intend to press for a greater number of directly elected members -- but by quietly changing the Letters Patent, it appeared that London was trying to pre-empt them, political observers say. But Patten, in his first comment on the issue, said the changes were a necessary step in the reform process, "so that the bill could then be brought into line with our constitutional arrangements and vice versa." He added -- as legal experts already have -- that the amendment would only become effective after it is published in Hong Kong's official government gazette. He also said the last word rested with legislators. "I suppose that the Legislative Council could either amend the bill in a way which made it allegedly more democratic or in a way which allegedly made it less democratic," he said. Britain and China agree that a new legislature to be elected in 1995 will consist of 20 directly elected seats -- with the remaining 40 to be filled by an electoral college, special interest groups and industrial sectors. But they have fallen out badly over the details of the crucial polls, with China declaring that it will scrap Patten's reforms in 1997 and hold fresh elections based on its own, as yet undefined criteria.
