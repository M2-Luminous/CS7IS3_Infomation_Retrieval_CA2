The coca growers are threatening to start blocking highways and stage rallies in Cochabamba demanding the abolishment of the supreme decree regulating the industrialization of coca leaf. We will now listen to what Jorge Martinez has to say about the matter: [begin recording] Martinez: [Words indistinct] to again implement measures of pressure to demand the fulfillment of the claims made by the whole of Cochabamba because, so far, the government has done nothing but sign agreements and hold meetings, while in practice it has done nothing. Unidentified reporter: In addition to protest, will highways be blockaded? Martinez: There will probably be road blockades and protest marches in Cochabamba and the tropical regions. [end recording] We wish to announce, moreover, that during our visit to the tropical region of Chapare we were able to see for ourselves that there is no such militarization of the region; there are no troops in the tropical region of Chapare, as has been reported. This fact has been confirmed by William Condori, leader of the coca growers: [Begin recording] In (Villa Catorce) and further inland, in the Simon Secure Park, we have confirmed reports that there is no type of militarization of the tropical zone in Cochabamba. We have also heard government spokesmen talk about the possibility of a militarization of the Cochabamba tropical region, but so far we have seen no troops. [end recording] As you have just heard, there are no troops in the tropical Chapare region. Condori also said there are no narco-guerrillas in the zone, and that it would be good for a special commission to enter the region to investigate reports of the alleged existence of narco-guerrillas.
