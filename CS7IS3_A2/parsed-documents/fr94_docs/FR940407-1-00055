The WACC was defined above as the composite of the cost of the various classes of capital used by the regulated firm weighted on the basis of the proportions of the total which each class represents. Corporate taxes were excluded. In reality, a regulated firm typically does pay taxes, and the WACC must be adjusted accordingly in arriving at a final allowable rate of return. The use of the WACC to determine an allowable rate of return without making such an adjustment would result in an understatement of the total cost of servicing capital to ratepayers. Assuming a 40 percent corporate income tax rate, for example, a company requires only $1.00 of revenue to provide a $1.00 return to bondholders because interest payments are tax deductible for corporate income tax purposes. The same company requires $1.67 of revenue, however, to provide a $1.00 return to preferred stock and common-stock equity shareholders because the firm must pay corporate income taxes, and dividend payments to such shareholders are not tax deductible. The following before-tax expression of the WACC (``BTWACC'') recognizes explicitly the existence of income taxes and is, therefore, the appropriate formula to use in computing an allowable rate of return: E:GraphicsEP07AP94.012 where: K d is the regulated firm's cost of long-term debt capital; K p is the regulated firm's cost of preferred stock capital; K e is the regulated firm's cost of common-stock equity capital; D is the value of the regulated firm's long-term debt outstanding; P is the value of the regulated firm's preferred stock outstanding; E is the value of the regulated firm's common-stock equity outstanding; and T is the corporate income tax rate. To illustrate the calculation of the BTWACC, consider a hypothetical regulated company that has total invested capital of $100 million, consisting of $25 million of long-term debt, $15 million of preferred stock, and $60 million of common-stock equity. Assume that the firm's cost of long-term debt is 7 percent, cost of preferred stock is 9 percent and cost of common-stock equity is 12 percent, and that the corporate income tax rate is 40 percent. The BTWACC for this firm is calculated as follows: Calculation of BTWACC 1Capital component 1Amount (millions of dollars) 1Proportion (percent) 1Cost (percent) 1WACC (percent) 1Tax factor (1/1&hyph;T) 1BTWACC Long-term debt 25 25 7 1.75 1.00 1.75 Preferred stock 15 15 9 1.35 1.67 2.25 Common-stock equity 60 60 12 7.20 1.67 12.02 n,s Total 100 100 10.30 16.02 The allowable rate of return for this hypothetical company should, therefore, be set at 16.02 percent, which would provide the firm with the opportunity to earn revenues sufficient to service the total cost of capital and taxes.
