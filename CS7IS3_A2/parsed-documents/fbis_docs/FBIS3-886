Grenade explosions last night resulted in deaths and injuries in the Burundian capital. It is once again violence of a political-ethnic character. The 13 members of the National Security Council who have just been appointed by the Burundian head of state, Cyprien Ntaryamira, have a lot to do. Gerard Furazima reports from Bujumbura. [Begin Furazima recording] Three people have died in the area of Nyakabiga. This is the toll of the tragedy which took place in the evening of 14 March when a group of still unidentified people launched a grenade attack on a house at about 0100. The house caught fire and was still burning early this morning. The fire brigade managed to extinguish the fire, but there was extensive damage. This violence of a political-ethnic character has produced victims among the Hutu majority ethnic group as well as the Tutsi minority. The phenomenon of ethnicization of popular areas like Kamenge and Kinama in the north of the capital, which are invaded day after day by Hutu looters, is increasing. To the south, Nyakabiga and Musaga are more and more inhabited by Tutsis. Fear and insecurity prevail within the remaining families in all these areas where their respective ethnic group members become scarce. A grenade thrown last night in a bar in Musaga in the south of the capital resulted in one person seriously wounded. In any case, the 13 members of the National Security Council, just appointed by President Cyprien Ntaryamira today, have a lot to do. Will they manage to stop the diabolical spiral of violence in Burundi since the murder on 21 October 1993 of Mr. Melchior Ndadaye, the democratically elected president? This is a great challenge for them. [end recording]
