ACTION: Notice of delegation of authority. SUMMARY: Within this notice, the Secretary is delegating his authority under the Section 184 Loan Guarantees for Indian Housing program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z&hyph;13a, to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. In this program, the Department guarantees certain housing loans made to Indian families and Indian housing authorities. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dominic A. Nessi, Director, Office of Native American Programs, Office of Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room B&hyph;133, 451 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 755&hyph;0032 or (202) 708&hyph;0850 (voice/TDD). (These are not toll free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 184 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992), codified at 12 U.S.C. 1715z&hyph;13a, authorizes the establishment of the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Fund (the Fund) to provide access to sources of private financing to Indian families and Indian housing authorities who otherwise could not acquire housing financing because of the unique legal status of Indian trust land. In general, these lands, held in trust by the United States for the benefit of an Indian or Indian tribe, are inalienable. Trust lands under this program also include lands to which the title is held by an Indian tribe subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States. Because the title to individual plots does not convey, and liens do not attach, conventional mortgage lending practices do not operate in this forum. The Fund addresses these obstacles to mortgage financing by guaranteeing loans made to Indian families or Indian housing authorities to construct, acquire, or rehabilitate 1- to 4-family dwellings that are standard housing and are located on trust land or land located in an Indian or Alaska Native area. The guarantee of the loan will cover 100 percent of the unpaid principal and interest. Borrowers will be required to pay a 1% guarantee fee at closing. A loan term of up to 30 years is permitted by statute, but is not required. The statute authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to approve loans for guarantee, issue certificates as evidence of the guarantees, and carry out other responsibilities associated with the program. To facilitate the administration of this program, the Secretary is delegating all of his power and authority under section 184 to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. Therefore, the Secretary delegates as follows: Section A. Authority Delegated The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development delegates to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing all power and authority of the Secretary with respect to the Loan Guarantees for Indian Housing program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z&hyph;13a (Section 184 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992). Authority: Section 7(d) Department of Housing and Urban Development Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 3535(d). Dated: September 19, 1994. Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary.
