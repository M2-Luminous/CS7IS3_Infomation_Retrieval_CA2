Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says that, in seeking permanent membership of the Security Council, Japan intends to gratify its dominationist desire through military intervention in the disputes of the world and have its past crimes hushed up at any cost. The news analyst says: A high-placed authority of the Japanese Government has gone the length of making Japan appear a permanent member of the Security Council, insolently claiming that "Japan has so far played a role equal to a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council." Such behaviour of Japan is a mockery of the international community, which shows its brazenness. Japan is not qualified to be a permanent member of the Security Council. By unleashing World War II, Japan destroyed world peace and security and imposed big disasters on the peoples of many countries. For these crimes, it is specified as a "hostile state" in the U.N. charter. Still more grave is that Japan has set it as its state strategy to revive its policy of aggression of the past. The policy of aggression of Japan which is hastening its conversion into a military power and its nuclear armament after paving the way for troops' dispatch overseas, poses a big threat to the peace in Asia and the world. Japan is racing headlong toward aggression, not breaking with its imperialist past. How can it be a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council whose mission it is to ensure peace and security of the world? If Japan is made a permanent member, it will mean overlooking Japan's failure to liquidate its past and encouraging it to commit past crimes again. Before coveting permanent membership, Japan must conscientiously repent of its mistake, honestly discharge its responsibility for apology and compensation and stop pursuing aggression and war.
