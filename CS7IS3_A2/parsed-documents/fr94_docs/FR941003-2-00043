FR941003-2-00043 FR941003-2-00031 (ii) The total number of pediatric practitioners providing immunizations to children. The program registered providers must have at least one Medicaid pediatric immunization claim per month or an average of 12 such claims during the year. The State would need 50 percent participation to show equal access through use of this guideline. d. Other States have the flexibility to devise alternative measures of equal access to immunizations. HCFA will evaluate these other methods by which States can choose to demonstrate equal access. G. Submittal of State Plan Amendments A State Medicaid agency must specify the reimbursement for the administration of pediatric vaccines (and, if applicable, submit documentation of equal access) as part of its obstetrical/pediatric payment rate State Medicaid plan amendment submittal that are due by April 1 of each year, beginning April 1, 1995 (and which are effective July 1, 1995). If the State Medicaid agency elects to pay the maximum regional amount statewide (including that established by the State in Universal Purchase States), it need only specify this in its State plan amendment submittal (no additional documentation will be needed). However, if the State Medicaid agency elects to vary the vaccine administration fee by geographic areas within the State, the State must list the administration fee for each area, and specify the methodology, and provide the data and methodology it used to demonstrate equal access to the vaccines for each geographic area where the maximum charges are not applied. This documentation requirement is consistent with the requirements currently imposed for submittal of State Medicaid plan amendments for obstetrical and pediatric payment rates under sections 1902(a)(30)(A) and 1926 of the Act. We also believe that documenting access to immunizations by each geographic area provides a more accurate picture of access and areas where access is problematic. The State plan amendment must be submitted by December 31, 1994 and be effective on October 1, 1994. For the interim period of October 1, 1994 through March 31, 1995, States may claim Federal matching funds for the costs of administration of vaccines to Medicaid-eligible children using the maximum charges or the lower fees established on the basis of the guidance provided in this notice. For this interim State plan amendment, the State will not be required to submit the data to document access to immunizations but will be required to list the methodology by which Medicaid beneficiary access to immunizations is assured. Beginning April 1, 1995, documentation of equal access to immunizations will be required to be included as part of the yearly Obstetrical/Pediatric State plan amendment submittal in accordance with section 1926 of the Act. III. Impact Statement For notices such as this, we generally prepare a flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a notice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of a RFA, States and individuals are not considered small entities. However, providers are considered small entities. In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any notice of proposed rulemaking that may have a significant impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.
