What is the current situation? According to Dai Xianglong, vice governor of the People's Bank of China, China has a positive attitude toward foreign financial organizations which want to come to China to develop business, but because it involves the problem of changing China's financial system, many areas have to be considered and looked at carefully. Regarding the question of whether foreign banks can also engage in renminbi business in China, Dai Xianglong frankly pointed out that the branches of foreign banks in China are mainly operating foreign exchange business, and that there are quite a number of them who have also wanted to operate renminbi business, but here several conditions have to be considered: First, the management standard of mainland banks must go through a process of improvement and internationalization, and speaking in terms of the current conditions, the commercial banks inside the country do not have the ability to compete with the commercial banks from outside the country. Second, the main objects of service of the Bank of China are the enterprises which cannot operate completely on their own; when the state bank can rid itself of this burden and can release loans at its own discretion, it can then compete with foreign banks. Third, the tax rate among Chinese banks is different from the tax rate among the branches of foreign banks in China, and he said that after these three problems are solved, foreign banks can start operating renminbi business. "But we have already tried it out in Xiamen and some other areas, and we may expand the project in the future." In addition, what must be stressed is that when foreign banks come to China to set up financial organizations, the main purpose is to arouse interest among investors in their own countries for investment in China, and not to completely rely on the operation of renminbi business in China to earn foreign exchange. Talking about the intention of Taiwan's financial organizations to come to the mainland, Dai Xianglong said that in this area, Taiwan funds are somewhat the same as foreign funds, and the mainland will still handle Taiwan funds in the same way it handles foreign funds. However, a more lenient attitude can apply to certain areas; for example, when a foreign bank wants to set up a branch in China, it should have 20 billion [no currency as published] in capital and it will take three years for it to set up a representative office. When Taiwan's financial organizations come to China to do business, these rules can be lifted appropriately. He disclosed that, at present, 14 nongovernmental commercial banks in Taiwan have expressed an interest in setting up offices on the mainland.
