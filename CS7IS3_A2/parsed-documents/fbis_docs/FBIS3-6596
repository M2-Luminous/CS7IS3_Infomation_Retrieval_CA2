In an academic seminar held under the auspices of the Central Intelligence Agency on the evening of 18 March, Director Woolsey said that the United States worries greatly over North Korea's nuclear weapons development, as well as its development of long- range missiles. In particular, Director Woolsey confirmed some reports that North Korea is developing new additional missiles with ranges greater than that of the Nodong missile, and said: If these two missiles are developed and tested, they could put at risk all of Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Also, if they are exported to the Middle East, they could threaten Europe as well.
