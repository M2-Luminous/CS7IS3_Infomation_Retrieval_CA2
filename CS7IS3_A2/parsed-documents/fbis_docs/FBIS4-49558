With China now engaged in restructuring of the banking system, it will take time for the state-owned professional banks to switch to state-owned commercial ones. Unfair competition would result from letting foreign-funded banks undertake the renminbi business at a time when the commercial banking system had not yet been established. The way in which foreign-funded banks ran their business and the taxation rate for these banks were different from those for domestic banks at the present stage. Mr. Tong said that the opening of banking business to foreign- funded banks had to be in line with the national situation. China employed the practice of letting foreign-funded banks undertake foreign currency business first and then went step by step to have them involved in the renminbi business. He added that there would not be an overall opening in such sector. Some areas including Shenzhen and Xiamen can take the lead in opening themselves to the outside world. The number of state-owned medium- and large-sized enterprises is relatively small in these places where the market economy system plays a dominant role and most banks operating there are commercial ones. They are therefore qualified for opening the banking business to the outside world to a greater extent. The time, however, is not ripe for the running of the renminbi business by foreign-funded banks at the present stage until the banking system is well established.
