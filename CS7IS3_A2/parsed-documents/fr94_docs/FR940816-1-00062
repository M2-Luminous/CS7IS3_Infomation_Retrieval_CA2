FR940816-1-00062 FR940816-1-00010 Gray wolves used for the reintroduction effort would be obtained from healthy wolf populations in Canada by permission of the Canadian and Provincial governments. Gray wolves are common in western Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000) and they are increasing in the Great Lakes area. Thus, the removal of wolves from locations in Canada would not significantly impact the wolf populations there. 5. Reintroduction Protocol This wolf reintroduction project is undertaken by the Service in cooperation with the National Park Service; Forest Service; other Federal agencies; potentially affected Tribes; States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho; and entities of the Canadian government. The Service would enter into agreements with the Canadian and provincial governments and/or Canadian resource management agencies to obtain wild wolves. The wolf reintroduction project in Yellowstone National Park would require the transfer of about 45 to 75 wolves from southwestern Canada with assistance by Canadian and Provincial governments. About 15 wild wolves would be captured annually from several different packs over the course of 3&hyph;5 years by trapping, darting from helicopters, or net gunning in the autumn and winter. They would be transported to the Park by truck or plane. In the Park, groups of wolves, each consisting of pups and possibly adults from the same packs, would be placed in individual holding pens of about 0.4 hectare (1 acre) size for a period of up to two months to allow for acclimation to the new environment. Acclimation pens would be isolated and provided maximum protection from humans and other animals, and efforts would be made to prevent habituation to people. During acclimation, each animal would be monitored with radiotelemetry to ensure quick retrieval of an animal if necessary. The wolves would be provided carcasses of natural prey taken from the area where they will be released. In addition, the wolves would receive regular veterinary care, including examinations and vaccinations. In autumn and early winter, about 3 groups of acclimated gray wolf pups, and possibly adult pack members, would be placed in the individual holding pens at about 3 release sites in the Park. The wolves would be kept and fed in these pens until about January 1. At that time, the wolves would be radio collared and released. Food (ungulate carrion) would be provided in the area until the wolves no longer required supplemental feeding. All wolves would be closely monitored each day or two for the first few weeks, and then the frequency of monitoring would gradually be reduced to about weekly. If wolves cause conflicts with humans, they will be recaptured and controlled according to the procedures that have been used with other problem wolves. Based upon previous experience with movements of wild, relocated wolves, it is questionable whether adults will remain with each other or the pups. The pups would remain in the wild as long as they appeared to be sustaining themselves on carrion or wild prey. Wolf pups should be capable of killing wild prey by January. The progress of the reintroduction effort would be reviewed periodically, and the success or failure of the release would be determined at least on an annual basis. In addition, the release of wild wolves into the Park would be reviewed and evaluated relative to the effects on the conservation and recovery of the gray wolf in the conterminous United States. If this reintroduction technique appeared successful, it would be repeated for at least three years or until two wild breeding pairs produced at least two young for two consecutive years in the Park. At that time, wolves would be monitored and no further reintroductions would take place unless fewer than 2 litters were produced in a single year. Subsequent releases would be modified depending upon information obtained during the previous experiments. Utilizing information gained from the initial phase of the project, an overall assessment of the success of the reintroduction would be made after the first year, and for every year thereafter. It is thought that the physical reintroduction phase would be completed within 3&hyph;5 years. After the reintroduction of wolves has resulted in two packs raising 2 pups each for 2 consecutive years, the wolf population would be managed to grow naturally toward recovery levels. This reintroduction attempt is consistent with the recovery goals identified for this species by the 1987 recovery plan for the northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. It is estimated that this program, in conjunction with natural recovery in northwestern Montana and a similar reintroduction into central Idaho, would result in a viable recovered wolf population (ten breeding pairs in each of three recovery areas for three consecutive years) by about the year 2002. A small portion of Idaho (east of Interstate 15) and Montana (east of Interstate 15 and south of the Missouri River from Great Falls, Montana to eastern Montana border) and all of Wyoming is proposed as an experimental population area for wolf reintroduction into the Park. Private landowners and agency personnel adjacent to the Park will continue to be requested to immediately report any observation of a gray wolf to the Service or to a Service designated agency. Take of gray wolves by the public would be discouraged by an extensive information and education program and by the assurance that, at least initially, all animals will be monitored with radio telemetry and therefore easy to locate when they leave public lands. The public would be encouraged to cooperate with the Service in the attempt to closely monitor the wolves and quickly resolve any conflicts. More specific information on conduct of the wolf reintroduction program can be obtained from Appendix 4 ``Scientific techniques for the reintroduction of wild wolves'' in the environmental impact statement: ``The Reintroduction of Gray Wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Central Idaho'' (Service 1994).
