Deputy head of the Taxation Office Nikolay Ivanov told the Financial Information Agency that as the payment crisis was raging in the country, numerous factories, organizations and commercial banks failed to pay taxes or tried to delay the payments by keeping their cash in hard currency accounts. This step will enable the Taxation Office to collect significant amounts. As of April 1 various organizations owed the budget about 5.5 trillion rubles. Ivanov emphasized that the ruling provided for very strict penalties for bank officers who failed to carry out the procedure. He also said that the Finance Ministry, the Taxation Office and the CBR have submitted to the government proposals on tighter controls over bank and factory managers as far as rules of storing, using and transferring cash were concerned.
