Many Hong Kong and Taiwan criminal gangs extend their operations to the mainland; they directly or indirectly build up their power. "Investment" is the protective coloration that allows them to establish bases. In addition to the well organized activities of underground criminal gangs in the big cities, gang activities on the Chinese mainland--characterized by clan power--are now extending to many towns and townships. Especially in areas where town and township enterprises have had a good start, these gangs have gradually become a dominating one-sided power, as they claim to work for the interests of the clan. Control of the Rural Economy by Clan Power GAIGE SHIBAO once reported that it was discovered that control of part of the rural enterprises in Anhui Province was completely in the hands of certain big families. Certain clans monopolized the positions of heads of townships, towns, and villages. Anyone of a different clan seeking work in the enterprises was up against all kinds of difficulties, and the distribution of wages and other benefits was decided unilaterally by the head of the clan in question. Such clan power conglomerates also had their own law enforcement personnel. Anyone who would violate the "clan rules" or would not follow orders, would suffer physical punishment. The only way for weaker and smaller families and clans is to submit to the bullying and the willful oppression by the powerful clans. In some rural factories, they forcibly seized all incoming orders and business contacts, and that has led to quarrels between some clans and even fighting with weapons. Local government and police are always very much afraid to get involved in such cases because the so-called "local snakes" [gang bosses] are too powerful. Some clan forces hold most of the administrative leadership power in the villages and townships and have command over the economic lifelines of the areas in question. In September of 1991, the bloody "7 September" riots that occurred in Qinghai Province and that shocked and frightened the central authorities, were also caused by different clans fighting for local farming and grazing resources. At the start of the riots, the public security authorities found it impossible to effectively intervene, and after the event they asked clan chiefs and local notables to mediate. There had to be no pressuring, only a peaceful procedure could do it in order not to evoke anti-government sentiment. Starting this year, officialdom is sounding off all its propaganda instruments to create momentum for starting the Three Gorges project and to prepare public opinion for the large scale resettlement of population from the reservoir site. The propaganda is mostly praising the transferees at the reservoir area for the way they support the government project, and for the way they are willing to "give their homes to the government." However, in actual fact, according to the revelations of a nongovernment newspaper in Wuhan, resettlement of people from Fengdu, Zhenxi, and other transfer areas in Sichuan is meeting with great resistance. Main resistance comes from the clan forces, now agglomerated into one force and not averse to getting into clashes with government personnel. The purpose pursued by this kind of clan power is not the commission of criminal acts, but rather the protection of the people's homesteads, of course also hope of gaining more benefits from the transfer. Whenever faced with this kind of a situation, the special work team in charge of population resettlement had to go to great trouble buying over or persuading the various clan chiefs. It has to be acknowledged, though, that the inflation of clan power in the villages has created a new pattern of its own among the local gangs. Criminal Societies Encroaching on Religious Organizations Now that there is strong popular demand for religious freedom, it is a matter of great concern for officialdom that more and more common people have taken to various religious activities, breaching the "three freedoms" policy of officialdom as far as it concerns religion, and weakening the centripetal force in politics. But an even greater concern is that the increased religious activities provide another sanctuary for underground gangs. One of this year's issues of the NEIBU BAODAO warns of the encroachment on religious organizations by criminal gangs. It is reported there that the several nationwide religious incidents in recent years, such as the activities of the Hu Han Pai in Yiwu County in Zhejiang Province, the "Da Zhao Sheng" incident at the time of the Asian Olympiad involving followers from ten provinces, and the "end of the world" incident started in 1991 by a Protestant sect in Hebei Province, are all cases of infiltration by "underground hostile forces" and by "religious forces from abroad." The actual fact was that in all these incidents some underground criminal organizations seized the opportunity to make capital by cheating religious followers out of their "offerings." When banned and suppressed by the government, members of the criminal gangs involved will proclaim their "religious belief" as justifying their resistance against the government. The cohesion among religious believers is a factor that the government cannot ignore. Infiltration by Criminal Societies from Hong Kong and Taiwan One contributing factor for the appearance of local criminal gangs and underground criminal societies on the mainland was the deterioration of public order on the mainland itself, but then there was also the catalytic effect of infiltrations by criminal gangs from abroad. Judging by news and case histories published by the public security agencies, criminal societies from Hong Kong and Taiwan are expanding their activities to the mainland in a variety of forms. One is the direct dispatch of persons to contact on the mainland criminal gangs or former convicts or former inmates of "reform through labor" institutions, set up lodges, and then slowly broaden out. It has been revealed that Hong Kong criminal societies have expanded their territory in Guangdong Province to include Shenzhen, Shantou, Dongguan, and Guangzhou. Criminal societies from Taiwan, while being constantly subjected to mopping up operations by the authorities, are also expanding their activities to the mainland. Their main areas of operation are Fujian Province and Xiamen, but they have also appeared in Guizhou and Guangxi. Of course, the Hong Kong and Taiwan criminal societies had to camouflage their infiltrations of the mainland. For this purpose, the economic reform and opening up on the mainland provided the criminal societies from abroad with an excellent opportunity and shield. It was then that "mainland investments" became for some of these criminal elements the best protective talisman. Investments were not only sure of being welcomed by the local governments, who were eager for quick success and instant benefits, but the mainland public security agencies and police forces frequently became eager behind-the-scenes backers for personages of criminal societies that came over as Hong Kong or Taiwan businessmen. Quite a few case histories show that some personnel of the public security agencies on the mainland had been bought over by the criminal societies. At one time the case of Zhang Zhen [1728 4176] had caused a sensation. The case showed clearly that authorities on the mainland would pay no heed to any other consideration when it comes to attracting investments. The great boss of Taiwan's criminal society, (gangster emperor) Zhang Zhen, after spending money lavishly, became for a time the honored guest of high cadres. It is difficult to verify whether Zhang Zhen really "washed his hands in a golden bowl," but with his "outstanding business achievements" in Taiwan and his "reputation" he was indeed accepted by the mainland, and he also became joined in sworn brotherhood with an artist, a painter. Wu Dongtan [0702 3159 3389], president of the "Tiandaomeng Taiyanghui" [Sun Society of the Divine Truth Brotherhood] of Taiwan, invested 100 million yuan in Fujian Province, which made him a favorite person in that place, and a luxurious villa became his base. In their exploration of the mainland territory, Hong Kong and Taiwan criminal societies have nothing else in mind but "profit." According to data with the Hong Kong police, most of the many firearms cases, large-scale drug smuggling cases, and illegal labor cases prosecuted since 1988 involved criminal organizations from the mainland, which goes to show that commission of crimes by joint operations of criminal societies within and across the border have now become the trend. It is already common knowledge that some members of criminal mainland societies cross the border and commit crimes in Hong Kong, with the plotting and organizing having been done by lawless elements across the border. To evade arrest by police, members of Hong Kong's underworld escape and hide out in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, where they are protected by local criminal gangs. Toward Improved Weaponry and the Use of Science and Technology A publication of a certain public security agency revealed that there were criminal gangs operating in certain areas of Jiangsu Province under such names as "Xiaoyao [Carefree] Gang," "Mudan [Peony] Gang," and "Meihua [Plum Blossom] Gang." Some of these organizations have an obvious political character, as they declare their intention to actually constitute a "second political regime" in their region. The criminal societies on the mainland are in the process of getting better weapons and applying more science and technology. With the cooperation of criminal societies in Hong Kong and Taiwan, they equip themselves with advanced items of armament and communication instruments, such as cordless telephones, high frequency radio stations, various kinds of rifles, and high speed boats. In an anti-drug campaign carried out in November of 1991 with the participation of regular army units in the southwestern border region, it was discovered that the bandit gangs in the hinterland had not only radio stations transmitting orders from bosses across the border, but also excellent weapons, even rocket launchers. After their annihilation, large amounts of weapons of an advanced type were captured. Whenever a criminal organization launches a large-scale action, they will temporarily hire forces to cover their operations. Along the Fujian coast, so-called "snake heads" [gang bosses] will surreptitiously ship over "human snakes" to Taiwan, and this according to an entire set of operational processes, in which each link is carried out in a division of labor, and every item done to perfection.
