FR940203-2-00138 FR940203-2-00068 Examples of Statewide Activities Comment: One commenter requested the inclusion of ``related services personnel'' among those individuals for whom training could be provided by a grantee receiving funds under this competition. The commenter felt that related services personnel would be critical to the success of students with disabilities in School-to-Work Opportunities programs and that these individuals should be trained along with the teachers and other professionals named in paragraph (c) under ``Examples of Statewide Activities.'' Discussion: Under the section of the notice entitled ``Examples of Statewide Activities'' there is a list which is meant only to be illustrative and to provide examples of some of the grantee expenditures that would be allowable under this program. The Secretaries agree that the costs of training related services personnel is sufficiently important to be added to the list as an allowable expenditure under this program. Changes: Reference to ``related services personnel'' has been added to the list of those individuals for whom training could be provided by a grantee under this program. Comment: One commenter recommended that examples should be added to the list of statewide activities to focus on the needs of disadvantaged youth and poor communities. The commenter proposed adding, as an example of allowable statewide activities, stimulating the development of partnerships in poor communities, and providing training and dissemination of curricula to local partnerships to more effectively respond to the needs of disadvantaged youth. Discussion: The Secretaries agree with the commenter that the examples of statewide activities should include activities aimed at addressing the particular needs of disadvantaged youth and poor communities. Accordingly, paragraph (b) of the examples has been revised to include stimulating the development of partnerships in poor communities. The Secretaries note that the statewide activities as proposed include the training and curricula dissemination activities cited by the commenter, for teachers, employers, workplace mentors, and others, at the local level. However, the Secretaries believe that an additional activity should be added, to clarify that States may assist localities in formulating strategies to recruit and retain all students including the poor and disadvantaged. These strategies may include the training and curricula dissemination activities described in paragraphs (c) and (e) of the examples. Changes: Paragraph (b) under ``Examples of Statewide Activities'' has been revised to include the clause: ``Stimulating the development of partnerships in poor communities'' as an outreach activity to promote and support collaboration in School-to-Work Opportunities programs. In addition, a new paragraph (h) has been added to provide that States may work ``with localities to develop strategies to recruit and retain all students in School-To-Work Opportunities programs, including those from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances.'' Allocation of Funds to Local Partnerships Comment: One commenter felt that the Secretaries should require local partnerships to describe how they will train counselors and other personnel to provide minority, female, disabled, and limited-English proficient youth with access to high-skill, high-wage, non-traditional careers. The commenter believed that such a requirement should be included in this section on ``Allocation of Funds to Local Partnerships'' and that it should be given as an example in the succeeding section, ``Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships.'' Discussion: The Secretaries agree that training is an important activity, and have included ``training for teachers, employers, workplace mentors, counselors, and others,'' as examples of State activities and ``providing training to work-based and school-based staff on new curricula, student assessments, student guidance, and feedback to the school regarding student performance,'' as examples of local partnership activities. Also, one of the requirements under school-based learning is ``career awareness and career exploration and counseling in order to help students who may be interested to identify and select or reconsider their interests, goals, and career majors.'' The Secretaries do not wish to mandate to local partnerships who should be trained or how the training should be accomplished. Rather, the Secretaries think it is preferable for local partnerships to make those determinations in ways that best serve the programs which they are implementing and the students participating in those programs. Changes: None.
