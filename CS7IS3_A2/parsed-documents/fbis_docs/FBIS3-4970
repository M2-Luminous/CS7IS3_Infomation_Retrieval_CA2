FTC officials said the commission suspects the cooperatives directed wholesalers to adopt certain prices and volumes with the aim of sustaining the price of rice not subject to government control. It is the first time for the commission to issue a warning in a case involving rice deals. A system of bidding for free-market rice was initiated in 1990 but the auctions have been suspended since last fall because last year's harvest was the worst in the postwar period and foreign-grown rice had to be imported on an emergency basis. Agricultural cooperatives, which virtually monopolize the supply of domestic rice, allegedly decided the prices and volumes of rice put up for auction on the free market during the first two years. Most of Japan's rice is bought by the government from cooperatives at highly subsidized prices and sold to the public at government-set prices. Some of the cooperatives are suspected of promising kickbacks to wholesalers under the guise of sales promotion expenses in return for making higher bid prices, the officials said. In the wake of higher-than-expected prices in the bidding for rice in 1990 and 1991, the commission started investigations into agricultural cooperatives and wholesales nationwide and determined they had violated the Antimonopoly Law, the officials said. The cooperatives cautioned by the commission are located in Akita and Niigata Prefectures, northern Japan, where popular brands of rice like Koshihikari and Sasanishiki are produced. About four million tons of rice are allowed every year to be traded outside of government price control. The prices of one million tons of this rice are set through auctions in local rice markets nationwide and the prices of the remainder are decided in direct deals between the national federation of agricultural cooperative associations and wholesalers.
