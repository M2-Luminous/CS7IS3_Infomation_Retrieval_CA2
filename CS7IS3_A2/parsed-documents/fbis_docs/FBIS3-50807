Reina, winner of the November 1993 elections, told local media that the preliminary 29 December report presented by Leo Valladares, national human rights ombudsman, "is a very courageous" document and that its recommendations should be followed. The report, which states that civilian and military personnel are responsible for the forced disappearances of dozens of people, "is a thorough study in which the truth is evident. Its effects will be proportionate to the courage with which the information is managed," said Reina, who will be sworn in on 27 January. Supreme Court President Orlando Lozano Martinez announced that the judicial branch will also follow up on Valladares' report. A Judicial Branch plenum resolved that Honduran judges in charge of criminal cases in places where both citizens and foreigners have reportedly suffered forced disappearances must begin or continue trials to punish the culprits. The Supreme Court also formed a special commission of prosecutors to study the national human rights ombudsman's report and to proceed with the corresponding legal actions. The Attorney General's Office, which will appoint a prosecutor next week, will continue the work done by the [Supreme Court] prosecutors. Human rights organizations are demanding that Division General [as received] Luis Alonso Discua, chief of the Armed Forces, be investigated in connection with several disappearances that took place while he was commander of the so-called "3-16" counterintelligence battalion in 1984. The Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (COFADEH) on 7 January will request at the Legislative Assembly that Discua be temporarily suspended so he can be investigated in connection with the disappearances, a request which, in President Rafael Callejas' opinion, "lacks any legal basis and will not be considered." Discua, who examined the report on the disappearances with Callejas on 3 January, has made no comment, although on various occasions he has said he had no part in the violations. Callejas said on 3 January that the report should not be used to open new wounds but to unite rather than divide the Honduran family. Carlos Sosa Coello, a deputy for the minority Social Democratic Innovation and Unity Party (PINU-SD), feels that Gen. Discua should be summoned by the Legislative Assembly to hear his views concerning the disappearances and that the state should compensate and apologize to the missing detainees' relatives. Legislative Assembly Vice President Marco Augusto Hernandez said that if any conclusive evidence is found implicating Discua in the forced disappearances, he should be separated from his post. Human Rights Commissioner Leo Valladares is of the opinion that a pardon cannot be granted in the case of the disappearances if the alleged perpetrators do not admit their culpability. Valladares also asked the Armed Forces to open its files to facilitate the investigations. "Reconciliation is sought through the search for truth and the implementation of justice," said Valladares, who also believes that the law will determine who is guilty. The report on the disappearances also names U.S. and Argentine military officers and former Nicaraguan "contra" fighters who operated out of Honduras during the eighties.
