Ostensibly, our arms are Russian, we cry out for spare parts from Moscow and Kiev, the army does not have a penny to its name, and yet our generals constantly look toward the West. The chief of General Staff returned from Brussels and left immediately for NATO's Atlantic headquarters in Norfolk. All right, in Belgium we at least have certain interests -- we are about to send our representatives to NATO headquarters -- but what business do we have with the Atlantic? In addition, the fact that three delegations are heading for the United States shows that there is apparently no coordination between the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense in anything related to the Army cuts and visits abroad.
