Mr. Dogan met today with Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, who is entitled to head the cabinet during the prime minister's absence through illness. Ahmed Dogan wanted to know when he would be able to meet with the prime minister personally, Mr. Matinchev said after the meeting. He said that DPS had certain ideas about structural changes in Prof. Berov's Cabinet, (which was formed on the DPS's mandate). However, he declined to give details or comment. "An overhaul of the cabinet would open new opportunities to the government, but its performance over the next three or four weeks will be of vital importance, for it will show whether we shall ask for such an overhaul," Mr. Dogan said after the meeting. He said that their ideas about structural changes in the cabinet were still at the probing stage. Mr. Dogan hopes to meet with Prof. Berov as soon as he is allowed by the doctors. Asked whether this will be the first appointment of the prime minister after his hospitalization, Mr. Dogan answered that he hoped so.
