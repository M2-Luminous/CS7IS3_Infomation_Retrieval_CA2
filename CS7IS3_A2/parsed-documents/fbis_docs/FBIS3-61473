Vinogradov, L.N. Shchavelev, V.S. Popenko, V.A.

Attention is focused on achievements in the field of argon arc welding of fuel elements (TVEL), magnetic field-controlled arc welding (DUMP-process), and electron beam welding. In particular, the SA-477, SA 457, SA-466, and SA-450 argon arc welding machines, SA-448 elevated pressure argon-helium arc welding machine, and SA-330, SA-340, SA-413, and SA-451 electron beam welding machines are described in detail. Today, the association is supplying the industry with small batches of power supply plants for 6 kW welding machines with a 75 kV accelerating voltage. This broad range of equipment and methods makes it possible to weld virtually all core elements of domestically made reactors. Some of the original units which have been proposed and implemented in the nuclear industry are suitable for use in various branches of the national economy. Figures 9.
