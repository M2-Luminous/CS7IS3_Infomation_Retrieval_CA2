The group, consisting of more than 20 members, including (Tang Jiqian), (Chen Ruiqiu) and (Fang Keng), arrived in Beijing on 24 May. Wang Zhaoguo welcomed the representatives of Hong Kong's textile trades. He thanked people of Hong Kong's textile-related trades for joining their mainland counterparts in working hard for economic development during China's reform and opening up period. He also thanked people of Hong Kong's industrial and business circles for their work in the development of education and public welfare on the mainland. The federation of textile-related trades of Hong Kong, set up in 1989 and composed of textile, dyeing, garment, and eight other guilds, represents Hong Kong's textile and garment industries. It is one of the largest industrial organizations in Hong Kong. The federation's board of directors is composed of well-known industrialists and businessmen of Hong Kong. Most of the members of the federation have invested in running factories on the mainland. The current visit by the delegation is for the purpose of enabling Hong Kong's textile and garment industries to increase contacts with the relevant central departments, know more about the situation of reform and opening up on the mainland, and expand relations and cooperation with the mainland. During their stay in Beijing, the members of the delegation will pay courtesy calls on the responsible persons of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, the United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the Ministry of Internal Trade, the China Textile Council, and other departments concerned. Wang Zhaoguo said during the meeting: Over the last decade since the start of reform and opening up, China has made tremendous economic progress, with a rapid increase in investment by people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. With the economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and the mainland becoming closer and closer, Hong Kong and the mainland have been economically linked together, complementing each other and working for a common prosperity. Wang Zhaoguo exchanged views with the representatives of Hong Kong's textile and garment industries on questions of concern, such as how to work more for Hong Kong's economic prosperity and smooth transition.
