In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS today, he said that on 31 May, the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet may resume debating the Crimean question as the 10-day deadline for bringing the Crimean constitution into line with that of Ukraine, as set by the Ukrainian Parliament, is running out. "It is impossible to predict today what decisions the Supreme Soviet will take or to talk about specific steps," Nikolay Mikhalchenko said. At the same time, he added that "Ukrainian legislature does not provide for introducing presidential rule. Therefore, anyone who talks about it is deliberately tricking the public."
