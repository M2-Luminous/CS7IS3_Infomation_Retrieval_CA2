On behalf of private station Sky, MRB conducted the poll from 13 to 18 May in the greater capital area using a sample of 1,000 voters and the ballot method. The information received outlines a series of critical parameters in the election behavior of voters. First, the distance that PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] established from ND [New Democracy] in October's election appears to be decreasing. The MRB poll gives PASOK 30.7 percent and ND 27.2 percent. The respective percentages of the parties in the same election district were 45.19 percent for PASOK and 36.46 percent for ND. As expected, the governing party is in the lead. Second, PASOK's losses in the greater capital area come from both the left and the right and do not appear to be accidental. PASOK has lost 3.7 percent of its power to the Political Spring, 2.7 percent to the Coalition of the Left and Progress, and 1.2 percent to ND, while 8.7 percent of those who voted for PASOK in October are now undecided. The "unity" of PASOK voters (those voters who say that they will vote for their party again) is 78.9 percent, a percentage that is neither low nor high. This percentage does point out the possibility of some remarkable losses for PASOK. Third, among all parties ND shows the highest "unity" percentage (83.3 percent), followed by KKE [Greek Communist Party] with 81.8 percent. This percentage shows that ND will possibly not suffer any serious losses compared to October. (If this happens, it will not be unnatural, given that the percentages that both large parties expect to receive at the European Parliament elections tend to be lower than those received in the national elections.) Currently, other than its remarkable "unity" percentage, ND appears to have suffered some losses to the Political Spring (3.4 percent), while for the first time it appears to have a very small gain from PASOK (1.2 percent). Therefore, there is an initial feeling (which other polls taken closer to the European Parliament elections will confirm or deny) that ND has "clear gains" (although very small) from the movement of voters from and to PASOK. It is crucial for ND to minimize its losses to the Political Spring and increase its "gains" from PASOK. Fourth, the Political Spring, with a low "unity" percentage, will be the big question mark in the elections. The poll gives it 7.1 percent in a region where it received approximately 6 percent. As a protest party (something that has been confirmed by every poll before the October elections), Political Spring shows great movement in voters "coming" and "going." It is becoming clear, however, that the party is gaining more than it is losing. At the same time, it is also showing a greater percentage of undecided voters (16 percent) compared to other parties, something that makes safe predictions of its course very difficult. Fifth, Coalition of the Left and Progress shows clear rising tendencies. Its gains come mainly from PASOK. Concluding, the gap is narrowing between PASOK and ND, with the former one maintaining the lead position at a safe distance. There is also a clear tendency of the Coalition and the Political Spring to increase their power, a tendency that is notable but not impressive. In any case, the two large parties appear to be confirming their sovereignty despite any small losses, particularly those of PASOK, which do not appear to be accidental.
