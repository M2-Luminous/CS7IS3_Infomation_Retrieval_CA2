On 28 December 1993, the BFEL facility successfully realized saturated oscillation, becoming the world's first infrared FEL facility--among the 10-odd such installations built in the United States, West Europe, and elsewhere--to reach this goal and thus propelling China into the world's front ranks in this high-tech field. The BFEL facility first achieved infrared FEL oscillation on 26 May last year, making China the fourth nation--after the United States, the Netherlands, and France--to use a radio-frequency linear accelerator for generating infrared FEL light. Following that achievement, BFEL facility scientists succeeded in raising the electron beam density and improving the uniformity of the quality factor; this in turn permitted them to raise system gain from the original 6 percent to 17 percent, where saturated oscillation took place. Also, compared to last May's achievement, stimulated oscillation signal strength is now 5 orders of magnitude higher [i.e., 100,000 times as high] and spontaneous radiation strength is 8 orders of magnitude higher.
