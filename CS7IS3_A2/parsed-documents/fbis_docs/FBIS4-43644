The chancellor also announced that Austria will present a supplement to Jacques Delors' European white paper with the major future political goals. [Vranitzky] This will be an Austrian program, outlining our specific prospects for the next few years -- on structural, traffic, and environmental policy, policy on research and science, etc. I have informed the members of the government that I will address personal letters to them in the next few days, inviting them to express their views so that we will have developed an Austrian perspective on a timely basis before the formal entry, which will enable us to take the required measures at home. These are our preparations for the EU Council meeting in Corfu. [Hopfmueller] Mr. Vranitzky, when you meet with President Klestil once more this afternoon, will the issues that you just mentioned be discussed, or will the final assignment of seats and standing room under the Greek sun be the main topic? [Vranitzky] I am primarily interested in issues of integration policy and not in the assignment of seats and standing room under the Greek sun, or in the distribution of sun or straw hats. What I consider significant is that the specific political implementation and the specific political work should be begun after the referendum that resulted a overwhelming support for the integration project. This is the most important thing for me. All other issues or secondary topics were discussed extensively in the past few days. I have once expressed my view clearly, and it is known to everybody now. In addition, the individual ministries must define through coordination how the work will be carried out in the future at the ministerial and bureaucratic level in Austria, and at the level of civil servants. These are the major issues. [Hopfmueller] Is the real background to the tug-of-war over Corfu not the definition of future competences within the European Union -- that is who will represent Austria politically in the future within the European Union? [Vranitzky] Well, you used the term tug-of-war. I would like to repeat that I never participated in such a tug-of-war. However, occasionally I am given a rope by the media. I usually put it aside as quickly as possible. [Hopfmueller] Well, you could have others participate in the tug-of-war instead of you. [Vranitzky] Well, then I would not be sure whether things are going in the right direction. Thus, I refrain from it. However, let me repeat the following once more: The next government, which will in all likelihood be formed and assume office before Austria's formal entry into the European Union, will have to discuss and adopt final regulations regarding competences. The current government, which will only serve for another three months, must prepare interim solutions, which we are now doing. I am quite confident that this process will be concluded shortly.
