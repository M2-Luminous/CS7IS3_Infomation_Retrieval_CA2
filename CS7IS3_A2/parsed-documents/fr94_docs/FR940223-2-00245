FR940223-2-00245 FR940223-2-00104 Complete the provided budget form identified as ``Attachment 3.'' A separate budget form must be completed for each proposal. A budget narrative should be attached to the form with containing any necessary explanatory information. Applicants must identify either on the form or in an attached narrative the source of its matching funds and whether it has a firm commitment for those funds. If activities under two or more DOT Programs are combined in a single proposal, separate budget forms must be completed to show program costs for each DOT Program, along with a separate aggregate budget form for the entire proposal. 6. Assurances Signature Form. Complete the attached form identified as ``Attachment 4.'' 7. Certification Signature Form. Complete the attached form identified as ``Attachment 5.'' 8. State Coordination and Evaluation Form. The proposed regulations issued under the National and Community Service Trust Act require that all community service projects be coordinated with their state community service plan in order to assure that the projects are building on existing programs and that they are not duplicative. Any community service organization submitting a proposal for a DOT Program must show evidence that the proposal has been reviewed and approved by the community service commission for the state in which it is located. Evidence of coordination can be shown by completion of the attached evaluation form (identified as ``Attachment 6'') by the state community service commission, by written correspondence from the state community service commission, or by documentation of a meeting with the state community service commission. In addition, DOT also asks that each proposal include a preliminary evaluation of the project by the state commission on national and community service for the state in which the project will be performed (the ``state commission''). An evaluation form to be completed by the state commission is attached (``Attachment 6''). Evaluations by the state commissions are optional and are not binding on DOT. However, DOT believes that any information from the state commissions would be extremely helpful in our review, and therefore strongly encourages all applicants to obtain an evaluation from their state commission. 9. Standard Form 424 (Request for Federal Assistance). Complete the attached Standard Form 424 identified as ``Attachment 7.'' Please be sure that all forms have been signed by an authorized official who can legally represent the organization.
