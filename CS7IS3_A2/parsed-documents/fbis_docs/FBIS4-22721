According to Arkadiy Kramarev, chief of the St. Petersburg GUVD, the operation produced quite good results. Militiamen worked 12-hour shifts; about 9,000 people participated in operational and preventive efforts daily. Not only militiamen but also soldiers in compulsory military service and militia functionaries from Murmansk, Vladimir, Kaliningrad, Kirov, Pskov, Smolensk and other oblasts took part in the effort. The operation was controlled directly by the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] of Russia. In the course of "Signal-2," 4,907 inspections of hotels, dormitories, and other facilities for the temporary residence of citizens were effected; 7,190 locations for the storage and sale of material valuables were checked out, along with 1,164 facilities of the licensing system. The results of "Signal-2," which lasted only two weeks, were two times greater than the statistics of militia activities in the previous month. Some 3,513 crimes were solved, including 43 murders, 90 cases of grave bodily injury, 58 bandit assaults, 282 robberies, and 213 cases of theft of motor vehicles and carjacking. A total of 3,360 criminals were apprehended, of whom 1,815 were "while the trail was hot." Some 292 crimes committed by criminal groups were uncovered. A total of 313 firearms and 681 units of cutting and piercing weapons, 16 grenades, 48 stolen motor vehicles, about 48 kilograms of drugs, money and valuables totalling 718 million rubles, $29,000, and 110 tonnes of rare-earth metals were confiscated from criminals. Lieutenant General Leonid Chervotkin, commander of the Northwestern District of the Internal Troops of the Russian Federation MVD, who was present at the briefing, assured those in attendance that St. Petersburg would be "cleansed" before the Goodwill Games. Among other issues, journalists were interested in new information concerning the talk about the dismissal of Arkadiy Kramarev, which had not died down in two weeks. Without starting a discussion, General Kramarev said: "There has not been an official document to this effect yet." A briefing at the SZ UVDT [Northwestern Directorate of Internal Affairs for Transportation] was held on the same day. The results of the "Signal-2" operation were also announced there. The leadership of the SZ UVDT is particularly concerned about the process of preparations for the Goodwill Games. The Organizational Committee of the games still has not familiarized the SZ UVDT with the schedule for the arrival and departure of the guests. However, despite the difficulties the directorate is already developing a plan of measures for the period of the Goodwill Games. Thus, it is planned to set up 13 operational protection lines at railway terminals and airports effective July. Some 910 people will be used to man them along the travelling route of the participants and guests of the Goodwill Games. According to SZ UVDT Chief Viktor Vlasov, the average number of crimes committed on transportation conveyances has so far dropped by a factor of two.
