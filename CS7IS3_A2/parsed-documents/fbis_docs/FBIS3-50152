Basta, indirectly confirmed the suspicion that the post-November secret service fabricated compromising material against journalists critical of current officials. "Using the same methods, you are arriving at the same conclusions as I have. Of course, I cannot speak about things that are still considered state secrets." This is how Basta answered a RUDE PRAVO question in connection with the RUDE PRAVO article of 15 January that discloses suspicion that the secret service fabricated compromising material against troublesome journalists that it could use in case of need. "I would be only too happy if some matters could be completely clarified. This can apply, for instance, to a certain Security Information Service [BIS] or Interior Ministry's disposition toward such sensitive issues as the freedom of the press," Basta said at the CSSD news conference on Friday. Afterward, he told RUDE PRAVO that he was thinking of cases of press and public opinion manipulation by the Interior Ministry. According to him, other methods were also used to influence journalists. As Basta said, "obviously, all means available to the secret service were used to this purpose. This includes, for instance, the establishment of an opinion-making instrument, which can be established by simply providing exclusive information regardless of the degree of their secrecy to certain journalists. If we glance through RESPEKT magazine since 1990, and possibly some other papers of a similar orientation, precisely from the point of view of the publishing of classified information, we will find at least four infractions or even crimes against the law on state secrets," Basta told RUDE PRAVO. According to him, the matter of the list of alleged State Security [StB] agents in the Syndicate of Journalists also merits an investigation. The list was prepared by the FIS in 1992, but the thing is, nobody was interested in how the diskette with the list of Syndicate members got into the hands of the FIS agents, Basta observed.
