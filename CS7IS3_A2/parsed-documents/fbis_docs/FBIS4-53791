We cannot deny the fact that our government's diplomatic efforts and public opinion calling for quick action for our fellow countrymen were important factors in their arrival in the ROK. All facts surrounding the defection of the five North Koreans, including Mr. Choe Chong-nam, have been kept secret. Therefore, it has been pointed out that intelligence agencies may have been involved in this case to an excessive degree. The government stated they defected to the ROK through legitimate procedures. Still, it has kept everything secret merely at the requests of countries involved. The reasonableness of this secrecy has been questioned. The government stated it would arrange a news conference with the five defectors when a proper method is agreed upon. It has been learned that the five loggers have not received the right of residence or Russian citizenship, which Russia gives to loggers who flee their camps. Therefore, it is believed that, as a result of our government's diplomatic efforts, they received travel permits from Russia, Kazakhstan, or any other country where they had stayed and came to the ROK through a third country. This method is completely different from the way the ROK proposed to Russia: We proposed that the loggers be repatriated to the ROK through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Russia's proposal that Russia and the ROK independently resolve this issue through bilateral negotiations has been implemented. It is very burdensome to the ROK and Russia to have bilateral negotiations to settle this issue. North Korea has shown great resistance several times to the South's Government alleged policy of accepting the loggers as defectors, saying: "If they take loggers to the South, we will regard it as kidnapping." It has been learned that North Korea has also called on Russia, on the basis of the treaty on cooperation in judiciary matters, to apprehend some 40 escaped loggers. The fact that the government has accepted five loggers immediately after it has made a decision gives the impression it has been excessively hasty to show off its achievements. There are some circles calling for self-examination as to whether the government paid a cost that we would not have had to pay if the matter was handled in a reasonable way. In fact, the government has not mapped out any practical measures for procedures to smoothly accept and settle North Korean loggers in our country. Discussions have been made on whether to provide them with 40 million to 50 million won per person for resettlement by applying the `Law on Protecting North Korean Compatriots Who Have Defected to the South'; whether to enact a new law; or how to give them vocational training. No decision has yet been made. So far, about 600 people have defected from North Korea for resettlement in the South. It has been learned that in some cases, they have not received resettlement funds due to lack of money, or in many cases, they have become `aliens' because they have failed to readjust. In view of this situation, some circles point out that instead of accepting North Korean loggers without prior arrangements, it is necessary to make swift preparations for them to help them adjust to a new free world and to live a life worthy of a human being.
