Galvan and M. Cabrera] [Excerpts] Tijuana, Baja California, 10 May--The Attorney General's Office [PGR] requested 30 warrants for the arrest and appearance of ex-officials and ex-agents of the State Attorney's Office, and has already implemented some of them. They are associated with the cases of the shootout at the Christine discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, the confrontation here on 3 March between federal agents and "narcos," and the presumed link between State Judicial Police [PJE] members and the drug Mafia. Today, the ex-state attorney, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, appeared at the PGR headquarters to make his statement. He was interrogated for 15 hours regarding the matter of the credentials carried by bodyguards of the Arellano Felix family drug traffickers at the Christine discotheque. Franco Rios and Alvarez Barriere denied that there was a "massive flight" of ex-PJE members, claiming that all the group chiefs replaced yesterday still remain in town. Furthermore, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office took penal action against the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agent, Gabriel Anzures Carpeta, as a person presumed guilty of crimes against the administration of justice and of theft, during his participation in the arrest of the Baja California deputy attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara. Meanwhile, 100 Federal Judicial Police agents arrived in Ciudad Juarez searching for the Tamaulipas drug trafficking "capo," Juan Garcia Abrego, and the brothers Benjamin, Ramon, and Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, Sinaloan drug dealers involved in the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. This announcement was made by the force's general director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes. Thirty Arrest Warrants After making his statement during a 12-hour period, the ex-commander of the PJE's second sector in this town, Jorge Alvarez Barriere, who admitted having been queried about the incidents of 3 March, remarked that the PGR had issued 30 warrants for arrest and appearance. He confirmed the existence of case record 3455, in connection with which the federal department opened an investigation of state agents' participation in the drug traffic. During his appearance before the PGR, Alvarez Barriere also explained that, at the time of the confrontation in Puerto Vallarta, he was not yet an agent of the force in Tijuana, and hence had no connection with the incident. He also denied having been dismissed from his position, claiming that the one currently heading the force has merely made a substitution. [passage omitted] As for the case involving the state's ex-attorney general, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, his defense attorney, Juan Belmonte Stringel, explained that he had been interrogated for a period of 15 hours regarding the credentials being carried by bodyguards of the drug trafficker, Arellano Felix, during the incidents that occurred at the Christine discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. He added that his client, who remained at the department's facilities from 1800 yesterday until 0800 today, had submitted evidence showing that the identity documents in the drug traffickers' possession were false, and that his signature had been altered. After the questioning, Belmonte Stringel declared that the ex-official, who appeared with an amparo to make statements at the PGR facilities, is by no means linked with the drug traffic or the shooting that occurred on 3 March in this town. [passage omitted] Moreover, in a communique, the PGR stated that, based on the activities cited in preliminary investigation 1142/94, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office found Gabriel Anzures Carpeta, a PJF member, presumably guilty of crimes against the administration of justice and theft. It should be recalled that, when the deputy attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara, was arrested, he was put into a green 1993 Jeep Cherokee without license plates, which had been reported as stolen, and driven by the presumed criminal. The vehicle was detected after the U.S. consul in Tijuana, Edwin Cubbisson, gave the department a list of 25 vehicles stolen in California, including that one, as well as another of the same type, a 1989 model. The PGR spokesman, Jesus Velasco, announced that, to date, five persons have made statements in connection with that preliminary investigation, which was turned over to the sixth district judge of criminal proceedings in Baja California. He stressed that the probes will continue, to determine whether there are other public officials involved in this illicit activity. One Hundred PJF Forces in Juarez The PJF general director in Ciudad Juarez, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, announced that 100 agents from this corps arrived today on a search for the Tamaulipas drug trafficking "capo," Juan Garcia Abrego, and the brothers Benjamin, Ramon, and Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, Sinaloan drug traffickers implicated in the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. The agents arrived on a special plane and on the "guajolota" [turkey], (a DC-6 used by the Attorney General's Office to transport prisoners classified as dangerous). They were headed by Carrera Fuentes and the operations coordinator, Jose Luis Patino, who were lodged in two hotels. During the operation, initiated in Ciudad Juarez, residences in the Campestre Juarez, Country Racquet, and San Marcos subdivisions were searched, as well as some rooms in hotels and even on farms located in the Casas Grandes area of the state's northwestern section. Carrera Fuentes explained that, based on the information held by the PGR, a simultaneous operation is being conducted in this town and Tijuana, "the worst trouble spots in the passage of drugs to the United States." He noted that probes are being made, ranging from bank accounts to operations carried out by the Arellano Felix brothers on this border. Carrera Fuentes claimed that the drug cartel chief in Tamaulipas, Juan Garcia Abrego, was on this border a few days ago. "We are following their trail closely, and expect to capture the Arellano Felix brothers at any moment." [passage omitted]
