In March alone 207,000 units were made, a 15.0-percent rise that marks the second largest monthly figure after last December. Of all, cars produced in the three months totaled 161,000, up 12.9 percent, and commercial vehicles reached 46,000, up 22.8 percent. The sharp gain in the commercial vehicle production was largely helped by a recovery in construction activity, officials said. Domestically 354,000 automobiles were sold, a rather moderate 7.2-percent increase, indicating that the economy, which previously showed signs of overheating, started to stabilize. In the period, a record 161,000 automobiles were exported, up 18.1 percent, thanks to the yen's continued strength and strong sales in the U.S. market. Of the exports, cars numbered 143,000, up 11.9 percent, and commercial autos 18,000, up 110.5 percent.
