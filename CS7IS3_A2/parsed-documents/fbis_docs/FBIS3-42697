Leonid Abalkin, one of the drafters of this report, informed Interfax of this. For some time the report has been under the consideration of First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who, judging by everything, intends to support it as an alternative to the government program approved in the summer of last year. It is quite probable that precisely this document will become the basis for the government program, which an expanded government meeting may adopt during the first 10-day period in February. In contrast to the strategic guidelines approved by the big Council of Ministers in August 1993, the document worked out by Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay Petrakov, and other academicians, in fact, provides for a departure from the anti-inflationary policy and proposes that state regulation in the economy be restored in quite a large volume. It asserts that the "negative tendencies in large measure are rooted in the failures of the policy of financial stabilization." The authors of this report state that it is impossible to wage a fight against inflation by "purely monetaristic methods," while a restriction of the money supply and a reduction of the budget deficit "deprive the national economy of the possibility of making efficient structural changes." "Gaydar's and Fedorov's course has failed," Leonid Abalkin declared yesterday. However, the measures proposed in the report, essentially, do not represent anything new. They were realized in practice through the pressure of enterprise directors during the pre-reform period and, to a somewhat lesser extent, under Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov. The authors of this report again, as during the 1980's, put forward the thesis about the need "to restore the production volume" through the "conversion of the defense industry." As a top-priority measure the report proposes the establishment of "price ratios and sectorial profitability levels efficient for our conditions." In practice, this can mean a departure from price liberalization and the application of methods of administrative regulation in production. "In a number of cases financial adaptation--preferential taxation and the extension of special credit for consumers of products--can help industries, which at present are noncompetitive owing to high prices," the report states. In other words, Messrs. academicians propose that credit injections, which take place anyway, be expanded in order to stabilize the financial position of large Soviet enterprises in the hope that they would consciously make their production more efficient, or without this hope, automatically identifying competitiveness with the absence of competitors and preferential conditions of existence. As it seems, such an approach exhausts the methods of "nonmonetary" effect on the economy and of fighting against inflation by "increasing effective demand." In order to expand the latter, the repeatedly expressed idea of indexing the population's savings to compensate for the price increase is proposed. This measure was actively lobbied in the former Supreme Soviet and was the main argument of Vladimir Ispravnikov, who appeared there in the role of Yegor Gaydar's opponent and after the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet switched over to the government apparatus. Its populist nature is all the more obvious, because the authors of this report propose that indexed funds be "pulled away" from the consumer market, evidently, by freezing deposits in banks. Thus, it is proposed that, in fact, credit emission be carried out, not granting additional real capital to the population, but, on the other hand, increasing the inflationary tax. The authors of this report made an interesting statement on its first page: "Economies of different countries are different." Obviously, this banality would not deserve a place in the academic development of the strategy of the economic course for Russia if not for the subtext, which is an antonym of the famous Russian proverb, "What is good for the German is death for the Russian." Undoubtedly, the approach to the "correction of reforms" developed by Messrs. Abalkin, Petrakov, and so forth, has all the chances to be supported by "commodity producers," whose interests, apparently, will be observed by the government of Viktor Chernomyrdin and Oleg Soskovets. Such an approach makes it possible to refrain for some time from the production of the very commodity that consumers would like to purchase owing to its consumer properties, not in view of the lack of other goods. The promised "selective" credits issued on the expectation of the "consciousness" of Soviet managers can save time for "commodity producers." At the same time, this approach flatters the sense of national exclusiveness, rejecting well-known world experience and referring to world practice not known outside the narrow academic circle. It can be assumed that, if this strategic document is accepted for execution and practical elaboration, real economic reforms will have a chance for continuation only to the extent that the government is incapable of pursuing its course in practice. However, if it seriously begins to act according to an academic scenario, the consequences will not be slow in making themselves felt and will force the political leadership to replace theoreticians with excessive initiative.
