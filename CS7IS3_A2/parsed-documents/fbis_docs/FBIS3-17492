Elections were recognised as valid in all the rural constituencies, while the minimum turnout of 35 per cent was not registered at any of the constituencies in the city or Ryazan itself. This is why only one deputy to the regional duma was elected there. According to the current regulations, repeated elections may be held there no sooner that in three months. So far as the future of the regional duma is concerned, a final decision will be taken by the regional electoral commission today after the final count of votes. The decision will hardly be positive, because one more deputy is needed to make the quorum. Nizhniy Novgorod -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Evald Kessariysky: The results of elections to the representative bodies of power were rather promising in that region. An average of 32 per cent of electors took part in the voting. 32 deputies were elected to the regional legislative assembly, and repeated elections will be held in 13 constituencies. The turnout was rather high in the city of Nizhniy Novgorod. According to preliminary results, 25 deputies were elected there. Repeated elections will be held in nine constituencies. Tambov -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Russkiy: Elections have been recognised as valid in the Tambov region with a population of 1.5 million, Chairman of the Regional Electoral Commission Nikolay Vorobev told ITAR-TASS. 43.3 per cent of electors took part in the voting. Thirty deputies were elected to the regional duma and 16 deputies -- to the city duma. A Tambov mayor was also elected for the first time ever. According to the preliminary information, the incumbent mayor of Tambov Valeriy Koval, 42, leader of local democrats, was elected to that post. He defeated a candidate from Rutskoy's party and a representative of communists. Voronezh -- By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Starukhin: Residents of the Voronezh region, and especially urban dwellers, did not show much enthusiasm about the Sunday elections to local representative bodies of power. According to preliminary results, only 23 per cent of electors took part in elections to the Voronezh municipal council, and elections can be recognised as valid only in seven constituencies out of 17. Turnout was a little higher during the elections to the regional duma, because residents of rural areas took part in them. A total figure is 42 per cent. However, the needed minimum was not reached at ten urban constituencies, and repeated elections will have to be held there. Elections seem to be valid in the remaining 35 constituencies, mostly in rural areas.
