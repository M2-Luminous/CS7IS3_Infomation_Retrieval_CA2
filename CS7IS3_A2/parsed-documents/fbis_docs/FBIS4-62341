As for holiday makers, the Crimean Government reached an oral agreement with Kiev on considerably facilitating a customs inspection procedure for those arriving in the Crimea. The Crimean vice-premier pointed out that it is too early yet to speak about the Crimea joining the rouble zone. However, he invited all those wishing to have a rest in the Crimea to visit Crimean resorts, adding that they will feel comfortable there with "Russian roubles."
