Merton] [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] commissioners are paid R25,000 [rand] a month, in keeping with the Transitional Executive Council's principle of "no gain, no loss", IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said on Thursday [14 April]. Speaking at a press briefing, he said those seconded to the commission were paid by their regular employers who could claim the salaries back from the commission. However, some employers had volunteered to bear the costs of seconded commissioners' salaries. The two IEC advocates were paid a salary in line which what they would have received in private practice, he added. American commissioner Ms gaye McDougal was getting a salary equal to the one she was paid in the United States, with an additional subsistance allowance, he said. Commissioners could also receive non-executive director's fees. Nobody was entitled to benefits such as pension, medical aid or leave pay, Mr Justice Kriegler said. The IEC employs 16 commissioners, 11 from South Africa and five from abroad. IEC finance sub-committee convenor Rosil Jager said the commission's preliminary budget was more than R696.5 million."The logistics of the elections are an enormous task," she said. "The scope of our operations has been changed by external circumstance," she added, referring to contingencies such as the double ballot system. Mrs Jager said staff levels has also been problematic. The commission had increased its staff from 200 to about 200,000 within a very short time. A source said the IEC was not yet certain how long it would be in existence after the elections, but would cut its staff back radically from April 29. The greatest proportion of the budget, R375.8 million, was allocated to election administration, which included salaries, printing costs and building rentals. IEC financial director Nonesi Ndungane said nearly R163.5 million was allocated to election monitoring. This would cover, among others, monitors' salaries and transport. It was "the price of the legitimacy of the elections", she said. The commission's adjudication directorate received nearly R29.5 million, most of which was used to pay legal staff. The IEC's office received R5.5 million, the communication directorate R29.5 million and voter education about R26.7 million. Mrs Ndungane said the IEC would honour any liabilities incurred when it cancelled April hotel bookings countrywide, but the World Trade Centre rental dispute was a matter for the public works department. A Public Works Department spokesman recently refused to comment on the issue, saying "legal representatives were looking into the matter". The IEC budget was approved by both the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] and the State Finance Department. It will be audited by the auditor-general. Mr Justice Kriegler also announced the TEC had approved a doubling of the election fund, to R44 million. He was hopeful the increase would soon be approved by the state Finance Department. This meant political parties qualifying for assistance because they had collected sufficient signatures could receive what he called a second dividend. The fund was set up to help political parties finance their campaigns.
