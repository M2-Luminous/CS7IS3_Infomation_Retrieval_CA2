FR940728-1-00032 FR940728-1-00011 40 CFR Part 52 [OAQPS # CA 37&hyph;10&hyph;6201; FRL&hyph;5021&hyph;7] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Ventura County Air Pollution Control District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. These revisions concern the control of oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) from boilers, steam generators, process heaters, and oilfield drilling operations. The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO X ) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA actions on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. DATES: Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing on or before August 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A. Meer, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. Please refer to document number CA 37&hyph;10&hyph;6201 in all correspondence. Copies of the rules and EPA's evaluation report of each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region 9 office during normal business hours. Copies of the submitted rules are also available for inspection at the following locations: California Air Resources Board, Stationary Source Division, Rule Evaluation Section, 2020 ``L'' Street, Sacramento, CA 95814. Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, 800 South Victoria Avenue, Ventura, CA 93009. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Duane F. James, Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, Telephone: (415) 744&hyph;1191. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Applicability The rules being proposed for approval into the California SIP include: Ventura County Air Pollution Control District's (VCAPCD) Rule 74.15, ``Boilers, Steam Generators and Process Heaters,'' and Rule 74.16, ``Oilfield Drilling Operations.'' These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to EPA on April 5, 1991 (Rule 74.16) and June 19, 1992 (Rule 74.15). Background On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO X emissions through reasonably available control technology (RACT) are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November 25, 1992, EPA published a NPRM entitled ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO X Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, notice should be referred to for further information on the NO X requirements and is incorporated into this proposal by reference. Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO X (``major'' as defined in section 302 and section 182 (c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas. The Ventura County Area is classified as severe; 1 therefore this area was subject to the RACT requirements of section 182(b)(2), cited above, including the November 15, 1992 deadline. 1 The Ventura County Area retained its designation of nonattainment and was classified by operation of law pursuant to sections 107(d) and 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the CAA. See 55 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by a pre-enactment control technologies guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document) by November 15, 1992. There were no NO X CTGs issued before enactment and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO X sources since enactment of the CAA. The RACT rules covering NO X sources and submitted as SIP revisions are expected to require final installation of the actual NO X controls by May 31, 1995, for those sources where installation by that date is practicable. The State of California submitted the rules being acted on in this document on April 5, 1991, and June 19, 1992. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for VCAPCD's Rule 74.15, ``Boilers, Steam Generators and Process Heaters,'' and Rule 74.16, ``Oilfield Drilling Operations.'' VCAPCD adopted Rule 74.16 on January 8, 1991, and Rule 74.15 on December 3, 1991. These submitted rules were found to be complete on May 21, 1991 (Rule 74.16) and August 27, 1992 (Rule 74.15) pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix V 2 , and are being proposed for approval into the SIP. 2 EPA adopted the completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (56 FR 42216).
