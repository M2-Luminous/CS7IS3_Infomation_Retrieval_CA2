The official added that the commitments were assumed with [word indistinct] in the legislation and the Mexican economic situation and that equitable treatment was also considered, as well as advancements in economic deregulation insofar as economic, political, and legal conditions allow. He said that among the most difficult requirements Mexico must meet is to achieve strong, sustained growth [words indistinct] to ensure that foreign businessmen will have greater freedom to conduct all types of business in Mexico. Dultzin also said that Mexico will receive the same treatment as other members [words indistinct] of the activities [words indistinct] Mexicans in those nations. As for the membership fee, Dultzin, who has also served as technical coordinator for Mexico's integration process with the OECD since 1993, emphasized that the members' annual contributions, determined by GDP, population, and exchange rate, finance the organization. He also pointed out that joining the international organization could mean that the Mexican public debt will go from a 100-percent risk factor [ponderacion] to being risk free, as is the case with the U.S., German, French, and British debts. Loans extended to Mexican banks, instead of being subject to a 100-percent risk factor, as is currently the case, would only be subject to 20 percent. Dultzin explained, however, that the country will not receive the benefit automatically. Mexico had to take several measures to be accepted into the OECD, such as adjusting [words indistinct] and satisfying minimum maritime transportation safety requirements. Dultzin indicated that Mexico's deep sea fishing fleet meets current safety requirements, while the country's freighters will be given a stipulated period of time to fulfill the requirements. He added that consultations were made with the United States and Canada to solve issues related to the automobile industry included in the free trade agreement negotiations. The Mexican official indicated that Mexico's OECD admittance date, 24 March, had been anticipated from the beginning of the year, which encouraged more long-term confidence and self-confidence among Mexicans. Mexico established relations with the OECD in 1982 after joining the organization's Steel Committee, where it gradually increased its participation until it was finally accepted in 1990 as a full member. In 1991, arrangements were made for an OECD mission [words indistinct] after which Mexico was accepted as an observer in several of the organization's committees.
