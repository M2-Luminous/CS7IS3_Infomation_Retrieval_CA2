FR940825-2-00039 FR940825-2-00019 Notice of Intention to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement The Commission staff has determined that licensing the existing projects could constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for Thunder Bay and Hillman Hydro Project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's EIS will consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed project and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by the Commission staff and considered in a final EIS. Project Site Visit The applicant and Commission staff will conduct a project site visit of the Thunder Bay and Hillman Hydro Project. The site meeting will be held starting at 1:00 P.M. on September 6, 1994 at the entrance of the Best Western Motel, 1286 M32 West, Alpena, Michigan and continue the next day (on September 7, 1994), and if needed on September 8, 1994, as well. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend. All participants are responsible for their own transportation to and from the project site. For more details, interested parties should contact Patrick Murphy, FERC, at (202) 219&hyph;2659, prior to the site visit date. Scoping Meetings The Commission staff will conduct one evening scoping meeting and one morning scoping meeting. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. To help focus discussions, a preliminary EIS scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the scoping meetings will be distributed by mail to persons and entities on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping document will also be made available at the meetings. The evening meeting will be held on Wednesday, September 7, 1994, from 7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. (or later) at the Natural Resources Center, Room 150 (NRC 150), Alpena Community College, 666 Johnson Street, Alpena, Michigan.
