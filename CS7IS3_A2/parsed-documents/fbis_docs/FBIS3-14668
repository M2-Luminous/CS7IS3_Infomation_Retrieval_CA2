AL-BA'TH writes: It has been shown to be impossible for Israel's policy to lead the region to the desired peace. The paper notes that since the positive summit session between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton Israel has been temporizing, maneuvering, and skirting the peace process and its basic components. Israel is bent on negating all that has been achieved in the interest of the peace process by fabricating incidents that could rekindle and destabilize the Middle East, directly affecting the peace process, which Israel views as being in conflict with its short- and long-term objectives. Israel objects to the terms of a just and comprehensive peace laid out in the UN resolutions as preconditions for any settlement. Israel's conduct inside occupied Palestinian territory and in Lebanon is designed to rekindle Lebanon, camouflage its crimes in the occupied territories, and derail the peace process. While Israel professes to be concerned about peace, it is carrying out a policy aimed at killing every chance for peace and implementing its game plan of promoting a greater Israel, through massacres in the occupied land and attempts to reignite Lebanon. AL-BA'TH concludes: Working for a just and comprehensive peace necessarily means creating the right climate in the region. Had Israel been concerned about the peace process, it would have at least committed itself to the implementation of the UN resolutions. Tel Aviv, is however, not serious about peace. Its attention is focused on sabotaging the peace process. Discussing the same theme, AL-THAWRAH writes: Since the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the heavy hand of Israel's terror has been felt throughout the Palestinian arena, and has been escalating systematically. AL-THAWRAH points to the deliberate killings committed by Israel on a daily basis. Blind and savage Zionist hatred has extended to Lebanon to assassinate the peace march, stability, and national unity, and sap the country's strength so as to make it easier to dictate its terms. There has been an international condemnation of Israeli aggressiveness and crimes and anti-peace policies. Yet, instead of international efforts being directed at forcing the Israeli rulers to comply with UN resolutions, pressure is being applied to victimized Arabs -- the only pary commited to peace. It is important, AL-THAWRAH concludes, to reiterate that double standards cannot help the peace process. TISHRIN, discussing the Jabalyah refugee camp massacre in Gaza, which claimed the lives of six Fatah hawks at the hands of Israel's secret units -- death squads disguised in civilian clothes -- writes: The new Israeli massacre was committed in the context of atrocities planned to browbeat the Palestinian people, quell their intifadah, and push them into unconditional capitulation. For Israel there is nothing to choose between one Palestinian and another; in its eyes all of them, including pregnant women and sucklings, are enemies. The escalation against the Palestinians began after the signing of the Oslo agreement and since the Palestinian side deepened its involvement in the talks to put that accord in place. Before they began the secret talks with the Palestinians in Oslo, the Israelis threatened to effect a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza strip, after their presence there had become a veritable inferno. But once the accord was signed, they adopted the tactic of temporization, withdrawing neither from Gaza nor from Jericho. And they are not planning any pullout. They saw in the Oslo agreement and its aftermath a pretext to escalate their criminal actions against the Palestinian people. The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are far from addressing the substance of the Palestinian cause, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the UN Security Council resolutions, the Madrid formula, or the peace requirements. The Palestinian side is yielding fresh ground at each negotiating round. What all parties should seek is a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict. Faced with mounting Palestinian resistance and a united Palestinian front, Israel contemplated a withdrawal from Gaza before the Oslo agreement. Today, however, is does not seem to be in any rush. Israel sees in the split in the Palestinian people's ranks and the continued involvement of the Palestinian side in the self-rule negotiations a golden opportunity for settling scores with the entire Palestinian community. Unless the Palestinian side rectifies its position by returning to full coordination with the other Arab parties and the components of a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts, it will be the Palestinian cause that will suffer.
