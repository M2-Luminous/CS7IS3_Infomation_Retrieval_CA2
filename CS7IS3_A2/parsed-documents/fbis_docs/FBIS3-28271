Mr. Kantor left Japan for the United States on 4 February and it is believed he will report to President Clinton that the Japanese are determined to block the "numerical targets." Now, how the upcoming Japan-U.S. summit will settle the dispute over numerical targets has become a focal point. During the series of meetings with Japanese ministers, Mr. Kantor stressed the importance of Japan-U.S. relations and then said: "If the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks fail to produce any results, the United States would adopt a different way." In this way, he suggested that the United States will not hesitate to restore the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. In response to his remarks, the Japanese side said: "He took a tough attitude in an attempt to press Japan for trade concessions" and added that this tough attitude was anticipated.
