FR940418-1-00020 FR940418-1-00004 Where: UDV = Total volume of all enclosed spaces below the upper deck in cubic meters. LOA = The Length overall, i.e., the length of the ship in meters from the foremost to the aftermost points, including a bulbous bow if present. MB = Moulded breadth in meters as defined in §135.12(c). D = Moulded depth in meters as defined in §135.12(b). SLD = Summer loaded draft (in meters) i.e., the maximum depth to which the vessel's hull may be immersed when in a summer zone. SLDISP = Summer loaded displacement, i.e., the actual weight in metric tons of the water displaced by the vessel when immersed to her SLD. (ii) If §135.42(a)(2)(i) proves unworkable, the total volume of the hull below the upper deck will be determined by multiplying the product of the LOA, MD and D by the appropriate coefficient listed in the following table: ␣ 1LOA in meters 1Coefficient 0 to 30 .7150 > 30 to 60 .7250 > 60 to 90 .7360 > 90 to 120 .7453 > 120 to 150 .7328 > 150 to 180 .7870 > 180 to 210 .8202 > 210 to 240 .7870 > 240 to 270 .7328 > 270 .7453 (3) The total volume of a vessel is the sum of the volume of the structures above the upper deck as determined in accordance with §135.42(a)(1) and the volume of the hull below the upper deck as determined in accordance with §135.42(a)(2)(i) or (ii). (b) Vessels which have had their total volume determined in accordance with §135.41 or this section may apply for readmeasurement when they have a new or corrected ITC 69, a suitable substitute or present documentation sufficient to calculate total volume.
