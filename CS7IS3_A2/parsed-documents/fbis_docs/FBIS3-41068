Quiroga also reported that 21 other people, who allegedly are members of one of the largest drug trafficking rings in the country, also were taken into custody as a result of this drug enforcement operation. The minister noted that this constitutes a mortal blow to a gang that has been operating in Bolivia and other countries since the mid-70's thanks to the support of Colombian drug cartels. The gang led by Chavarria was not only engaged in selling thousands of kilograms of illegal drugs but also the laundering of millions of U.S. dollars. Moreover, Meco Domingez' cooperation with police since he was arrested by police last December on drug trafficking charges played a decisive role as it enabled police to arrest these 22 people. [passage omitted] Chavarria's gang turned over 500 kg of drugs every fortnight. It is believed that the drug was processed in sophisticated laboratories located in some forested regions in El Beni Department. [passage omitted] During this operation--called Endless--the FELCN conducted a mass roundup of alleged drug traffickers and seized 14 properties and a large number of weapons, including rifles, shotguns, machine guns, grenades, and three radio transmitters.
