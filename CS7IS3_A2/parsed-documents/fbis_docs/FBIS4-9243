He is accompanied by Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans. The formal talks between the Dutch delegation and Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, now acting prime minister, lasted more than two hours. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov also attended the talks. "It is the sides' shared opinion that there are still untapped possibilities in the field of economic relations which should be further developed based on the good relations the two countries maintain," the spokesman for the Bulgarian Government reported after the meeting. Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev believes that it is possible to activate bilateral economic relations mainly in the field of investment, production, finance and lending. He thanked the Dutch side for its assistance in the stabilization of Bulgaria's balance of payments. Bulgaria expressed its readiness to accept Dutch investments in the construction of a transport corridor from the Black Sea to Bulgaria's western border, a transport corridor connecting the south and the north by building a tunnel under the Shipka Pass (in the Balkan Range), and the construction of a new bridge across the Danube. "The Bulgarian side hopes that the Netherlands will continue to support Bulgaria's efforts for integration with all the European structures and will ratify its Interim Agreement on Trade with the European Union at an early date," Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev was cited as saying. The prime minister of the Netherlands described Bulgarian-Dutch cooperation within the framework of the International Monetary Fund as very successful and praised Bulgaria's joining the Partnership for Peace plan. Mr. Lubbers admitted there are many potentials for the advancement of bilateral relations, pointing out the need of updating all older bilateral agreements and creating a modern legal framework for the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments. He showed interest in the political and economic situation in Bulgaria at the moment, the problems of ethnic minorities in Bulgaria and human rights, Bulgaria's position on the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Balkan relations. In Mr. Matinchev's opinion, the ongoing process of Bulgaria's settling its debts to the Paris Club of official creditors and the London Club of creditor banks is a light at the end of the tunnel. Mr. Matinchev sees the lack of an earlier settlement of Bulgaria's external debt problem and the Yugo-embargo as the main reasons for the slow progress of reforms in this country. According to calculations made by employing the methods of the world body, Bulgaria has suffered a loss of 3,200 million U.S. dollars as a result of the strict application of sanctions against the former Yugoslavia. The direct losses in the country's balance of payments since the beginning of this year only are estimated at 700-900 million U.S. dollars. Mr. Matinchev informed Mr. Lubbers about the political life in Bulgaria, stressing that despite the heated debates in parliament, the country is an island of peace free of interethnic or other conflicts. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov made a detailed analysis of Bulgaria's position on the Yugo-crisis and outlined the parameters of its Balkan policy and its relations with Greece, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Turkey. After the formal talks the foreign ministers of Bulgaria and the Netherlands signed a joint political declaration between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the two countries. "This is the first declaration signed by representatives of the two countries since the collapse of communism in Bulgaria," the media were told by Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans. "The document spells out everything that Bulgaria and the Netherlands have in common, the two countries are members of many international organizations and have many common goals," Mr. Kooijmans said. Listing those common goals, he stressed the stability and economic prosperity of Europe and cooperation in a lot of fields. "Most important is the prevention of conflicts, and stability also means security, the European countries should cross-cooperate in the military organization, it is very important to make the idea for peace a reality," the Dutch foreign minister said. "The joint political declaration makes provisions for bilateral cooperation in economy, politics, trade and culture in the light of the two countries' common goals," Bulgarian foreign minister Daskalov specified. Tomorrow the Dutch delegation will have meetings with President Zhelyu Zhelev and National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov.
