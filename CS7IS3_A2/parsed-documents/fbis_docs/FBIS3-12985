FBIS3-12985 "drnes045_l_94007" FBIS-NES-94-045 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 ISRAEL Labor Says Meretz Inclusion `Vital' for Talks TA0703160294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1400 GMT 7 Mar 94 TA0703160294 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Text] The Labor bureau and caucus decided that the agreement with Meretz is binding and it is vital for the continuation of the peace talks that Meretz remain in the coalition. The participants also expressed support for the initiative to co-opt into the coalition any Knesset faction that accepts the government's basic guidelines and the agreement with the PLO. The prime minister told the meeting that in the wake of the Hebron massacre there is an atmosphere of pre-retaliation in the Arab world. The government must be prepared, and expand the coalition. Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin attacked the prime minister saying that he does not call a spade a spade, and plays a game of saying yes and no at the same time. Beilin quoted from the Kahn Commission on the Sabra and Shatila massacre on what it had to say about Refa'el Eytan and asked how international public opinion and the Arabs could accept Eytan joining the government. Beilin was constantly interrupted by catcalls. The Meretz Knesset faction unilaterally reaffirmed its opposition to Tzomet joining the government. The faction said that Meretz cannot be a member of a government in which Tzomet is a member under the present circumstances, and its ministers will resign the moment negotiations are opened between Labor and Tzomet. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir notes that during the meeting, Minister Shulamit Aloni apologized for her reported remarks in YEDI'OT AHARONOT that Sarid "is a spokesman and a public relations man" and said she had no intention of criticizing Yosi Sarid. She also made it clear that there is no basis for the reports that she opposes the faction's stand on Tzomet. Meretz decided to express full confidence in Minister Yosi Sarid and his contribution to the movement's position on Tzomet. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 7 March adds: "Tzomet sources told our correspondent that senior party members who spoke to Prime Minister Rabin over the phone during the past few hours understood that the Tzomet story is over, and that the main thing now is bringing SHAS (Torah Observing Sephardim) back into the government while reaching a compromise with Meretz. Tripartite Meretz-SHAS-Labor negotiations are currently under way." ] Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan informed his Knesset faction that he is waiting to hear from the prime minister, if he intends to invite Tzomet to negotiations on joining the coalition. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports Eytan as saying that if he is invited, he will go to the meeting. Nobody in the faction had reservations about that position. Eytan said he would present the prime minister with positions he has coordinated with Zvulun Hammer, the National Religious Party chairman.
