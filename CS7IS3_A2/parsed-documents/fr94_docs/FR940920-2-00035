Delmarva Power & Light Company [Docket No. ER94&hyph;1628&hyph;000] Take notice that on September 6, 1994, Delmarva Power & Light Company (Delmarva) of Wilmington, Delaware, filed under the provisions of Section 205 of the Federal Power Act a twenty-year power supply contract (the Service Agreement) under which Delmarva will provide all requirements service to the Town of Clayton, Delaware (Clayton). Delmarva states that the Service Agreement supersedes Delmarva's Rate Schedule No. 64 under which Clayton currently receives service. Delmarva, with Clayton's concurrence, requests a waiver of the 60-day notice requirement and an effective date as allowed for by the terms of the Service Agreement that commences with the date prior to November 6, 1994, that Clayton actually begins taking all requirements service from the Company. Alternatively, Delmarva asks for an effective date of November 6, 1994, which is sixty days after the filing date. The Service Agreement provides for the continuation of the requirements service previously furnished Clayton under Rate Schedule No. 64, but changes certain terms and conditions. The chief differences between the Service Agreement and Rate Schedule No. 64 are that the Service Agreement provides for all requirements service as a change from the partial requirements service Clayton was receiving, establishes a new rate for Clayton which is below the level of the rate currently charged Clayton and below the settlement rate previously established for Clayton in Docket No. ER92&hyph;236&hyph;000, and provides for future adjustments to the Clayton rate based on changes in the level of Delmarva's retail rates. The Service Agreement has a twenty year term. Delmarva states that the filing has been posted and has been served upon the affected customer and the Delaware Public Service Commission. Comment date: September 27, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice. 9. Southern Company Services, Inc.
