He said that he agrees with the Army commander about implementing strong measures against the Cambodian robbers. Regarding preventive measures, all sides must coordinate with each other to make them work. These include those in the government administrative circle -- the Interior Ministry and the unit in charge of national security; and the military with the major tasks of preventing violations of sovereignty -- the Royal Thai Army and the Royal Thai Navy. In the case of serious incidents, the Royal Thai Air Force should also lend a hand. In any case, the defense minister agrees with the idea of implementing extremely decisive actions against the bandits in the future. The reason is that many Thais have been killed and wounded. At the same time coordination has begun with the National Defense Ministry of Cambodia and the Cambodian side pledged to try to prevent such incidents from occurring. Meanwhile, a group of armed Cambodian bandits held three Thai officials of the Thapthim Sayam project and demanded ransom. Following coordination between Thai authorities and Cambodian representatives, the Thai side agreed to pay 120,000 baht in exchange for the release of the hostages. [passage omitted]
