The bioindustrial science park of Canavese made its first steps yesterday in Ivrea. The Canavese Bioindustry Park limited company was established. Its founders include the RBM biomedical company, Finpiemonte (regional holding company), Federpiemonte, Assindustria Ivrea, Olivetti, the Turin provincial authority, and the municipal authorities of Ivrea and Colloretto Giacosa. The design and construction phase of the bioindustry park will take place over 1994-95 and in 1996 the park will begin to manage the services that will be made available to the companies housed there. The initial cost of the park is estimated to be 30 billion lire for 8,000 square meters of laboratories that will be made available to university researchers and private companies beginning in 1996. In the area located in the municipality of Colloretto Giacosa, on the outskirts of Ivrea, a staff of up to 400 will be involved in activities related to the pharmaceutical, chemical, environmental, veterinary, food and agriculture, and medical sectors. Ivrea ensures that this is the first initiative of its kind in Europe with an entirely biotechnological vocation. Europe is playing a fundamental role in the development of the park because 21 billion lire come from funds for projects promoted by the EU [European Union] for areas of industrial decline (which in Piedmont include the province of Turin and Verbano-Cusio-Ossola). The Canavese initiative is part of a second allocation of investments, to be made over 1995-96 and amounting to more than 583 billion lire to be divided between public and private projects for the two areas of Piedmont. "In the first semester of 1994," said Industry Councillor for the Piedmont Region Giuseppe Cerchio, "the first phase involving an investment of 558 billion lire will be completed." The new projects concern a wide range of sectors, but special emphasis has been placed on technological innovation and the construction of science parks. "For this area," explained Cerchio, "the overall investment amounts to 53 billion lire, 37 of which come from EU, government, and regional funds while the remaining sum has been covered by promoting committees that have already been established and that include the municipal authorities, organizations, companies and private groups." The completion of the Lake Maggiore park, which began with the first part of the program has also been approved. Funding will also be provided for a feasibility study on the Caselle aeronautical science park -- which the regional authorities will support in the future -- and the Canavese technology district will be approved. However, as far as these last projects are concerned, these are only the first steps pending other operational programs.
