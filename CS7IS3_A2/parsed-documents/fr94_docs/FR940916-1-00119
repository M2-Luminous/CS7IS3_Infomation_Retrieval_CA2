FR940916-1-00119 FR940916-1-00016 Section 232.813. This section specifies which conventional freight trains are required to be operated with two-way EOT devices. Based on Section 7 of the RSERA and after review of the comments received and the accidents relied on for support of the use of two-way EOT devices, FRA proposes that the devices be required on trains that operate at speeds in excess of 30 mph and on trains that operate in mountain grade territories. (A detailed discussion of mountain grade territory is contained in the discussion of appendix C.) FRA proposes to except several types of trains from the requirements regarding the use of two-way EOT devices. In addition to those trains specifically excluded in the statute, FRA believes that there are other operations that should also be excepted. FRA recognizes that the safety reasons for requiring two-way EOT devices are less compelling in two types of operations (i) freight trains having the ability to initiate a brake application from other than the front end and (ii) trains equipped with fully independent secondary braking systems. In order to provide the industry with time to acquire a sufficient number of two-way EOT devices and to ease the economic impact of acquiring the devices, FRA proposes not to mandate compliance with any regulation requiring the use of two-way EOT devices until January 1, 1997. This section also establishes the calibration and stenciling requirements for two-way EOT devices. FRA agrees with several of the commenters that the 92-day calibration period currently required for one-way devices is outdated and was established at a time when there was little experience with these types of devices. Since that time, FRA has received no evidence indicating that the calibration of the devices is difficult to maintain. Furthermore, several railroads attested to the reliability of the one-way and two-way devices, contending that the failure rates of the devices are extremely low. Consequently, FRA proposes that two-way EOT devices be calibrated at least once a year. In order to ensure timely calibration of these devices, the date the next calibration is due shall be marked on both the front and rear units. Based on the statutory mandate contained in §7 of the RSERA, recodified at 49 U.S.C. 20141, and after consideration of Congress' purpose in enacting the provisions contained in that section, FRA finds no safety or public interest justification at this time to exclude any categories of trains or rail operations, other than those specifically enumerated in this section, from the requirements regarding two-way EOT devices. Due to the clear statutory mandate and because there is little data currently available regarding the operational and safety benefits specifically attributable to two-way EOT devices, FRA has not provided any benefits to offset the cost of this provision in our cost/benefit analysis. However, FRA is aware of several recent incidents that might have been avoided had the involved trains been equipped with two-way EOT devices. Among these incidents are the following: •On May 17, 1990, near Nampa, Idaho, a Union Pacific train was involved in a side collision, probably due to a crimped train line hose, resulting in the retardation of the brake pipe pressure reduction and preventing an emergency brake application throughout the train. The estimated damage of this incident was in excess of $130,000. •On September 18, 1991, near Spague, Washington, a Burlington Northern train derailed, probably because a trespasser closed an angle cock, causing interference with the air brake system. The derailment resulted in the release of hazardous materials and the evacuation of four people from the area. Damages to railroad property were estimated at over $3.8 million. •On March 7, 1992, near Kansas City, Missouri, a Kansas City Southern train was involved in a railroad at grade crossing accident, probably due to a closed angle cock on the trailing end of the first car in the train resulting in inadequate braking ability. The incident resulted in the derailment of several locomotives and freight cars, and damage was estimated at over $930,000. •On October 1, 1993, near Keystone, Nebraska, a loaded Union Pacific coal train collided head on with an empty Union Pacific coal train. The suspected cause of the incident was a closed angle cock at about the 15th car, which prevented application of the brakes beyond that point. Property damage was estimated at over $2 million, and some members of the crew sustained serious personal injuries. •On December 25, 1993, near Seward, Nebraska, a Burlington Northern train was involved in a rear-end collision and the train's crewmen were forced to jump from the moving train. Subsequent investigation of the incident revealed that the sixth car in the train had a kinked air hose and ice in the hose couplings. Property damage was estimated at over $1.2 million. The two most recent incidents cited above involved unit coal trains that encountered blockages in the brake pipe near the front cars in the trains, resulting in an inability of the brakes to set from those cars to the rear of the train. Due to these incidents both of the involved carriers are in the process of equipping their unit coal trains with two-way EOT devices. In the incidents cited above, it appears that the actual damage incurred and the potential damage to life and property might have been avoided had the trains involved been equipped with two-way EOT devices. Thus, FRA believes some safety benefits may be achieved by mandating the use of these devices; however, FRA is not able to provide quantifiable data regarding the safety benefits of the devices. Consequently, FRA requests comments and information from interested parties regarding other recent incidents that might have been avoided if trains covered by this proposal were equipped with two-way EOT devices. FRA also requests comments from interested parties detailing the quantitative and qualitative safety and operational benefits derived from the use of two-way EOT devices. Section 232.815. This section provides the operating requirements for dealing with en route failures of various train brake system components. (It should be noted that in order to avoid civil penalty liability, a railroad must also comply with the limitations stated in §232.17.) The proposed general guiding principles for handling en route failures of train brake system components are: (i) the railroad shall reduce the maximum operating speed of the train to the extent necessary to safely compensate for the loss in available retarding force due to the en route failure and (ii) a train shall not proceed beyond the next point where brake system repairs can be made to restore the full available brake system retarding force if a train experiences an en route brake system failure that reduces the total available retarding force. FRA feels adherence to these two general guiding principles will allow railroads to continue to move freight and passengers safely when brake system failures occur.
