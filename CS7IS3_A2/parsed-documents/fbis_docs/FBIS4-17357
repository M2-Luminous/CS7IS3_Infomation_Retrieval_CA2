For Starters, it Proposes That Market Be Crossed With Collectivism"] [Text] The ideological and moral principles of the White movement are still topical in present-day Russia, leaders of the People's Workers' Union of Russian Solidarists [NTS] claim. Despite the collapse of communism and the Soviet power, the oldest anti-Soviet organization does not consider its historic mission played out. At a press conference held at the Revolution Museum yesterday, NTS leaders unveiled their program for erecting Russia's "new ideological core." The victory of the Reds in the four-year Civil War undoubtedly amounted to a national catastrophe that has brought about the corruption of morals and the social enslavement of Russian citizens, Dmitriy Khanov, NTS activist, said. Having long predicted an end to the Soviet system, the solidarists did not expect that the revival would take so long to complete. The ideology to heal the nation and create a new Russian community should be a theory of solidarism synthesizing a liberal market economy, collective traditions, and statehood, the NTS believes. An integral part of the overall national revival are geopolitical efforts to bring the nation to a healthy state. The RSFSR's administrative borders inherited from Bolshevism cannot be seen as enduring boundaries of the Russian state, the chairman of the NTS executive bureau thinks. Nonetheless, the future merger of historical Russian lands, NTS leaders believe, will proceed peacefully through the natural attraction of a number of republics to each other. Meanwhile, the issue of Crimea, where a referendum has already been held, should be a subject of international talks. In the solidarists' view, the Russian leadership should courageously and openly announce its historical responsibility for the future of the Crimean peninsula. The Russian leadership, however, can acquire the moral right to solve territorial disputes only after it gets rid of the Soviet heritage. The NTS, which has not been encumbered with a totalitarian heritage, is already preparing the ground for future talks. "The NTS congratulates you on the results of the referendum," said a leaflet distributed by solidarists in Sevastopol. "Crimea was the last corner of Russian land that was defended from the Bolsheviks by Vrangel's White Army. Your will, your craving for Russia is a bone in the throat of [Ukrainian] independence-seekers."
