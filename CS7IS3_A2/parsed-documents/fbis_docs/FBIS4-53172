This forum will be the first ministerial-level meeting on the security issues of the Asia Pacific region. With the major aim of building confidence among nations in this region, Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who will attend this meeting, will urge the participating countries to "enhance transparency of their military capability." Japan particularly intends to call on Southeast Asian countries and China, which are said not to be conscious of the importance of transparency, to compile "white papers" on national defense affairs. However, since this is the first security conference with China and Russia, Japan will not hastily seek a conclusion on how to deal with the Korean peninsula issue at this conference. This forum will open in Bangkok on 25 July prior to the Enlarged ASEAN Foreign Ministers Conference. Apart from the six ASEAN nations, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei, Japan, the United States, Australia, China, and Russia are among the 18 participating nations in the conference. Foreign ministers from these countries will freely exchange their views on the security system in the Asia Pacific region. Thailand, host country of this conference, proposes to discuss the "security situation in the Asia Pacific region." The Japanese Government will dispatch Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda to attend a senior working-level meeting of the Enlarged ASEAN Foreign Ministers Conference scheduled in Bangkok from 22 to 25 May to discuss details of the agenda, including Japan's proposal. At the security forum, Kakizawa will make a speech to explain Japan's basic policy to the participating countries. Japan believes that "the Asia Pacific region needs to form a new security framework to deal with the situation after the end of the Cold War. As a prerequisite to this, it is important to build confidence among the countries in this region." Based on this idea, he will stress in his speech the need for improving transparency of military and defense capabilities of each country. Most participating countries, except Japan, the United States, and Australia, have not disclosed the actual state of their military capabilities. Therefore, Japan will request the countries concerned to work out "white papers" equivalent to Japan's Defense White Paper. Behind Japan's proposal is the fact that moves to strengthen military capabilities are noted in China and Indonesia, and the ASEAN nations have also begun to engage in a military buildup. Kakizawa further intends to suggest the following: 1) exchange of views on various issues, such as how to cooperate in disaster relief and UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO); 2) establishing a system to prevent arms proliferation, including nuclear weapons, within the region; 3) exchange of views of private-sector think tanks dealing with security issues. He also plans to discuss Japan's stance that the international community should unite in dealing with regional issues, such as the alleged nuclear arms development by the DPRK (North Korea).
