Under the Constitution, 178 places are provided for in the Federation Council - 171 people have been elected, 140 people have registered. So the Federation Council is competent to begin its work. Allow me, in accordance with the Constitution, to declare open the first sitting of the Federation Council, of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. [applause followed by Russian national anthem] Esteemed members of the Russian Federation! As of today, Russian statehood is acquiring new qualities. The bicameral parliament of the Russian Federation is beginning its work. At the same time, the chronological link which was broken for decades is restored. The State Duma has begun work at the same time as the Federation Council. And it is not a matter of the formal restoration of the name of a state institute of Russia. The meaning of what has happened is much deeper. Russia is returning to its roots, is restoring lost traditions. It cannot acquire its true character without that. It's not possible to go forward without that. It's not possible to take a worthy place in the contemporary world without that. The new Russian statehood is based upon a solid legal basis, the Constitution, which was adopted not by a group of people, not by a party but, for the first time in the history of Russia, by nationwide vote. We all still have a lot to do to ensure that the constitutional statutes become norms of our life, to learn to live in accordance with them. I recognize fully the particular responsibility that lies upon the president in that common work. As president of the Russian Federation, in carrying out my duties, I will observe and defend strictly the Constitution of the Russian Federation adopted on 12 December 1993 by nationwide vote, respect and guard the rights and freedoms of the people of Russia and serve faithfully their interests, defend the sovereignty and independence, security and territorial integrity of the state, fulfill conscientiously the duties placed upon me by the Constitution. I am counting on the deputies of the Federal Assembly also to adhere strictly to the Constitution of Russia in their actions. Those who are here in the Federation Council are those who won free and democratic elections in sharp and open competition. I congratulate you on this great political and personal success. You have been elected to the Federation Council, the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly. Russian citizens have put their trust in you, they have transferred on to you part of their power and at the same time placed on you great responsibility for our fatherland, for the people of Russia. I hope every one of you fully realizes this. You will now participate immediately in running a great power, in determining its destiny. Each of you will now have a much greater opportunity to be of use to Russia. I believe that you you will use this opportunity to the maximum for the good of our people. On this exciting day I should like to share with you what I believe to be especially important for present-day Russia. First of all, the parliament starts its proceedings in a country which is at peace. The electorate expects from deputies real efforts to consolidate civil peace. Last year a great effort was required to retain this peace. At the hardest moment most of those now in this hall backed the president and helped to avert chaos and civil confrontation in Russia. There is a great need now for members of the Federation Council and deputies of the State Duma leading the Russian parliament to the the road of creation. Cooperation must be the main thing in relations between the legislative and executive authorities. The Federal Assembly is starting its work in a single Russian Federation state. No matter for whom our voters voted, no matter what party or bloc they gave their vote to, they were unanimous that the Russian Federation should continue to be an integral state, a firm federation. It is our duty to fulfill this will. The Constitution clearly demarcates what things come under the jurisdiction of the federation and of its components. We must strictly adhere to that, and at the same time remember that strong regions are the condition of Russia's prosperity. Parliament is starting its working at a most crucial moment of the existence of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Each of the states is increasingly coming to understand that alone they cannot cope with most difficult problems, and that they cannot survive alone. Our countries are already being linked together, and in this process it is Russia's vocation to be the first among equals. Our compatriots, those in the former Soviet republics, first and foremost, rely on the fact that voluntary, free, and peaceful integration will grow from strength to strength. They hope that their lawful interests will be protected. And our duty is to live up to these expectations. The election of the Russian president to the post of CIS chairman provides an exclusively favorable opportunity to implement these aims. Our position remains unchanged. The richer, the more comprehensive, and the closer the relations between our states are, the better. You are starting work in an atmosphere of profound transformations in the country. We all know how difficult it was to move from endless and fruitless talk to practical deeds. It is imperative now not to stop half-way. Over the two years of reforms in Russia, the basis for a market economy has been laid. But this is just the beginning. In the course of the parliamentary campaign, many fresh and original ideas were voiced which can give fresh impetus to reforms. The parliamentarians have a realistic opportunity to implement these ideas, first and foremost in laws. It is laws which are the foundation of democratic power. In many respects, the Russian Federation's legislation has still not become the legislation of the market. Almost insuperable obstacles still remain both for businessmen and bankers and private farmers. If during the time of your work in this sphere you can bring about a breakthrough, you will not only justify the aspirations of the electorate, but will assume a worthy place in the history of Russia. We have many resourceful and energetic people who want and can get down to work. Today they are in need of our support. We must finally give them the opportunity of working and earning. These people are the very basis of our country's prosperity. It is their hands that are creating a stable and prosperous society in which no one will feel himself humiliated and alienated. At the same time, material prosperity alone will not make the country happy nor revive in citizens of Russia a sense of their own dignity. We must honestly admit that in the most difficult transformations in the Russian Federation, only a very little of the mighty potential of the multinational culture of the fatherland has so far been activated. This culture has been left on the sidelines of the reforms, and it is perhaps this that is the reason for many difficulties and failures. It is our common task to align the market and culture to the greatest possible degree. Unless we do so, the market will not become civilized; unless we do so, the market will not emerge from crisis, there will be no revival of spirituality, there will be no revival of Russia's greatness. I call upon you to bear this constantly in mind in your work. The Federal Assembly is starting its work in a period when the Russian Federation's democratic statehood is being established. Everyone knows with what pain and difficulty this process has been proceeding. The adoption of the Constitution offers a realistic opportunity for making this more calm and effective. It can be said that for the first time agreement has been reached in Russia on the rules and norms which are obligatory for all political forces. And we must at all costs preserve this accord, in order that there can be calm in the country, in order that dictatorship can never return to Russia. We can and must help public and political forces to find accord on the main issue, the categoric and total exclusion of force from the country's political life. There shall be no justification for those who organize mass disorders. No one must evade responsibility for calls for violent actions, for inciting national, social or religious dissension amongst people. There is one more issue I would particularly like to dwell on. Russia is a great power and it will never agree to be on the sidelines of world civilization. The time has ended when our country felt itself to be a besieged fortress and was in confrontation with the rest of the world. Our task today is to activate truly wide and equal cooperation with the world community. It is not by military might alone that a worthy place in the world is defined. Our country and people have a great resource of vital energy, and it is up to us to help our fatherland to gather its forces, to revive those powerful stimuli which would resurrect its greatness. International law is our fundamental guideline in the world. Russia will strictly abide by its norms and principles, convinced that this is the most efficient way of protecting national interests. However, one other aspect is of no lesser importance: all states must also strictly abide by norms of the international law in their relations with Russia. No double standards will be tolerated here. I hope that State Duma and Federation Council deputies will support both the president and the government in this respect. Esteemed members of the Federation Council! The majority of you are experienced politicians who have learned the secrets of power and are capable of distinguishing great politics from petty intriguing. I see you as one of the main stabilizing forces of Russian statehood. And both the president and parliamentarians could voice disagreement with one or other decisions taken by the other, could be dissatisfied with each other, could argue and stand their ground. But any political problems can and should be resolved only by legal procedures. We must remember always that we represent a great country, a great people, multinational Russia, and that means that as long as our powers are in force we are not free from that demand, even in our private life, and even more so on the state tribune. It is essentially, finally, to forget revolutionary vocabulary, to rid ourselves of the vestiges of unhealthy suspicion and political maximalism [maksimalizm]. Given the diverse party nature of parliament, there is a fundamental basis for joint constructive action - that is concern for the citizens of Russia, that is sticking to the strategic course for economic reform. We should consider the constitutional and democratic procedures for forming power and defining the political and economic policy of the country to be unshakable and inviolable. At the same time, the state is obliged to defend democracy by all legal means. In Russia, in Russian statehood there are quite a few old and not so old traditions. They are to be enriched substantially and new elements are to be introduced into them. This directly concerns the Federation Council. Constitutional norms define the overall structure of work of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. A lot of work lies ahead to specify these norms. I hope you will approach it looking not just one or two years ahead, but far into the future, into the 21st Century. I intend to be in constant contact with legislators, to hold consultations with the leaders of parliamentary factions on all the most important issues. The Constitution envisages an annual presidential address to the Federal Assembly. I will make one shortly, after procedural matters are solved in either chamber. In this address I will submit to you a program for political and economic changes in 1994, the main directions of domestic and foreign policy, and I will also outline plans for the next two years. The address will take stock, as carefully as possible, of all the constructive ideas contained in election manifestoes and programs, as well as of deputies' proposals on ways to organize our cooperation. Esteemed Russian members of parliament: you have been asked by the citizens of this country to lay the foundation for the building of Russian parliamentary culture. This is peaceful, creative, and also very difficult work. Special responsibility has been placed upon you: you are the start, and the future of Russia depends to a large extent on how successful this start is. Let me wish you success in our common cause of shaping our fatherland. Thank you.
