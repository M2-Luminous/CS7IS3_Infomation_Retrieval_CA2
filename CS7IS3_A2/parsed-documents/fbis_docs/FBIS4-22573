A member of the Russian delegation Aleksandr Piskunov delivered a paper "On Russia's Peacekeeping Activity on the Territory of the Former Soviet Union." The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Ukraine people's deputy and deputy chairman of the Ukraine Supreme Council Commission on Foreign Affairs Bohdan Horyn took part in the discussion and, upon his return to Kiev, provided for the UKRAYINSKA HAZETA an analysis of this complex issue. Russia's position on its right to conduct peacekeeping operations on the territory of independent states which emerged after the breakup of the Soviet Union is an international problem meriting an especially close attention of the international community. The idea that Russia should be given a UN mandate for peacekeeping missions in Moldova, Georgia, Tajikistan and other CIS states is not only actively discussed in the Russian press but is increasingly voiced by Russian Federation (RF) Foreign Minister A.Kozyrev as well as representatives of its new legislative corps. This is why peacekeeping activities that take place far beyond RF borders require broad and comprehensive discussion and analysis from the point of view of their compliance to international legal norms. First of all, the meaning that Russia attaches to terms "peacekeeping forces" and "peacekeeping activities" should be scrutinized, to see to what extent it confirms to the interpretation and experience developed in this area by the UN. It should be kept in mind that at the time of the Soviet empire, to which Russia considers itself a successor, a practice existed whereby a completely different meaning and substance were attached to commonly used words, concepts and terms, as a result of which, although widely known the world over, they acquired their own peculiar connotations and even became their exact opposites. As is well-known, the former Soviet Union did not need to import champagne from France but produced instead its own version of the famous beverage, under the absurd label of Soviet Champagne. The fact that for three centuries the Champagne region of France has been the place of origin of champagne, or that it is made from special types of grapes that grow only in that region, did not matter Soviet specialists in either semantics or wine making. Nor did the Soviet Union consider it necessary to hold to the meaning which the international community, based on many centuries of experience, attaches into the concept of democracy, as a result of which under the Soviet regime the term "Soviet democracy" came into being, meaning in practice the exact opposite of democracy, i.e., an anti-democratic, totalitarian regime. Today Russia, considering itself the successor of the Soviet empire, has borrowed much of that negative experience in its theory and practice. Its current domestic and foreign policy also gives cause for concern, especially if we were to decipher such peculiar terms as "Russian democracy" and "Russia's peacekeeping mission in CIS states." Let me briefly analyze some of the actions of Russian troops outside RF borders. Proof of Russia's peculiar interpretation of its peacekeeping role comes from events in Tajikistan, where Russian troops took part in a civil war, protecting a regime that was faithful to Russia. Recently, Russia has been calling the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan its own border. According to statements from influential politicians in Russia, the basis for this bold claim is the fact that Russian troops are protecting ethnic Russians in Tajikistan. Statistics show that due to the unstable situation in the region there are fewer and fewer ethnic Russians there, but this does not mean that Russia will stop calling the Tajik border its own. Most likely, another version will be invented: the need for protection against Muslim fundamentalism or something similar--to justify the occupational regime and Russian presence in that country. After the publication of many documents, it is no longer a secret that the puppet Dniestr Republic was created with the direct participation of Russian troops. The commander of the so-called peacekeeping 14th Army, Russian citizen General Lebed, despite being on the pay of Russia, ran for and won a seat in the Supreme Soviet of the Dniestr Republic. It is an unprecedented event in world experience. A similar mission by Russian troops in Georgia ended, according to Georgia's leader E.Shevardnadze, with the occupation of Abkhazia. "Georgia suffered a defeat in a war against an unequal foe, in a war which, according to a minister of one superpower, had been started to safeguard strategic interests of that country in Georgia," said Eduard Shevardnadze at a press conference for Georgian and foreign journalists, meaning strategic interests of Russia. The above-mentioned facts make us wary of Russia's peacekeeping missions. An analysis of the actions by Russian forces beyond RF borders makes it clear that Russian leaders attach a meaning to the concept of "Russia's peacekeeping mission in CIS states" that has nothing in common with the peacekeeping activity of troops under the aegis of the UN. It is very important that this reality of Russia's foreign policy attract the attention of the world opinion, especially now, when Russia is actively seeking a UN mandate to carry out peacekeeping operations in countries which emerged after the breakup of the USSR. Information appearing in newspapers that in July of this year the first-ever joint tactical training exercises by peacekeeping forces of the US and Russia will take place in Orenburg oblast give cause for alarm. The goal of providing security for independent states would be much better served if two or three independent groups of experts were formed under the aegis of the UN, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and NATO to study and report on the aims and consequences of Russia's so-called peacekeeping activity on the territory of independent states. The collected material and expert conclusions could become a weighty rebuttal to attempts by Russia to get for some of its military units the mandate of UN peacekeeping forces, which, as seen from daily experience, would be used for conducting dubious operations. We believe that putting an end to activities that contravene international norms can be done only with the help of an independent international fact finding mission, by discussing its conclusions in the UN Security Council. Russia's neighbors need mutually beneficial economic cooperation and not contingents of "peace-loving Russian troops." Those peace-loving troops should be based on their own, Russian territory. Other nations will decide for themselves whom to call and with whom to be friends on an equal footing. So far, in early March, Russia refused to supply gas to Ukraine. This is an example of its peace-loving policy.
