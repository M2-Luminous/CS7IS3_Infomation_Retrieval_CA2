FR940526-1-00002 FR940526-1-00001 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 208 [Regulation H; Docket No. R-0838] Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Board is proposing to amend Regulation H to implement section 6(b) of the Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992, which authorizes state member banks to make investments designed primarily to promote the public welfare to the extent permissible under state law and subject to regulation by the Board. The proposed amendment would permit state member banks to make certain public welfare investments without specific Board approval and other public welfare investments with specific approval. The proposed rule also addresses the procedural aspects of these investments. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before July 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments, which should refer to Docket No. R-0838, may be mailed to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th and C Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20551, Attention: Mr. William W. Wiles, Secretary; or may be delivered to Room B-2223 between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. All comments received at the above address will be made available to the public, and may be inspected at the Freedom of Information Office, Room B-1122 between 8:45 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Manley Williams, Attorney (202/736-5565), Legal Division; Sandra Braunstein, Program Manager for Community Affairs, (202/452-3378), Division of Consumer and Community Affairs; Larry Cunningham, Senior Financial Analyst (202/452-2701), Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 6(b) of the Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992 added paragraph 23 to section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 338a. Section 6(b) removes the restriction on the ability of state member banks to purchase, sell, underwrite, and hold investment securities provided that the investment is designed primarily to promote the public welfare and that the investment meets certain other criteria. Specifically, the investment must not violate state law or expose the bank to unlimited liability. The aggregate of the bank's public welfare investments must not exceed the sum of five percent of the bank's capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and five percent of its unimpaired surplus fund. The Board may waive this limit by order, on a case-by-case basis, however, and permit a bank to make investments in an amount not exceeding the sum of ten percent of the capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and ten percent of the unimpaired surplus fund of the bank. Finally, the Board must limit a bank's investments in any one project. In the past, requests by state member banks to make public welfare investments have been dealt with on a case-by-case basis. To reflect section 6(b)'s amendment of the Federal Reserve Act and to facilitate public welfare investments under that section, the Board is publishing for comment an amendment to Regulation H to be incorporated in a new section entitled Community Development and Public Welfare Investments. This amendment would permit, in many cases, public welfare investments without Board approval. Core Public Welfare Investments The proposed rule identifies classes of public welfare investments that do not require Board approval, leaving less common investments and investments of more than five percent of a bank's capital subject to case-by-case review. The proposed rule's classification seeks to distinguish public welfare investments from entrepreneurial investments--section 6(b) merely states that public welfare investments include investments designed primarily to promote the welfare of low- and moderate-income communities or families. Under the proposed rule, a state member bank may invest, without Board approval, only in a corporation, limited partnership, or other entity established solely to engage in the following activities: low- and moderate-income housing; nonresidential real-estate development in a low- or moderate-income area if that real-estate is used primarily by low- and moderate-income persons; job training or placement for low- and moderate-income persons; small business development in a low- or moderate-income area; technical assistance and credit counseling to benefit community development; and job creation in a low- or moderate-income area for low- and moderate-income persons. The Board is particularly interested in comments on whether the test for low- and moderate-income housing should be based on whether a majority of the units are occupied by low- and moderate-income persons or on other Federal programs such as the low income housing credit in section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In defining low- and moderate-income persons and low- or moderate-income area, the proposed rule uses definitions that will permit a state member bank to look to readily obtainable data. Specifically, the proposed rule uses the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Chapter 69 Community Development definition of low- and moderate-income persons. Similarly, low- or moderate-income area is defined as an area in which the median family income is less than eighty percent of the median family income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, or, for non-metropolitan areas, the state. Finally, the proposed rule uses the Small Business Administration's definition of small business. Substantive Requirements The proposed rule contains a number of substantive requirements based on section 6(b). Specifically, the investment must not violate state law or expose the bank to unlimited liability. In addition, without Board approval, a state member bank's aggregate public welfare investments must not exceed the sum of 5 percent of the bank's capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and 5 percent of the bank's unimpaired surplus fund. The Board has previously determined that undivided profits may be considered part of the capital stock and surplus of a state member bank (12 CFR 250.152). Accordingly, the proposed rule limits aggregate public welfare investments without Board approval to up to five percent of the capital stock and surplus of the state member bank. Section 6(b) also requires that the Board limit investments by a state member bank in any one public welfare investment. Investment of up to two percent of the bank's capital and surplus would not threaten the safety or soundness of a well-run adequately-capitalized bank. In addition, previous community development investments by state member banks have not approached this ceiling. Accordingly, the proposed rule limits a state member bank to investing not more than two percent of its capital and surplus in a single investment without Board approval. The proposed rule also establishes certain non-statutory substantive requirements for state member banks seeking to make public welfare investments without Board approval. Specifically, the bank must be at least adequately capitalized and rated a composite CAMEL ``1'' or ``2'', and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, cease and desist order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Board or a Federal Reserve Bank acting under delegated authority. These requirements help to ensure that the investment is consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank. Procedural Requirements The proposed rule sets forth four procedural requirements. First, to keep Federal Reserve Banks apprised of public welfare investments, within 30 days after making a public welfare investment, a state member bank must advise its Reserve Bank of the amount of the investment and the identity of the corporation, limited partnership, or other entity in which the investment is made. Second, a bank seeking to make an investment that falls outside of the investments specified in the proposed rule must receive Board approval. In no event may aggregate investments exceed ten percent of the bank's capital stock and surplus. Third, if a public welfare investment entered into under the proposed rule ceases to meet the statutory requirements or any requirements established by the Board in granting approval, the bank must divest itself of the investment to the extent that the investment ceases to meet those requirements. 1 Finally, if a preexisting public welfare investment meets the requirements for investments which do not need Board approval, or if the Board approved the investment, the bank need only notify its Reserve Bank of the investment within sixty days after the effective date of the final rule. For other preexisting public welfare investments, the bank should apply to the Board for approval of the investment within one year after the final rule's effective date. 1 This divestiture is governed by the same requirements as divestitures of interests acquired by a lending subsidiary of a bank holding company or a bank holding company itself in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted. Divestiture is not required if the investment ceases to meet the non-statutory requirements concerning capital, CAMEL ratings, and enforcement actions. Bank Holding Company Investments In the event that the Board adopts a final rule permitting state member banks to make the proposed public welfare investments discussed above, the Board will consider revising its interpretation of Regulation Y to permit the same class of investments to be made by bank holding companies. If revised accordingly, a bank holding company could apply to make those investments under the existing expedited notice procedures. To deal with proposed public welfare investments by state member banks during the pendency of the proposed rule, the Board has delegated to the Director of the Division of Bank Supervision and Regulation, in consultation with the General Counsel and the Director of the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, the authority to approve investments that meet the requirements of the proposed rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Board certifies that the proposed amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and that any impact on those entities should be positive. The proposed amendments will reduce the regulatory burden for many state member banks by permitting them to make certain investments that had previously required Board approval, and will have no effect in other cases.
