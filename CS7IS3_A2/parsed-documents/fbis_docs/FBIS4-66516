The verdict is the right of the appropriate court only. Personally, I say that local leaders are honest and, on the whole, make those decisions that serve citizens' interests and solve their problems. I appeal to my colleagues in the press not to rush in making accusations until all investigations are done and judges announce their verdict. When dealing with building violations, we encounter numerous and lengthy obstacles. In the latest governors' council meeting, we decided to control these obstacles...and eliminate those negative trends that put limitations on fighting obstacles. These obstacles are: First: As demolishing buildings is an administrative resolution, it could only be resolved in administrative courts. In the past, those committing building violations could file complaints in different kinds of courts in order to be acquitted. This process delayed the decision to execute demolition resolutions. As the phrase "security does not permit" was an obstacle that governors and district heads faced and which stopped the demolition of buildings for years, I made an agreement with the minister of interior to the effect that this phrase no longer be used with regard to building violations that have to be reviewed by security personnel before they execute their demolition. Major General Hasan al-Alfi, minister of interior, promised that, starting at the present time, this phrase would no longer be used as an obstacle. Moreover, building violations will be changed from violations to felonies that would be punishable by law. This means that culprits, besides paying fines, will receive prison sentences. [Abd-al-Ghani] Where were the local councils during the past years when buildings were being erected? How is it that those councils have now reappeared demanding--with raised voices--quick trials for district heads and district engineers? [Sharif] True, local councils are considered the primary instruments for the supervision of district heads' resolutions and any permits issued or actions executed by district offices which effect the people. Local councils should have spoken up, posed questions, and investigated building violations, because these councils hold monthly conferences with district heads and question them about every big issue as well as every detail related to all matters that concern the district. The councils should have completely performed their duty with regard to these issues. [Abd-al-Ghani] Does this mean that the Local Councils Law will be changed? [Sharif] Yes. We will consider seriously the idea that the members of local councils take part in both inspection patrols, together with district engineers, in order to detect building violations, and in reporting these violations. Therefore, local councils would be carrying full responsibility with regard to building violations, and subsequently, for the people's benefit, will play a role in fighting corruption and negligence. [Abd-al-Ghani] What are the bases for nominating local leaders? How could this nomination be regularly supervised and monitored? [Sharif] In order to nominate local leaders, we have started resorting to press ads, in which we allow all government officers who have reached either grade-level one, or the grade-level of general director, who wish to be promoted to the grade-level of under-secretary, to apply for posts of local leaders. I attend, in person, the interviews of applicants. Those who are selected are required to attend a course in local administration and then do some field research. The candidate is then given a trial period before he/she resumes the leadership post. Subsequently, all through the period when the candidate is in office, he/she is placed under our daily supervision and monitoring in order to assess his/her adaptability with regard to decisionmaking. [Abd-al-Ghani] Why are local leaders left in their posts for long periods? Because of their many acquaintances across the years, when they have to find solutions for peoples' problems or attend to peoples' interests, are they not subjected to embarrassment? [Sharif] A resolution has been issued that does not allow any local leaders, however successful they may have been and though they may have had many achievements, to remain in office more than five years. This is so that this local leadership would not feel embarrassed when dealing with problems and interests of those acquaintances whom it might have known for a long time. Another reason for this resolution is to renew the leadership, in action and in thought, at the local district level. [Abd-al-Ghani] Some hypocrites address the governor as: "Mr. Minister Governor." Similarly, some media personnel in the governorate write big sign-posts that are placed on the Governor's desk having as a title: "The Minister Governor." Which of these is right and which is wrong?! [Sharif] A governor should not be addressed as "Mr. Minister Governor." The financial status of a governor is the same as that of a minister. However, this fact does not mean that a governor should be addressed by the title "minister." Therefore, governors should not allow anyone to address them by this title, because this kind of address reflects flattery and hypocrisy. Personally, I do not allow that. All the ministry's correspondence with governors does not include this title. Governors should observe this regulation and put it into effect immediately. [Abd-al-Ghani] How powerful is a governor's endorsement? I pose this question because citizens believe that this endorsement is the right path to heaven! [Sharif] A governor's endorsement is one that gives the okay for execution; it is completely valid. However, a governor endorses only those documents that he is empowered to endorse. For example, according to local government regulations, a governor has the right to allot a percentage of public housing at his discretion. However, a governor would first endorse the allotment of houses for the rest of the cases before he endorses allotments for any special cases. No to the Oral! [Abd-al-Ghani] What about an oral endorsement that a governor gives to his subordinates either over the telephone or by meeting with them? [Sharif] On the one hand, an oral endorsement is sound and needs quick action if it is given for the general benefit, such as when the governor gives oral instructions or gives those instructions over the telephone in order to repair a damaged road or a burst water pipe. On the other hand, the endorsement is unsound if it is given by an employee, and the governor does not carry responsibility for it; this latter case would be unsound according to the work plan and its legal and sound venues. In addition, in case the endorsement carries any responsibility, the governor must endorse it instantly. [Abd-al-Ghani] Because some previous district heads made some mistakes, a big number of current district heads have started to refer documents that need endorsement to the legal department for getting their view in fear of making the same mistakes made by their predessecors. What do you think is the solution? [Sharif] I do not deny this truth. However, the local leadership should have confidence in its resolutions--and in its honesty. This state of affairs has delayed the issuing of building permits; currently, this delay has been overcome. Self-confidence and confidence in one's country provide district heads with complete validity to make the right decisions. [Abd-al-Ghani] Has the cleaning organization for Cairo and al-Gizah achieved its goals? [Sharif] Yes. Since the state provided equipment worth 3 billion pounds, the cleaning organization for Cairo and al-Gizah has achieved its goal. Private cleaning (the private sector) has a good future in this activity. Resolutions will be issued to encourage such companies. Shortly, the door will be opened for private sector companies to contribute to other aspects of public services such as garbadge collection, its sorting, and classification. [Abd-al-Ghani] In case a citizen fails to get what he/she is entitled to get from either the district head or the engineers, what does the citizen do and to whom does he/she have recourse? [Sharif] Currently, I do not believe that this situation will occur because, the law is clear and provides every citizen with his/her entitlement. However, should this situation occur, the Governor's office is opened; governors hold weekly conferences with citizens. No citizen will find any difficulty in solving his/her problems.
