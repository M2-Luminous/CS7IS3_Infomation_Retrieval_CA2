Government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment is one of the areas covered under bilateral talks on a new trade framework which the two countries hope to reach agreement by February 11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington. The deal came after four days of bilateral negotiations held since Tuesday at the Foreign Ministry, the source said. As part of the deal, Tokyo offered to introduce an open bidding system for purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment valued at more than 100,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or some 19 million yen, the source said. Japan also promised to introduce a "comprehensive" evaluation system to decide on which equipment to purchase on the basis of not only price but also other factors to make it easier for U.S. suppliers to win contracts, the source said. Japanese and U.S. trade negotiators have long been at odds over the minimum value of contracts to be opened to general bidding, as Washington demanded 5,000 SDRs against the 130,000 SDRs sought by Japan. The source indicated that the comprehensive evaluation system would apply only to medical equipment, as U.S. medical devices are usually priced higher than those made in Japan. The talks over government procurement are part of the so-called framework talks under which the two sides hope to agree on ways to slash Japan's massive trade surplus with the United States.
