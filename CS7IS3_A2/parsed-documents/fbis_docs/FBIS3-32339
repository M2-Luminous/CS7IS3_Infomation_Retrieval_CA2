Yesterday, Saturday, the armed group requested that in light of an imminent dialogue between Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, and the EZLN, the NGO'S could lay out a security cordon which would prevent both sides from interfering in the physical space of the dialogue table. Gerardo Gonzalez, spokesman for the Coordinating Board of Nongovernment Human Rights Organizations (CONPAZ) in this city, indicated this group's interest in also becoming a permanent observer of the Chiapas peace process. He added that the security cordon would be implemented either on foot or by using vehicles operated by CONPAZ members, the Red Cross, the Health Secretariat, and nongovernment human rights organizations which will cover the area where the talks will take place. The CONPAZ representative indicated that the objective is to observe all movements of troops and aircraft, as well as national and international correspondents sent to cover the dialogue. He added that this will serve to prevent any irregularities which may affect the first rapprochement to ensure peace and reestablish legal order in the region. "(Today) we expect to deliver the EZLN acceptance letter to [Monsignor] Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de Las Casas dioceses and national mediation commissioner, as well as to Camacho Solis." He mentioned that the letter was sent to all representatives of the 130 nongovernment organizations in the country inviting their representatives to participate in implementing the security cordon in order to ensure the dialogue. Gonzalez believes the communities of San Miguel, the municipality of Ocosingo, and the city of Comitan are ideal sites for the talks aimed at setting the foundations of a true reconciliation between Chiapas inhabitants and state and federal authorities. The spokesman for CONPAZ, an organization which consists of approximately 11 local groups, was interviewed at the conclusion of a citizen's march for peace and reconciliation that ended with a meeting in this community's central plaza. As of the start of the negotiation process between the peace commissioner and the EZLN, under the mediation of Bishop Ruiz, both sides have agreed to initiate a dialogue based on a prearranged agenda. The dialogue is aimed at solving the Chiapas Indian community problem. Beginning on 1 January the EZLN staged an uprising in four communities of the State of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico, and presented demands for Indian grievances. It is expected that this Sunday Camacho Solis will announce the date and place where the first direct talks will take place.
