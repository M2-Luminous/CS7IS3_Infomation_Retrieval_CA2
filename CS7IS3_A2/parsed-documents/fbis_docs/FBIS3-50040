These 150 families owe blood under the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. They expect nothing from the laws of this state. The state does not protect them. This state throws them on welfare and leaves them under siege, including their children and associates. This state is paralyzed, humbled by the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. Meanwhile, the family of Gjovalin Cekini has a blood score to settle with the government. They expect the judiciary to respond to the crime before they heed the call to arms of their ancestors, the weapons of the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. The government, after all, has the chance to triumph over Lek showing that it is no longer the government of 2 April [1991] that murdered by night and shed tears by day. It has an opportunity to avert one more murder. It has the opportnity to remove the checkpoint on Bahcellek bridge, over which criminals enter and leave Shkoder. It has the opportunity to rescue Shkoder from isolation from the rest of Albania, as if we were in the time of the principality of Kara Mahmut Bushatlliu. Shkoder is becoming isolated. Caught up in the spider's web of the embargo, the city is writhing in agony and devouring its own citizens. It was corruption and the representatives of corruption in Shkoder, tension, and the absence of a political breathing space that murdered Gjovaiin Cekini. It was the logic of Kara Mdhmut Buchatlliu in the mouths of oil smugglers and the smugglers of infants, that called Shkoder the citadel of the Democrats. Once it was the citadel of the Communists, and before that it was a principality, before Albania existed, although it was Albanian before the principality existed. The language of the party faithful is sending Shkoder back in time, toward experiences of this kind, inexorably shifting the barrier of the embargo from Han i Hotit to Bahcellek bridge [from the Albanian-Montenegrin border to the southern entrance to the City of Shkoder], separating the city from Albania. This kind of talk calls for aid from the phantom of Lek Dukagjio. Quo vadis Scutari? Shkoder, where are you going?
