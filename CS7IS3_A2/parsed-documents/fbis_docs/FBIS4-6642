If Hata, who heads Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], powerhouse of the seven-party ruling coalition, succeeds departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, his term is expected to be short given the current unstable political situation, according to political sources. "We hope Hata will be nominated for the premiership because that would be a great help toward the Olympics," said an official who requested anonymity. "But we are afraid he would not be able to keep his position until the year of the games," he said. The 58-year-old Hata hails from Ueda in the central Japan prefecture.
