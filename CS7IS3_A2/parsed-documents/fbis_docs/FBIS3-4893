On Sunday the Taiwanese Council of Labour Affairs chairman accused Bangkok of being insincere on solving the problem of Thai workers in Taiwan and warned that his country would halt the labour import from Thailand. Prasong said the Foreign Ministry was ready to help deal with the council's complaints but insisted that the Thai Public and Social Welfare Ministry was the responsible agency. "I don't know why it [the issue] has been brought up just now. The problem has long existed. Why are they talking about it now?'' he said. Chao Shou-po, chairman of the Council of Labour Affairs, warned Thailand that Taipei might have to suspend the import of Thai workers unless Bangkok tackles problems such as exorbitant commissions charged by Thai job placement agencies. Chao blamed the Thai government for "lacking application" in curbing such unfair practices. His attack was released just over a week after a three day-to Thailand trip by Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. Prasong said if Thai workers illegally entered Taiwan they have broken the law and should be penalized accordingly. "We cannot blame a country which takes legal action against those who illegally enter its territory," Prasong said. Job Replacement Department Director Sinchai Riantrakul, meanwhile, said that Thailand had done its best to solve the problem. He said the department had issued warnings in early February to at least 47 employment agencies to strictly comply wlth Thai law. He added that the department would take legal action against any company known to have collected exorbitant fees from Thai workers. "Yesterday was the deadline for job recruitment agencies to abide by the laws," he said. Thai workers have to pay Bt80,000 to a job replacement agency before they are able to work in Taiwan. Sinchai denied a report that there were 2,500 Thai workers illegally working in Taiwan, adding that he thought the flow of illegal workers to the island state was decreasing. He also said he did not how many job placement firms had contravened the law. Commenting on exorbitant fees, he said Taiwanese employment agencies were also to blame over the practice and Taiwan should help tackle the problem. "They [Taiwanese brokers] demand Bt20,000-Bt30,000 for each worker," he said.
