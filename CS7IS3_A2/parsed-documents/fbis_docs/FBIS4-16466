In 1993, this sum constituted R57,000. This was the conclusion made 14 April by the Russian Federation Government's Food Commission. In the current year the government will procure 10.7 million tonnes of grain into the federal food fund designed to supply military and same-status categories of citizens, as well as for other purposes, which is 1.1 million tonnes less than in 1993. The government will allocate R1.6 trillion in budget loans to raise federal grain funds and, in addition, 5.5 trillion to 6 trillion will be channeled for these purposes from the state fund to ship foodstuffs to Upper North areas.
