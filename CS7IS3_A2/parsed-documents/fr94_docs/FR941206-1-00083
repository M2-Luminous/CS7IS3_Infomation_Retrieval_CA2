FR941206-1-00083 FR941206-1-00007 In evaluating options that the industry could use to comply with the proposed standards, the Committee tried to ensure that the compliance options would impose a minimum burden on small businesses. For example, the proposed standards do not require the use of control devices that require a significant capital investment and impose an unfair burden on small businesses that typically have trouble raising capital. Small businesses can meet the emission limits for finishing materials and adhesives through the use of compliant materials. The Committee tried to ensure that the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the proposed standards were not beyond the resources of small businesses. The Committee also evaluated whether the proposed work practice standards presented any particular problems to small businesses. Some members felt that developing an operator training program might pose some problems to small businesses. Rather than exempt small businesses from what the Committee feels is a key work practice, the Committee decided to recommend that small businesses work together to develop a training program. The Committee also suggested that large businesses that already have training programs in place could share the key components of those programs with small businesses. Finally, the Committee recommended that State small businesses assistance programs assist small businesses in developing their training program. The Small Business Work Group made several recommendations to the Committee, including a recommendation that the EPA draft a document that would provide guidance to small businesses on how to obtain a Federally-enforceable limit on their potential to emit and recordkeeping requirements that might be associated with the limit. In addition, small business representatives proposed that the EPA draft a memorandum responding to questions developed by the Small Business Work Group pertaining to area sources that become major sources. The Small Business Work Group also recommended that the EPA discuss in the preamble the benefits of general permits for small businesses and encourage their use where appropriate. The Agency agreed and a discussion of general permits is included in section VI.L. The Small Business Work Group also recommended that the EPA, in conjunction with the State of North Carolina Small Business Ombudsman Office, develop an information outreach program to serve as a resource for small wood furniture manufacturers. The Agency has agreed to work with the North Carolina Small Business Ombudsman Office to develop this program. J. Selection of Definition of Source The choice of an affected source influences possible reconstruction and modification impacts of the proposed standards. It also determines the point at which the addition or replacement of individual emission sources (i.e., a spray booth, or a finishing line) results in a new source. Section 112(a)(3) of the Act defines ``stationary source'' as having the same meaning as that given in section 111(a) of the Act, where ``stationary source'' is defined as ``any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant.'' Most industrial plants consist of numerous pieces or groups of equipment that emit HAP and that may be viewed as ``sources.'' The EPA, therefore, uses the term ``affected source'' to designate the equipment within a particular facility that is chosen as the source covered by a given rule. The definition of source may be broad and include all emission points within a facility, or may be narrow and include only an individual piece of equipment. 1. Reconstruction Considerations Reconstruction is defined by ยง63.5 as the replacement of the components of a stationary source to such an extent that: (1) the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable new source, and (2) it is technologically and economically feasible for the reconstructed source to meet the promulgated emission standards established by the Administrator pursuant to section 112 of the Act. Upon reconstruction, a stationary source is subject to relevant standards for new sources, including compliance dates, irrespective of any change in emissions of HAP from that source. Major affected sources constructed or reconstructed after the effective date of a rule promulgated under this part are also subject to the preconstruction and review requirements in ยง63.5 (d) and (e).
