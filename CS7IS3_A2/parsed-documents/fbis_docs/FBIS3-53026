An objective analysis of the significance of this exceptional attention will show that the reason for this is that the Syrian-U.S. summit is an important, historic event on whose results depends the future of the entire Middle East. AL-THAWRAH adds: The summit, as it is planned for, is a meeting for peace in the Middle East. Its major topic is how to end the deadlock in the peace process that resulted from Israel's intransigent policy. AL-THAWRAH goes on: Certainly, President Clinton, who has already emphasized his eagerness to meet President al-Asad, will ascertain Syria's true desire to achieve peace in the region, its serious stance toward the peace process, and its unchanging concern to provide all the means possible to make this process succeed and achieve its major objective -- a comprehensive solution based on a just, full peace. AL-THAWRAH concludes: The purpose of the al-Asad-Clinton summit is to rectify the course of the peace process and give it a new momentum to ensure that it will make progress. Under the headline "The Geneva Summit," TISHRIN says: Rarely have we seen political meetings that received a broad political and media attention that equals the attention focused now on the expected summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. Since the announcement of the meeting, politicians and newsmen have been expressing their views and the world media organs -- in their various political shades and professional levels -- have been full of articles and commentaries about this major event. TISHRIN says this attention has not come out of a vacuum. It is truly a natural outcome of the weight of the two presidents and reflects, at the same time, the hopes pinned by international quarters regarding the possibility of advancing the peace process in this region, which occupies the heart of the world and represents a mainstay of the life cycle in it. TISHRIN adds: The international community, which is seeking peace and stability in the Middle East, has found out after many long experiences that this goal is impossible to achieve away from Syria and its views. No settlement can survive unless it is just and comprehensive, ends the causes of injustice and aggression, and restores rights to their legitimate owners. President Hafiz al-Asad is the person who proposed this theory and who has borne the burden of convincing the world of it. He has succeeded, and thus provided the objective means for the Madrid conference and opened the door for the possibility of achieving real peace in the region. TISHRIN also highlights the media capabilities mobilized by Zionism to disturb the atmosphere of the upcoming summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. The paper points out that Zionism spared Syria no false accusations and also practiced all kinds of blackmail and intimidation against the U.S. Administration. TISHRIN concludes: We hope that the summit will succeed and achieve its objectives and fulfill the great hopes pinned on it by reviving the march of a comprehensive settlement and achieving a just and lasting peace in the region that would end occupation and restore usurped Arab rights. Syria has made, and will continue to make, positive contributions toward this end. Commenting on the importance of supporting Syria's stands, AL-BA'TH says: The Damascus Declaration foreign ministers were very clear when they asserted that a unified Arab position is what enables the nation to restore all of its rights in accordance with UN resolutions. The paper notes that the meetings of the Damascus Declaration foreign ministers over the past two days have paid special attention to the importance of the upcoming summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton under the current circumstances. The paper says that the Damascus Declaration foreign ministers did not forget to stress Syria's important, vital role in ensuring the success of the peace process. They affirmed their countries' support for President Hafiz al-Asad, who is maneuvering the ship while demonstrating rare courage and wisdom. AL-BA'TH concludes: It is very important for Syria to go to the Geneva summit while standing on firm ground and having the support of all its Arab brothers in order to achieve a just, comprehensive peace that restores Arab rights in full, keeps harm out of their way, and thus provides them with strength and impregnability.
