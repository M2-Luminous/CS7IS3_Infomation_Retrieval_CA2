The Slovak Constitution stipulates that the president can be dismissed if he fails to observe his constitutional duties. In February the HZDS organized a petition campaign in support of a referendum through which they wanted to resolve the political crisis. The citizens had to decide on three issues: calling early elections, exclusion of the "renegade deputies" from parliament (Meciar's cabinet fell because some of the HZDS deputies had left the party which lost the majority in parliament), and explanation of the origin of money used in privatization. However, in March Kovac refused to call the referendum because the 350,000 signatures, required by the Constitution, had not been collected, as the Presidential Office had found. In the meantime, the parliament has dismissed Meciar's cabinet and set the early elections for this autumn. The HZDS has checked again the collected signatures and found out that out of 422,054, 372,054 were valid so that Kovac ought to have called the referendum, Cabaj said. Katarina Tothova, the justice minister in Meciar's cabinet, pointed to a contradiction in the statement by the Presidential Office which had said in March that only 232,957 were authentic, while at present it acknowledged validity of almost 325,000 signatures. She noted that law which had been in force in February, did not stipulate that exact address and identification number were necessary, as required now by the amended law on referendum which had been passed last week. Tothova also denied an allegation by Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), that the HZDS was preparing another referendum which would shorten Kovac's five-year term. Kovac was elected last year. "I do not know anything about another petition committee," she added.
