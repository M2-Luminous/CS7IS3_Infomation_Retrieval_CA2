At a news conference at the Swiss Embassy in Moscow, he highlighted the "particular openness" of his talks with Russian officials. The main purpose of this first official visit to Russia was the signing of a trade and economic cooperation agreement on Thursday [12 May] by the head of the Federal Department of Public Economy [DFEP] and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Mr. Delamuraz stressed that his visit has contributed to reinforcing the trust between potential investors and between the two countries. The DFEP head also insisted on the "human" value of the trade and economic cooperation agreement that was signed last Thursday. This accord is intended to replace three bilateral agreements that were concluded with the former Soviet Union, as well as the 1979 program for economic, industrial, scientific, and technical cooperation. Arduous Privatization On Friday morning, the federal counselor met with Mr. Anatoliy Chubays, Russian deputy prime minister in charge of privatizations. They discussed the issue of privatization. "This is a sensitive topic. Calling for privatization is not enough. Russia is a state which is experiencing rapid change, where the structure of law, the consistency and prevalence of specific rules are hardly established," Mr. Delamuraz said. The Russian Government assured the federal counselor that access to foreign assets would not be limited and that there would not be any discrimination. "Many fields of activity are open, except that of rail transport," Mr. Delamuraz added. As far as Russia's debts to 83 Swiss companies, amounting to 320 million Swiss francs [SFr], are concerned, the DFEP head said that the Russian prime minister had confirmed that a solution would be found by summer. Exports on the Rise The visit by Mr. Delamuraz comes at a time when Swiss exports to Russia have increased considerably. Totaling SFr327 million last year, exports mainly comprise machines, chemicals, food, and watches. Imports (SFr376 million in 1993) chiefly are fuels and metals.
