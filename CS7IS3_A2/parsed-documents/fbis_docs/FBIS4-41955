This was stated today by Qian Qichen, PRC vice premier and foreign minister, who is in Moscow on an official visit, speaking at Moscow State University. The head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the results of Boris Yeltsin's visit to China in December 1992 "initiated a new era in Sino-Russian relations." The minister noted that he was "very pleased" with today's meeting with the Russian president. "China's consistent policy regarding development of relations with Russia," he said, "is based on the fact that it fully respects the choice of the Russian people and always aims at developing long-term and stable relations of neighborliness, friendship, and mutual cooperation on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, regardless of how the domestic situation in Russia might change." The minister said he was absolutely certain that China and Russia "must and will definitely be friends for a long time to come." The minister said that the views of Moscow and Beijing "either coincide or are similar" on many very important international problems. He stressed that China "is not taking part in the arms race or any military alliances. And it neither does nor will lay claim to hegemony anywhere or ever -- either now or subsequently, when it becomes a powerful country." [sentence as received] The head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed a rather skeptical view regarding the possibility of a direct transfer of the experience of Chinese reforms to Russian soil. "China's experience is applicable only to the specific conditions of our country. Russia's reality is different from that of the PRC," he said. At the same time, the minister expressed readiness to develop contacts in the sphere of the implementation of reforms, having noted that it is useful for both countries to exchange and to borrow experience from one another. He said he was certain that "Russia will undoubtedly find a path of development suitable to its own reality. It will definitely overcome the current temporary difficulties and will be able to restore its economy." Qian Qichen admitted that in the conditions of rapid development of Russian-Chinese contacts "some problems have arisen." The most important is "incidents where a few criminals cross the border and engage in criminal activities, or where unscrupulous traders sell fake and inferior goods for a quick profit." The minister stressed that Chinese Government is prepared "to cooperate with Russia in taking legal measures against Chinese citizens who violate Russian laws." According to Qian Qichen, the Chinese people "are thinking about and are doing only one thing: developing the country's economy is their major aim." He stressed the need for the gradual implementation of reform while maintaining social and political stability and avoiding social unrest. The minister dismissed claims that China "is only implementing economic but not political reforms" as "misunderstanding." According to Qian Qichen, claims that China has become the world's third economic superpower also "do not correspond to reality." "We believe that China continues to be among the less well-off developing countries and it will take efforts of several generations to make it a medium-developed country." The minister recalled that the Chinese reforms have been carried for "only 15 years." "It will take another 20 to 30 years to create a complex of more mature and complete systems," he said.
