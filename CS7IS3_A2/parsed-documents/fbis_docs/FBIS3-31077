What are the repercussions in case the Serbs withdraw their heavy weapons 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo, and what are they if they do not? What, after all, are the "heavy" weapons of the Serbian army and what are criteria for determining that? Could the withdrawal of these arms seriously weaken the military position of the Serbs in comparison with that of the Muslims? What will happen if the Serbs in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina reject NATO's ultimatum? Still in Range The Serbian side around Sarajevo has artillery pieces of 76-, 105-, 122-, 130-, and 155-mm caliber, and the 128-mm Plamen and Oganj multiple rocket launchers. They also have mortars of 60-, 81-, 82-, and 120-mm, as well as T-55 and T-54 tanks, and T-54 tanks with 100-mm guns. Are these the heavy arms that NATO demands to be withdrawn? If the guns of 76- and 105-mm are withdrawn 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo, the 130-mm guns with the range of 28 kilometers would still be in range. So would the 155-mm howitzers, which would reach Sarajevo suburbs, and 122-mm howitzers and the 128-mm Oganj multiple rocket launchers, whose range is 21.8 kilometers. Of course, the Serbs also have the 262-mm Orkan multiple rocket launchers, whose range is over 50 kilometers. So, the limit of 20 kilometers set by NATO does not solve anything. True, it could remove the bulk of the Serbian artillery from the separation line with the Muslim side in and around Sarajevo, but cannot absolutely prevent attacks on the town itself, or its suburbs, in case the fighting continues. What To Do With Factories Moreover, mortars of 60-, 81-, 82-, and 120-mm are small and can easily be hidden, which renders the control of withdrawal virtually impossible. The Serbian side also has the light, partisan-type, single barrel version of the Oganj and Plamen missile launchers. These are also very easy to camouflage and hide and can be used for attacks if the need for this arises. There is also the question as to what to do with the 30-mm self-propelled antiaircraft artillery pieces ("praga"), or those of 57-mm (self propelled antiaircraft guns of Russian production)? Are these also heavy weapons? Will NATO also set an ultimatum to the Muslim side to move artillery 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo? And where and in what direction? The Muslims in Sarajevo have several guns of 105-, 122-, 130-mm, and several self-propelled artillery pieces and tanks. Some of these had been left behind in the former school center of the former Yugoslav People's Army for training and the Muslim side modified them for use. Others came through the violation of the arms embargo. Members of Muslim units in Sarajevo have a fairly large number of mortars of 60, 81, 82, and 120 mm. They also have various recoilless guns of Pakistani, Turkish, Iranian, and Western production. All these are of relatively small and can be hidden, especially in the town. How will UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] control the withdrawal of these weapons to a distance of 20 kilometers away from the town? Can UNPROFOR representatives register accurately who violates cease-fires with artillery just by placing themselves on the line separating the warring sides? Hardly! The withdrawal of the Serbian heavy arms to 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo could be a direct provocative factor and challenge for the Muslim side to launch an offensive of larger proportions, especially because Washington holds the view that the "Muslims should be given a chance to regain militarily what they have lost in the war." In other words, NATO and the West are trying, to put it graphically, to tie the hands and legs of the Serbian side in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and then throw it in the ring. The withdrawal of the Serbian heavy weapons 20 kilometers away from Sarajevo could endanger the vital sections of the Serbian military industry: the Pretis factory in Vogosca, the factory for aircraft engines in Rajlovac, the Famos factory, the Koran factory for tank engines in Pale, and some other plants for production of weapons and equipment. All these are relatively close to Sarajevo. The reaction of the Serbs living in Sarajevo, people who have stayed in their homes, is a special problem. Will they start moving out?
