The leader of the Ukrainian delegation at the talks, Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov granted an exclusive interview to a UNIAN correspondent. As Shmarov emphasized, the date of the trilateral talks was not agreed in advance. A decision on the meeting of the delegations of the United States, Russia, and Ukraine was taken promptly. The visit to Moscow by U.S. Vice President Albert Gore probably gave an impetus to holding the meeting. During Albert Gore's meeting with the Russian leadership, the issue of nuclear armaments was touched upon. However, as Valeriy Shmarov pointed out, Ukraine was precisely insisting on holding trilateral talks, being convinced that this would be the most effective form of achieving agreement on START I ratification and implementation. Therefore, the fact that such consultations did take place and that they will be continued in the future can be regarded as the first success. The resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on the ratification of START I, with the reservations formulated by the Ukrainian parliament, was the first and foremost issue discussed at the consultations. Ukraine's representatives had an opportunity to clearly comment on these reservations. These, as a matter of fact, represent that working plan according to which the parliament and the government of Ukraine have to work so as to achieve "pure" ratification of the treaty. The members of the Ukrainian delegation emphasized three main issues concerning which Ukraine hopes to find understanding with the partners: Obtaining political guarantees from nuclear states; gaining compensation for nuclear weapons transferred from Ukraine, tactical weapons in particular; and receiving technical and financial assistance in the implementation of the disarmament project. Most understanding was reached on the issue of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons. For the first time ever a proposal was formulated: To solve the issue through Russia writing off Ukraine's debts for energy. However, this decision was not approved because, in the opinion of the participants in the talks, it is necessary to discuss these issues in greater detail with experts. As far as strategic weapons are concerned, the energy uranium required by Ukraine's nuclear power stations was offered as compensation. In case this issue is solved in a positive manner Ukraine's needs for this raw material would be satisfied for 5 years. Such a mechanism is acceptable in principle and technical coordination has been planned. The issues of compensations for the tactical and strategic nuclear weapons were discussed as one package. Today it is still early to mention any specific sum because no final calculations have been made and they have not been coordinated with experts. Ukraine's representatives believe that these could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars because, according to average world prices, for example, the price of one kilogram of highly enriched uranium is $15,000. According to Valeriy Shmarov, the U.S. and Russian sides are concerned most of all about the issue of Ukraine's pace in fulfilling the provisions of START I, in particular, deactivation of the latest SS-24 missiles. Ukraine takes a clear stand: One can immediately talk about the types [as received] after the reservations formulated by the Supreme Council are fulfilled. Already today Ukraine is making specific steps toward nuclear arms reduction: The deactivation of SS-24 missiles is under way -- 17 such missiles have been withdrawn from combat duty and put under control, and by the end of the year their number will reach 20. As a matter of fact, two regiments will be disarmed. This is evidence of Ukraine's course toward a non-nuclear status. It is ready to further continue this work but it hopes for adequate moves on the part of the partners, the United States and Russia. In particular, Valeriy Shmarov remarked that the pace of elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine depends very much on financial assistance. At present it is insufficient. The aid is mainly rendered in the form of consultations, and delivery of computer or space communications systems. The following problems, however, remain unsolved: What is to be used to transport the dismantled warheads, where is the fuel to be taken, and where is the money to come from? The Ukrainian side does not shrink from the opinion that $2.5 billion should be spent on complete nuclear disarmament, including the social protection of servicemen, restoration of order on the territories, etc. Today, due to the economic crisis, it is difficult for Ukraine to shoulder such a burden and at the same time to abide by the fixed terms. However, the members of the Ukrainian delegation emphasized that despite the economic difficulties the START I treaty will be unconditionally fulfilled. If Ukraine raises the issue of financial aid, then it only has in mind speeding up the pace of nuclear weapons elimination. Ukraine will further carry out voluntary disarmament under conditions of universal support. According to the deputy prime minister, the current consultations failed to formulate the issue on political guarantees in a clear-cut manner. However, he expressed satisfaction with the relatively high level of representation of the delegations which took part in the negotiations and also the high level of competence of the experts who arrived with the U.S. and Russian delegations. As Valeriy Shmarov indicated, he hopes that by such a composition it will be possible to draft a document that can be submitted to the top leaders of the states for signing. The participants in the meeting agreed to continue their work in one month's time. However, the Ukrainian representatives are today already preparing information based on the materials of the consultations for Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk, because at the meeting of the CIS heads of state in Ashgabat the Ukrainian side intends to raise materials from the trilateral talks for a dialogue between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, although the discussion of this issue was not planned in advance.
