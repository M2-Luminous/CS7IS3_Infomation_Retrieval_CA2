Introduction Optical fiber cables carry extremely high volumes of information with little attenuation. They have such advantages as being free of electromagnetic interference, thin in diameter, light, and energy efficient. Therefore, they are viewed as one of the greatest inventions of the twentieth century as a transmission medium to support the information-oriented society. Although optical fiber cables were unimagined just twenty-five years ago, their stunning development and progress have begun to virtually replace the old copper wire communication cables technology which has sustained a one hundred year history. Serious development of optical fibers began in 1970. The initial stage was experimental research, then there was a series of failures under actual environmental conditions. Characteristic failures included: 1. Increased attenuation due to hydrogen. 2. Fiber breakage. 3. Eccentric cores. 4. Separation of glass and resin due to water penetration Increased attenuation. 5. Increased attenuation due to bubbles in coating layers. 6. Difficulty in splicing because of lowered adhesion between glass and coating layers. 7. Difficulty in splicing because of increased jacket stripping force. Many research projects for improvement were launched on the basis of these failures. Today, both functionality and quality have reached near perfection. This paper introduces: 1. The present state of functionality and quality; 2. The trends of productivity and cost efficiency; 3. Fulfilling the needs of the market. I hope this paper will be a contributive reference for the application and expansion of optical fiber cables. 2. Research and Development (1) Improved Functionality One of the major characteristics of optical fibers is their large information-carrying capacity. Most of the current transmission systems employing optical fibers use a method of sending light pulses as a signal. The information carrying capacity is determined by the duration of the interval between the light pulses. When pulses are sent over long distances, they expand and overlap adjacent pulses, and become undistinguishable upon reception. This expansion of pulses is called dispersion. There are the following types of dispersion: 1. Modal dispersion; 2. Waveguide dispersion; 3. Material dispersion. As Figure 1 shows, in the case of light injected into fibers with comparatively large diameters, there is a wide variety of light ray components, from the component that is propagated along the interface of the core and the cladding while being totally reflected repeatedly, to the component that is propagated along the center of the core and experiences practically no total reflection. These components exist discretely, and each one is called a mode. The delay time is different for each mode. This is the cause of the spreading of pulses in the case of multi-mode fibers, in which one pulse consists of many modes. By utilizing the refractive index dependence of light velocity, the graded index (GI) fiber was developed. In this fiber, the mode dispersion is cancelled by making the refractive index in the center of the core high and the refractive index on the periphery low. However, as it is impossible to completely eliminate pulse spreading due to modal dispersion, there is a tendency to deviate from use of this fiber. When the core diameter is made sufficiently small, a condition is formed where these modes are unable to exist except for one. In the single mode fiber, which was designed with this condition, there is in principle no pulse spreading due to modal dispersion, and so transmission at an extremely high bit rate became possible. At present, virtually all communications fibers are of this type. Even this single mode fiber has limitations on its information-carrying capacity. The reason for this is pulse spreading due to material dispersion and waveguide dispersion. The cause of pulse spreading due to these two kinds of dispersion is that delay time is dependent on wavelength. This dependence of delay time on wavelength is relative to alterations in glass composition and distribution of refractive index. Even when a laser diode is used as the light source, the light does not oscillate on a single wavelength, but is composed of a plurality of wavelengths. Therefore, pulse spreading occurs due to differences in the delay time of each wavelength. To minimize this pulse spreading, the center of the wavelengths of the light source should be made to reach the maximum point on a graph of the relationship of light velocity to wavelength. This is illustrated in Figure 2. The maximum point is called the zero-dispersion wavelength. Currently, the most widely used light source wavelength for single mode fibers is the 1.3 &mgr; band. The zero-dispersion wavelength of fibers used is also 1.3 &mgr;, the same as that of the light source wavelength. Recently, use of a transmission system has begun which employs the 1.55&mgr; band, in which the attenuation of optical fibers is lowest. Also, by increasing the difference in refractive indices between the core and the cladding, and reducing the core diameter, the fiber whose zero-dispersion wavelength is shifted to 1.55 &mgr;, called the dispersion shifted fiber, was developed and is now in use. This system was first used by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) of Japan. A repeaterless transmission was realized by ocean cable over the 120 km distance from Matsuyama to Oita. This cable was installed in 1988 with an information carrying capacity of 1.6 Gbps. Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) plans to use the dispersion shifted fiber in a cable (TPC-5) to be laid in 1995-1996 on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. The use of recently developed optical fiber amplification technology is also planned for this system. KDD plans to send 5 Gbps signals of light over a distance of 9,500 km with no conversion of light into electricity, relaying it with optical fiber amplifiers. Another distinguished characteristic of optical fibers is their attenuation. The major component of the glass used to make optical fibers is SiO<inf> 2</inf> . As shown in Figure 3, the manufacturing methods include the modified-chemical vapor deposition (MCVD) method in which the raw material of SiCl<inf> 4</inf> is vaporized and oxidized, and the outside vapor deposition (OVD) method and vapor-phase axial deposition (VAD) method, in which hydrolytic dissociation is performed in the flame of a burner. In each method, because the core and cladding are produced while rotating, there is, in principle, no eccentricity of the core, but actually, the core sometimes becomes eccentric when glass rods are connected at each end for handling. For this reason, total inspection of the core eccentricity is conducted. The vapor pressure of SiCl<inf> 4</inf> , the raw material of optical fibers, is much larger than that of salts of transitional metals, which induce increased attenuation. Therefore, it is easy to eliminate transitional metal impurities. However, as the raw material can be adulterated with SiHCl<inf> 3</inf> or with moisture due to leaks into the raw material supply pipes, OH groups become incorporated in the glass. These OH groups absorb light, inducing worsened attenuation. In the VAD method, which was developed in Japan, because glass is synthesized by hydrolytic dissociation of the raw material in a flame, there is in principle much adulteration with OH groups. Therefore, undertaking the development of technology to remove OH groups after glass synthesis, success was ultimately achieved with the use of chlorine to remove hydrogen. After the removal of OH groups, the causes of attenuation are Rayleigh scattering, which has a larger effect at short wavelengths, and molecular vibrational absorption of Si-O, which has a larger effect at long wavelengths. Rayleigh scattering is dependent on the concentration of the dopant in the core. For the formation of refractive index distribution, usually germanium is added to the core to increase the refractive index. In contrast, fluorine may be added to the cladding to reduce the refractive index. Rayleigh scattering is suppressed by making the core of pure SiO<inf> 2</inf> because of no dopant in the core. Japan has developed the fluorine dopant technology and has realized the pure silica core single mode fiber in which attenuation is further reduced by 10-15%. These fibers were used in 1992 in the second trans-Pacific optical fiber cable (TPC-4). As in the previous description, dispersion shifted fibers have attained the limit for information-carrying capacity, and pure silica core fibers the limit for attenuation. Figure 4 shows an attenuation-wavelengthcurve for a typical optical fiber and the causes of that attenuation. Optical fibers are made of glass. Glass is well known as a fragile material. Therefore, ever since the early stages of optical fiber development, research has been conducted on ways to maintain their strength. Glass is strong to begin with; its fragility is due to the fact that there are cracks on its surface. Optical fibers are produced drawing the molten glass preform. In this process, optical fibers are coated with resin to protect their surface before it can touch a hard object, so that the optical fiber retains its original degree of strength. This technology was also invented in Japan. Figure 3(d) shows the concept of the drawing machine. Because the adhesion of foreign substances to the surface of a fiber weakens its strength, cleanliness is also emphasized in the fiber manufacturing process not only for attenuation but also for strength. Because it is in reality impossible to achieve 100% cleanliness, weak spots are intentionally broken with a certain tensile load that is applied beforehand, so that the weak areas are not shipped. This process is called screening. On the one hand, when hard resin is used as the coating material, the fiber receives minute bends when a non-uniform lateral pressure is applied, increasing attenuation. On the other hand, soft resin is unable to fulfill the role of protecting the surface of the fiber. Therefore, the resin for coating has a two-layer structure, composed of a soft resin which protects the fiber, and outside this is a hard resin which protects that soft resin. Atop this, for the purpose of distinction, color is applied with ink. When foreign particles become stuck on in the coating process, the outside diameter becomes larger in spots, so that bends arise in fibers when they are combined as cables, increasing attenuation. Several colored fibers are lined up side by side and covered with resin. This resin layer is called ribbon coating. The structure is shown in Figure 5. When the ribbonized fibers are separated, the ribbon coating is removed. But if the ink sticks to the ribbon coating at this time and is stripped, it becomes impossible to distinguish the fibers; so countermeasures for this must be also considered. On the one hand, if the adhesion between the soft resin and the glass is high, the coating cannot be stripped away cleanly at the time of splicing. On the other hand, if there is no adhesion, difficulties arise when the ribbon fibers are spliced. The fibers and the coating will slip after the coated resin at the ends of the fibers is stripped, and when the ribbon is held at the resin part, because the length of the extrusion of the fibers is not uniform splicing is impossible, as shown in Figure 6. The degree of adhesion, therefore, must be controlled to satisfy these two conditions. Coating strippability is also related to Young's modulus. This is shown in Figure 7. The prevention of generating air bubbles in coating layers is also important. When there are many air bubbles, bends arise in the fiber due to non-uniform stress. This increases attenuation. Especially at low temperatures, the Young's modulus of the resin increases, and the difference in thermal contraction between the glass and the resin can produce a large stress, increasing attenuation. The generation of air bubbles is prevented by revising the die structure and by process parameter control, such as resin temperature. An on-line air bubble sensor has also been developed. Consequently, the materials used to coat the glass are also important. We can observe that many kinds of studies have been made from every angle up to the present time. (2) Improvement in Quality As in the description in part (1), the functionality of optical fibers has reached its limits. The next step would be to produce optical fibers without variance in this functionality so as to ship them with assurance, and to prevent loss of functionality after shipping. Group activities by production technicians for improvement have been very effective for reducing variance in production. Control of the purity of the gas used and leak checking in the supply pipes are important for low attenuation. Because alteration of the distribution of the refractive index causes the variance of the mode field diameter (power distribution of the light to be propagated in the fiber), the cutoff wavelength (wavelength limit in which single mode propagation is possible) and the zero-dispersion wavelength, inspection is conducted at the preform stage, and feedback is made if there are any abnormalities. Especially in the steps after glass synthesis from fiber formation to coating, cleanliness control in the manufacturing process is important for strength. It is also essential that characteristics of fibers remain unchanged for many years after cables are laid. If hydrogen is dissolved in the glass, attenuation increases because of light absorption by hydrogen molecules. Origins of this hydrogen include the decomposition of resin used as the coating material and the oxidation of metals used to form the cable. As countermeasures, resin which produces little hydrogen is used, and oxidation-resistant metals are used to plate the metals used. Also, if defects exist in the Si-O network within the glass, hydrogen reacts with these defects, increasing attenuation even further. Therefore, it is also important that no defects be formed in the glass network in the glass synthesis process. Figure 8 shows the spectral attenuation of a fiber in which attenuation is increased by hydrogen. Quartz glass is water dissolvable. Its dissolution is accelerated by tensile force applied to the fiber. The fibers are stranded in the cable, and receive a slight amount of tensile force. Water vapor in the cables causes the gradual growth of cracks on the surface of the optical fiber, so that finally, breakage can occur as a result of a small tensile force. Breakage lifetime depends on original strength of the fiber, the tensile force that is applied to it, and a value n expressing the speed of crack growth. The value n is a numberthat is determined experimentally from the relationship between the tensile force applied to a fiber and the breakage lifetime. It depends on temperature and humidity. Figure 9 shows one example of the relationship between tensile force applied to a fiber and the breakage lifetime. The slope of the curve is the value n. The strength of a fiber decreases even in a state without load stress; the speed of this decrease in strength depends on the kind of resin used for the coating. The properties of resin change when it is exposed to humidity or ultraviolet light. This process can lead to changes in the characteristics of fiber. First, the color of the resin yellows due to ultraviolet light, making distinction difficult. Since it has been found that fibers may change in color when stored for a long period of time in a warehouse with fluorescent lamps, countermeasures have been taken. It has also been observed that adhesion may change between glass and coating layer due to humidity, and bubbles appear within the coating layer. Bubbles which exist within the coating layer from the start also grow, causing problems. With the increase in the number of fibers used in high-fiber-count cables, cable splicing requires more time, causing the fibers to be exposed directly to rain or humidity in manholes. In extreme cases, the manholes can be flooded. In such cases, the humidity resistance of resin is important. Changes in adhesion are considered to be caused by breakage of the hydrogen bonds between the glass and the resin by water. This is shown in Figure 10. Adhesion is scrupulously controlled in the fiber manufacturing process, but when this adhesion changes due to humidity, problems occur at the time of cable connection. The appearance and growth of bubbles within the coating cause micro-bends of fiber, which affect attenuation. Bubbles at the glass-resin interface are especially important factors in attenuation. The resin used for fiber coating has been developed with the above points in mind, and resin has been developed in which the kinds of problems observed earlier do not arise. Table 1 is an example of the results of underwater, high temperature or high humidity conditions accelerated degradation tests. When a fiber is left in water at 100°C for 16 hours, delamination may occur between the glass and the soft resin, and bubbles appear. As a result, attenuation increases. Also, when a fiber is left for four months at 95% humidity and 60°C, the stripping force may change, making connection difficult. Leaving a fiber at the low temperature of -40°C may also increase attenuation. When a fiber is left under water for six months, it is possible that the fiber's strength decreases. These phenomena depend on the type of resin used for coating. By selecting an appropriate type of resin, strength reduction can be prevented. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

Optical fiber cables have become highly reliable. 3. Production Methods (3) Improvement in Productivity As the price drop in the optical fiber market has been remarkable, it is natural that every maker is concentrating on increasing productivity. The main factors that determine productivity are speed of glass synthesis, drawing speed, and preform size. In 1989, it was reported that the speed of glass synthesis was 9 g/min by the OVD method of Corning, and the preform size was 90 km/preform. These values were slightly higher with Japan's VAD method. A glass synthesis speed of 20 g/min at the laboratory by the VAD method has been reported. The drawing speed of 1,200 m/min is also the highest that has been reported. In the VAD method, improvements have been made to the structure of the burner for flame hydrolysis in order to increase the speed of synthesis. When drawing speed increases in the drawing process, coating resin is applied to hot fibers, and the resin decomposes. To avoid this, it is necessary to sufficiently cool the fibers after they emerge from the drawing furnace and before they enter the coating die, therefore, the distance is lengthened from the drawing furnace to the coating die. Drawing towers that are twenty meters or more in height are also being considered for this. In response to high speed drawing, technology has been developed to apply pressure to the resin inside the die that will be used to coat fibers, and high resin curing speed has been achieved. In the early development of optical fibers, thermosetting silicone resin, which is extremely stable chemically, was used. But more recently, to increase the drawing speed, UV-light curable resin is more common because of its very high curing speed. To advance the curing speed even further, high-power UV lamps have been developed. (4) Cost Reduction The cost of optical fibers includes indirect expenses such as the cost of research in addition to expenses for raw materials, personnel, and facilities. Since SiCl<inf> 4</inf> , the raw material of the glass, is a byproduct of the production of silicon for semiconductor devices from the raw material of SiHCl<inf> 3</inf> , refining and transportation compose most of the raw material expenses for the glass. However, the requirements for the resin material to be used in coating are stringent, as written in the explanation in section 2, and this kind of resin is not produced in as large a quantity as other plastics, so it is quite costly. The cost of gases such as oxygen, hydrogen, and helium and the cost of electricity are also high. Personnel expenses per unit length of fiber during the manufacturing process are relatively low because of increased productivity, as in the description in section (3). However, as inspection items are added for quality improvement, the expenses in this aspect remain high. Facility expenses have decreased somewhat due to increased productivity, but there are also factors increasing facility expenses, such as the enlargement of machines, factory automation, and the installation of sensors for quality improvement. Facility expenses do not necessarily decrease in direct correlation to increased productivity. 4. Market Needs (5) Increase in Types of Cable Structure There are many types of optical fiber cable structures, depending upon the applications. Since different types of cables are used overseas, the number of types is further increased. First, the cables used domestically will be discussed. Cable structures can be explained by looking at the number of fibers included in one cable. There are single-fiber cables in which one fiber is housed in one cable. These generally have a structure in which strengthening materials and jacket are applied to the inner fiber. For cables of up to about 12 fibers, a layer type is used in which fibers are stranded around a strength member. Up to about 48 fibers, a unit structure is used in which units of eight fibers are stranded with each other and then further stranded around a strength member. In cables of one hundred fibers, a grooved spacer structure is used in which five 4-fiber ribbons are housed in each groove of a spacer with five grooves. In an era in which optical fibers reach each house, as many fibers as houses go out from the telephone office, necessitating the use of high-fiber-count cables. The highest fiber count in cables currently laid is 1,000, and the diameter of this 1,000-fiber cable is just 40 mm. Eight-fiber ribbon is used in this cable. This is shown in Figure 11. In the slotted core type cable, water-swelling tape is used for protection against water entry. At present, the development of super high-count cable with higher fiber count is under way. The structure of these cables use stranded units of ten 16-fiber ribbons. Cables of up to 4,000 fibers are being considered. This is shown in Figure 12. Ocean cables are laid at depths reaching several thousand meters from cable laying ships, so they receive large tensile forces. The water pressure they are subject to after being laid is also very large. In the structure used by KDD, the fiber units are encased in three divisions of steel shells to make them resistant to that tensile force and water pressure, and steel wires are stranded around these. This is covered with a copper tube, which transmits electrical power, and on top of that, two layers of polyethylene, low-density polyethylene and high-density polyethylene, are used to block seawater. To combat any water penetration, a compound to prevent the spreading of water is used to fill the area between the steel components. This is shown in Figure 13. The special feature of optical fibers is that they are not subject to electromagnetic interference. Therefore, it is possible to construct composite fiber-optic power cables, in which optical fibers are included in power cables. It is also possible to lay optical fibers parallel to high-voltage power cables that are laid along steel towers. Composite fiber-optic overhead ground wires are widely used at present. Here, overhead ground wires laid parallel to power cables are used as pipes, and optical fibers are encased inside these pipes. Overseas, the loose tube cable is the standard. The fibers are inserted into a tube, and the tube is then filled with a jelly to prevent water permeation. Caution must be exercised because the jelly may erode the resin used for coating. (6) Production Capacity and Delivery Times In 1992, 2.46 million kilometers of optical fiber were produced in Japan (from a survey by The Japanese Electric Wire and Cable Makers' Association). In a plan by NTT, B-ISDN is to be constructed and optical fibers are to be laid to every household by the year 2015. There are reports that this plan may be postponed because of falling income levels at NTT, but it is clear that even if the plan is delayed two or three years, many fibers will be necessary. The companies involved will have sufficient production capacity to fully respond to those future needs. The preparation of such a production system will also result in shorter delivery times from ordering to shipment. (7) Development of Related Technologies 1. Fusion Splicing To join optical fibers, the ends of the fibers are cleaved to mirror surfaces, and then aligned and fusion spliced with heating by electrical discharge. In the case of single mode fibers, the core diameter is extremely small, at only 8 &mgr;, and it is necessary for the fibers to be aligned as precisely as possible. For this alignment, the sides of the fibers are illuminated, and their position is thereby confirmed for proper alignment during splicing. Confirmation of core position is conducted automatically through image processing based on information from a CCD camera. At present, the loss due to splicing is at the extremely low level of 0.03 dB. To join ultrahigh-fiber-count cables, fiber by fiber splicing would take an immense amount of time. Therefore, a technology has been developed whereby fiber ribbons are joined all at once. For this mass fusion splicing technique, it is necessary that each fiber that is to be spliced should be heated identically with electrical discharge energy. It is set so that all the fibers in a ribbon are placed in the position where the energy is uniformly distributed. This is shown in Figure 14. In this method, ribbons of up to sixteen fibers can be simultaneously spliced. A fully automatic fusion splicer is being developed. This machine will automatically conduct operations from jacket removing to reinforcing after splicing. When use of this fusion splicer is begun, splicing will be possible at about four times the speed of conventional splicing machines. The industry is looking forward to this machine as it will create great labor savings and shorten training time as well. 2. Connectors Even with the development of a fusion splicer that can handle sixteen fibers at once, quite a long time is needed to splice ultrahigh-fiber-count cables such as those that encase four thousand fibers. Even with the fully automatic fiber splicer, calculations show that it would take a full day to splice cables of this type. Therefore, discussions are being held regarding the development of high-count-fiber connectors. Thefiber count in a connector so far developed is sixteen. The connectors line up the cores of mating fibers by inserting two pins called guide-pins into the guide-holes on both sides of the fiber ribbon. The accuracy of the alignment is within 1 &mgr;, and the loss due to splicing has reached an average level of 0.2 dB. The structure of the connector is shown in Figure 15. The development of eighty-fiber connectors is also in progress. There are two methods: one in which eighty fibers are lined up in one row, and the other in which sixteen fiber connectors are arranged in five vertical rows. Taking two minutes as the connecting time for one connector, the joining time of four thousand fibers cables would be just one hundred minutes. 3. Surveillance System for Optical Fiber Network Along with progress in the deployment of optical communications systems, the effects of accidents involving optical fiber cables breakage will become extremely serious. Conventionally, nitrogen gas was sealed inside a cable at a certain pressure, and accidents were detected by monitoring this gas pressure. However, to suppress costs the gas-pressurized cable system has been abandoned, and instead, attenuation is measured periodically. When attenuation increase is detected, it is necessary to switch immediately to spare fibers. NTT has developed the system shown in Figure 16. In this system, light of a different wavelength from the signal light wavelength is used to measure the attenuation of a fiber in use. The optical components used in this system include a coupler that combines light of two different wavelengths and a fiber selecting switch that is used to launch the measuring light into each fiber sequentially. The coupler is made with the technique of fiber fusing. The switch is composed of the mechanically movable master connector and the connector arrays opposed to the master connector. However, it is hoped that a non-mechanical switch will be developed in the future. To reflect the measuring light at the end of the fiber under test, a filter is installed which passes the signal light through but causes the measuring light to reflect. The switch to a spare fiber, in case any abnormality is detected, is made by a mechanical optical switch. As optical fibers become more and more widespread, to construct an accurate data base of information regarding optical fiber networks that is necessary for cable maintenance and management, including manufacturing data, characteristics of transmission, installation date, placed location, and data on spliced lines, automatic renewal of the current manual collection processes is being considered by NTT. This would enable the quick selection of idle fibers for new subscribers and quick switching from lines with problems to idle lines. The main components for the system are the connector with memory, the local controller (LCTR) (a simple transmitter with microprocessor) which sends information from this memory to a central workstation, and appropriate optical fibers. The connector with memory is used when joining optical cables in a manhole; when joining the connectors, the memory chips on the connectors are also fixed on the printed circuit board (PCB). The LCTR gathers information from the memory chips through the PCB and sends the information to the workstation at the telephone office viaappropriate fibers. The system structure is shown in Figure 17. 5. Summary Since the latter half of the 1970's optical fibers have been made into cables and laid on site. In the meantime, trouble of various kinds has occurred in the factory and on site, and improvements have been made in response to these problems. At present, almost all of the problems have been exhausted, and it seems that the industry has neared the point of perfection in creating countermeasures for these problems. With their excellent reliability, these optical fibers will be laid on a global scale in the future. As a result, it is expected that a high level information society will be realized with various services available at a low cost, and that a number of new industries will be established in relation to this achievement.
