FR940630-0-00098 FR940630-0-00036 Clarification That ``Section 3 Resident'' Includes Public Housing Residents. A few commenters stated that some public housing residents do not meet the low-income or very low-income qualifications established by section 3, but noted that the statute indicates that all public housing residents are eligible for the priority consideration established by section 3 for public housing resident in employment and training opportunities. The commenters requested that the Department resolve this contradiction by explicitly including public housing residents in the definition of ``section 3 resident.'' The Department agrees with the commenters that the definition of ``section 3 resident'' should include all public housing residents. Section 915 of the 1992 Act (the section that amended section 3), provides that it is ``the policy of the Congress and the purpose of section 3'' that economic opportunities generated by HUD financial assistance be directed toward low- and very low-income persons, ``particularly [to] those who are recipients of government assistance for housing.'' The inclusion of ``public housing resident'' in the definition of ``section 3 resident'' is consistent with Congressional policy and statutory intent. Definitions of Low-Income and Very Low-Income Are Statutory. Many commenters suggested alternative definitions for low-income person and very low-income person. The commenters wanted the definitions to specifically include participants in programs under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), welfare recipients, and welfare eligible applicants, or to base the income level on household income, not individual income, or to base the income level on a percentage of the median of the majority income, and not an all inclusive median income. Section 915 of the 1992 Act, which amended section 3, specifically provides that ``low-income person'' and ``very low-income person'' shall have the meanings provided these terms in section 3(b)(2) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act). Accordingly, the definitions are taken from this section of the 1937 Act. Proof of Status as Section 3 Resident Is the Responsibility of the Individual. A few commenters raised questions concerning the form of certification or other evidence they were required to obtain or accept from individuals to verify their status as a section 3 resident. A few other commenters stated that questions about a person's income were an invasion of privacy. The interim rule does not mandate (nor did the proposed rule) that the recipient, contractor or subcontractor require certification or evidence of a person's section 3 status. However, if verification of status is requested, it is the responsibility of the individual seeking the preference in employment provided by section 3, to present evidence that the person is a low-income or very low-income person. The Department does not prescribe any special form of certification. Acceptable documentation or evidence may include evidence of a person's residency in a public housing development, or evidence of section 8 certificate or voucher assistance, or other evidence of participation in a HUD or other Federally assisted program such as JTPA, AFDC, or JOBS, or evidence of participation in a State or local assistance program, or receipt of welfare assistance. On the subject of invasion of privacy, one commenter stated that an individual who applies for a job should not have to disclose his or her income. If an individual wants to take advantage of the preference provided by section 3, the individual must be willing to make such disclosure, or as noted earlier, present other evidence of participation in a program that assists low- or very low-income persons. It is not unusual for programs that provide preference for certain groups (e.g., elderly persons, young persons of a certain age group, minorities) to require the persons claiming the preference to support eligibility for the preference. Revision to the Definition of ``Section 3 Business Concern'' Several commenters suggested alternative definitions for ``section 3 business concern.'' The proposed rule defined a section 3 business concern three different ways. To be eligible for the section 3 preference, a business concern would only have to meet one of the three definitions. First Definition Is Unchanged. Four commenters criticized the first definition, which requires 51 percent or more ownership of the business by low- or very low-income persons. The commenters stated that this definition was totally unrealistic. The commenters stated that if a business concern is sufficiently capitalized to bid on construction projects of substantial size and complexity, then in all likelihood the owners were not low-income or very low-income persons. The first definition is derived from the statute which calls for majority ownership by low-income or very low-income persons. The Department acknowledges that there is a small percentage of these types of business concerns. These business concerns exist primarily in public housing developments, and therefore are business concerns to which housing authorities have access for contract work. In several public housing developments across the nation, residents have organized to form small businesses that are engaged in lawn care, building maintenance, and even small manufacturing work, and provide these services for the development in which they reside or for other developments owned by the housing authority. The commenters are correct that generally resident-owned businesses are not the business concerns that are capable of bidding and performing work as the primary contractor for a major construction or rehabilitation project. Nevertheless, because this definition is statutory, and has meaning within the public housing industry, the first definition is retained by the interim rule, and remains unchanged from the definition in the proposed rule.
