On Tuesday, a Moscow newspaper reported it as a fait accompli, which caused confusion at the Defense Ministry. The Defense Ministry's press center has flatly denied the information, calling it a provocation. What has actually happened? MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI has learned form sources close to the president that Defense Ministry chiefs have long had differences of views, particularly on how military reform should be carried out. Far from all generals support Pavel Grachev's stance on the matter. As a result, two camps have emerged in the ministry leadership, both with their own doctrines of military organization. As with Grachev's other opponents, Gen. Kolesnikov is not a proponent of radical reform. According to officials from the Defense Ministry central staff, this stance has annoyed Pavel Grachev. Recently, appointments to high posts at the General Staff were made without Kolesnikov's consent. Other "working incidents" have also been reported. Small wonder that the other day Kolesnikov said in an outburst of emotion that if his opinion was not heeded, he was ready to resign. It cannot be ruled out that military bureaucrats interested in such a turn of events have deliberately leaked the information to the press, adding by themselves a finishing touch: Gen. Kolesnikov's separation request is already sitting on Yeltsin's table. Still, the source told MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, it is possible that there may indeed be only one step from an oral statement to a written request. It is believed, however, that Boris Yeltsin is unlikely to accept the resignation, because he sees Kolesnikov as "a mighty counterweight to extreme reformers." Come what may, Mikhail Kolesnikov has said in public that he is not going to resign and that he is fully intent on honestly performing his duties.
