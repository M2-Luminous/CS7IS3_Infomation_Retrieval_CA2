Addressing the media after meeting international mediators Henry Kissinger of the United States and Lord Carrington of Britain at his official residence in Pretoria last night, Mr. de Klerk said he was optimistic that another summit meeting of the key political players could take place by next week, but he said logistical problems virtually ruled out participation in the election by the Inkatha Freedom Party. Mr. de Klerk gave his approval for a document he had been given containing the terms of reference and time frames thrashed out by the working groups of the ANC, the IFP and the government. He said it was now up to the ANC, IFP and kwaZulu government to give their approval. [Begin de Klerk recording] What now remains -- if I may focus on the mediation process -- is finalization of the terms of reference in the procedures. I have been given a document which I regard as a relatively good document which is the result of representatives from the three, four main parties having met during today. This document is now being put before the principals from all sides, and if agreement is reached, the mediation can start almost immediately. I would not rule out another summit. [end recording]
