FR940804-0-00017 FR940804-0-00008 Modeling Results The USEPA reviewed the dispersion modeling analysis performed by Versar Incorporated for this SIP revision request and has determined that the analysis is acceptable as a demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for CO. This attainment and maintenance demonstration was performed in accordance with USEPA guidance. III. Final Rulemaking Action The USEPA approves the February 11, 1993, submittal as a revision to the Illinois CO SIP for the GMC iron foundry in Vermilion County amending 35 IAC section 216.381 because the deficiencies identified were corrected in a FESOP issued to the Source. Vermilion County is and has always been designated as attainment for CO and ozone and the emission limit set forth in the SIP revision was shown through the modeling analysis not to cause or contribute to a violation of the NAAQS for CO. Because the State included the following conditions in a FESOP, the SIP revision is now federally enforceable upon the effective date of this action. 1. Specific test method to be used; 2. Identification as to whether a continuous or integrated sample is to be used in the test method; 3. A compliance test that contains averaging times; and 4. The appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements to insure compliance. Because USEPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. This action will become effective on October 3, 1994. However, if the USEPA receives adverse comments by September 6, 1994, then the USEPA will publish a notice that withdraws the action, and will address the comments received in response to this final rule in the final rule on the requested SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of this Federal Register . The comment period will not be extended or reopened. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. USEPA., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976).
