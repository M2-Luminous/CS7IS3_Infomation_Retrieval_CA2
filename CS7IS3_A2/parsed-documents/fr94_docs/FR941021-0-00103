FR941021-0-00103 FR941021-0-00020 In §600.123(f) under Cost sharing or matching, ``expendable equipment'' has been deleted because it is an example that does not fit the subject of the paragraph. Section 600.124(a) under Program income has been rewritten to improve the syntax. In §600.124(b)(1), (2) and (3), ``program'' has been deleted to reflect that DOE is limiting the use of program income to the project on which it is earned, not more generally to undefined programs. Section 600.124(d) has been rewritten to improve the syntax and to add the applicability to commercial organizations. Section 600.125(a) on budget plans has been rewritten to improve the syntax. Section 600.125(e)(2) on budget period extensions has been rewritten to improve the syntax. In §§600.128, 600.151(b), and 600.161(a)(3), ``grant'' was changed to ``award'' to be consistent with DOE usage. In §600.134(c) under Equipment, ``Federal awarding agency which funded the original project'' has been deleted and replaced with ``DOE.'' The word ``awarding'' between ``Federal'' and ``agencies'' has been deleted as unnecessary. In §600.134(g) under Equipment, the following has been added: ``Equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency.'' This makes explicit what is intended but not directly stated in Circular A&hyph;110. This policy, it should be noted, is consistent with Section XXX .32(e)(1) of the A&hyph;102 Common Rule. Section 600.134(h) under Equipment and its subparagraphs have been renumbered from Circular A&hyph;110, in which it was listed as Section XXX .34(g)(4). Subparagraph (g)(4) was a different subject from the rest of the paragraph (g). Also, the language ``the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate'' was deleted and replaced by ``the provisions of 600.134(g)(1) apply'' to give a more precise cross-reference to the applicable standards. In §600.144(a)(2) under Procurement procedures, ``for the Federal Government'' is deleted as an inappropriate standard for financial assistance. In §600.151(h) pertaining to performance reports, ``applicable'' was added to emphasize that not all provisions of 5 CFR Part 1320 apply in requesting performance data. Section 600.152(a)(1)(i) under Financial reporting has been rewritten to improve syntax. In §600.153(b)(4) pertaining to record retention requirements, ``etc. as'' is deleted and replaced by ``and related records, for which retention requirements are'' to provide more specific examples. In §600.153(g) pertaining to record retention requirements, the first sentence in the A&hyph;110 text was deleted because it had the appearance of a subparagraph title, which the rest of the subparagraphs did not have. In §600.153(g) (1) and (2), ``awarding'' was deleted and replaced by ``responsible for negotiating the recipient's indirect cost rate'' in (g)(1) and ``cognizant'' in (g)(2) to emphasize the role of cognizant agencies in indirect cost rate negotiation. Appendix A, No. 8 has been rewritten to more accurately state the circumstances under which Executive Orders 12549 and 12689 apply. III. Explanation for ``Interim Final'' Rulemaking
