According to the prime minister, it is particularly regrettable that this step was taken at a time when talks between Estonian and Russian representatives are in progress. Laar thinks that this is probably a case of Russia putting pressure on Estonia in order to achieve concessions with regard to resolving the issue of Russian military pensioners who live here. At the same time, Laar stated that Estonia will firmly retain her position and continue to call for the Russian troop withdrawal by 31 August of this year. Estonia will definitely approach international organizations in order to resolve the conflict that has resulted from this strained situation, Laar emphasized.
