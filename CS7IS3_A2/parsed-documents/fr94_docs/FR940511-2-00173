FR940511-2-00173 FR940511-2-00110 [Release No. 34&hyph;34017; File No. SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;92&hyph;16] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Order Approving on a Temporary Basis a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Margin Levels for Collateralized Mortgage Obligations May 5, 1994. On December 28, 1992, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;92&hyph;16) pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 relating to the establishment of margin levels on Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (``CMO security'' or ``CMO'') currently eligible for deposit or which may become eligible for deposit at PTC. Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on February 7, 1994. 2 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change on a temporary basis, until April 30, 1995. 1 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33546 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5646. I. Description PTC's proposal establishes a method of computing the percentages to be deducted from the market value of certain securities (``haircut'') to determine how those securities should be valued for purposes of participants' Net Free Equity. 3 The securities in question are CMO securities 4 which are eligible for deposit or which may become eligible for deposit at PTC. Currently, the only such securities are Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (``REMIC'') issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA REMIC''). 5 3 Net Free Equity is calculated as the sum of: (1) The cash balance in the account; (2) the market value of securities in the account, less the appropriate haircut for such securities (``Applicable Percentage''); and (3) the value of all Supplemental Processing Collateral; minus (4) Reserve on Gain on transfers made that day. Supplemental Processing Collateral includes the following: (1) The value of optional deposits to the participants fund allocated to that account (optional deposits to the participants fund are deposits that exceed the minimum deposit required pursuant to PTC's rules and procedures); and (2) 20% of the mandatory deposits to the participants fund for the Master Account (mandatory deposits to the participants fund are minimum deposits required to be deposited into such fund pursuant to PTC's rules and procedures). Reserve on Gain means: (1) The contract value credited to the cash balance of a delivering participant or limited purpose participant over the market value of securities credited to the transfer account associated with the account of the receiving participant; or (2) the market value of securities credited to the transfer account associated with the account of a receiving participant over the contract value credited to the cash balance of the delivering participant or limited purpose participant. PTC Rules, Article I, Rule I. 4 A CMO is a multiple-class mortgage cash flow security. As such, a CMO redirects the cash flow from an underlying standard mortgage-backed security (``MBS''), such as a Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA'') security, and allows the CMO issuer to create classes, or tranches, with many different interest rates, average lives, prepayment sensitivities, final maturities, and payment priorities. 5 VA REMICs are securities for which the full and timely payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and backed up the full faith and credit of the United States government. The Commission approved VA REMICs as eligible for deposit at PTC in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 30792 (June 10, 1992), 57 FR 27495, and 31914 (February 24, 1993) 58 FR 12295.
