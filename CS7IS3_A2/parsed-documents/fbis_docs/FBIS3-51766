In an exclusive statement to PRENSA LATINA, Contino said there is a tendency to talk about a generational succession, which is an inappropriate term, because it implies: You got up to here; now I will continue alone. He said there are three generations of revolutionaries living together in Cuba, and far from disagreeing they agree fully regarding principles, ideas, and goals of the revolutionary process, which began in January 1959. Contino, who is 33 years old and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, also denied Cuban society is facing a crisis of values. Contino conceded, however, there are groups among the young population (5.7 million people, ranging between 0 and 30 years of age Cuba) that are involved in criminal activities, but this is triggered by the difficult economic situation Cuba is facing. Contino said the crime rate has increased as well as displays of social indiscipline and "jineterismo" (a local term to denote a form of prostitution that is linked with tourism), but most of these cases are isolated cases and not the general behavior of young people. Contino said that in the eyes of the UJC each individual case is undoubtedly a problem. He added the UJC is trying to approach those youths who are involved in criminal activities, so as to educate them. Contino said there is a strong campaign against crime, because in the difficult situation Cuba is facing, there is a thin line between criminal and counterrevolutionary actions. Contino said Cuban youths in general are highly motivated politically, which shatters the argument that young people are withdrawing from the revolutionary process. Contino referred to relations with the young believers as very good, and he confirmed relations with their organizations are smooth. The UJC was founded in April 1961 as a selective and leading organization, and it has a membership of 550,000 from the entire population of 3.1 million youths.
