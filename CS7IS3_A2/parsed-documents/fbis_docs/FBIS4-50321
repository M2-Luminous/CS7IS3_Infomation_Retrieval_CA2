The meeting mainly discussed issues such as preparatory work regarding the design and issuance of the PRC's Hong Kong SAR passports, as well as issues pertaining to Hong Kong's social welfare, such as public housing and the retirement security system. While discussing the issuance of Hong Kong SAR passports, PWC members noted: This task is of great importance to ensuring the freedom of entry and exit for Hong Kong residents, to strengthening Hong Kong's economic relations and trade with other countries and regions, and to maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. The members proposed: Hong Kong SAR passports should embody the spirit of "one country, two systems," and they should be issued in strict accordance with the Basic Law. To enable Hong Kong residents to use SAR passports on 1 July 1997, we should make advance preparations for the design, printing, and issuance of such passports. The members added: Our government will take active diplomatic actions with other countries and regions regarding mutual visa exemption arrangements for SAR passports; this is particularly important. They also noted: Besides SAR passports, preparations should also be made regarding SAR travel documents. While discussing public housing policy that has a major bearing on Hong Kong's welfare, the panel decided to set up a public housing research group. To broadly canvass opinions in all quarters, some public figures in Hong Kong will be invited to serve as advisers to the research group. The panel also discussed the retirement security system. The meeting was held in Beijing 16-17 May.
