In an interview at Stormont Castle, Belfast, yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, restated the British Government's refusal to embrace Sinn Fein in the search for a political solution until the IRA ended violence permanently. With ministers acutely aware that Sinn Fein has scored another propaganda victory in Mr Adams' U.S. visit, Sir Patrick's uncompromising position was endorsed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons. In New York, Mr Douglas Hurd, Foreign Secretary, said Mr Adams' remarks had been characterised by "ambiguity and evasion." The U.S. administration also moved quickly to emphasise that its decision to admit Mr Adams on a 48-hour visa did not reflect policy differences with the British government over Northern Ireland. President Bill Clinton, rejecting calls for more U.S. pressure on Britain, said at a press conference: "Let's be fair. The people that have to resolve this are the Irish and the British." He described the peace initiative taken by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, as "astonishing" and said Mr Adams should back it. Sir Patrick dismissed Mr Adams' renewed calls for clarification as delaying tactics. After a briefing to members of the congressional committee on Irish affairs, Mr Adams said he was anxious to find a proposal to put to the IRA to end its conflict. "The ball is firmly in the British court," he said. Mr Adams repeated his calls for British government action when he addressed the national committee on American foreign policy. But Sir Patrick, who said it was "a pity" that Mr Adams had been given a platform in the U.S., insisted that it was Sinn Fein which had "the key" to a peaceful solution. He said: "The only rational choice for a organisation that has a political objective is to accede to the declaration, end violence and make it clear that you have ended violence, and then make use of what has been offered, Sinn Fein has the key. The key is their ability to give up violence." Referring to the Sinn Fein president's recent letter to Mr Major, Sir Patrick said that it "did not seek any clarification or explanation of any specific matter at all. It is entirely clear that what he wants is a renegotiation of the declaration." He claimed that Mr Adams' continuing refusal to be specific meant that there was no "genuine request for enlightenment and the most likely candidate for an alternative explanation is the desire to play for time." Mr Adams, in calling on the government for talks on the mechanics of a negotiated settlement, said: "Mr Major has talked of a first step in the peace process. What is the second step and the third step?" He said peace would be difficult to establish but prospects were better than ever before.
