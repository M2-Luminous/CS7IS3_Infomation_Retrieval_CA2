The meeting stressed: Governments at all levels and various departments must further understand the great significance of accelerating the construction of the zone from the height of realizing the reunification of the motherland, must make concerted efforts to do a good job of port construction, and must actively create the optimal conditions for the opening of the three exchanges. Communications Minister Huang Zhendong and Provincial Party Secretary Jia Qinglin listened to the reports submitted by the leaders of Zhangzhou City and the Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone and made important speeches. Since the Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone, which earmarks an area of 18 square km for development, has been under construction since the beginning of last year, great progress has been made in the various fields of work, thus attracting the attention of people at home and abroad. When discussing the need to fully understand the significance of accelerating the zone's construction, Huang Zendong stressed: Fujian will be the first to bear the brunt of opening direct air and shipping services between the two sides of the strait. Efforts should be made to speed up port construction to facilitate the commencement of shipping services. It is imperative to accelerate the construction of the Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone. Jia Qinglin fully affirmed the achievements already made by Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone. He pointed out: The zone has been set up in Fujian, Zhangzhou, Longhai, and Gangwei, and these areas will be the first to benefit. We should support the zone's construction with concrete action. He stressed: Not only will the construction of the zone spur Zhangzhou's economic development but it will also play a mutually complementary role in the development of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. More importantly, we should focus on the development of exchanges between the two sides of the strait and serve and submit to the overall situation of peaceful reunification and the concept of one country, two systems. We should approach the great significance of the construction of the development zone in this sense. The meeting studied the issues of port construction, land acquisition, deep-water facilities and the corresponding support roads on land, funds, a 35,000-tonne-class multipurpose wharf, the zone's preferential policy after the introduction of taxation system reform, and the zone's gateway to the outside world. The participants achieved unity in understanding and adopted a resolution.
