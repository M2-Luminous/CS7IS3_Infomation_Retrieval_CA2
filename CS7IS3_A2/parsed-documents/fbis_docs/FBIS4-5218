Approximately 5,000 students of 22 Seoul universities, including Hanyang and Kyonghui Universities, gathered at Chongnyangni Station, Chongmyo Park, and other places in Seoul and held meetings to oppose the ratification of the Uruguay Round implementation plan. The students called the revision of the Uruguay Round implementation plan an antistate act that would crush agriculture. They demanded renegotiations with the United States on basic agricultural products. They also demanded that the National Assembly not ratify the implementation plan and opposed the adoption of the Morocco protocol composed of implementation plans of each state scheduled for 12 April. Approximately 5,000 students of some 110 regional universities, including Pusan, Chonnam, and Kyongbuk Universities, held meetings this afternoon to oppose the adoption of the Uruguay Round protocol and the National Assembly's ratification and staged street demonstrations. In particular, students of eight universities in Pusan and South Kyongsang Province, including Pusan and Tonga Universities declared a class boycott for today and tomorrow. Most of today's gatherings were peaceful, and there was no confrontation between police and students.
