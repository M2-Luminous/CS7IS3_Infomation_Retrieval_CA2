Localities should take advantage of the opportune time to accelerate the development of the non-trade industry that creates foreign exchange. Especially, we should attach importance to developing and improving tourism software. Qian Qichen arrived in Chengdu 15 May. During his stay, he attended a national forum of tourism bureau chiefs and heard reports by leaders of Sichuan Province and Chengdu city. Later, he inspected well-known scenic spots in Sichuan and attended the opening ceremony for the 1994 Chinese Cultural Relics and Historic Sites Tour of Leshan International Tourism Buddha Festival on 18 May. While in Sichuan, Qian Qichen extensively exchanged views with Sichuan's leaders and people in charge of tourism from various provinces on the current state of and prospects for tourism development. Qian Qichen said: China, rich with tourism resources, a long history, and a unique cultural tradition, is a great attraction to the world. Judging from the current international and domestic situations, now is the opportune time to develop tourism. Some Western economies are in recession; and the political situation in some regions, in chaos; while China, developing in a healthy and stable way, has attracted many investors. In three years, Hong Kong will be returned to China. To tourism, this is a great opportunity. We should seize and take advantage of the opportune time. With the launching of economic and financial reforms and the establishment of a socialist market economy in China, China will surely make great headway in developing tourism. Qian Qichen pointed out: Tourism is a comprehensive industry. Its development depends on various industries such as communications, telecommunications, hotel, and transportation, as well as safety. Tourism development will also give an impetus to the development of these industries. As an outward-oriented industry that creates foreign exchange, tourism represents a major nontrade channel from which China earns foreign exchange. Statistics show that, from 1978 to 1993, foreign exchange income from tourism totalled $32.1 billion, becoming a major part of China's foreign exchange earnings from nontrade channels. This has laid a good foundation for further development. Currently, we should improve software and service quality, strengthen safety in travel, and perfect the management system. In 1993, China received some 7 million foreigners who toured China. Tourism is a good channel for foreigners to get to know China. We should leave a good impression on foreign tourists. Qian Qichen also hopes that localities should strengthen production of tourism commodities and develop China into a "shopping paradise" for tourists worldwide. In speaking of tourism development in Sichuan, Qian Qichen pointed out: As a populated province with abundant tourism resources -- a rare favorable condition, Sichuan should concentrate its efforts on development, coordination, and service, so as to make good progress in tourism. Qian Qichen will inspect other parts of Sichuan on 19 and 20 May. Accompanying Qian Qichen were He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of the State Council General Office, and Liu Yi, director of the National Tourism Administration.
