Kato told a news conference after the panel's plenary session the tax commission is resolved to realize tax reforms centering on a boost of indirect taxes. The policy was agreed on when the coalition government was formed last August, he said. Taking the country's future into consideration, tax reform must be carried out regardless of which government comes into power, he said. Kato said reform is also Japan's international obligation and the commission is required to work out a proposal by the end of June, in time for the July summit of major industrialized nations in Naples. The body will coordinate its stance with other councils concerned with administrative reforms, leading to cuts in government expenditures, he said. Kato expressed hope the SDP will support the proposed tax system reforms.
