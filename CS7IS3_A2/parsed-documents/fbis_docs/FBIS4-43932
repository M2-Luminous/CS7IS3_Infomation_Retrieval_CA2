[passage omitted] The man appointed prime minister just after the Arusha agreements last year, Faustin Twagiramungu, who was very wary about the principle of intervention a few days ago, appears more willing to accept it today, as he told Assane Diop: [Begin recording] [Twagiramungu] The French program must be (?undertaken). I did not meet with only the UN ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee; I also met the secretary-general of the United Nations and other ambassadors. They all told me that it was a matter of stopping the Rwandan tragedy, and that, therefore, no one should oppose it. If the content of the resolution is simply to stop the tragedy and not to drag us into another conflict where France would come up against the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] on the ground, I think the resolution should be accepted. As far as I am concerned, I think I have a duty to make contact with the RPF; to discuss and see what is positive in this resolution; to agree, of course, that we should continue to work to stop the massacres and put an end to the tragedy; and also to ask France to stick to the content of the resolution adopted by the United Nations. [end recording] [passage omitted] Balladur was asked at the National Assembly in Paris who was supporting France in this matter, and this is what he answered: [Begin recording] [Balladur] In Africa, Senegal, with whom we have long been comrades in arms, will supply one unit. Discussions are underway with other countries. The political support of a large number of African states -- French speaking, Portuguese speaking, and English speaking -- which has been expressed to us directly, is encouraging. In Europe the operation has the support of the Western European Union and several member countries of that organization have told us they are available to give logistic support: I can name Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Belgium.
