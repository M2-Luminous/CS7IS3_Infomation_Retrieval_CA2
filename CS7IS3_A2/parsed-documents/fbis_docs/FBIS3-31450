Another part of the weaponry will be placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control; therefore, the reason for NATO air strikes no longer exists, prime minister Lukic said. Replying to the question of when the Russian UNPROFOR soldiers could be expected to arrive in Sarajevo, Lukic did not specify the time but said that their deployment along frontlines would be an opportunity for the world finally to understand that it is not only one side -- the Muslims -- that care about peace.
