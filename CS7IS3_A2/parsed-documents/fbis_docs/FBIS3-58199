However, the trip does symbolize a certain progress. After all, in its first year in office, one had the impression that the Clinton administration had put the word "Europe" on the index. Whenever foreign policy would play more than merely a secondary role, the catchwords were "Somalia," "North Korea," "NAFTA" [North America Free Trade Agreement], and "GATT." Secretary of State Christopher has articulated with impatience and unwillingness that "West Europe is no longer the dominating region of the world." Moreover, one was hearing "a lot of criticism" from Europe but not "from Asia." Unforgettable remains Christopher's blunder in connection with Bosnia, which sounded as if he had copied it from Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister of the 1930's. For the architect of the Munich agreement, Czechoslovakia was "a faraway country of which we know nothing." For Christopher, Bosnia was a "humanitarian crisis, far away from home, on another continent." "Russia First" Official rhetoric has meanwhile changed, and so has politics. Clinton will visit Europe three times this year, and Christopher has given assurance that "Europe is in the center of our interest." This is the good part of the news. The less flattering part remains unsaid: Not "Europe first" but "Russia first" is the hidden motto, even when at the opening of the Brussels NATO summit, Vice President Gore once more emphasized the classic orthodoxy: "When there is fighting in Europe, we are also suffering; when Europe is safe and free, we also prosper." However, America's eye remains primarily directed toward Russia, and the policy in this connection is called "Partnership for Peace," which NATO should give its place this week. The intricate draft Made in USA [preceding three words in English] reads just like the Bible; everyone can pick out what fits best into their concepts. Yet, at the end of the day, two things remain indisputable: The Russians must not be upset and, hence, the East Europeans not be accepted into NATO. What remains are consolation prizes for the former compulsory members of the Soviet empire, who now have to hold out in that drafty waiting room that used to be called "In-Between-Europe": between NATO Germany in the West and Russia in the East. True, the alliance intends to offer "interested countries" -- such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and others -- treaties on military cooperation, ranging from joint training to exercises for peaceful missions. This produces a pleasant modernization push for the backward Eastern armies. However, what should the "In-Between-Europeans" do with the passage in bold print, that says: no security guarantees, no date for membership in the alliance? At best, they may "consult" NATO in case they feel threatened. Who will blame Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski for deriding such "partnership" as a signal to "get lost." Behind that, if one wants, one can see a psychiatric view of Western foreign and security policy. The "patient" is Moscow and the therapy is called "appeasement and mollification." Those who want to shift NATO toward the East had better think of the terrible irrational reactions in Russia: paranoia and chauvinism, finally the victory of the neofascist and neoimperialist forces under the banner of someone like Zhirinovskiy. Even if such therapeutical definition of politics -- an old Western reflex --is not a compliment for the Russians, Boris Yeltsin has now gratefully accepted the signals. While Clinton was packing up, Yeltsin once more dramatized what has long since been part of the standard repertoire of Russian rhetoric: a NATO extension would trigger "a negative reaction from Russian society" and a "military-political destabilization" in In-Between Europe. One thing is true about this theory, which is also supported by Chancellor Kohl: Provocation is no foreign policy -- particularly if it might benefit Yeltsin's enemies at home. Yet, maybe even this building of premises is becoming shaky. First, if we are worried about the Russian reformers, we should display the same solicitude toward the East Europeans as well. The former Polish defense chief said, "Our main reason to get into NATO is to secure democracy. We must force back the same nationalists who are also bothering Yeltsin." Second, the therapeutical approach forces the doctor into the straight jacket. Those who commit themselves to the motto "To do anything but provoke them" give the patient a permanent veto right against their own policy. Moreover, the partners are thus stripped of the incentive of examining reality. Those who understand and excuse everything will easily be maneuvered into the situation where they blackmail themselves -- which might culminate in the point where vital interests are suddenly at stake. American -- and also German -- diplomacy toward Russia is, thus, running the risk of issuing a blank check and making itself a hostage of Yeltsin. A wiser policy would, of course, pursue a strategy on three different tracks. On the one track, the train would roll toward help and consideration, although one must never forget that democracy and the market economy are not export hits and that Russia's fate lies in Russia's hands. (It only worked in Germany and Japan after 1945 -- albeit under the loaded cannons of the occupiers.) The second track is called conditionality: Money only for reforms, consideration only for legitimate interests. Neoimperialism under the old-new Czarist flag, particularly if such imperialism puts its paw on the Baltics and East Europe, must no longer count on understanding. In this case, the Russian-friendly "Partnership for Peace" would have to transform itself into a protective alliance with East Europe, including the extension of NATO. Moreover, such a strategy does not necessarily have to weaken Yeltsin -- after all, he could then refer to the loss of Western confidence and be able to exquisitely sober those who pester him at home. Comfort for "In-Between-Europe" On the third track, the West can make a security-political virtue of diplomatic necessity -- that is, not to enlarge NATO. After all, the more an alliance is watered down, the more badly it will produce security. Although NATO has lost its classic function -- defense against a Soviet attack -- it remains an indispensable insurance firm. One has to keep the machinery well oiled; despite disarmament, the alliance needs the capability to quickly restore its potential. Ironically, it is particularly this concentrating on the essential thing that offers "In-Between-Europe" the best comfort. Even someone like Zhirinovskiy will think twice before he plays with fire when he knows that the there are well-trained firemen on the other side. We must help the Russians, even in our own interest. Only, confidence is good, but insurance is better.
