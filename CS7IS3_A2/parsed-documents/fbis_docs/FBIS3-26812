Ciren Zhuoga, vice chairman of the regional government, made a speech: "Earnestly Implement the Conference Guidelines, Work Hard To Establish a New Economic System." Xiao Huaiyuan, director of the regional economic research center, chaired the closing session, during which Zhang Zijian, deputy director of the regional finance department, explained the progress in appraising the fixed assets and circulating funds of enterprises in the region. The main achievements of the conference are: First, increasing the awareness. After diligently studying Executive Vice Chairman Yang Chuantang's important speech and other relevant documents, the conferees renewed, deepened, and increased their awareness of the necessity of accelerating the pace of reforms and the urgency of strengthening the intensity of reform. At present, along with the continual deepening of reforms and growth of the economy, deep- rooted contradictions in the regional economic system have gradually surfaced. To solve these contradictions and problems, reform is the only way out and regression will absolutely lead us nowhere. Second, grasping the policy. Through study, discussion, and exchange of views, the conferees understood comprehensively the ideology for guiding reform in the region, which calls for "overall promotion and breakthrough in key areas" and for "converging with the whole nation in terms of framework and system." Third, clarifying the tasks. The conferees clearly defined the "three key areas and six major tasks" of reform for this year. Fourth, enhancing the confidence. Officials from all comprehensive economic departments and departments in charge of enterprises pledged to transform functions, delegate authority to enterprises, and eliminate red tape for them in accordance with the principle of separating government administration from enterprise management so as to give rein to enterprises to develop themselves. For their part, representatives from enterprises said specific and preferential reform measures, which have proved effective for improving the external environment of enterprises and invigorating their internal vitality, will definitely promote the comprehensive growth of enterprises. Vice Chairman Ciren Zhuoga put forward a five-point requirement for implementing the conference guidelines: First, it is necessary to earnestly study, comprehend, and transmit the conference guideline. [passage omitted] Second, it is necessary to ensure good groundwork for establishing a modern enterprise system, which is a key area of the enterprise reform in 1994.

[passage omitted] Fourth, the regional and prefectural (city) economic restructuring departments should work hard to organize and coordinate the implementation of various reform measures slated for this year. [passage omitted] Fifth, it is necessary to relentlessly carry out reform measures. [passage omitted]
