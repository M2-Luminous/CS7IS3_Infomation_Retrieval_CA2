These projects include a subway, a number of expressways, waste water treatment systems and the pulldown of dilapidated houses to build new residential areas, he said after visiting four cities -- Vienna, Paris, Berlin and Cologne earlier this month. "Only by drawing on all outstanding achievements in human civilization will it be possible for Beijing to grow faster," he said. He also pledged to draw on successful experience in urban construction of the four cities in order to turn Beijing into a "modern international metropolis" as soon as possible. He recalled that during his meetings with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Austrian Chancellor Franz Vrantzky, the two chancellors expressed full support for the expansion of cooperation between the Chinese capital and the capitals of Germany and Austria. Meanwhile, mayors of the four cities also pledged to expand cooperation with Beijing in science, technology, economy and culture, he said. Beijing signed nine cooperation agreements with companies in France and Germany during the mayor's visit, involving a total investment of nearly 300 million U.S. dollars, he said. Under these agreements, companies in Beijing and their counterparts in France and Germany will co-produce cans, machine tools, electrical appliances, pharmaceuticals and adhesives. Government statistics show that Germany, France and Austria have invested 270 million U.S. dollars in 138 joint ventures in Beijing.
