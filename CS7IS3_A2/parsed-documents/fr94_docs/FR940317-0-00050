SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a companion release, the Commission is proposing rule amendments that prohibit a broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer from underwriting a municipal issue unless the issuer agrees to disseminate information to the secondary market and from recommending the purchase of a municipal security without reviewing such information. I. Executive Summary The recent high volume of municipal securities offerings, as well as the growing ownership of municipal securities by individual investors, has highlighted the need for improved disclosure practices in the municipal securities market, particularly in the secondary market. To encourage and expedite the ongoing efforts by market participants to improve disclosure practices, and to assist market participants in meeting their obligations under the antifraud provisions, the Commission is publishing its views with respect to disclosures under the federal securities laws in the municipal market. This interpretive release addresses the following: (1) With respect to primary offering disclosure, despite the significant improvement in disclosure practices in recent years as a result of voluntary initiatives, increased attention needs to be directed at •Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest and material financial relationships among issuers, advisers and underwriters, including those arising from political contributions; •Disclosure regarding the terms and risks of securities being offered; •Disclosure of the issuer's or obligor's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. This information should include audited financial statements (or disclosure that the financial statements were not subject to audit) and an explanation of the accounting principles followed in the preparation of the financial statements, unless the statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') or accompanied by a quantified explanation of any deviation from GAAP;
