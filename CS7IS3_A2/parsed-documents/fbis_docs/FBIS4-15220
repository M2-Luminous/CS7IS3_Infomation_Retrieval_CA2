Debates on the same topic the day before had yielded no results. Opposition members have failed to offer any alternative to the peace deal, our correspondent reports. At the same time, one opposition member Boris Kakubava has made an abortive attempt to bring a motion of no-confidence in Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze. In an emotional address to the house, head of the interim committee for the state of emergency Jaba Ioseliani called the opposition's bluff: "What exactly do you want? If you want war, you must say so. But if you want peace, this can be achieved by moving step by step, including agreements similar to that signed in Moscow."
