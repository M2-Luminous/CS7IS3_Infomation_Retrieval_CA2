FR940414-1-00033 FR940414-1-00010 The 1977 Amendments added Section 301(b)(2)(E) to the Act establishing BCT for discharges of conventional pollutants from existing industrial point sources. Section 304(a)(4) designated the following as conventional pollutants: Biochemical oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), fecal coliform, pH, and any additional pollutants defined by the Administrator as conventional. The Administrator designated oil and grease as an additional conventional pollutant on July 30, 1979 (44 FR 44501). BCT is not an additional limitation, but replaces BAT for the control of conventional pollutants. In addition to other factors specified in Section 304(b)(4)(B), the Act requires that BCT limitations be established in light of a two part ``cost-reasonableness'' test. American Paper Institute v. EPA, 660 F.2d 954 (4th Cir. 1981). EPA's current methodology for the general development of BCT limitations was issued in 1986 (51 FR 24974; July 9, 1986). 4. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) (Section 306 of the Act) NSPS are based on the best available demonstrated treatment technology. New plants have the opportunity to install the best and most efficient production processes and wastewater treatment technologies. As a result, NSPS should represent the most stringent numerical values attainable through the application of the best available control technology for all pollutants (i.e., conventional, nonconventional, and priority pollutants). In establishing NSPS, EPA is directed to take into consideration the cost of achieving the effluent reduction and any non-water quality environmental impacts and energy requirements. 5. Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources (PSES) (Section 307(b) of the Act) PSES are designed to prevent the discharge of pollutants that pass through, interfere with, or are otherwise incompatible with the operation of publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). The Act requires pretreatment standards for pollutants that pass through POTWs or interfere with POTWs' treatment processes or sludge disposal methods. The legislative history of the 1977 Act indicates that pretreatment standards are to be technology-based and analogous to the BAT effluent limitations guidelines for removal of toxic pollutants. For the purpose of determining whether to promulgate national category-wide pretreatment standards, EPA generally determines that there is pass-through of a pollutant and thus a need for categorical standards if the nation-wide average percent removal of a pollutant removed by well-operated POTWs achieving secondary treatment is less than the percent removed by the BAT model treatment system. The General Pretreatment Regulations, which set forth the framework for the implementation of categorical pretreatment standards, are found at 40 CFR part 403. (Those regulations contain a definition of pass-through that addresses localized rather than national instances of pass-through and does not use the percent removal comparison test described above. See 52 FR 1586, January 14, 1987.) 6. Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS) (Section 307(b) of the Act) Like PSES, PSNS are designed to prevent the discharges of pollutants that pass through, interfere with, or are otherwise incompatible with the operation of POTWs. PSNS are to be issued at the same time as NSPS. New indirect dischargers, like the new direct dischargers, have the opportunity to incorporate into their plants the best available demonstrated technologies. The Agency considers the same factors in promulgating PSNS as it considers in promulgating NSPS. B. Section 304(m) Requirements and Litigation Section 304(m) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(m)), added by the Water Quality Act of 1987, requires EPA to establish schedules for (i) reviewing and revising existing effluent limitations guidelines and standards (``effluent guidelines''), and (ii) promulgating new effluent guidelines. On January 2, 1990, EPA published an Effluent Guidelines Plan (55 FR 80), in which schedules were established for developing new and revised effluent guidelines for several industry categories. One of the industries for which the Agency established a schedule was the Pesticide Chemicals category. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (NRDC) and Public Citizen, Inc., challenged the Effluent Guidelines Plan in a suit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ( NRDC et al v. Reilly, Civ. No. 89&hyph;2980). The plaintiffs charged that EPA's plan did not meet the requirements of sec. 304(m). A Consent Decree in this litigation was entered by the Court on January 31, 1992. The terms of the Consent Decree are reflected in the Effluent Guidelines Plan published on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41000). This plan requires, among other things, that EPA propose effluent guidelines for the formulating, packaging and repackaging subcategories of the Pesticide Chemicals category by January, 1994 and take final action on these effluent guidelines by August, 1995. EPA filed a motion with the court in November, 1993 requesting an extension of time until March 31, 1994, for the EPA Administrator to sign the proposed regulation.
