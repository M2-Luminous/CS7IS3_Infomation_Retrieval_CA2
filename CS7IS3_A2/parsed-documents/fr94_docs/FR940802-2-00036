FR940802-2-00036 FR940802-2-00030 I. Jurisdiction The procedural regulations of the DOE set forth general guidelines by which the Office of Hearings and Appeals may formulate and implement a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. It is the DOE policy to use the Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals to fashion procedures to distribute refunds obtained as part of consent orders, see Office of Enforcement , 9 DOE ¶82,553 (1982); Office of Enforcement , 9 DOE ¶82,508 (1981); Office of Enforcement , 8 DOE ¶82,597 (1981). As we stated in the Proposed Decision, we have determined that a Subpart V proceeding is an appropriate method for distributing the Telum consent order fund. Therefore, we will grant the ERA's petition and assume jurisdiction over distribution of the fund. III. Refund Procedures A. Refund Claimant In the Proposed Decision, we determined that insofar as possible the consent order fund should be distributed to the customer of Telum who was injured by the alleged overcharges. Salt River, the only Telum customer who made purchases during the consent order period that were covered by the PRO and Amended PRO, is the only Telum customer we identified as likely to have been injured by the alleged overcharges. Although the Telum consent order covers all sales of ``covered products'' by Telum for the period December 1, 1973 through April 30, 1974, the ERA audit files, the PRO, and the Amended PRO are all based only on sales by Telum to Salt River. The consent order, while lacking in specificity, was clearly arrived at in order to settle this one outstanding enforcement issue. We are thus able to use the information contained in the audit files for guidance as to the identity of Telum's injured customer and the extent of the alleged overcharges, as we have done in some prior refund proceedings. See, e.g. , Howard Oil Co. , 15 DOE ¶85,072 (1986). Consequently, we are establishing a claims procedure in which Salt River may apply for a refund equal to the entire consent order fund. Limiting the universe of applicants to Salt River allows us to fashion a refund plan that will correspond most closely to the alleged overcharges settled by the consent order. See Consumers Oil Co. , 13 DOE ¶85,226 (1985); Marion Corp. , 12 DOE ¶85,014 (1984). In prior refund proceedings, in order to receive a full refund, claimants whose prices for goods and services are regulated by a governmental body, e.g., a public utility, have not been required to provide a detailed showing of injury. See, e.g. , Dorchester Gas Corp. , 14 DOE ¶85,240 at 88,451 (1986). Instead, regulated firms have been required to (i) Certify that they will pass any refund received through to their customers, (ii) provide us with a full explanation of how they plan to accomplish the restitution, and (iii) certify that they will notify the appropriate regulatory body of the receipt of the refund. Id. These requirements are based on the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm, any overcharges would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should be passed through to its customers. We have been informed by Salt River that the nature of its business is that of a municipal public power utility whose rates for electricity are set by a publicly-elected Board of Directors (i.e., a governmental body). See Memorandum of April 29, 1994 Telephone Conversation between John Egan, Spokesperson for Salt River, and Andrew Beckwith, OHA Staff Analyst. We have determined, therefore, that Salt River is a regulated firm as that category is defined above. See City of Lubbock , 18 DOE ¶85,116 (1988). Accordingly, we have determined that Salt River, as a regulated firm, need not make a showing that it was injured by the alleged overcharges. However, Salt River will be required to comply with the stipulations outlined above that are incumbent upon regulated firms when submitting an Application for Refund. B. Calculation of Refund Amount As stated above, the ERA audit files identify Salt River as the Telum customer injured by the alleged overcharges that were the subject of the consent order. In the Proposed Decision, we indicated our intention to find Salt River eligible for the entire amount of the consent order fund as restitution for the alleged overcharges. We received no comments in opposition to this proposal and therefore shall adopt it. In addition, Salt River will be eligible to receive all of the interest that has accrued on the consent order fund. C. Application for Refund Procedures An Application for Refund may now be filed by Salt River. Salt River's Application must be postmarked within 90 days after publication of this Decision and Order in the Federal Register . See 10 C.F.R. §205.286. The application must be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of Salt River, and specify that it pertains to the Telum, Inc. consent order fund, Case No. LEF&hyph;0114. Salt River's Application for Refund must be filed in duplicate. A copy of the application will be available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC. If Salt River believes that its application contains confidential information, it must so indicate on the first page of its application and submit two additional copies of its application from which the information that it claims is confidential has been deleted, together with a statement specifying why any such information is privileged or confidential. The application must also indicate whether the applicant or any person acting on its instructions has filed or intends to file any other application or claim of whatever nature regarding the matters at issue in the underlying Telum enforcement proceeding. Salt River must also certify that it is not related to Telum, the consent order firm. The application must include the following statement: ``I swear (or affirm) that the information submitted is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.'' See 10 CFR 205.283(c); 18 USC 1001. Furthermore, Salt River should furnish us with the name, title, and telephone number of a person who may be contacted by the OHA for additional information concerning the application. In addition, Salt River's employer identification number and current address must be listed in the application. The application should be sent to: Telum, Inc. Consent Order Refund Proceeding, Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC 20585. As indicated above, Salt River should also: (i) Certify that it will pass any refund received through to its customers, (ii) provide us with a full explanation of how it plans to accomplish the restitution, and (iii) certify that it will notify the appropriate regulatory body of the receipt of the refund. In the event that Salt River does not file a refund application that meets the requirements set forth in this Decision and Order, the funds in the Telum consent order account shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and any refined product pool funds in the Telum consent order escrow account that the OHA determines will not be used to effect direct restitution to Salt River will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA. It Is Therefore Ordered That: (1) An Application for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department of Energy by Telum, Inc. pursuant to the consent order executed on May 30, 1990, may now be filed. (2) The application must be postmarked no later than 90 days after publication of this Decision and Order in the Federal Register . Dated: July 25, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18780 Filed 8&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
