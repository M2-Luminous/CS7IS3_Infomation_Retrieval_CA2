Hayim Ramon's move did more than threaten the Labor's hegemony in the Histadrut; it left a vacant space at the top, a space that has to be filled, a space that causes great apprehension in the party. All triggers have been released, and some people are standing with live grenades in hand, waiting for the next move before deciding where they should be hurled. As cabinet member, Ramon represented the party young generation's hunger for privileges and for a role in the making of momentous decisions. Ramon, who was 42 when he was first appointed minister, was the white hope of the young guard, for whom he was a model to be emulated. Now his place at the big table is vacant. The young party members are convinced that one of them should occupy it. The middle generation members believe it is time one of theirs joined the leading team. And Rabin? Apparently he has made no commitment to anyone. He listens to everyone, nods his head, and does whatever he pleases. The prime minister's bureau has been a scene of pilgrimage in the past two weeks. 'Uzi Bar'am, Nisim Zvili, Avrum [Avraham] Burg, and Hagay Merom all met with him at their request. The list may have been longer. They all spoke of the need to appoint a young Labor minister. Rumor has it that Zvili actually prodded Rabin. Failure to appoint a member of the young guard at once would be a mistake, he said. With Zvili as the initiator, the move needs to be thoroughly examined. Seasoned politicians explain that such a move will create facts on the ground, barring Ramon from returning to the government after the Histadrut [Labor Federation] elections. The occupied seat will signal to Ramon something along the lines of the famous adage that "graveyards are filled with people who thought they were indispensable...." Rabin listened and nodded. The conversation, we are told, proceeded as follows: Zvili: "If you are asking me, you should act quickly and get someone from the Ramon bunch into the government." Rabin: "Who?" Zvili: "There is no shortage of candidates: Beilin, Burg, Merom. You have two vacant seats." Rabin: "Is that your suggestion?" Zvili: "Yes, it is." Bar'am had a similar suggestion. Rabin remained uncommitted. In any event, he said, it is irrelevant until after the Histadrut elections. Burg and Merom apparently asked to be placed at the forefront of the group vying for the vacated slot. Burg, who is working around the clock for the Histadrut election campaign in Jerusalem -- he heads their public relations -- this week released a statement to the press proposing to stay off the issue, because this is not the right time. However, at the end of the statement he mentions -- supposedly by the way -- that when they do get to discussing the issue, they should remember the results of the primaries. Explanation for the uninitiated: In the primaries, Avrum Burg made the third slot, right after Rabin and Peres. When Rabin was composing his cabinet, Burg considered himself a natural candidate for ministerial appointment. Rabin had a different opinion. Burg should mellow a bit, grow up a bit, he said. Burg, a Peres man who has never received real promotion from him, was offended, but continued running. Now he thinks it is time the IOU was paid. Burg will be impeded by his recent announcement that he was competing for the job of the Jewish Agency chairman. He made frequent statements about how important and interesting the job was. Now he says: "Being a minister is still more interesting in these critical times. If I have to choose between the two, I would prefer to be minister. Yes, I believe the primaries results are consequential. If they decide to appoint Edri, they will find me there [not further specified]." The key of coalition appointments stipulates one minister per three Knesset members [MK's]. The faction had 44 MK's and rated 15 ministers. Now, after Ramon's "secession," it rates only 14 ministers. But even now, it is two ministers short. Rabin still holds five portfolios: prime minister, defense, interior, religious affairs, and health. He is reserving the religious affairs and interior for SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim]. Defense is run by him and by Mordekhay Gur. That leaves him with the health portfolio, although another appointment is possible, particularly in view of the fact that some ministers have two portfolios. There is an opinion that since Rabin does not feel obligated to anyone, he may appoint an outside professional, thereby closing the affair. If he does that, there will be backlash from party members. Justifiably, they are looking for appointments. Five MK's feel they deserve it, some more, some less: Yosi Beilin, Avrum Burg, Hagay Merom, Rafi Edri, and Efrayim Sne. Beilin, the deputy foreign minister who has been doing an excellent job, does not like being presented as a candidate. He is happy, and he is not even certain that Peres will fight for him now, in view of the recent tension between them. On the other hand, he will not decline a ministerial appointment, if offered one. Even if it is the health portfolio. His appointment will depend on Peres. Rumors have it that Rabin does not like him, but he thinks very highly of him and is not ruling out his candidacy altogether. "No one has told me anything, and I do not think it is relevant at the moment," Beilin says. Peres' position on the case of Burg is equally unclear. Peres is today a solitary cabinet minister, the sole member of his own camp, after Shahal, whose appointment Peres had warmly encouraged, has long ago wandered off in the direction of Rabin. As for Burg, it is being said that Peres had provided him with a springboard, but the moment his back was turned, Peres snatched away the pool. Hagay Merom, a member of Kibbutz Yif'at which belongs to the United Kibbutzim Movement [UKM], once fought for a ministerial appointment, but Rabin preferred Tzur, although the latter had not been elected to the Knesset. Merom was offended, and a short while later, he attacked Rabin from the Knesset podium, calling on him to restrain the functionaries at the Prime Minister's Office. The prevailing opinion is that Rabin does not trust him, and in addition, he has no reason to appoint another UKM member. Merom: "I do not take the various statements about me seriously, and I have no claims on a place around the cabinet table. I like it in the Knesset, and I like it in a situation where I am free to voice my views -- even when they are against the government -- without the constraints of ministerial responsibility. But, I appreciate my colleagues' thinking I should be minister." Efrayim Sne, too, was once a Peres man. However, he quit at the last minute of the struggle between Peres and Rabin. I think Rabin is more suitable, he said then. Peres does neither forgive nor forget. Whenever Sne's name is mentioned for a possible government position -- and it has been mentioned for a variety of jobs -- Peres vetoes it. Perhaps this time Rabin will persist. Sne's training as a doctor could be to his credit when the candidate for the job of health minister is considered. Speculations are that given the choice between Beilin, Burg, Merom, and Sne Rabin will choose the latter. Incidentally, Sne met Peres last week and asked him to withdraw his opposition to his inclusion in the government, either as a deputy minister or as a minister. Peres replied: "Why should you be appointed before Beilin or Burg?" Peres had a similar reply about Rafi Edri's candidacy. Edri, a minister without portfolio in the unity government, walks around with a promise in his pocket from Rabin to appoint him as a minister. The promise was given to him before Ramon dropped his bombshell, when Edri finessed the resumption of relations with SHAS. Rabin had then planned to ask the Labor Central Committee to approve the return to the government of Ramon -- who resigned due to the party convention's resolutions -- along with the appointment of Edri as minister without portfolio. The double deal was meant to soften the blow for those who feel that the younger generation is not sufficiently represented. Now, everything has changed. Rabin may not be able to make good on his promise to Edri, which some term "a solid promise that holds more than water." The problem could be solved if the prime minister had the guts to make the move he ought to make: "rid" the government of David Liba'i and Shim'on Shetrit, two law professors who get on his nerves. Then he would have three or four vacancies, which would enable him to appoint a few young men as ministers and be seen as a leader grooming Labor's next generation, as Begin and Shamir did in the Likud. However, Rabin is not built that way. He would rather leave people in the lurch and make them leave of their own volition. The point is, however, that Liba'i and Shetrit have no plans to go. Under certain circumstances one might consider the possibility of Ramon himself returning to the government. However, such a scenario may only be examined after the Histadrut elections, and only if Ramon fails to head the largest faction. According to one scenario, under such conditions Ramon would transfer his votes to Labor in exchange for a seat around the government able. This will create a problem. Ramon was expelled from Labor, and if he is appointed minister he will no longer be able to run in the Knesset elections. People will say he already got his reward. On this point, Labor is holding him by the throat. Ramon's friends claim that he will return to Labor only through the front door; that is, if he wins the Histadrut elections and is appointed its secretary general. Then, however, Ramon will stay as secretary general and there will be a vacant seat around the government table. Zvili: "The issue is not on the agenda. Everything will be dealt with after the Histadrut elections and SHAS' return to the coalition. I did not make any recommendations to the prime minister as to whom he should appoint. That is his call. I told him that as soon as he makes up his mind I will help him get his decision approved by all the party institutions." Meanwhile, the expected appointments have become the hottest topic of conversation in the Knesset cafeteria. Everybody is stirring the pot, appointing, and making doomsday predictions. And what about Rabin? He is tensely awaiting the results of the Histadrut elections. He has put all the ingredients in the pot, and it remains to be seen whether Ramon will spoil his broth.
