All major economic targets were reached or overfulfilled. In an important step, the socioeconomic situation was put under control. Political stabilization was maintained. Our external relations were broadened. Vietnam's reputation in the world was heightened. The achievements recorded in 1993 and previous years created a momentum for the country to develop in the following years. However, our economy still has many weaknesses. Many urgent cultural and social issues have not been solved in an efficient manner. The evil practices of waste, corruption, and smuggling is still prevalent. Order and discipline in economic and social management are still not firm enough. Based on that situation and the new requirements, the National Assembly resolves that the main duties and targets for 1994 will be as follows: 1. Orientations and Duties for 1994 and Following Years: We must strengthen all recorded achievements, carry out the first step of industrialization and modernization, and grasp opportunities to accelerate our economic development rate in order to move our country on to a new developing stage. At the same time, we must make important cultural and social changes, intensify the fight against corruption and smuggling, maintain political stabilization, broaden external relations, and protect our national independence, sovereignty, and integrity. 2. Main Targets in 1994: General domestic production will increase by eight percent. General industrial output and agricultural production will increase by 11 percent and four percent respectively. Food production will be 25 million tons. Exports will increase by 20 percent. The inflation rate must be below 10 percent. The rate of population growth must be lowered by 0.06 percent. The National Assembly Resolution outlines the major duties and measures to be executed in 1994: 1. The Economy: A. Agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture must be comprehensively developed together with the development of their respective processing industries. All production, business, and service activities must be accelerated in a diversified manner in cities and rural areas. In 1994 we must carry out the granting of land as regulated by the law. External economic activities must be intensified, especially the export sector. We have to replace imported products with those that can be produced locally; we have to limit the import of nonessential goods, and efficiently protect local production. We must restore, upgrade, and construct our material and social infrastructure and selectively build some heavy industrial establishments in key sectors. B. We must practice thrift in production and consumption to save money for development investment and improve the productivity, quality, and efficiency of our business and production.
