On 7 April, Dominican Vice Chancellor Fabio Herrera Cabral criticized the idea of sending UN observers to the Dominican Republic border. Vice Chancellor Fabio Herrera Cabral said that to post foreign observers on both sides of the border would be an insult to national sovereignty. He added, however, that the Dominican Government would be agreeable to accepting observers if they were recruited from among the Dominican population. Mr. Fabio Herrera Cabral was reacting to statements by a UN spokesman raising the possibility of observing the behavior of Dominican authorities from the border with Haiti. It should be pointed out that over the past few days the Dominican Government was subjected to severe criticism because of its ambiguous attitude toward the embargo, especially its providing gasoline and gas oil to the Republic of Haiti.
