Hoar, commander of [as published] chief of the US central command, has by now become a frequent visitor in Pakistan who is treated with somewhat greater deference than what is shown for generals from elsewhere. He is here again on what may be his umpteenth visit, going through an almost unchanging itinerary. This includes not only a junket throughout the country inspecting the military installations but calling on the state functionaries including the President. The frequency of his visits suggest this is no mere courtesy call but a routine function of his responsibilities as the C-in-C [Commander in Chief] of a command which covers the region Pakistan is in. No government has ever given any explanation for the regularity of the General's visits and it is needless to expect the present regime to do so. Military matters of this nature are still obscured by a sort of an information denial system and little is ever known of such issues till much later when comment becomes redundant. However, in the present circumstances, there is need to quantify the American General's visit as it comes at a time when there has been no change in Washington's policy towards Islamabad. Although Pakistan just escaped by a hair's breadth from being put on the black list of the states accused of aiding terrorism, it is still in a grey area, a kind of a limbo, as far as relations with America are concerned. None of the stringent curbs imposed as a result of the Pressler amendment have been lifted, nor has the State Department relented from raising the bogey of nuclear weapons, supposedly stashed away in Pakistan. To all intents and purposes, this country remains out in the cold waiting with consummate patience to be returned to the good graces of the United States. Against this background, General Hoar's visit arouses even greater curiosity that needs to be cleared away. As Pakistan is no longer the recipient of any kind of American military aid nor any of the security pacts are operative that once linked the two states, it is intriguing why should the General be here so often and under what sort of understanding the joint US-Pak military exercises are being held. These two queries must also be seen in the light of Islamabad's increasing concern over the apparent American leniency towards India on the nuclear issue and its hardline policy towards Pakistan. It makes no sense that Islamabad should remain involved in a bizarre love hate linkage with Washington, which neither holds any gilt-edged guarantee of better times ahead nor allows taking up other options. This policy has been pursued by all the governments after the bonanza of American munificence resulting from the "Afghan jehad" gradually dried up. Even the Nawaz Sharif regime, which made a fetish of its self-proclaimed "independent" policy and doing away with the "crutches" of aid, never really got out of this Catch-22 situation. General Hoar was then just as much a regular visitor as now. In fact no government has ever thought of charting out a brave new policy or will do so, specially in the present unipolar world. It is quite likely the vague policy of waiting for America to issue us a certificate of fitness, after Islamabad has done its best to clear away the doubts, will continue.
