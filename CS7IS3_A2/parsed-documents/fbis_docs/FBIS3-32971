In 1990, the face value of the country's foreign debt was 30 percent; in 1993 it surpassed 82 percent. Between 1991 and 1993 Costa Rica paid $1.525 billion in principal and interest on its foreign debt, thereby lowering the burden of its foreign debt. Central Bank President Jorge Corrales believes this is the result of appropriate macroeconomic policies. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 1 Feb 94 p 24A)
