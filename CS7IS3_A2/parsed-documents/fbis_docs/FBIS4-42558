Kiriakidhis] [Text] The day before yesterday, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis held a protest meeting with the ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members. The meeting is considered to be the first step in a plan to promote the Cypriot Government's new policy. The policy is being formulated in view of the prospects and options included in UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report. According to reliable information I MAKHI has received, the meeting was considered necessary in order to prevent negative situations in the future, such as a possible return to the confidence-building measures [CBM's] scheme. The Cypriot Government made it clear that it strongly opposes such an eventuality. The meeting with the ambassadors was held immediately after the National Council meeting at which all the members of the body said they are intensely concerned with the (negative) U.S. intention to bring back the old set of ideas and CBM's (based on the Vienna talks and the U.S. promises). They especially stressed the dangers of this move in view of the expected UN Security Council resolution. The United States plays an important role in the resolution. According to the same information, Mikhailidhis warned the ambassadors, who represent permanent members of the Security Council, that if there is no tangible evidence that the Turkish side has shown signs of goodwill, the Greek side will not participate in any dialogue. The foreign minister also referred to two points of the UN secretary general's report: 1) Butrus-Ghali's note that the lack of an agreement on the Cyprus issue is due to the "lack of political will both by the Turkish Cypriot leadership and the region outside of Cyprus (Turkey)." 2) The UN secretary general's position that no discussion on the CBM's (even if the 21 March document is modified) or the substance of the Cyprus issue will bear fruit if the lack of goodwill by the Turkish side is not rectified. Mikhailidhis stressed to the "five" that any pressure on the Greek Cypriot side to accept any discussion will be fruitless, because this is a unanimous decision of the country's political leadership. Answering a relevant question after the conclusion of the National Council meeting, President Glavkos Kliridhis said: "Some countries may believe that despite what the UN secretary general says, resuming the procedure might bear fruit. But, both sides must agree on this, because there can be no negotiations with just one side. Therefore, it will depend on us whether the talks will continue or not." According to other information I MAKHI received, the second step in implementing the new policy will be taken up today at the foreign minister's meeting with his Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, in Moscow. Meanwhile, the Turks are trying to stop the Greece-Cyprus efforts to promote Cyprus' application for membership in the European Union [EU] and will launch an official campaign in European capitals on 15 June. [Akyon] Dogan, Turkish minister in the Prime Minister's Office, will be in charge of the campaign and will try to avert an EU decision on Cyprus' application at the Corfu summit. Serge Abou, the EU observer to the Cyprus issue, will submit a report to the EU Council of Ministers on 13 June on developments in Cyprus. The Cyprus issue is expected to be discussed at the EU summit.
