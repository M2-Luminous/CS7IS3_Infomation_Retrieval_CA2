He began his business career at the age of 23 as general manager of a building contracting firm and in 1961 founded the Cantieri Riuniti Milanesi construction company. Two years later he founded Edilnord, which in five years planned and built a 4,000 unit housing center in Brugherio, on the outskirts of Milan. His second major project was Milano 2, for 10,000 inhabitants, designed and begun in 1972. It was followed by Milano 3 (for 12,000 inhabitants) in 1976. Also in 1976, Berlusconi joined the shareholders of the Milan daily, IL GIORNALE and later became its publisher. He is also 100 percent owner of TV SORRISI E CANZONI, Italy's best selling magazine. In 1978 Berlusconi ventured further into the communications field by opening the Canale 5 private television channel in Milan, extending his network nationwide and purchasing two other major channels in 1980, Rete 4 and Italia 1. Meanwhile he erected Il Girasole in 1979, the largest market center for wholesale traders in Europe. In 1988 he bought a 25 percent stake in Amef, the company which controlled the Mondadori publishing group, and in 1990 he became chairman of Mondadori. He also owns 25 percent of La Cinq, the first commercial television network in France and is president of the European Consortium for Commercial Television (ACT) in Brussels. His bid to enter the French television world in 1984 proved difficult and finally collapsed in 1989, but he had more success in Spain where he bought up a 25 percent stake in Antenna 3 in 1989. Berlusconi is also a committee member of Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] and since 1986 is president and owner of the first division AC Milan soccer team, which this year won its third consecutive National League title. Berlusconi in the 1980's found himself dragged into the scandal over the outlawed Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge, of which he was a member. He denied ever having played an active role in the lodge, but found himself charged with perjury in connection with the inquiries. The late 1980's also saw him doing battle with the RAI state broadcasting company which sued him for unfair competition and unauthorised use of nationwide live broadcasting. The issue was settled with a new broadcasting law which many saw as tailor-made for the Milan magnate. According to his detractors, Berlusconi's close personal friendship with disgraced Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi, who was premier when the new broadcasting law was being drawn up, smoothed Berlusconi's path in mass media. His awards include the 1977 Knight of the Order of Labor Merit of the Italian Republic and has been a member of the board of the Teatro Manzoni theatrical company in Milan. Berlusconi has handed over management functions of his Fininvest empire but still retains 100 percent ownership. The group is Italy's third largest private enterprise. Fedele Confalonieri is the new chairman of Fininvest, which operates in the television, advertising, publishing, supermarket, insurance and building sectors, generating net earnings of 10.5 trillion lire (6.2 billion dollars) in 1992. Fininvest announced earlier this month it planned to reduce its stake in Mondadori to less than 50 percent. Berlusconi has created his party, Forza Italia (Go Italy), less than three months before the March 27 elections. Alfredo Biondi -- Justice A qualified solicitor and law graduate, Alfredo Biondi, 66, was born in Pisa and is currently based in Genoa. He first entered Parliament as a candidate for the Liberal Party (PLI) in 1968, and remained as such until just before the March 27-28 1994 elections when he ran successfully for the small conservative Center Union (UDC), grouping most of the ex-Liberals. In 1981 Biondi became part of the parliamentary inquiry commission on terrorism in Italy and was thus involved in the investigation of Aldo Moro's murder by the Red Brigades in 1978. He also served as minister for European affairs in 1982 and has held posts on numerous committees such as constitutional affairs, justice, and more recently on laws reforming parliamentary immunity. He was deputy speaker of the Senate in the last legislature. Within the Liberal Party Biondi maintained a high profile becoming national vice-secretary and later national secretary of the party.t Raffaele Costa -- Health Raffaele Costa, 47, is a lawyer, journalist and editor of IL DUEMILA (2000) magazine. He was health minister in the Amato government and transport minister under Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. He entered parliament in 1976 and has remained in the Lower House ever since. Besides his ministerial posts, Costa has served as undersecretary several times, at the Justice, Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Public Works Ministries. Costa is famous for his battles against extravagance and waste in the public sector. Lamberto Dini -- Treasury Lamberto Dini was born in Florence in 1931, obtained a degree in economics from Florence University and attended post-graduate school at the University of Minnesota and at Michigan University. He obtained a Stringher scholarship from the Bank of Italy and a Fulbright scholarship from the United States government, as well as a research fellowship from the Ford Foundation. In May 1959 he entered the International Monetary Fund as an economist and worked his way through the ranks until becoming central co-director for African affairs. Dini became director general of the Bank of Italy in 1979 and is also a board member of the Italian Exchange Office, chairman of the deputies of the Group of Ten and a member of three OECD Economic Policy committees. He is on the European Union's Monetary Committee and has represented Italy as a substitute for the central bank chief at meetings of the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Center for Monetary and Banking Studies in Geneva. Dini's wife, Donatella Zingone, founded the Zeta industrial group in Costa Rica and is considered one of the richest people in the Central American country. Francesco D'Onofrio -- Education Francesco D'Onofrio, 54, belongs to the right-wing Christian Democratic Centre, which broke away from the Christian Democratic Party when it became the Popular Party. D'Onofrio teaches law at Rome University. He joined the Christian democrats in 1977 and worked as a consultant for the Higher Council of Public Administration from 1977 to 1981. He worked in the state-run departments of local administrations and of institutional policies between 1982 and 1989 and was a top party official in Rome from 1986 to 1988. He was elected to the Senate in June 1983 and has been a member of several commissions, including Constitutional Affairs, Broadcasting and Institutional Reforms. With three other former Christian Democrats, D'Onofrio set up the Christian Democratic Centre, but stood with Forza Italia for the proportional sector of the Lower House vote. Giuliano Ferrara -- Relations With the Parliament Best known for his one-man political comment show which has run since 1989 on the Fininvest-owned channel Canale 5, Ferrara is a prominent public figure with a long involvement in media and politics. Since 1989 he has been a member of the European Parliament where he was elected as an independent on the Socialist ticket but recently announced his intention to withdraw his candidacy for the June elections. He also served on European Parliament commissions on youth, culture, media, education and citizens' rights. The son of a Communist Party member, Ferrara, 42, was active with the Communists until 1980 when he turned his attention to journalism and to the Socialists, becoming a close acquaintance of then-Socialist leader and Premier Bettino Craxi. He worked as political commentator for the late-night RAI-2 news in the mid '80s and, after his lucrative move to the Berlusconi network, as anchorman for various, sometimes stormy current affairs programs on Fininvest's Canale 5 and Italia 1. He writes a regular column for Italy's biggest-selling daily CORRIERE DELLA SERA. He was born in Rome, where he still lives with his wife Anselma Dell'Olio. Publio Fiori -- Transport Publio Fiori, 56, a Rome lawyer, has a long history with the Christian Democratic Party but in the March vote was elected on a National Alliance ticket. He taught at university and worked as a state lawyer, becoming a public works officer before being appointed president of the party's advisory council and member of the regional management board.

He was elected to the national parliament in 1979 with the Christian Democrats and has held posts in several parliamentary commissions, the last being Finance and Tax Registry.

Domenico Fisichella -- Cultural Heritage Domenico Fisichella, 59, a senator elected with National Alliance, was born in Messina, Sicily, and is a lecturer in political science at Rome University, and at the private Luiss University, also in the capital. He is an editorial columnist for the Rome conservative daily, IL TEMPO, where he has repeatedly asserted that "in democracies there is a constant temptation toward a perversion of plurality, toward an excess of plurality." Fisichella is an outspoken monarchist. Vito Gnutti -- Industry Businessman Vito Gnutti, 55, was born near the northern city of Brescia and in the 1970s owned a steel factory with plants in Brescia and Milan. The company failed and in 1986 Gnutti bought Silexport, specializing in rifle barrels. Gnutti, a long-standing member of the Lombard region's industrialists' association, describes his past political ideas as varied and said he "also" voted for non-disgraced former Socialist Party chief Bettino Craxi, "when I thought it was right to do so." He is a member of the Confindustria national board. Lured into politics by Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi, Gnutti was first elected to the Lower House in April 1992. He received 52 percent of the vote in his Val Trompia constituency in last March's elections. Gianni Letta -- Cabinet Undersecretary Gianni Letta, who announced earlier on Tuesday [10 May] that he gave up his post as Fininvest deputy president two days ago, worked as a publishing and broadcasting executive for Berlusconi's group from May 1987, when he became vice chairman of Fininvest Comunicazioni and board member of the group's supermarket and department store chain, Standa. Before joining Fininvest, Letta's career was at the conservative Rome daily, IL TEMPO, where he rose from simple reporter in his early 20s to board member, then a top editor. Letta's career at IL TEMPO ended abruptly when he confessed to having received 300 billion lire (187 million dollars) in bribes from the state-owned IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] colossus. Letta has always claimed the money, handed to him by Italstat chairman Ettore Bernabei, was part of a "promotional campaign" and a totally legitimate affair. Letta was also anchorman for the current affairs television show, "Italia Domanda" ("Italy Asks") broadcast by one of the three Fininvest networks. Born at Avezzano in the Abruzzi 59 years ago, he comes from a family of lawyers. Roberto Maroni -- Interior Roberto Maroni, 39, is the Northern League whip in the Lower House. He is viewed as the right hand man of party chief Umberto Bossi, and is the federalist movement's chief negotiator. He was born in the northern town of Varese, where he has a lawyer's practice. He is married, with two small children. Maroni began his political activity with Bossi in 1979 and was one of the founding members of the Northern League. He is provincial secretary for the Northern League in Varese and a member of the Lombard League's national council. In 1990 Maroni was elected to his home town's city council and was first elected to parliament in the Lower House in April 1992. He was a member of the constitutional affairs, interior and cabinet office parliamentary committees. Maroni led negotiations that created the League's two-way electoral alliance with Forza Italia in the north of Italy, and has stood in for Bossi more than once in talks with coalition partners. Antonio Martino -- Foreign Affairs Antonio Martino, 51, an economist who studied at Chicago University under free-trade guru Milton Friedman, heads the political science faculty at Rome's private Luiss University. The son of Gaetano Martino, the Liberal Party vice secretary who in the 1950s was education and foreign minister and among the signatories of the Treaty of Rome, Antonio Martino began his political career with the Liberals, standing for election to that party's secretariat in 1988. In December 1993 he moved closer to electoral reform champion Mario Segni, signing an appeal for a strong alternative party to the Democratic Party of the Left and for Segni to become premier. Later he became involved in the Forza Italia experiment, acting as one of Berlusconi's top economic advisers during the March election campaign. He is the author of Berlusconi's 30 percent flat tax rate proposal, to be compensated by a new system of taxable income declared. Since being tipped as foreign minister, Martino has taken steps to reverse his reputation as an anti-European Thatcherite, calling for a "monetary constitution" to forge economic and monetary union in the EU [European Union]. Unveiling his policy-thinking in a recent interview, Martino said that Italy would "never again be a European Cinderella." "Slovenliness and unmet deadlines have made us lose face in Europe," he said, striking three keynotes in the defence of human rights, a war on national selfishness (meaning firm antiprotectionism in foreign trade policy), and "transparency" with the United States. He said these were all elements that broke with the "muddle along" approach he attributed to past governments. As foreign minister, Martino intends to pay his first visits to the United States and Israel where, he said recently, "they have a very negative image of our coalition." Clemente Mastella -- Labor Clemente Mastella, 47, was born in Benevento, near Naples, and joined the Christian Democratic Party early in his youth. He graduated from university with a degree in philosophy and worked as a journalist for RAI in Naples, later becoming head of information and publishing for the Christian Democratic Party. He was first elected to the Lower House in 1976 and has been there ever since, joining a variety of commissions and becoming undersecretary for Defense under Premier Giulio Andreotti in 1991. He has gained considerable power because of his continued role in the party's mass media and information department.

Giancarlo Pagliarini -- Budget Giancarlo Pagliarini, 52, is a certified public accountant from Milan who worked at Arthur Andersen from 1967 to 1983, when he formed his own accounting agency. Pagliarini was not active in politics before he met Umberto Bossi in 1990 and joined the Northern League. He was elected to the Senate with the party in April 1992. He is a member of the economic planning and budget commissions. Among his main contributions to the League's policies is the proposal to privatize totally the pension system and to use workers' monthly pension withholdings to pay for the pensions of retirees, and to calculate a worker's pension according to the total contributions paid during his/her working life. He also wants to give everyone education "vouchers" and let the individual choose whether to attend public or private school. He taught at Parma University and is on the board of several accounting and financial service associations, including the Miami-based International Independent Accountants Association. He was one of the founding members of the Alliance for Institutional Reforms (APRI) in 1983 and has published numerous works on taxes, accounting, financial reports and budgeting. Cesare Previti -- Defense Cesare Previti is a well-known and wealthy lawyer and Silvio Berlusconi's personal legal adviser. Born in Reggio Calabria, Previti is a former member of the neofascist Italian Social Movement and was elected to the Senate with Forza Italia in the March elections. Previti was the analyst who stirred a hornet's nest only a few weeks ago when he suggested that the judges' self-governing body, the Supreme Council of Magistrates (CSM), should "adapt to the new political reality emerging from the elections." According to Previti, the one-third of CSM members who are not judges and who in the past have been appointed by parliament (using a "proportional" system according to party size) from now on should be appointed only by the three right-wing parties forming the new government coalition. Over 1,000 magistrates have signed a petition against Previti's proposal, charging that it would undermine the political independence of the judiciary and place it in the hands of the executive. Previti is Forza Italia's Senate whip. Adriana Poli Bortone -- Agriculture Adriana Poli Bortone, 50, is from the southern town of Lecce and has been on the city council there since 1967. She joined the neofascist Italian Social Movement early on and has been a member of the party's national secretariat and executive commission.

She also is a member of the Education and Fine Arts commission and is on the party's commission for women's issues. Since 1972 she has been assistant professor of Latin literature at Lecce University. In April 1992 Poli Bortone was re-elected with the MSI, which became the National Alliance ahead of the March 28 general election, receiving more votes than any other party colleague in the Puglia region. Francesco Speroni -- Institutional Reform Francesco Speroni, 47, is a former Alitalia flight technician with a political science degree from the University of Pavia. He worked as a transport personnel consultant at the Health Ministry and was president of the Association of Flight Technicians before joining the Northern League in 1986. He was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and in 1990 was elected city councillor of Busto Arsizio, his home town near Varese. The following year he was elected a member of the Lombardy regional council.

Giuseppe Tatarella -- Post and Telecommunications, Deputy Premier Giuseppe Tatarella, 60, is a lawyer and journalist first elected to parliament in 1979 with the neofascist Italian Social Movement. A native of the southern Puglia region and one of the most powerful right-wing politicians there, he is considered one of National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini's closest aides and will "represent" the south in the premier's office. He was a member of the Justice, Public Works, Finance and Treasury, Culture, Science and Education commissions and was also a member of the joint commission on Information, Security Services and State Secrecy. He is Lower House whip for the MSI, now the National Alliance, and a member of the national secretariat. He was also among the founders of the association, Young Italy, and has held several local administration posts in his southern hometown of Bari. Roberto Maroni of the Northern League last week said of Tatarella that, "speaking with him, I feel as if I were talking to an old-time Christian Democrat."

He is also working in the Commission for Currency Reform and in two technical committees at the Finance Ministry. He is a member of the so-called Liberal Democratic Foundation, which split from the Pact for Italy after the March elections to join Berlusconi's alliance. Tremonti, however, began his political career as a Socialist and first ran unsuccessfully in the 1987 elections. He was also a consultant for then Socialist Finance Minister Rino Formica, has offices in Milan and Rome and writes commentaries for the Milan daily, CORRIERE DELLA SERA. He reportedly had a falling out with Formica, thus "fortunately" ruining his chances of being appointed head of IRI's SNAM [National Gas Pipeline Company] industrial unit (whose chairman was later put under investigation for corruption). At the end of last year Tremonti hit the spotlight with the timely publication of a book on fiscal federalism, an issue close to the heart of the Northern League, and quickly picked up by all other parties during the election campaign. One of his main theses is that revenues should shift from indirect to direct taxes.

He teaches political science and is director of the research and studies center of comparative politics at Milan's Bocconi University. Urbani, known to combine a diplomatic manner with firmness and determination, is the main architect of Forza Italia's institutional platform. According to this advocate of good government, Berlusconi's movement should be firmly anchored in the center of the nation's political spectrum and interpret a capacity for renewal in a liberal key.

During the last legislative session, Comino was on the Chamber of Deputies' committee on agriculture.
