The multipolar tendency will become more obvious. The shock wave caused by the end of the Cold War on the world situation will change from across-the-board shock in 1993 to in-depth shock in 1994. The general changes in the international situation will tend to be less violent, but local and regional turbulences will still continue. The contention for domination of affairs in the Asia-Pacific region will develop further. The multitiered economic cooperation in this region will continue mainly in the form of subregional cooperation [yi ci qu yu he zuo wei zhu 0110 2945 0575 1008 0678 0155 3634 0031], and the multilateral dialogue mechanism in Northeast Asia will become the new focus of regional security cooperation. After the Seattle meeting, the United States tried to further expand the functions of APEC, and further its effort to establish the Asia-Pacific Economic Community advocated by the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Although Japan did not object to the relevant proposals raised by the United States, it set forth certain reservations and limitations on the U.S. proposals and also covertly encouraged and supported ASEAN in confronting the United States on this issue. The ASEAN countries were opposed to the U.S.- dominated plan for Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation. After Indonesia took over the APEC chairmanship, it joined other ASEAN countries in using this advantage to slow down the pace of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation advocated by the United States. After the Seattle meeting, although economic cooperation in the Pan-Asia-Pacific region was strengthened somewhat, the APEC ministerial meeting in Seattle did not reach agreement on the final development goal and evolution pace of APEC. Moreover, various parties concerned were involved in sharp contradictions on this issue. Therefore, the Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation will not advance too fast in 1994, and the subregional and "enlarged tripartite" [zeng zhang san jiao she 1073 7022 0005 6037 1709] economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in East Asia, will come to another upsurge. After the security forum in the ASEAN region was set in motion, the United States, Japan, and Russia will gradually shift the focus of their work to the Northeast Asian security affairs that have close relations with their own interests. It is expected that the United States, Japan, and Russia will strengthen their tripartite "semiofficial security forum" on affairs in Northeast Asia, and will make an effort to create their official dialogue mechanism. At the same time, the United States, Japan, and the ROK will also gradually open the secret consultation organization for the security in Northeast Asia formed by the United States, Japan, the ROK, Canada, and Australia, and will consider including China and Russia as members in order to exchange opinions on security affairs in this region. Northeast Asia will thus become another focus of the Asia-Pacific multilateral security dialogue. The scope of contradictions between the United States, Japan, and Europe will become wider, but the focus of their frictions will shift. European and Asian affairs will be more closely linked in Western relations. In the economic field, after the end of the Uruguay Round trade talks, the contradictions between the United States, Europe, and Japan will shift to the concrete implementation of the agreement. This year, the U.S., European, and Japanese Governments will still be plagued by their domestic problems, and may adopt more protectionist measures under domestic pressure. In the political and security fields, in January, U.S. President Clinton will promote his "New Atlantic Doctrine" during his visit to Europe. The United States will try to maintain its domination over European political and security affairs and try to make NATO carry out adjustments and reforms according to its wishes. This will inevitably arouse vigilance and resentment among some West European countries. NATO's reorganization will become the main subject of the U.S.-European dispute. The U.S.-Japanese contradictions will become more prominent in the course of establishing the Asia-Pacific multilateral security mechanism. A noteworthy fact is that the United States, Europe, and Japan are all stressing the implementation of their new Asia-Pacific policy in an attempt to expand their own influence in the Asia-Pacific region and to raise their status in the West. That is, they are trying to boost their influence in Europe and America through first boosting their influence in Asia. Improving the Cooperative Mechanisms in Each's Own Region Will Remain the Task of Primary Importance of the Three Major Economic Circles of Europe, the United States, and Japan. Improving and developing their internal cooperation mechanisms, and properly handling the contradictions and problems inside their own regions will be the most pressing and also the most important task for regional economic circles in 1994. Before this task is successfully fulfilled, it is hard to carry out large-scale and intense inter-regional economic frictions and struggles. Although the Maastricht Treaty has come into force, it is hard to say whether the second-phase goal of the European Economic and Currency Union will be smoothly achieved. There remain serious differences between various EC countries on the economic policies. The struggle between unionism and the idea of safeguarding national sovereignty will become more profound and more intense in the process of integration. The general economic recession will make it hard for most EC members to meet the third-phase requirements of the economic and currency union on time. The North American Free Trade Agreement is also facing the fact that a distinct gap exists between the economies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, so it is hard to unify the specific standards. In addition, many domestic factors in the United States and Mexico are also constraining the union from extending into Latin American. It is also hard to advance economic cooperation in the Pan-Asia-Pacific region at a faster pace because of the unevenness of economic development, the differences in social systems, and the existence of complex contradictions inside this region and also because the organizational structure of regional economic cooperation is rather loose. Russia will remain the world's largest unstable factor, and the political struggle in Russia will continue. Although Russia's new constitution has been passed and the new parliament has been elected, the Russian political situation will remain uncertain and the political struggle inside the ruling clique of Russia may become more intense. At present, various political factions are involved in another round of trial of strength around the cabinet appointments and the chairmanship of the two parliamentary chambers. In the first half of this year, the debate on whether to hold a presidential election will arise again. The tendency toward autonomy and self-determination in the 88 federal entities will make it hard to compromise with the national authorities. More importantly, the Russian economy is far from moving onto a path of normal development. It is even harder for the new parliament and the new cabinet to reach a conclusion on the new reform program. The authorities' macroeconomic policy will continue to be uncertain and elusive and the microeconomic entities will find it hard to take a firm course. The overall economic situation in Russia will not make a marked turn for the better. In addition, big-power nationalism's further rise in Russia has aroused vigilance among some Western, East European, and former Soviet countries. The Russia policy of the Western countries, especially that of the United States, will be continuously adjusted according to changes in the Russian political situation. The changing Russian political situation will remain the most important variable that affects the development of the world pattern. Many local hot spots will be settled in a political way, but many difficulties will remain. In some regions, local conflicts may arise again. After the signing of the framework agreement on the Palestinian-Israeli Peace Treaty, the Middle East peace talks may make further breakthroughs. The dialogue between the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge is still continuing. After the adoption of the interim constitution in South Africa, nationwide general elections will be held. The parties involved in the Bosnia civil war may reach a cease-fire agreement. However, the contradictions in all such old hot spots are complicated, and the peace processes will not be smooth. The frictions and conflicts in some new hot spots of the former Soviet region and Eastern Europe have not been alleviated, and may even further escalate.
