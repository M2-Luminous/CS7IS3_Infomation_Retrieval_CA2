FR940524-2-00090 FR940524-2-00052 A. Burden on Competition The NYSE acknowledges that some loss of revenue to other SROs may result from its proposed rule, but disagrees that the proposal will have a significant anti-competitive effect on the marketplace that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The NYSE also asserts that proposed NYSE Rule 434 is justified from a regulatory perspective and that arguments regarding competition as they relate to revenues are inappropriate. In support of its contention that the proposed NYSE Rule 434 is justified, the NYSE asserts first that, as DEA for most of its members, the Exchange is charged with overseeing compliance by its members with the applicable financial responsibility rules. The Exchange believes that the information gathered in processing extension requests is essential in carrying out its statutory oversight responsibilities. 53 53 The Exchange also states that the FRB concurs that the DEA has ultimate responsibility in monitoring those firms which it examines, and that even the CSE acknowledges that this information is important to the DEA. Second, pursuant to agreements with other SROs, the NYSE has assumed responsibility to oversee compliance by its members with sales practices and related rules of the NYSE and other SROs. Information derived from extension requests is necessary to perform effective on-site review as this is a significant means for detecting potential sales practices problems. Third, the NYSE believes that the proposal does not conflict with federal laws permitting any SRO to approve extensions of time. The NYSE states that while 1980 amendments to Regulation T and similar changes to Rule 15c3&hyph;3 under the Act permitted any SRO to grant extensions, the FRB issued a letter outlining procedures to be followed when a non-DEA SRO considers such requests, including notification of the DEA. The NYSE also notes that the FRB Comment Letter states that modern technology has significantly altered the convenience benefits of the 1980 amendments, and that the authority of non-DEAs to grant extensions should be on an exception basis. 54 54 Along these lines, the NYSE's 1989 Comment Letter states that 99.6% of all extension requests received by the Exchange are transmitted electronically. Fourth, the NYSE asserts that concentrated regulatory responsibilities under Exchange Act Rules 17d&hyph;1 55 and 17d&hyph;2 56 require that the NYSE obtain continuous first-hand information from its DEA firms and process such information. The NYSE further asserts that, because the Exchange already has 17d&hyph;1 and 17d&hyph;2 responsibility for regulation of its members, it does not make good regulatory sense to break out one aspect of regulation for the economic benefit of individual SROs. The Exchange cites to the FRB Letter, which states: ``We certainly would question the propriety of an SRO with virtually no general examination responsibilities passing on extensions of time as experience might be lacking in correlating credit extensions with other areas of regulatory concern.'' 57 55 Rule 17d&hyph;1_Examination for Compliance with Applicable Financial Responsibility Rules_deals with designation of a SIPC member to an SRO for purposes of examining such member for compliance with applicable financial responsibility rules. 56 Rule 17d&hyph;2_Program for Allocation of Regulatory Responsibility_deals with the creation of plans between SROs to allocate responsibility to receive regulatory reports from persons who are members or participants of more than one SRO, to examine such persons for compliance, or to enforce compliance by such persons with specified provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 57 See FRB Letter, supra note 9 at 2. Finally, the NYSE asserts that arguments that the proposal violates section 11A(a)(1) of the Act are ``ill conceived.'' The NYSE states that section 11A(a)(1), pertaining to the national market system, is basically concerned with efficient, effective and competitive trading systems and not regulatory obligations. 58 Moreover, the NYS does not agree that proposed Rule 434 would have a negative impact on the extension processing system in terms of efficiency or technical innovation. The NYSE asserts that it has been a pioneer in developing and computerizing the extension processing system, and that other SROs copied its efforts. The NYSE states that it is committed to increasing efficiency in the process, which is reflected through, e.g. , its committment of staff dedicated to monitoring extension requests. 59 58 The NYSE cites: HR Report No. 94&hyph;229, 94th Congress, 1st Session (1975) ``The Report of the Committee of Conference to accompany S. 249'' and Senate Report No. 94&hyph;75, 94th Congress, 1st Session (1975) ``Report of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, United States Senate to accompany S. 249,'' at 101. 59 The NYSE stated, at the time of the 1989 response letter, that it had a 5-person professional staff as well as a group of about 128 examiners and 32 coordinators who add integral surveillance support to the Credit Regulation Function, and that it believed its staff to be unique to the industry. B. A Program of Sharing Information The NYSE does not believe information sharing between SROs would be practical. First, the NYSE states that it needs to have extension information on-line. The NYSE states that it needs to make immediate decisions in order to perform daily regulatory responsibilities. Information and reports received after the fact would not be as valuable. Second, the NYSE states that current SRO systems are not compatible and could not be linked because of different parameters and methods of processing data. The NYSE also states that information provided by other SROs would be of little use to the NYSE because each SRO makes decisions based on its own standards. Third, the NYSE states that the expense necessary to link current SRO systems would be substantial and other SROs would look to the NYSE to pay the majority of the cost associated with the changes since the NYSE processes 85% of its members' extensions. The NYSE also states that it does not believe that the expense is justifiable since it performs all of the tasks associated with margin positions, and other SROs have little or no need for this information. The NYSE asserts that its regulatory costs should not be increased in order to justify the non-regulatory purposes of other SROs, and that such costs will be passed on to customers.
