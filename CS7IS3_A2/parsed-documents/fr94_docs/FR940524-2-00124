FR940524-2-00124 FR940524-2-00067 b. Are for no fewer units (or portion thereof approved by HUD) than the number of units to be demolished or disposed of; and c. Will house at least the same number of individuals and families that could be served by the housing to be demolished or disposed. D. Applications for Units To Be Funded From Headquarters Reserve 1. Cover Letter A PHA submitting a category 3 application shall identify the purpose of the application (see section I.C.1 of this NOFA). 2. Section 5(j) Certification The PHA must certify that the units requested are required to comply with court orders or directions of the Secretary. Court orders must be identified. E. ``Other'' Applications Applicants are encouraged to review the rating criteria (IV.E.) to ensure rating factors have been addressed in the application. ``Curable technical deficiencies'' (section IV.B. of this NOFA) relate only to items that would not improve the substantive quality of applications relative to rating factors. A PHA may file only one application per locality under this category. 1. Cover Letter Applicants for ``other'' public housing development units (category 4), must state whether they will accept fewer units than applied for. Refusal to accept fewer units may result in an application not being selected if funds are not sufficient for the full number of units. 2. Section 5(j) Certification The PHA must certify to one of the following, pursuant to section 5(j) of the USHA (select E.2.a or E.2.b.): a. The units requested (limited to 100 or fewer) are needed for family housing to satisfy demands not being met by the section 8 existing or voucher rental assistance programs; or b. 85 percent of the PHA's dwelling units (select (1), (2), or (3)): (1) Are maintained in substantial compliance with the section 8 housing quality standards (24 CFR 882.109); or (2) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which funding has been awarded; or (3) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which applications are pending that have been submitted in good faith under section 14 of the USHA (or a comparable State or local government program), and that there is a reasonable expectation, as determined in writing by HUD, that such application would be approvable; or will be so maintained upon completion of modernization under the Comprehensive Grant program. 3. Funding Preference in Accordance With Section 6(p) Section 6(p) of the USHA requires HUD to provide a funding preference for applications in areas with an inadequate supply of housing for use by low-income families (i.e., a ``tight'' housing rental market). The implementation of this preference shall be in accordance with the process described in section V.A.2 of this NOFA. a. The PHA must furnish data relative to rental vacancy rates in the market area where the project is proposed. This data should include a description of the data sources and methods used to obtain survey information. (It is recommended that PHAs consult with local community development agencies relative to their housing needs before submitting applications under this NOFA, since most of these agencies will have participated in the development of a Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS).) b. Factors such as the following will provide evidence of conditions which, when taken together, will demonstrate a pattern of inadequate supply (generally, no one factor, taken alone, is conclusive); (1) The current rental housing vacancy rate is at a low level (typically six percent or lower) which results in housing not being available for families seeking rental units (unless the housing market area is not growing and, as a result, is experiencing low levels of demand); (2) The annual production of rental housing units is insufficient to meet the demand arising from the increase in households, or, where there is little or no growth, is insufficient to meet the demand arising from net losses to the available inventory;
