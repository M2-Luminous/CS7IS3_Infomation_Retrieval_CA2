These combat vehicles returned home in March 1994. Russian heavy armament was presented in the West for the first time and in principle was seen as a possible variant in the reequipment of two tank and three mechanized brigades. At the time of the arrival of the Russian tanks in Sweden, the search for a replacement for the obsolete STRV-103 tanks produced by the Swedish concern Bofors since the 1960's and for its British counterpart of the same age, the "Centurion," had been continuing for more than two years. Tests were performed on the American tank "M1A2 Abrams," the West German "Leopard-2K Imperwood," and the French "Leclerc." There are 400 tanks subject to replacement. So far the Swedish Parliament has given its approval for 200 vehicles but it has authorized the expenditure of less money than that--about a billion kronor (approximately $150 million). The incongruence of the dream of the military with the possibilities of the country forced the Ministry of Defense to look for an up-to-date and high-quality tank that would serve the next 30 years, extremely advantageous in terms of price as well as other contractual conditions. Therefore, when the T-80U first appeared at an arms exhibition in Abu Dhabi, the Swedes decided to test it as well. In terms of price--about $3 million--the tank was doubtless very interesting. But they were not able to complete the testing. The government made the decision to buy West German "Leopards." Judging by the haste with which the choice was made and by the attempts to disparage the merits of the T-80, the decision was basically dictated by political considerations. Swedish Minister of Defense Anders Bjoerck declared, in particular, that only servicemen no taller than 165 cm can work in a Russian tank, and it is difficult to find such people in Sweden, and that the loader may lose his arms, although in reality this process has been automated.... By the way, the FRG and France demonstrated how to trade with arms. There were more and more frequent visits of high-ranking government delegations from Bonn and Paris in Stockholm and Shevde, where a tank test range is located. It is rumored that the Germans brought about a ton and a half of documentation and advertising about the "Leopard" and the French brought about 3 tons. In Sweden, the French merchants established a presentation office and hired retired generals to work in it. They spent about $5 million to promote the "Leclerc." These two main competitors for the big contract (the United States was out of the game as soon as it refused to concede even a cent) agreed on the most improbable conditions of the deal even to the point of concluding contracts on the basis of 100-percent compensation. The advantage went to Bonn's offer to establish a joint enterprise in Sweden for the assembly of the "Leopard" tanks, part of the production of which Bonn agreed to sell to third countries. This makes it possible for Stockholm not only to rearm its army but also to create a large number of new jobs, which is quite important in time of crisis. In Sweden, for some reason Washington did not utilize a single one of its customary methods to attract a buyer and did not even resort to the means of political pressure, which it actively utilizes in other regions to increase its share of world trade, which in the last few years has increased from 30.5 to 45.8 percent. The arms market has become tight and to occupy a substantial place there it is necessary to trade in the new way, as do the French and Germans. It appears that the reform of the arms trade in Russia that apparently began with an edict from the president on the establishment of the firm "Rosvooruzheniye" was limited to this. In any case, the view of trade in the leadership of the country has not changed. We expect it to bring many billions into the treasury but we are not giving political support to our merchants abroad. Not a single delegation visited the T-80 tanks in Sweden. And there can be no talk of the organization of a temporary representation with the hiring of local military people or the establishment of joint production in Sweden. In Sweden, the T-80 tanks justified the funds spent on them and showed what they are capable of doing, even though they were driven by Swedish crews that quickly learned this art. Even during the preparatory phase, the meticulous Swedes set forth their questions on 500 pages, questions that were answered by close to 10 Russian research establishments. The vehicles were driven through ravines and snow drifts at the very Arctic Circle. The tanks did not break down a single time over six months. "My observation is that the military people liked the T-80," said Aleksandr Vonsovskiy, an expert with the state company "Rosvooruzheniye" who has been given awards in our time for his commercial successes, "our tank is better than the other vehicles and is adapted to Swedish conditions. But even if it came to the commercial negotiations that are planned for 1995, we could not offer conditions analogous to those of the Germans and French." To change the tendency in recent years toward declining Russian arms exports (from 1988 through 1992, they declined 83 percent in comparable prices and amount to about $2 billion), it is necessary to change a lot above all in the attitude toward this business and also to resolve the problem of the compatibility of Western and Russian standards for arms, which will inhibit the advancement of complex Russian hardware to Western markets. The differences are so great that for the Swedes to acquire the T-80U tanks would mean that they would have to spend many millions more to restructure all of their logistical and technical support facilities.
