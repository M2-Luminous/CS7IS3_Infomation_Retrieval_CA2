Setting up "Radio Free Asia" is a mistake by the United States, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying in all daily newspapers. The U.S. Senate last week debated legislation on the creation of a the radio station, which President Bill Clinton proposed in June, that would broadcast to Myanmar [Burma], China, Laos, Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The Vietnamese spokesman said, "the people of Asia believe the aim (of the radio station) is to impose foreign political points of view on them. It represents clear interference in their internal affairs as it aims to provoke instability in these countries." The plan would not only be harmful to economic and social development in Asian countries but also would affect relations between these countries and the United States, he added. "NHAN DAN" (the PEOPLE'S DAILY) said in an article today that the U.S. Senate's decision was completely counter to the trend of peace, stability, and cooperation in Asia and in the world. It also violates international law, the paper pointed out. "QUAN DOI NHAN DAN" (the PEOPLE'S ARMY newspaper) said in a Sunday article that the U.S. decision was a product of the Cold War period and went against the general trend in the Asian region. The army newspaper said U.S. President Bill Clinton and many other U.S. senior officials have stated that they respect the sovereignty and the right to self-determination of other countries, and would not intervene in the internal affairs of other countries. The paper said it was a pity that U.S. authorities have now gone back on their word and violated international law. The article expressed the hope that the United States would make a correct decision in accord with the general trend in Asia and the world.
