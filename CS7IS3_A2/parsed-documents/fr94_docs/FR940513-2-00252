ACTION: Notice of funding availability. SUMMARY: HUD is announcing the availability of $5 million in funding for Fiscal Year 1994 for a Youth Development Initiative under the Family Investment Center Program (FIC). The Youth Development Initiative under FIC will provide five grants for innovative violence abatement strategies that have been developed by youth for public housing. The Youth Development Initiative furthers the mission of Operation Safe Home, a major Clinton Administration Initiative that addresses the larger problem of violence in America's low-income communities. The Youth Development Initiative will provide young individuals (ages 13&hyph;25), including noncustodial parents with child support agreements for children that are public housing residents and who would be capable of meeting their obligations by being provided such services, with better access to comprehensive education and employment opportunities and supportive services. The grants will be for up to three to five years in duration, depending upon the activities undertaken, and will involve youth as active partners, to provide leadership opportunities and improve the capacity for long-term training and services for young residents. The Department has proposed regulations for this program as part of the Tenant Participation and Tenant Opportunity (TOP) rule, published on April 19, 1994 (59 FR 18666).
