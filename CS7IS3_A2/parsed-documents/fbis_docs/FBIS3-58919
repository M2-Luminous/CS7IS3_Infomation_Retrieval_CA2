Problems involving inspection and quarantine practices have stood in the way of farm trade between Taiwan and Belgium, a spokesman for the office pointed out, adding Belgian traders have been longing to sell fresh flowers to Taiwan. The quarantine task force will be composed of officials from Belgium's Ministry of Agriculture and Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, the spokesman said. Meanwhile, he noted, the first meeting of the task force will be held in Taipei in April or May.
