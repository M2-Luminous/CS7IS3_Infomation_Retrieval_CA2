Tudor's `Objectionable' Attacks"] [Text] "Esteemed Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, I would like to reassure you on this occasion too, of the affection I nurture for you. It is my duty to say this now, at a moment when your life and the work carried out by you are denigrated publicly in an abominable manner," reads the open letter that Adrian Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies, sent to Traian Chebeleu, the spokesman of President Ion Iliescu. Without spelling out the name C.V. Tudor -- or of the magazine ROMANIA MARE, for that matter -- Adrian Nastase vehemently disapproved of the calumnies published in the aforementioned weekly about the presidency's spokesman: "You will always be above such calumny which, as far as you are concerned, will never be approved or believed." In conclusion of the document sent to Traian Chebeleu, Adrian Nastase mentions: "I choose this way to write to you because I also wish to sound the alarm signal that has not been heard for a long time. Without suggesting actions that would limit the rights and the power of the press, I believe that it is necessary for the newspaper guild to display an ethical and concrete solidarity that should isolate and eliminate from the journalistic world the filthy attack -- no matter in what paper it is published -- that is multiplied on the rotary printing press."
