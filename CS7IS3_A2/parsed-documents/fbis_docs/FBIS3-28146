The United States apparently has begun to soften its position in a bid to break the deadlocked situation as the upcoming Japanese-U.S. summit meeting lies just ahead. During the vice- ministerial talks held in Washington last week, the United States expressed its understanding for holding discussions in a bidirectional manner, according to an international financial source. Japan and the United States are to exchange views on matters they are concerned about. They are currently "at a stage where work is being done vigorously to determine how to incorporate this (in the reports)" (as stated by a senior Finance Ministry official). As for the "bidirectional" idea, it was expressly stated in the joint statement announced at the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting last July that "consultations will take place under the basic principle of a two-way dialogue (between Japan and the United States)." However, the United States has so far refused to alter its position that the purpose of the framework trade talks is to correct the closed nature of Japanese markets, not to discuss the problems of the United States. As a result, this has stalled the trade talks in general. Meanwhile, the United States has also demanded that objective criteria be designated to help increase foreign insurance companies' share of the Japanese market to the level of that of the markets of other major industrialized nations (G-7). Japan, however, has refused to change its attitude of a complete rejection of this, saying, "Objective criteria could become numerical targets" (as stated by a Finance Ministry official). Consequently, the talks on insurance issue are expected to remain entangled until the final moments before the bilateral summit meeting.
