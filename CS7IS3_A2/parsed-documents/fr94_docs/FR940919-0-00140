FR940919-0-00140 FR940919-0-00017 Issue 14: Several commenters, including Congressman Wally Herger, requested the precise locations of the populations of the species be widely disseminated or included in the final rule. One respondent requested that the Service notify all landowners whose property has been found to contain one or more of the species. Service Response: For the reasons discussed in the response dealing with critical habitat below, the Service concludes that providing the exact locations would increase the degree of threat facing these species. Issue 15: Some commenters were concerned that the Service did not give due consideration to the impacts of the six year drought in California. They contended that increased amounts of rainfall would result in greater numbers of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Service Response: The average and above average rainfall levels that occurred in 1992/1993 did not reveal significant new populations of the five species in unexpected areas because most vernal pools held water, at least to some extent, during the drought that extended from 1987 to 1992. Even very small, shallow vernal pools were observed to hold water, allowing reproduction of the four fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp during these drought years (J. King pers. comm. 1992; M. Simovich pers. comm. 1992; Simovich et al. 1993). Also, natural vernal pool complexes are expected to have some pools that at least partially pond in drought years even though other pools may fill only during years of average or above average precipitation. Issue 16: Several commenters concluded that the data on the crustaceans does not demonstrate a historic and consistent decline in populations levels. One commenter stated that the data on the Conservancy fairy shrimp, longhorn fairy shrimp, and the vernal pool fairy shrimp is very limited because they were only recently described. Service Response: Relatively little information is available to reconstruct the distribution of the four species listed herein prior to the loss of vernal pool habitat that began in the late 1800's. However, the Service is required to evaluate species based on current and likely future threats to their status. As discussed in this final rule, numerous populations of the four species face severe, imminent threats that could result in substantial habitat losses and extirpations in the future. Since at least the mid-1980's, the human population has been growing rapidly throughout the Central Valley and other regions of California. Although three of the five crustaceans were described scientifically in 1990, their distribution and abundance are sufficiently documented relative to current and future threats to their continued existence. Field samples made from vernal pools have contained these three fairy shrimp prior to 1990. The earliest known collections of the Conservancy fairy shrimp were made in 1979, the vernal pool fairy shrimp in 1965, and the longhorn fairy shrimp in 1937. Issue 17: The Contra Costa Water District reported that neither the Los Vaqueros Reservoir alternative nor the Kellogg Reservoir alternative would impact the single vernal pool complex inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp within the watershed (John Gregg, Los Vaqueros Project, in litt. , 1992). Service Response: The Los Vaqueros Reservoir project likely would result in adverse impacts to the California linderiella, vernal pool fairy shrimp, and the longhorn fairy shrimp based on an analysis of the environmental documents for this project (California Department of Fish and Game 1983; John Gregg, Los Vaqueros Project, in litt ., 1992; Jones and Stokes 1986, 1989, 1990, 1991). On September 2, 1993, the Service issued a conference opinion to the Bureau of Reclamation for the effects of the Los Vaqueros Reservoir project on the three fairy shrimp species. Issue 18: One commenter stated that there are populations of the crustacean species located on nature preserves and for this reason the Service was urged to ``slow'' the listing process for these animals. Four people noted that portions of three preserves owned by the Nature Conservancy are inhabited by three of the fairy shrimp species and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. One commenter concluded that this assured the long-term protection of these species. However, the other three commenters stated that the preserves were either not specifically managed for these animals or the sites are imperiled by activities on adjacent properties.
