He also said: "During the meeting among the ROK, the United States, and Japan scheduled for 3, 4 June in Washington, the three countries will settle the level and types of sanctions against North Korea and the demands to make on North Korea. From early next week, coordination of various views regarding the draft of the resolution provided by the United States will be carried out on a full scale among the permanent members of the UNSC." Following is an interview with Permanent Representative Yu Chong-ha: [Kim Cha-ung] At the 3 June UNSC meeting, Hans Blix, secretary general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, revealed: "We could not find any technical or safety reasons for North Korea to replace the fuel rods at its atomic reactor." Does this mean that North Korea intentionally started to replace the fuel rods? [Yu Chong-ha] Yes. This means that North Korea replaced the fuel rods not because of the technical and safety reasons they were insisting on, but for political purposes. North Korea intentionally removed the evidence that could have determined that it has diverted nuclear material. [Kim] Other than measuring the fuel rods, are there any other ways to find out whether North Korea has diverted nuclear material? [Yu] There is no certain evidence that North Korea diverted nuclear material by examining the fuel rods. If nuclear waste was examined, we could have had a partial knowledge of whether the nuclear material was diverted, but the information is not complete. Now, the way to find out about North Korea's nuclear activities through the fuel rods has disappeared. [Kim] Does our government firmly support sanctions against North Korea? [Yu] Currently, our government's firm position is that the move toward sanctions is inevitable. The ROK, the United States, and Japan are discussing in Washington the pace and method of the sanctions and what demands they will make on North Korea. [Kim] What do you think will be the content of the sanctions? [Yu] In general, there are three kinds of resolutions for sanctions at the UNSC--a resolution of warning, a resolution for sanctions in stages, and an overall resolution for sanctions. One of them will be applied to North Korea. [Kim] When do you think that a resolution on North Korea will be adopted? [Yu] It will not be adopted in just one or two days. If you look at previous cases, it takes two to three weeks from the time the permanent members of the UNSC start to discuss this matter and the time a decision is made. Some permanent members say that "This is not a time-pressing issue now." The opportunity for a later measurement of the fuel rods has been lost, but since the discharged fuel rods are under the surveillance of the inspection team, permanent members point out that it is not a time sensitive issue. [Kim] It is important to see how China will react to the resolution against North Korea. What is the attitude of the permanent members, including China, regarding this matter? [Yu] I had contact with related ambassadors. China is still adhering to the position of "opposing sanctions," which has been its position in the past. However, China seemed to sense the ROK point of view that there is no other way than to take sanctions. France and Great Britain feel strongly about taking sanctions. Russia proposed an eight-party meeting in an effort to seek other ways to resolve this issue rather than taking sanctions.
