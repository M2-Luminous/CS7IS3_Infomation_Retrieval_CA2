[Kopecna] First of all, on finishing the proposal for the minister of justice on appointment of the state attorneys. They will be appointed to their posts according to the Law on the Office of State Attorney on 17, 19, and 23 May. I consider expert qualifications and integrity to be the most important criteria. At this time, approximately 900 attorneys who were transferred here from the former offices of the prosecutor work at the state attorney offices. As of 1 July, there will be approximately 100 fewer of them. Their number at the individual levels of the office of state attorney is defined by the Ministry of Justice and are derived from the number of judges. [Safrankova] Do you have any other priorities? [Kopecna] I will also concentrate on further developing cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior in the struggle against crime because, after all, criminal action is the focal point of the work of the office of state attorney. It takes part in a civil action only exceptionally as specified by law. This concerns, above all, selected sections of Family Law--denial of fatherhood according to Article 62 of the Family Law, for instance. [passage omitted]
