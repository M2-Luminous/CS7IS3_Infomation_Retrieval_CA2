New payment amounts have been set for citizens and legal entities -- subjects of entrepreneurial activity -- for the issue of licences by the Ministry of Transport to carry out agency services for the merchant marine port [as received] in the sea and river ports of Ukraine. In Odessa, Ilyichevsk, Kherson, Yuzhnoye, and Mariupol ports this is $800,000 per port; in the ports of Berdyansk, Nikolayev, Kherson, Izmail, and Reni this is $400,000; in Belgorod-Dunayskiy, Kiliya, Yalta, and in all river ports this is $200,000 per port. The resolution stipulates that these payments are to be made in foreign currency (with the availability of the National Bank licence) or in Ukraine's currency converted according to the National Bank exchange rate at the time of issue. Besides, the principal marine agencies of the Ukrainian Ministry of Transport are exempt for five years from any payments for the issue of licenses to carry out agency services for the merchant marine fleet. The resolution also stipulates that 90 percent of the monies received for the issue of licenses are transferred to the currency account of the Ministry of Finance, if paid in foreign currency, and to the state budget, if paid in Ukraine's currency. The rest of the sum remains at the disposal of the Ministry of Transport.
