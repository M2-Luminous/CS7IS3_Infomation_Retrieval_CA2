Kata Peli Nagy reports on the circumstances of the ballot at the MSZP congress. [Nagy] [passage omitted] According to Gyula Horn, the agreement promises a predictable policy that focuses on people, which is sociologically well-grounded and which intends to modernize. [passage omitted] Gyula Horn sees the basis on which the government program is founded as neither liberal, nor left-wing, but a realistic one. It is unequivocally clear from the document that the coalition wants a social market economy, it is enterprise-friendly, and encourages foreign investment. Its strategic aim is to speedily join the West European organizations, to establish good-neighborly relations with countries surrounding Hungary, and to support as far as possible the Hungarians living as minorities. Gyula Horn, who is the MSZP candidate for the post of prime minister, views his upcoming government as a government of experts despite the concessions he had to make during the negotiations with the SZDSZ. Horn said that finding state secretaries for the ministers will be next week's task. In connection with this I have learned that no candidates have been found as yet for filling the state secretarial posts that were originally offered to Gyorgy Janosi and Sandor Csintalan. Janosi rejected the post of state secretary at the Ministry of Culture and Public Education, while Csintalan refused the post of state secretary at the Ministry of Labor that Mrs. Kosa, nee Magda Kovacs, candidate for the post of minister of labor, offered him. Pal Vastagh, candidate for the post of justice minister, has also failed to find a state secretary. MSZP Deputy Chairman Ferenc Baja has asked Katalin Szili to accept the post of state secretary at the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Csaba Tabajdi has been nominated for the state secretarial post of chairman of the Office of Hungarians Beyond the Border and the National and Ethnic Minorities Office--the two offices will be merged. MSZP Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres was elected as leader of the MSZP group of parliamentary deputies at the congress this afternoon. [passage omitted] The group decided on the people it will delegate to posts of chairmen and deputy chairmen of the parliamentary committees: Sandor Orosz--chairman of the Agricultural Committee; Judit Csehak--chairwoman of the Social Affairs Committee; Etele Barath--chairwoman of the Environmental Protection; Ivan Vitanyi--chairman of the Cultural Committee; Gabor Gellert Kis--chairman of the Human Rights Committee; Gyorgy Janosi--chairman of the Education Committee; Sandor Nagy--chairman of the Audit Committee; Jozsef Alajos Geczi--chairman of the Parliamentary Immunity Committee.
