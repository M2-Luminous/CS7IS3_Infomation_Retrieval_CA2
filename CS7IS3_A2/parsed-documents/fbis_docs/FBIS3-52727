Do these calls hurt the activity of the army, and how is the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] preparing to deal with such a phenomenon? [Baraq] In my view, the IDF will have no problem with carrying out legal orders at any stage. The IDF does not determine policy and, as an army, has no stand on the arrangement with the Palestinians. It has a professional stand on the security issue and makes that known in the relevant forums that determine professional issues. The IDF's professional stand relates to security -- how to defend ourselves against an external threat; how to defend the settlements; what security can be provided on the roads -- in view of the government decision to leave the population centers and to transfer responsibility for public order and security there to the Palestinian police force. I reiterate: The IDF has no stand on the political aspect of the government's resolutions and will not have one in the future, due to the very nature of the relationship between the Army and the government. On the other hand, the IDF, as the Army of a democratic state, carries out the decisions of the elected government -- any elected government. That was the situation up to now, that is the situation now, and that will be the situation in the future. The IDF carries out the security aspect of the government's decisions to the best of its abilities. There are hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the Army and tens of thousands of officers who, as civilians, express the entire spectrum of political views held in this country. Therefore, it is legitimate and even good that as citizens, they have a view, because after all, they belong to a democratic state. They express that view once every four years by putting what they think is the right slip in the ballot box and, by doing so, elect a government. The elected government is the one that instructs and guides the IDF. Recruits, members of the standing army, and officers do not express political views when in uniform. They implement the army's orders, which stem from Israel's elected government (that is the basis of a democracy). Therefore, any soldier, when in uniform, must carry out all the legal orders he receives from his commander regardless of his political views. I expect any group of reservists and any commander who are right-wing supporters to carry out -- without hesitation or appeal -- an order to detain a group of Israeli settlers that tries to break into a closed area near the synagogue in Jericho, because they are in uniform. To the same extent, I expect any group of soldiers, regardless of whether they are drafted or in the reserves, who happen to belong to There Is a Limit or Peace Now to disperse rioting Palestinian women and children with resolve and without a second thought. If an order is given, it must be carried out. That is the basis of a democracy, and we must all understand that. The IDF exists in order to defend, and it is ready to do anything to uphold the right of every citizen to believe what he wants and to struggle to convince the government and the public of the rightness of his path. The citizen must do this in a way that is in total conformity with the rules of democracy. Therefore, I occasionally appeal to the Israeli residents of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza to try to express their political protests within the Green Line to the extent possible, in order to avoid diverting the IDF from its main mission of pursuing wanted men and safeguarding the security of the settlers themselves. [BAMAHANE] Does [former Army chief chaplain] Rabbi Goren not understand that? [Baraq] I have not even read what Goren said. From my viewpoint, what people say is unimportant. Anyone who disobeys a legal order in the army will find himself in jail -- period -- even if the order touches on an issue which he, as a civilian or as a member of the government, would have voted for or conducted differently. In my view, there is currently no danger of soldiers refusing to obey orders, and if there are isolated cases among hundreds of thousands of soldiers, they will find themselves in prison.
