He said: "The government is not in a position of being able to interfere in automakers' business in a capitalist nation or a country in which market mechanism functions well. And, there is no such law. If the automobile and insurance industries come up with ideas to solve the issue, it may be necessary for the government to support them in implementing the ideas." Thus, he indicated that trade imbalance should be corrected mainly through the private sector's voluntary efforts.
