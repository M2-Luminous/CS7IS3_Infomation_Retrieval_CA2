"If the problem is not solved the nuclear power plants will simply shut down", he warned. Three-month delays in wage payments are also a reason of the protest, although not the major one, according to Kashkin. "Our objective is to be heard by the government. A special meeting is necessary on problems of nuclear and fuel production", said Kashkin who is also deputy chairman of the trade union of nuclear industry workers. After the Chernobyl catastrophe nuclear reactors had to be modernised, however the lack of finances stalled the work. "We know too well what this is fraught with", Kashkin said. The government reportedly owes the indstry 600 billion roubles. Some 60 people from eight nuclear power plants are picketing the government building instead of expected 150.
