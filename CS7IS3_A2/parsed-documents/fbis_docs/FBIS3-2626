In a recent interview with a reporter from BEIJING REVIEW, Zhang Xianghai, deputy director general of the State Administration of Taxation, answered questions concerning the issue. Excerpts follow: QUESTION: [Q] What modifications concerning the taxation of foreign-funded enterprises are found in the current taxation reform? ANSWER: [A] Taxation reform concerning enterprises using foreign investment and foreign enterprises includes the following major aspects: According to the decision adopted by the Fifth Session of the Standing People's Congress, effective on January 1, 1994, foreign funded enterprises and foreign enterprises became subject to national unified taxes such as value-added tax, excise duty and business tax. Imposition of the taxes was necessary to develop both the socialist market economy and a fair taxation system, and was in line with the demands of a majority of foreign-funded and foreign enterprises. The reforms adopted the important principle of placing no undue tax burden on foreign-funded enterprises in order to ensure the consistency and stability of China's taxation policies. Simply stated, the state established taxation rates based on avoiding both increases or decreases in the general level of tax burden. In general, the reform measures guarantee state revenue, while at the same time avoiding placing an added tax burden on enterprises. Nonetheless, changes in the taxation structure and channels of taxation will inevitably result in minor increases or decreases in taxes on certain products and enterprises. As part of an effort to solve this particular problem, the state will implement necessary policies and measures to ensure a smooth transition from the old taxation system to the new. According to a recent decision approved by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, foreign-funded enterprises established before December 31, 1993, which face an increased tax burden due to imposition of value-added tax, excise duty and business tax, will with the approval of taxation authorities, receive refunds for increased tax payments during their term of business operations within five years. Foreign-funded enterprises established after January 1, 1994, are subject to the new tax law. Q: Following the unification of income taxes on domestic enterprises, domestic enterprises enjoy tax rates equivalent to those of foreign-funded enterprises. However, the latter previously enjoyed various other privileges. Are preferential policies such as these still valid? A: The taxation reform confirms that the Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China for Enterprises With Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises, effective as of July 1, 1991, will remain in effect and the various privileges stated in the law will remain unchanged. At present, however, domestic enterprises enjoy tax rates equal to those of foreign-funded enterprises. This is aimed at providing conditions and opportunities for enterprises to compete on an equal footing. Preferential policies granted to foreign funded enterprises will remain unchanged. On the basis of unifying tax rates for domestic enterprises, the state will, at an appropriate time and after necessary preparations, use legal means to unify the income system for both domestic and foreign enterprises through the promulgation of The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China. Q: Previously, various localities arbitrarily established development zones and granted certain preferential taxation policies without having first obtained the approval of the central government. How do state taxation authorities plan to approach this issue? A: While it is necessary to provide preferential taxation policies for foreign investors, such policies should be enacted in strict accordance with the law. Preferential taxation policies should be designated only by the central government, which alone has the final say concerning the issue. China is a large country with 30 provinces (excluding Taiwan), municipalities and autonomous regions, hundreds of cities and thousands of counties. Confusion would reign if local governments were allowed to proceed as they wished. Allowing them to do so would not only lessen the original function of preferential taxation policies, but would also destroy the country's overall taxation environment. Preferential taxation policies are only part of the investment environment, and other factors such as resources, infrastructure and labor conditions are perhaps more important. In 1992, the State Council issued the Circular on Strengthening Taxation Administration and Strictly Controlling Tax Reductions and Exemptions. The circular contains two articles concerning the taxation of foreign-funded enterprises, reaffirming that all preferential taxation policies arbitrarily designated by local governments and departments which are contradictory to the state taxation laws and regulations are invalid, and should immediately be withdrawn or rectified. The circular also stated that all economic development zones lacking the approval of the State Council are prohibited from receiving various preferential taxation policies granted to approved state level development zones. The State Council's effort to rectify the situation is designed to guarantee the correct implementation of taxation laws and regulations in order to protect the legitimate interests of investors. Q: What is the situation concerning tax revenue received from foreign-funded enterprises during the past 15 years of reform and opening? A: Since implementation of the reform and opening policies, China has adopted a series of preferential taxation policies to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the country. The preferential polices have played an active role in attracting foreign investment and accelerating economic development. Throughout the period, China's tax revenues from foreign funded enterprises have increased substantially on an annual basis. In 1992, tax revenues from foreign-funded enterprises soared to 10.7 billion yuan, a dramatic 52 percent increase over the previous year, and the figure hit 20 billion yuan in 1993. In terms of reforms of the taxation system, China has insisted on the following three principles -- the protection of national interests, facilitating the opening effort, and gradually instituting generally accepted international practices. China will continue to abide by the three principles in any future taxation reform.
