The recorded excerpts come from a Zhirinovskiy address to the State Duma on 13 January. Zhirinovskiy is shown standing at the State Duma podium saying: "One of our party's representatives has said that a psychiatric examination is required here. I agree. On one side of this parliament there are quite a lot of candidates for it, and I'll certainly see to it that it's done in the next two years, through our intelligence services. And in two years we'll have papers indicating which ones of you have had which diseases, and for how long." The video cuts to a later portion of Zhirinovskiy's address: "Don't interrupt while.... [shouts] Shut up! [Bangs fist on the podium] I am speaking here now. Do you expect me to let you make all this noise while I'm speaking? So get out of the hall, get out! All of you, get out!" An unidentified voice calls out to Zhirinovskiy. He continues, "All the candidates for lunatic asylum." A different unidentified voice says, "Turn the microphones off, enough of that." Zhirinovskiy continues: "Go on, stay in your seats. You haven't spent long enough in prisons under communists! Just look at you, how many of you there are!" The video cuts to another portion of Zhirinovskiy's address: "In the autumn of 1995, most of the people who will be sitting here will be representatives of real democratic parties, who will never interrupt a speaker. Yes, that's exactly what I mean, people repeating `time is up' all the time, and you, Mr. Chubays, you'll be making this sign when you're in the cell, in Lefortovo prison. You'll be making this sign [Zhirinovskiy taps himself on the wrist] in the cell, asking for your lunch." The video cuts again. Zhirinovskiy says, "I have a different role, and the party believes we are destined for something different. We are waiting for other elections." The video cuts and Zhirinovskiy continues: "I would gladly have agreed to carry out the functions of leader of the Russian parliament as it would have been an example, not just for this country, not just for Europe, but for the whole world. After all, just two days that I spent in Europe sent the entire planet reeling, all the diplomats, all the ministers." The video cuts to Zhirinovskiy saying, "The entire Russian nation -- not those with guttural speech or dual citizenship -- need me to be in good health." In the final excerpt of the speech Zhirinovskiy says, "I am waiting for presidential elections in Russia. And rest assured that I'll have enough to speak to you about after that."
