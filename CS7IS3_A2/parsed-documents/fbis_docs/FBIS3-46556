The message reads: To the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation: We rang out a year of rewarding struggle in which we advanced along the chuche banner and are greeting the hopeful new year of 1994. The SKNDF Central Committee respectfully sends the first greeting of wishing the great leader long life with the consistent expressions of congratulations by all the vanguard fighters and patriotic masses of various strata of the South. The last year of 1993 was a historic year in which national prestige of the chuche Korea was exalted further in the entire world under the outstanding leadership of the great leader and in which a new advance was made in the struggle of the 70 million fellow countrymen for national reunification. The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who adds luster to the chuche chronicles with his unequalled exploits, made brilliant achievements for the times and mankind last year with his deep insight into the rapidly changing situational demands and with his energetic ideological and theoretical activities and great practice of the revolution. Last year was marked by the culmination of the antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate, stifle [chilsik], and crush [apsal] the Northern half of the country and pull down the socialist fortress. The great leader overcame and made a breakthrough in the manifold difficulties and trials with his tested leadership, ever-victorious wisdom and strategy, and the might of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses, thus powerfully demonstrating to the entire world the justness and invincibility of the chuche socialist cause. The celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the 7 July war victory, which were grandly observed amid great admiration of the people at home and abroad, were great festivities of both our nation and mankind that built up as an everlasting historical monument the immortal achievements of the respected and beloved leader, who leads the cause of independence and the cause of socialism of our times along the ever-victorious road. They were a great epic, which vividly proved the chuche truth that the people who pioneer their destiny independently and creatively, upholding the great leader and under the leadership of the leader, are ever-victorious. With the noble idea of believing in the people as in heaven, the great leader has devoted his entire life to the masses, setting off on a life journey -- boarding a mass-oriented train. Everywhere he gave sacred on-the-spot guidance, which he gave so many times last year, miracles and innovations were brought forth, enabling the brethren in the North to brilliantly conclude the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan in the unprecedented world economic recession and achieved the triumphant bumper crop, thus providing the firm foundation of self-reliant economy. The 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee, which proudly summed up the Third Seven-Year Plan and put forth the revolutionary economic strategy, marked another resplendent chapter in the glorious history of the WPK, which victoriously pioneers the hitherto-uncultivated chuche socialism under the tested leadership of the great leader and the dear comrade leader. In the land of the North, where the great leader's politics of benevolence is in full bloom, all the people enthusiastically put into practice last year the noble, beautiful traits of devoting themselves silently to the party, the leader, the group, and comrades without seeking any honor or compensation. Thus, the North society highly demonstrated its prestige as the crystal of wholehearted loyalty and filial duty and as a solid sociopolitical living organism. Last year, when there was the acute and serious confrontation between socialism and capitalism, the great leader firmly held the control lever of history and elucidated clearly the direction and position of the times, thus enabling the world's progressive people to advance continuously along the road of anti-imperialist cause for independence and of the movement of rebuilding socialism. The great leader, who is the lodestar of the fatherland's reunification, presented last year the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the fatherland, which is comprehensive of the lofty spirit of nation-loving and national independence, thus vigorously arousing the 70 million fellow countrymen to the struggle to realize the cause of the fatherland's reunification in the nineties. The great leader has verified Tangun as the originator of our nation, who actually lived, thus hardening the belief of all fellow countrymen that they are a unitary nation inheriting a 5,000-year history and enabling them to achieve national harmony and great unity. With boundless happiness and pride in living and struggling with the great leader as the sun of the nation, we stoutly carried out the patriotic struggle to pioneer the nation's destiny last year. Our masses in the South made a counterattack on the antidemocratic, antinational, and antireunification group, which has strangled democracy with feigned reforms, taken pro-United States and pro-Japanese flunkeyism and betrayal of the nation to intensify its subordination, and pushed South-North relations to the dangerous situation on the brink of war by pursuing anticommunism and anti-North confrontation since the military dictatorship turned into the civilian fascism. By doing so, they have unveiled the current regime's mask of a civilian government and deepened the crisis of the colonial fascist system. Through our struggle in a grave situation last year, we came to bear even more firmly the faith that we will achieve the victory of the cause of independence, democracy, and reunification without fail as long as we have the great leader and the immortal chuche idea. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is indeed a benevolent sun that leads our SKNDF and other patriotic masses of various circles to ceaselessly follow the patriotic road to independence, democracy, and reunification under the banner of struggle, without wavering in the colonial fascist forces' persistent temptation and unyielding under any outrageous reactionary offensive, no matter how giddily the dirty flood of betrayal and reform overflows from the countries where capitalism has been rehabilitated. The immortal chuche idea is a brilliant beacon for pioneering our destinies. In the new year, we will accelerate modeling the SKNDF and the ranks of the movement for changes after the chuche idea, under the brilliant chuche rays and substantially carry out work to make the masses in various classes and strata have consciousness and to organize them by using the respected and beloved leader's memoir. By doing so, we will strengthen the independent main forces of the national and democratic movement in every way. We will imminently and daringly organize and carry out the mass struggle to smash the current traitorous regime that pursues flunkeyism, nation-selling, and war, so that we can mature the situation of the movement for changes on our own initiative. We will also create a wind of nationwide advance for independent reunification, upholding the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the fatherland, and will make 1994 a historic year of national reconciliation and unity. Although the road of struggle is arduous and formidable, our just cause will obtain victory without fail as long as the great leader exists and the chuche banner vigorously flies at the front. This morning of the new year when the ardor of admiring and following the chuche sun is filled in every place, the SKNDF Central Committee conveys the wish of all the vanguard fighters and masses of various classes and strata in the South for the longevity of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song who is a peerless patriot, a legendary hero, and the father of the nation. [Signed] The SKNDF Central Committee [Issued] 1 January 1994, Seoul
