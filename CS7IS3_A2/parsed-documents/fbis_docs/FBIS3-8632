Three of the attacks were on the Teslic front, south of Doboj, where the Moslems disregarded their festival of Bairam and engaged in strong offensive activities against the Serb positions. Another abortive attack was launched on the south sector of the Trebava front, east of Doboj, which the Serbs beat back, suffering no casualties in the process. Yet another futile effort to break through the Serb defence lines was undertaken on the western sector of the Ozren front, south of Doboj. Here, the Serbs also neutralised a Moslem terrorist group in an attempt to be infiltrated behind Bosnian Serb lines. Serb villages on Mt. Ozren were subjected to strong small-arms fire by Moslem forces, which have been observed to be regrouping. One Serb soldier was wounded by Croat small-arms fire from the direction of Orasje in the north after midnight, Serb military sources said. Bosnian Serb positions were exposed to provocations also elsewhere in the Sava River basin during the night, but did not respond. The Bosnian Serb army command in Herzegovina reported reduced Moslem operations and only sporadic fire from small-arms and anti-aircraft guns from the direction of Gorazde in the east. In the coming days, Moslems are likely to launch assaults on Cajnice, Ustikolina and Kalinovik in the southeast and Borci in central Bosnia, the source said and attributed the present comparative lull in the fighting to the Bairam festival.
