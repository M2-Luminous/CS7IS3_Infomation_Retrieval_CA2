At the airport, Minister Buwayz made a statement in which he said: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You returned from Cairo today, after taking part in the 101st session of the Arab League Council. How do you assess the work of that session, particularly in relation to Lebanon? [Buwayz] This conference was certainly held amid critical regional conditions. It involved sensitive topics, which we noted before leaving Beirut, primarily lifting the boycott and amending the League Charter. The most important thing during that session was the postponement of these sensitive issues, because we feel that conditions are not favorable for a change. The causes that led to and justified them at a certain stage still exist. I believe that this session was very wise in overcoming some challenges and certain differences in views. Hence, it studied the agenda in depth and postponed discussion of a number of points that the League thought it was premature to review. [Correspondent] You certainly carried the problem of the south with you to that conference. How was Arab solidarity regarding the ongoing Israeli aggression against the south? [Buwayz] I believe that Arab solidarity concerning the issue of the south, Palestine, and all other Arab issues under consideration is very serious. It is not the idea of solidarity that counts; it is how we apply this solidarity that counts. I can say that the Arab League's work mechanism had earlier been submitted for discussion. I hope Arab accord will be further enhanced to help the League express this solidarity and unity. [Correspondent] You held a number of meetings on the sidelines of the conference. Can you give us an idea about their outcome? [Buwayz] Just like any other conference, this meeting gave the opportunity to hold side meetings. I held a number of intensive meetings with Arab foreign ministers, including Their Excellencies 'Amr Musa, Faruq al-Shar', the Qatari foreign minister, and others. I also held several meetings with the Arab League secretary general. [Correspondent] Will the secretary general pay a visit to Lebanon soon? [Buwayz] I believe that his excellency the Arab League secretary general will visit Lebanon in mid April to open the Arab League's legal center, which has selected Lebanon as a base. [end recording]
