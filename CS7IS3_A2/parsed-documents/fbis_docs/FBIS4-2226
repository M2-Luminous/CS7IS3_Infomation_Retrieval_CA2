The reports quoted a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official as saying that "the development will be unclear" despite the fact that talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor are likely to be resumed next week. Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morroco next week at the signing ceremony for the global trade pact concluded in the Uruguay Round last December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
