It decided to have some members of the inspection team remain in North Korea for additional inspections. Since North Korea postponed inspections on the radioactive chemical laboratory in Yongbyon, contrary to what it had promised to the IAEA, and sufficient inspections cannot be completed by 14 March -- the deadline for scheduled inspections -- the IAEA decided to extend the schedule and have some members stay there for one or two more days to inspect the facility. It has been learned that the IAEA had already made a tentative agreement with North Korea on the inspection method of the radioactive chemical laboratory, which is believed to be a nuclear reprocessing facility. The IAEA plans to have inspection members, aside from the ones who will stay longer, return to the IAEA secretariat office in Vienna on 15 March as scheduled. A well-informed diplomatic source in Seoul explained: "The IAEA actually finished inspecting the North Korean nuclear facilities during the past inspections and is eager to have the results back at the IAEA headquarters for analysis. Some members will stay for a more thorough inspection of the last radioactive chemical laboratory, and all of them will be back by the middle of next week." Regarding the broken seals, the IAEA verified the information and accepted North Korea's explanation that "those were because of careless handling." The source said: "North Korea intended to test the will of the ROK and U.S. Governments by deliberately creating obstacles to the exchange of North and South special envoys; however, the IAEA appraises that North Korea accepted comparatively easily the IAEA inspections, which are directly connected with UN sanctions."
