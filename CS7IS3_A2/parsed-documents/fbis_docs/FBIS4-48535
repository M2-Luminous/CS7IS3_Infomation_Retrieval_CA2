Although there is nothing to criticize about the initiative, which meets the wishes of almost the entire political class, the same cannot be said of certain repercussions which, in some cases, are rather confusing. The need in this new political context to clean up or even remodel the Ivorian electoral code in its present form is unanimously accepted by almost all the leading electoral partners. This has been the case for ages. Back in November 1992, Mr. Henri Konan Bedie, then the speaker of the National Assembly, publicly called for a new electoral code, while in Ouragahio. A few months later, in March 1993, his party, the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI], stated during its conclave that the Ivorian electoral code "must be judiciously and moderately reviewed...." Mr. Bernard Zadi Zaourou of the Union of Social Democrats has made this one of his conditions for remaining in the government. "The 1990 Electoral Code must not be functioning in 1995.... (otherwise) I will leave government and give the reasons for my action." Leaders from the Union of Democratic Forces, which is composed of six political parties -- the Ivorian Workers Party, the Liberal Party of Cote d'Ivoire, the UND [expansion unknown], the Democratic and Social Movement, the PPS [expansion unknown], and the African Party for Ivorian Rebirth -- are calling for a new electoral code. It also known that the Ivorian Popular Front [FPI] has made the drafting of a new code one of the highlights of its program, stating that it constitutes one base for a free and open election. It even presented a list of proposals to former Prime Minister Alassane Dramane Ouattara -- a gesture which it reiterated with his successor, Daniel Kablan Duncan. All this goes to show that the leading political protagonists on the national political scene, who are the first concerned by, or at least the most attentive to, the electoral code, want something new. People believe in the advent of this new system, because the government office in charge of the elections let the people have a glimmer of hope. Reporting the remarks of one of Mr. Emile Constant Bombet's advisers in December 1992, which at the time we attributed to leaks, we published the following: "Leaks coming from the Interior Ministry say that by 1993, or by 1994 at the latest, a roundtable conference made up of all the political parties will be held, in order to reach a minimum consensus on a new electoral code. The office presently in charge of elections says it is ready to work towards such a rapprochement." However, in practice, instead of fostering rapprochement among the political parties in order to obtain this minimum consensus on a new electoral code, Mr. Bombet has chosen to draft an "electoral bill" which, on behalf of the government, he is about to submit to the National Assembly. Between the initial intent and this rehash, what could have happened? It would seem that there was no consultation -- most political party leaders that we have approached say that they do not know anything about such a bill. The luckiest person in this situation is Professor Hubert Oulaye, an FPI electoral expert, who is also the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission -- a body set up by the FPI. Mr. Oulaye, upon reading the bill, was surprised that no consultations or referendum had been held, considering that many election results from 1990 were contested, even if no concrete action was taken on them. Furthermore, he added, "there is no country in the subregion today which went to the polls without going through consultations and an improvement of the conditions of the electoral system." In any case, Mr. Bombet's new electoral code is here and will surely be submitted to the nation's representatives for consideration. As far as we are concerned, we need to know what it says, in addition to its worth. The electoral bill is comprised of 136 articles assembled into three sections. Right from the first section -- the common general provisions, and the first chapter -- the electorate -- we enter into what constitutes one of the major themes of the current political debate. Article 3 tells us that, naturally, Ivorian nationals are the voters, but in addition there are also "non-nationals from the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS], in conformity with the agreement relating to citizenship in the community, and shall be registered on the voters' list." Voting by ECOWAS nationals is presented by the government as an innovation in the explanatory text. Thus "voting is no longer, as in the past, reserved for non-Ivorians of African origin, but only for nationals of ECOWAS member countries, in conformity with the agreement...." Unfortunately, a good number of jurists unanimously admit that the ECOWAS protocol does not confer any legal rights on ECOWAS citizens. The recognition of ECOWAS citizen's rights is left to the discretion of ECOWAS member countries but that does not make them legal. The protocol does not define the rights that ECOWAS nationals can enjoy once they are outside their own country, especially when they are in another ECOWAS member country. Simply put, the citizenship referred to in the protocol has never been defined let alone granting any electoral rights to citizens. Certainly, the protocol mentions the free movement of persons but this does not imply the automatic granting of civic rights. The jurists view, coupled with the fact that only three countries have signed the famous protocol, shows that the government might need other arguments to support its action short of imposing its electoral code. Again, Mr. Oulaye is of the view that Article 3 poses three kinds of problems in regard to ethics and safeguarding national sovereignty. First, foreigners have voted in Cote d'Ivoire from 1960 to 1990 in violation of Article 5 of the Constitution which reserves voting rights exclusively for Ivorians. Our lawmakers who have so far passed electoral laws have done so without amending the Constitution. They were fully aware of the unconstitutionality of their action. However, they did take care to ensure that those electoral laws were provisional. Curiously, however, the new electoral law is not a provisional but a definite law. According to Mr. Oulaye, the government does not want to amend the Constitution. It wants to pass a law that clearly violates the Constitution -- it is fully aware of the fact -- whereas it would be more logical to amend the Constitution or to adapt the new law to it. From the ethical standpoint, foreigners are generally more exposed to pressure, manipulation, and intimidation. The fact that foreigners are more vulnerable psychologically paves the way for fraud in which some relish. What is still more serious is the fact that ECOWAS citizens, who may be called upon to vote, are not obliged to face the consequences of their electoral act. In the event of a tragedy -- in the extreme case of a civil war for example -- other countries will come and collect their nationals while Ivorians, who have nowhere to go, will at best be granted refugee status. Here lies the difference which is not at all a small one. Another major concern that Article 3 will surely cause is the failure to indicate the duration of stay which makes an ECOWAS citizen eligible to vote. The ECOWAS citizen is simply being asked to register to vote. It is easily imagined that only one trip is enough for an ECOWAS citizen to qualify to vote in Cote d'Ivoire especially when it is common knowledge that the voters register is classified as a secret state document which the public can access only on election day. One can just imagine the implications. Moreover, the document is full of contradictions and discrimination. Although an ECOWAS citizen -- even the one who is just passing through -- is allowed to vote, Article 5 paragraph 1 states that "those who have acquired Ivorian nationality for less than five years or by marriage" do not have the right to vote. So, a period of five years is necessary for those who have the courage to apply for Ivorian citizenship and who are therefore prepared to fulfill their obligations and to face the consequences of their decision to accept this status, to be eligible to vote. Mr. Oulaye agrees that all laws more or less fix a deadline for eligibility to vote which is five years in the case of Cote d'Ivoire, just the timeframe necessary to show one's patriotism. However, Mr. Oulaye does not understand why restrictions should be imposed on a person who wants to be Ivorian whereas nothing is required of a foreigner, who is just passing through Cote d'Ivoire and whose vote can upset our political system. "Is there something in the wind?" The question needs to be raised because the provisions of this bill are far from reflecting the earlier concerns expressed by the PDCI during its recent conclave where it was stated, notably: "Concerning the issue of voting by foreigners, it is necessary to state and specify that naturalization at a foreigner's request and in conformity with preconditions that are yet to be defined, might be the most appropriate solution in so far as applicants have economic interests in our country." Who stands to gain from this change in stand just a few months ahead of the elections? Clearly, the debate will be rowdy and bitter even outside the Parliament buildings where the bill is expected to be debated. One often forgets that Cote d'Ivoire is one of the few countries where nearly half of the population is made up of men and women who have chosen to live in this country without, for that matter, opting for Ivorian nationality. This percentage, which is far above what is termed the tolerance level, is problematic and requires a certain amount of realism that excludes demagogy, passion, and electoral concerns. It might be the best way of preparing the ground for xenophobia which will not fail to be expressed at the least provocation. The intentions of the bill's authors appear to be even less clear when Articles 7 and 8 are examined. According to Article 7, the voters register shall be unique, permanent, and public...and shall be placed at the disposal of all voters. Thus, we learn that the voters register shall be made public. This implies that the administration is not compelled to publish it. It is up to voters to go to the administration to consult the register, an extra effort that men and women of our towns and villages will be expected to make. The establishment of a voters register is too serious and complex an issue for its sensitization aspect to be neglected, unless...and talking about the voters register, Interior Minister Bombet has officially announced the beginning of the revision of the voters register to prefects and mayors but it is only at Territorial Administration Director Ipaud Lago's office and at some obscure places in Abidjan that one is aware of this exercise, where posters (apparently) aimed at informing the general public, indicate how to register, where to register, who should register, how to check on one's registration, and so on. Too bad for those who do not know where to find Mr. Ipaud Lago's office and other chosen places. Finally, looking at Article 13 of the bill which says: "The modalities for establishing, revising, rectifying, publishing, and displaying the voters register shall be determined by a decree issued at a cabinet meeting," everything becomes understandable and explainable. Thus, instead of a law codifying the registration and a ministerial decree taking care of the implementation of the exercise, it is the interior minister who is in charge of choosing when and how the exercise will be carried out. The whole bill is conceived in the same vein. Even provisions which would be more or less acceptable to everybody are immediately nullified because in the final analysis it is the interior minister who will issue a decree on its implementation. The setting up of a voters register commission, whose functions will be determined by ministerial decree is envisaged. Furthermore, a commission for the distribution of voters cards -- an important phase in the electoral process, especially in the tropics -- will be entirely controlled by the administration which will appoint its members among whom will be dignitaries (sic) but no political party representatives. Meanwhile, all results shall be sent directly to the Interior Ministry contrary to Article 59 which states: "Each returning officer shall send a copy of the electoral report to the ministry in charge of the elections by the fastest means possible and through the head of the constituency under which his polling stations operate..." The change is certainly related to what happened in Kani during the 1990 presidential elections. In fact, that example obviously inspired the Interior Ministry's senior officials or perhaps it served as a test case at the time. The laws provide for only three electoral reports -- that of the Interior Ministry and two others exclusively reserved for the prefectural capitals and constituencies. In short, the administration is omnipresent at all stages of this bill which considerably favors foreigners as far as eligibility and ineligibility are concerned. In fact, even if they can vote, they cannot be elected. Even those who opt for Ivorian citizenship will have to wait for 10 years. They are only asked one thing: to vote. Apparently, the election bill has been purposely worked out to suit the authority controlling the major sectors of the state and administration, that is the ruling party. There is one point on which political officials may agree unanimously even if they fail to admit it openly. In fact, if the bill is passed, to contest the legislative and municipal elections, one would henceforth have to attach to one's declaration of candidacy an approval from one's party or political group in addition to a deposit of 200,000 CFA francs for those contesting the legislative elections and 10,000 CFA francs for those contesting the municipal elections. The contents of the bill are clear. It means an end to independent candidates, and especially a warning to irregular candidates from all sides. Prospective candidates must henceforth deal with party headquarters which are often touchy. They must yield to their authority or bow out. Freedom of expression within political parties will thereby suffer since politicians will now be aware that their political future no longer depends on the citizens' choice but on their party organs. Concerning the presidential elections, things are different. An independent candidate will have to pay a fixed deposit of 20 million CFA francs and be backed by 5,000 voters, that is 500 per region. Sometimes, there is a difference between the legal electoral framework and electoral practice. For that reason, should one neglect the contents of this framework and allow oneself to be guided by other concerns? In addressing deputies from the rostrum of the institution he heads, Parliament speaker Charles Bauza Donwahi called for true democracy and open elections. Will this election bill be submitted to him soon to help him achieve his goal? We doubt it, but we dare believe that the nation's representatives will use common sense in making the necessary amendments to the bill.
