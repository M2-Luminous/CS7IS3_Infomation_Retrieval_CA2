[passage omitted] We have received several phone calls. One of the callers asked about the law on former agents. [Gal] I cannot say just now. The fact is that the law will become effective from 1 July, but in my view it will be impossible to implement because the parliamentary committee elected by the previous parliament is not sufficient to start work, since the law prescribes more than one committee. Nor do I know when this parliament will have the time to select further committees -- after a due selection process. This is one side of the issue. However, another reason why we should not hurry in this matter is that I am convinced this law is unconstitutional and, in practice, unworkable. It would be best if the Constitutional Court could rule on this question as soon as possible -- as far as I know the law has been referred to the Constitutional Court -- because its ruling will be significant in resolving this situation.
