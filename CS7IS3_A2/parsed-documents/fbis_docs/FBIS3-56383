Speaking at the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow on Friday, he said the new agreement would be make it possible to send the Start-I treaty for parliamentary ratification because the conditions set in a resolution by the Supreme Soviet have now been removed. Kravchuk says his country is given assurances of security guarantees, territorial integrity, financial incentives for the weapons and help in dismantling them, and no threat of economic pressure. For its part, Moscow is committed to supply fuel grade uranium to Ukraine, minus the cost of dismantling the weapons and reprocessing the nuclear warheads, Kravchuk told Interfax. He said that experts on all sides are yet to estimate the amount and form of compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons to be withdrawn from Ukraine. One option is to write off the Ukrainian debt for fuel imports from Russia, Kravchuk said. IF [INTERFAX] Note: Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Interfax Friday that as a result of the dismantling of Ukrainian missiles Kiev would receive nuclear fuel in the form of rods for uranium reactors, but "there is no question about writing off the Ukrainian debt to Russia." In response to Kozyrev's statement his Ukrainian counterpart Anatoliy Zlenko underlined in his conversation with Interfax that this form of compensation is foreseen in the tripartite Russian- American-Ukrainian agreement on the withdrawal of nuclear missiles from the Ukraine's territory signed in Moscow. The Ukrainian leader denied allegations that his country was offered $1 billion as compensation for the withdrawal of its nuclear weapons. He said the question was not on the agenda. As a next step, said Kravchuk, Moscow and Kiev could try to resolve the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet this year, proceeding from the interests of Russia, Ukraine, and Crimea. If the two problems are removed, he said, this will help to put bilateral relations on a friendlier footing as befits partners and good neighbors.
