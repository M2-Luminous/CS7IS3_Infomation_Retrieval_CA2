FR940325-0-00023 FR940325-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 27 CFR Part 9 [T.D. ATF&hyph;356; RE: Notice No. 783] RIN 1512&hyph;AA07 The Hames Valley Viticultural Area (93F&hyph;009P) AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury. ACTION: Final rule, Treasury decision. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes a viticultural area in southern Monterey County, California, to be known as ``Hames Valley.'' The petition was submitted by Mr. Barry C. Jackson of the Harmony Wine Company on behalf of Valley Farm Management, Soledad, California, and Mr. Bob Denney & Associates, Visalia, California. The establishment of viticultural areas and the subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in wine labeling and advertising will help consumers better identify the wines they may purchase, and will help winemakers distinguish their products from wines made in other areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert White, Wine and Beer Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20226 (202&hyph;927&hyph;8230). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of definitive viticultural areas. The regulations allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an appellation of origin on wine labels and in wine advertisements. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, for the listing of approved American viticultural areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27 CFR, defines an American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an American viticultural area. Any interested person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a viticultural area. The petition should include: (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition; (b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; (c) Evidence relating to the geographical features (climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area from surrounding areas; (d) A description of the specific boundaries of the viticultural area, based on the features which can be found on United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and (e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map with the boundaries prominently marked. Petition ATF received a petition from Mr. Barry C. Jackson of the Harmony Wine Company to establish a viticultural area in southern Monterey County, California, to be known as ``Hames Valley.'' Mr. Jackson submitted the petition on behalf of Valley Farm Management, Soledad, California, and Mr. Bob Denney & Associates, Visalia, California. The Hames Valley viticultural area is located approximately three miles west of the town of Bradley and some seven miles north of Lake Nacimiento. It is located totally within the larger and previously established Monterey viticultural area. As stated in the original petition and letter from the petitioner dated April 27, 1993, there are several existing vineyards within the area that comprise approximately 630 acres planted to grapes. No wineries are currently located within the Hames Valley area. The size of the area is about sixteen square miles or approximately 10,240 acres.
