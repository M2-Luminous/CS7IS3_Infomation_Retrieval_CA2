Prathin Santipraphop has pledged the police will take legal action against Gen. Vang Pao's fighters taking refuge in Saraburi's Wat Tham Krabok and other immigration centers. Gen. Prathin said 40 Lao out of 6,096 living in Wat Tam Krabok were suspected to have military connections with Gen. Vang Pao's groups. "I have ordered metropolitan and provincial police, including state agencies concerned, to inspect whether the Laotian anti-government members are living in the immigration centers in the northern and northeastern provinces," he said. "These people will be arrested and brought to court," said Gen. Prathin. "This includes Lao illegal immigrants." He said the illegal immigrants would be deported to their home country after being prosecuted. The chief ordered police to search for more evidence to prove that Gen. Vang Pao and Gen. Thonglit Chokbengboun had been using Thailand as the base to mastermind subversive activities against the Lao government. Gen. Prathin's pledge to arrest the rebels came after the military filed charges against Gen. Vang Pao, claiming the movements of the Lao dissidents in Thailand had shaken national security and had affected the relationship between the two countries. The military yesterday arrested three Lao believed to work for Gen. Vang Pao's group. They are identified as Pa Cha Pa, Cheu Yang, and Mai Jung Yang. Pa and Cheu hold American citizenship and Mai has Australian citizenship. According to the police, after the civil war in Laos died down in 1975, the court of the then Lao government ruled that Gen. Vang Pao and Gen. Thonglit, now in exile in the United States, were war criminals. [passage omitted] Based on last year's intelligence information, the Supreme Command Headquarters discovered some Hmong ethnic people allegedly belonging to the Lao anti-government forces had been active militarily along the Thai-Lao border.
