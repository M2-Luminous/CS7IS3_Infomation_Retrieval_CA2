FBIS4-56297 "drlat085_c_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-085 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 MEXICO Chiapas Governor Proposes Reconciliation Commission Chiapas Governor Proposes Reconciliation Commission PA0205192494 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 27 Apr 94 pp 12, 56 PA0205192494 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Report by Jose Antonio Roman] [Text] Ocosingo, Chiapas State, 26 Apr -- In an urgent appeal, Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno asked Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas; Bishop Samuel Ruiz; national and state human rights commissions; the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]; the ARIC [Rural Association of Community Interest); and even those displaced by the armed conflict to establish, together with the state government, the Agrarian Reform Secretariat, and other appropriate authorities and organizations, a commission for community reconciliation in the strife-torn area. In a new visit to the municipality that was the site of the 1 January armed conflict, the governor met with ARIC-Union of Unions [Union de Uniones] representatives and ranchers. He promised the ARIC that he will try to obtain the release of four Indians who have been in prison since May of last year in El Carmen Patate Ejido on charges of killing two soldiers. In addition, the official assured the cattlemen that he will enforce orders for the arrest of those who have occupied lands after 15 April and do his best to resolve the squatting problem. During a brief stay in this town, the governor assessed the reconstruction projects here and met at this city's Lions Club office with over 20 organizations and groups, including 16 alleged Zapatists recently released from the Cerro Hueco Prison. After having their photograph taken with the governor, the latter demanded compensation for the moral and economic hardship they suffered while being incarcerated for over three months without any charges having been made against them. The state governor agreed to grant them a loan to help them in a farming program, and that is why they went to Tuxtla Gutierrez today. In a radio message broadcast to all residents from the XEOCH radio station in this town, where the constant movement of vehicles and military troops can still be seen in the streets, the governor indicated that if the commission for community reconciliation in the strife-torn zone is created, it could become the forum for reaching agreements on minimal rules to allow reconciliation and avoid further confrontation. Lopez Moreno added that in this region it is particularly necessary to ensure that there will be no more evictions, invasions, attacks, or threats on individuals or homes, personal property, or the real estate of those living there. "We need to guarantee the free flow of people and products, mostly consumer goods and staple products and medicines," the governor said in his message, which was broadcast all day long in Tzeltal. In this new recent visit to one of the towns that was the site of January's armed conflict, Lopez Moreno asked the sides that have been summoned to respond positively to his appeal to further efforts toward seeking a dignified, just, and lasting peace and to make genuine social solidarity stronger. The governor said the commission's goal is to set up forums for consensus among all the parties in the most convenient places. "We will examine the people's problems and together we will decide what must be done. Let us put our agreement in writing and abide by it." From the radio station's small booth, surrounded by announcers, photographers, and cameramen who covered his brief working visit to the capital city of this municipality, Lopez Moreno warned that without respect it will not be possible to go anywhere unless we are prepared to let violence flare up again. "We must act with haste. If we let more time go by, later will be too late. Let us prevent a war among brothers. Let us make a new contribution to the general peace effort in the state. The commission I propose will allow us to prepare for the signing of the peace agreement so all will go smoothly and so it will take affect immediately." He then added that Chiapas residents want peace. "We want local residents to return to their jobs; to work the land; to get rid of their fear and anxiety; to travel about without fear; to be at peace in their homes; to enjoy life and the things they own; to trade and to study; in sum, we want a return to normalcy. We must resolve the problems down there based on an awareness of the new situation." The governor also mentioned last night's meeting, when the Executive Commission for Agrarian Affairs was created. "For the sake of peace and for the first time in our history, social leaders, cattlemen, bankers, and peasants met with the government last night to find together solutions to our problems, fully aware that either we are all saved or we are all lost." In the meeting with ARIC-Union of Unions delegates, president Lazaro Hernandez Vasquez voiced the concern of the people of Ocosingo and Las Margaritas at the delay in signing the peace agreements. Several delegates told the governor of the agricultural backwardness from which peasant organizations and members of ARIC suffer. The delegates requested financial assistance to buy land and implement production programs. Santiago Lorenzo Jimenez, ARIC's commissioner for reconciliation, asked the governor to intervene to secure the release of Melchor Jimenez Lopez, Antonio Lopez Jimenez, Manuel Lara Ruiz, and Tiburcio Ruiz Lara, who have been held in the Cerro Hueco prison since May of last year when two military men died during an armed confrontation with "several unidentified individuals."
