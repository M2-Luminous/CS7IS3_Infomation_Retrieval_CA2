FBIS4-52576 "dreas091_j_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 Indonesia * Suharto on Political, Economic, Trade Issues * Suharto on Political, Economic, Trade Issues * Concerned About Lack of Unity in Golkar 94SE0115A Jakarta SUARA KARYA in Indonesian 29 Mar 94 pp 1, 8 94SE0115A Jakarta SUARA KARYA Indonesian CSO [Text] Suharto, chairman of GOLKAR's [Functional Groups Organization] Development Board, has asked for an increase in coordination, integration and communication among the three tracks, A, B and C, within the Greater GOLKAR Community. Coordination among these three tracks must be carried out periodically, or if possible constantly, using the principles of mutual respect and openness by creating close relationships among the tracks so that joint social and GOLKAR problems can be solved quickly. Suharto, chairman of GOLKAR's Development Board and president of the Republic of Indonesia, expressed these thoughts in his written recommendations delivered by Azwar Anas, the coordinator of GOLKAR's Development Board's Duty Presidium, at the opening of the 1994 National Working Meeting (RAKERNAS) of GOLKAR's DPP [Executive Board], which took place in the auditorium of the DPP offices in Slipi, Jakarta, yesterday morning. The top leader of track A, General of the Army Feisal Tandjung, and of track B, Minister of the Interior Mohammad Yogie S. Memet, also attended the opening ceremonies. Besides stressing the importance of unity among the three tracks, the Chairman of the Development Board also advised all of GOLKAR's cadres on the proper attitude to take towards various political issues which are now critical to our society. One of them is the issue of the undercurrent. The Undercurrent Mr Suharto said that the issue of the undercurrent, which has continued to develop recently and which has become a tough problem for the Greater GOLKAR Community, must be overcome immediately because it will eventually damage GOLKAR. The Development Board believes that basically no undercurrent is developing. "A small number of people have misused the name of the many and have called themselves the undercurrent," he said. What is actually happening is a kind of manipulation because in fact those politics are no different from various kinds of manipulation. Speaking about the issues of collusion and other defalcations which have surfaced recently, the chairman of the Development Board asked GOLKAR to be capable of anticipating and overcoming them in accordance with the constitution and the laws based on PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation]. At the same time, GOLKAR must continue to push for the creation of a professional, honest, clear and authoritative government apparatus as the servant of the state and of the people, ready to protect, serve as a model for, serve and value the rights and obligations of every citizen without exception. This apparatus must avoid provocative actions which have no basis in facts or figures but must be based on the rule of law. Speaking of the problem of succession, which the mass media has discussed a lot recently, Mr Soeharto reminded the audience that we should always be guided by the constitution which was approved by the people through the MPR [People's Consultative Council]. The Development Board believes that a lot of fuss should not be made over this issue because there already is a mechanism for succession, i.e., the five-year leadership mechanism. "Through this forum GOLKAR's cadres should be able to explain this to the broader public in the provinces," he affirmed. The Chairman of the Development Board also reminded the audience that the excellent record already achieved at each general election must be maintained and this can at the same time be a counter to the issue of the single majority developed by the other side. The issue of the majority and the possibility that a dictatorship of the majority will arise are false. "Because after five victories we have not become dictators; in fact, we have always valued the opinions of the masses and have accommodated their aspirations," he said. General Election Laws Another matter about which we must be cautious, said the Chairman of the Development Board, is the other side's desire to reconsider and change the present general-election laws. The Development Board believes that the existing general-election laws are still sufficiently relevant to current conditions and therefore should be maintained. GOLKAR's victories in five general elections are proof that the people trust GOLKAR so much that they channel their aspirations to GOLKAR. The people's trust cannot be ignored. "It is the task of GOLKAR's cadres to continue to build up GOLKAR support so that in the upcoming 1997 general elections supporters will continue to put their support and confidence in GOLKAR again," said Mr Suharto. In facing these problems, said Mr Suharto, we must really develop GOLKAR cadres, those in the legislative ranks, in the administration and in the social and professional/functional organizations; organizational discipline must continually be increased. "Long before making a decision, the coordination of the three tracks must be increased," he warned. Instructions about decisions already agreed to in the capital must be given to and implanted in the provinces so that the same consensus is reached in both the capital and the provinces. As part of the effort to win the upcoming 1997 general elections, according to the directives issued by GOLKAR's Development Board, the provinces in which there was a decline in GOLKAR votes in the 1992 general elections must be evaluated as soon as possible. GOLKAR must pay the most attention to the cultivation of those provinces. Preparations must be made to cultivate public issues in the form of real actions which GOLKAR raises and realizes. Mr Suharto said that cultivating supporters person by person must be based on principle of no day is to pass without cultivating supporters through the following approach: each GOLKAR cadre is obliged to develop GOLKAR supporters, at the very least those who live "on the same mattress," "in the same kitchen" and "use the same well". In addition, efforts must be made to cultivate new voters, of whom there will be 21 million at the upcoming 1997 general elections. One way to cultivate them is for every DPD II [Provincial Parliament] to hold a yearly hiking contest for Junior High School and Senior High School students and for vocational schools at the same level, the prize being a one-year scholarship. Mr Suharto also reminded the audience that capable, well-known campaigners capable of attracting public support must be gotten ready as soon as possible. GOLKAR Cadres In carrying out provincial duties, the Chairman of GOLKAR's Development Board urged that each and every task be carried out with an attitude of unity, harmony and permanent communication among the members of the Greater GOLKAR Community. Besides that, GOLKAR cadres in the ranks of the legislature and in the professions and functional groups must also increase their sensitivity so as to be able to grasp and realize the aspirations developing within society. "Because an inability to grasp and fight for the aspirations living and developing within society might harm GOLKAR in the future," affirmed Mr Suharto. At the same time, any policy considered harmful to society or the actions of any tainted figure must be prevented as soon as possible. GOLKAR's caderization, said Mr Suharto, must produce the following vision and ideal: GOLKAR is always prepared to respond to challenges and is always responsive to the needs of the people. Without that condition, caderization is merely ceremonial action and only follows the words of the constitution but neglects its spirit. In this respect, GOLKAR is being tested. Can it regain the trust not only its traditional supporters but also of the 21 million new voters in the 1997 general elections? Speaking of cadre management, the Chairman of GOLKAR's Development Board suggested that data on membership and cadres be updated immediately and accurately, emphasizing the recruitment of quality cadres. Putting the education and training of cadres on a firm footing must be implemented in an integrated, planned, guided, graduated and uninterrupted way. These initiatives include tools for evaluating the achievements of cadres and the compilation of criteria for that purpose, as well as assigning tasks to cadres in a conceptional way. A National Viewpoint Mr Suharto reminded the audience that GOLKAR must continue to strengthen its commitment to PANCASILA, which is to be implemented by its being in the forefront of instilling and implementing PANCASILA. The purpose of this is to heighten vigilance and to make an effort to counter various ways of thinking, concepts and ideologies which are in conflict with or not in accordance with PANCASILA, and which are being practiced by certain parties, in particular the intensive efforts being made in various ways by certain parties to inject ways of thinking, concepts and ideologies which are not in accordance with PANCASILA. For that reason, GOLKAR must also strengthen its commitment to instilling a national viewpoint which is reflected in the patterns of thought, action, work and works which have a national viewpoint. Efforts to strengthen this national viewpoint continue to show their relevance because of the two contradictory trends which have affected the world in our times. First, the trend towards globalization marked by a trend towards a uniformity of value systems, patterns of thought, work, and production. The second trend is an atavistic attitude and a narrow concept of nation. Such a concept is now affecting certain regions and nations so that tendencies in that direction have succeeded in splitting apart a nation and state and eventually that nation and state disappears from the world political map. "We have had a lot of experience with that and we don't want to undergo that again," he said. Efforts to put that national viewpoint on a firm footing show the relevance of government programs to eradicate poverty. That is why the Development Board invites all parties to foster and develop feelings of social solidarity with those who live below the poverty line, with those who always suffer catastrophes and natural disasters and with the less fortunate. The National Working Meeting which opened yesterday will end on 31 March. Except for the opening and closing ceremonies, all activities are closed to the mass media. Harmoko, General Chairman of GOLKAR's DPP; Army General Feisal Tandjung, Chairman of track A of the Greater GOLKAR Community; Minister of the Interior Mohammad Yogie S. Memet, Chairman of track B of the Greater GOLKAR Community; and Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Minister of National Development Planning and Chairman of BAPPENAS [National Planning Board] gave briefings at the National Working Meeting.
