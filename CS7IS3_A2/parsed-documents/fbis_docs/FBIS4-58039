A paper editorial said that viewpoints of President Nixon toward Iraq, which were reflected in his book had equalled between the danger of Iraq to the West with that of the Soviet Union and pointed out that Bill Clinton insists on obstructing the lifting of the embargo so that Iraq would not resume its liberation role for peace, stability and justice in the region. The paper said that Nixon, in his book admits that the influence of Saddam Husayn's Iraq bypasses its geographic size and makes it in the same level of influence of the Soviet Union toward international events. The Iraqi paper further said that the former American president added in his book that Saddam Husayn's Iraq and the Soviet Union represented the most significant dangers and challenges that had faced the world. It explained that Nixon assessments were based on various political and geopolitical realities that could not be concealed, prominent among which is that Iraq is considered one of the few countries that would have an essential role in world economy, the world technological growth and the balances of regional and international forces. Referring to the factor of oil, the paper said that oil is an effective power in the hand of Iraq and that oil would remain the major source of energy in the world for another century and consequently the one who dominates oil would have an effective role in the world of tomorrow. AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper said the second effective power is technology which started to be acquired by most nations and had minimized the importance of some countries that had technological supermacy. The paper added that patriotic policy also influences the role of countries in international events and that the independent political course of some world countries has become a giant power feared by the big powers which try to place the world under their hegemony. The paper linked this reality with the plots and aggressive plans and said that America resolved to destroy countries that maintain an independent course like Yugoslavia and that its attempts with Iraq had failed. AL-JUMHURIYAH expressed conviction over having oil as a strong weapon in the hands of Iraq alongside other weapons for the sake of confirming its effective role and position in the region and said that the independent policy of Iraq represents the basic guarantee for having oil away from imperialist domination and turning technology into a striking power in steadfastness and progress. The paper said that all those facts interpreted Nixon outlook toward Iraq and were represented in the fact that Saddam Husayn's iraq constitutes an obstacle that could not be removed before the attempts of American imperialism dominates the world and that is why we see Clinton insists on obstructing the lifting of the embargo imposed on Iraq.
