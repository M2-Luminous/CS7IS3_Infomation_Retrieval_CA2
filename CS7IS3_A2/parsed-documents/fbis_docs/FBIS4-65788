At the end of the year, in connection with the party congress, a decision will be made on how to continue from here with the bankrupt Finnish Communist Party (SKP). Last Thursday [21 April], SKP(Y) made public a new draft for a party program. The draft emphasizes "a new kind of socialism and a humane civilization." Revolutionary Goal Still Alive According to Yrjo Hakanen, chairman of the SKP(Y), who presented the draft, the goal of a socialist revolution is still intact. However, the collapse of the USSR has changed the concept of revolution. Hakanen noted that we learned from the example of the USSR that seizing power is not the same thing as implementing socialism. "We need the creation of a fundamentally different democratic use of power in our society. For example, based on the experiences in the USSR, there has been an inclination to view matters strictly from the perspective of the state and the governing of the state. We want to emphasize the use of power by individuals themselves. The development of individual ways of influencing and a new type of society of citizens is unavoidable." According to Hakanen, it is not enough anymore to move into the government or to be part of the state machinery. "It is easy then for matters to move out of the control of the citizens, and thus there is a tendency for events to turn against people." SKP(Y) proposes a "new and radical program." According to this, markets and capital flow should be subjected to democratic guidance, the banks should be nationalized, and workers should be given greater opportunities for influence. The government should be turned into a "government of democratic change, which would be guided by the needs of people and not by the requirements of the markets." Six-Hour Workday According to the program, the general workday should be shortened to six hours. Thus employment will improve. Shortening the workday without decreasing earnings is possible, according to the program, as work would become more productive and profits would be distributed in a new manner. Individual companies would, among other things, be responsible for the employment of people. Correspondingly, society would ensure that companies could continue to operate. Cooperation Instead of Alliances Existing gender-based inequities should be eliminated, by, among other ways, eliminating the division between male and female work in the job market. According to the program, the public sector should be in the forefront of implementing equality. The size of the public sector should not be reduced. Instead, it would be its function to develop employment, regional democracy, and environmentally safe technologies, as well as guaranteeing citizens a high level of social services. On the international scene, the renewed SKP would like to develop Finland's policy of neutrality, which has "traditions that still contain much of value and worth developing." As examples of this are mentioned an active role in resolving conflicts proactively and peacefully, as well as the development of a good cooperative relationship with Russia. The program would reject membership in the European Union [EU], as this would avoid "supporting the development of new opposing political blocs and unequal structures." The program suggests that the security of Europe could be ensured by promoting disarmament and by dismantling "remnants of the Cold War, such as NATO." Final Program Taking Form A decision will be made regarding SKP's program, in connection with the party congress at the end of the year. The communists want to debate the matter, based on which the final program will take shape. The new program will replace SKP's old program. According to Hakanen, the date of the party congress will not be set until the date of the popular referendum regarding membership in the EU is known. Because of the campaign against the EU, the party leadership does not want to take any chances by having the congress convene around the time of the plebiscite. Hakanen stated that SKP(Y)'s view is that if the party congress accepts their concepts, there will be no need for a separate SKP(Y) any more, and "the communists in this country will act in the name of SKP."
