Court officers personally visited the deputies to the Municipal People's Congress and People's Political Consultative Conference, asking them to choose one of three descriptions of Yu: "well-meaning peasant", "generally good but with small faults", or "ignorant village moneybags". "More than 80 per cent of the delegates chose `ignorant village moneybags' (tuchan zhu)," a source said. "This proved to the court that nobody would protest against a stiff sentence." Yu had been the head of the inordinately wealthy Daqiuzhuang village near Tianjin. Unconfirmed reports at the time of his sentencing suggested that Yu's case was taken all the way to the Politburo because lower-level legal functionaries believed that Yu had the personal protection of a senior Chinese leader. The main reason for the delay in sentencing Yu was uncertainty about the popular response to throwing the book at the once-praised peasant hero, the source said. But the poll dispelled all doubts. "This gave them confidence that the sentence would not be contentious as were many of those passed after June 4," he said, referring to harsh sentences dished out to Tianjin students after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which had caused resentment in the city. Yu was sentenced to 10 years for bribery, six years for harbouring criminals, three years for obstructing justice and a total of six years for unlawful detention and control of others in a case involving the beating to death of a village worker in December 1992. Some of the terms will be served concurrently. In publicity surrounding his trial, mainland media repeatedly criticised Yu and the 25 village henchmen sentenced along with him for their disrespect for and ignorance of the law. Two weeks ago, China's procurator general, Zhang Siqing, mentioned Yu's case in his national work report as an example of "the small number of judicial officials and grass roots cadres who abuse their authority and detain people unlawfully." However, the Daqiuzhuang issue remains a sensitive political topic in Tianjin, where officials have already quashed a proposal from the city's agricultural research institute to launch a study on "the Yu Zuomin Phenomenon in China". "It was believed this would go against Beijing's policy that Yu Zuomin should be treated as an isolated case which does not invalidate the economic achievements of many other rich villages whose leaders have a boldness of vision," a government researcher in the city said. Yu is understood to be under tight guard at a rural Tianjin jail, where he complains about a lack of birds nest soup and Yunnan cigarettes. While under detention, Yu was accused of offering "tens of thousands of yuan" to bribe a court official to reveal details of the investigation. Meanwhile, sources said Daqiuzhuang has been reopened to foreign visitors after a one-year off-limits policy. "The clan atmosphere has been done away with following the appointment of outsiders to take over," the source said. "Tianjin leaders feel it is safe to open it again." Experienced cadres from Jinghai county, which includes Daqiuzhuang, have been brought in to take over. The government and party posts have been split to prevent a recurrence of the autocratic style of rule of Yu Zuomin, who was concurrently party secretary, village head and general manager of its main enterprise holding company. Ou Binju, former deputy director of Jinghai's foreign trade bureau, is the new mayor, while Wei Zongjing, former assistant county head of Jinghai, is the new party secretary. Daqiuzhuang was promoted from a village to a town in November, giving it more access to public infrastructure spending, the source said. The village's economy, meanwhile, is showing signs of recovery from the incident, which idled many of its 300 factories in the first half of last year. Ou told the People's Daily last month that residual problems caused by the factory shutdowns had been resolved by July or August last year. "But the greatest change in Daqiuzhuang is among the people," he said. "When the people meet with the business leaders of the village no longer do they meet the arrogant manner of the past." The town aimed to increase its total output by 34 percent to 7.5 billion renminbi in 1994, Ou said.
