And in the same way that we see Macao as the springboard for Portuguese businesses into China, I believe Portugal can play a similar role in allowing Chinese businessmen into the European community. I have also emphasized to the Chinese authorities our support for the full integration of China in the international economic, trade, and financial system. To this end we have been advocating and will continue to advocate China's full membership of the GATT system. [end recording] Our special correspondent in Beijing, Feliciano Estevao, reports in connection with Cavaco Silva's speech: [Begin Estevao recording] It is true that Cavaco Silva has given much to the Chinese authorities. For one thing he has volunteered his image and prestige in support of the cause of China's penetration of the EU's markets. As is known, in the aftermath of the Tiananmen events, China was banished from the political diaries of the EC countries. Second, Portugal supports the normalization of relations between the European Union and China. Cavaco Silva is of the view that there is no longer any justification for continuing to enforce sanctions, namely those banning visits by heads of state and monarchs to the People's Republic of China. Third, Cavaco Silva has unhesitantly advocated China's integration in the international economic and financial system, namely its membership of GATT. [end recording]
