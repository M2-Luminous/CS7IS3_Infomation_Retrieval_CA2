In an educational seminar held for its students, by the Higher Institute for Political Science, Salman spoke on the firm principles of the Syrian policy under President Hafiz al-Asad's historic leadership in terms of domestic construction and political and economic multiplicity, and in terms of the Arab solidarity and strengthening the Arab people against the cultural invasion to which they are being exposed. Salman spoke about the peace process and its repercussions and on obstacles that are preventing its progress. He said: Syria supported the peace initiative because it emphasized the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Syria's insistence on a comprehensive solution stems from its firm pan-Arab principles. This was manifested at the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Bill Clinton where Al-Asad represented the Arabs' stand and desires and the U.S. Administration announced its intention to realize comprehensive peace on all tracks of the conflict. The minister refuted the motives of the tendentious campaigns of Israel, the Zionist Lobby, and the media that are sympathetic to them. He said the aim of these campaigns is to change the firm and pan-Arab position of Syria, whose Arab and international role has grown under President al-Asad's leadership. This has been voiced by the Arab media which are daily reiterating that Syria is the symbol of the pan-Arab struggle and the honest helmsman of the Arab ship sailing toward the future. At the end of the meeting, Salman answered questions by students participating in the seminar. Answering a question, Salman said: I hope Rabin's announcement on withdrawal from the Golan will be free of land mines which we have always encountered in every session of talks in which the principle of withdrawal from all the occupied territories in exchange for peace was discussed.
