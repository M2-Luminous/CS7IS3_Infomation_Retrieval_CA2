What is your opinion about the solution proposed by the Partnership for Peace to the East European countries and about a possible access of our country to the North Atlantic Alliance? [Spiroiu] Well, there have been long preparations for that meeting. As you know, there was also a meeting at Travemunde in October. This is a meeting whose importance is determined by the fact that, in practical terms, it will make official -- so to say -- a viewpoint of the Alliance about the future of the Alliance and mainly about the future position regarding the acceptance of Central and Eastern European countries in NATO. As is known, I have already mentioned it before that it is not the Romanian Army that joins NATO, but Romania, and this is Romania's foreign policy promoted by the competent bodies as stipulated by the Constitution. The Army and the Ministry of National Defense do nothing else but follow this foreign policy and thus prepare the necessary elements to enable our military body to integrate into the security structures that it will join, namely NATO, the Western European Union, as well as other structures. Thus, it is important for the Romanian Army that, by following Romania's foreign policy, it should make the necessary preparations for ensuring the compatibility of our military body with the military bodies of the countries that belong to the Alliance. Here I am referring to compatibility in the area of structures, the decisionmaking system, political control of civilian society over the military field, training programs, and ultimately also the equipment, an element that will be achieved gradually, as soon as necessary conditions will be created for it. In this respect one might say that the reform process in the Army that has been carefully prepared -- preparations for this reform finalized at around the end of 1992 and its implementation started as early as 1993 -- and includes all these areas, starting with the legislative area up to the other areas that I have mentioned before, does nothing else but make our military body ready so that when the political decision for our country to join the NATO or the security structures, even on the basis of partnership is taken, we should be prepared for it. All I can say is that the Army has taken steps in this direction. Certainly, the Partnership for Peace elevates to a new level the partnership that has existed so far within the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC], that was set up after 1991, that is, after November 1991. Why am I saying that it elevates the partnership to a new level? Because, this time we are no longer talking about a collective relation, that is, to join collectively these programs within the NACC, but about a bilateral option, namely, the option of each state to have access to this Partnership for Peace, certainly by fulfilling certain conditions. And all I can tell you is the fact that what we have been doing in the field of reforming the military body is perfectly valid also for the Partnership for Peace. Thus, if the meeting that is taking place today and tomorrow in Brussels and that is attended by heads of states and governments will adopt this idea of Partnership for Peace, I believe that Romania, and mainly the Romanian Army -- since I can only talk on behalf of the Army -- will fulfill the necessary conditions to enable the competent political bodies to take steps toward this partnership on a bilateral basis for peace. [Reporter] Mr. Minister, do you believe that it is desirable to have one step or several steps in the process of joining NATO? [Spiroiu] It would be a great mistake to have several steps. I have already stated, if I am not mistaken in the interview that I granted to the daily ROMANIA LIBERA, or even in the newspaper of the government that any type of discrimination would create distrust and suspicion again and would bring about a feeling of marginalization or isolation, which would be counterproductive in view of the establishment of security in this area. Thus, I believe -- but I have to repeat that the decision rests with the political bodies -- that every country should have equal security in this area, without discrimination, without new frontiers, a sphere of security in which one should take into account the interests of Russia and the independence of Ukraine. In general, I personally believe that these are very important elements for the establishment of European regional security, thus the zone that includes also Romania. Thus, this is very important.
