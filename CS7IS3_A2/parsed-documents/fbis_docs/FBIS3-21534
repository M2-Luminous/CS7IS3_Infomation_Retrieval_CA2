The plant used to produce launchers for medium- and shorter-range missiles. The inspection was made within the framework of the Treaty on Medium- and Shorter-Range Missiles joined by Kazakhstan after disintegration of the former Soviet Union. The republic has a quota on sending its inspectors to the United States and an obligation to admit U.S. representatives to Kazakh facilities liable for inspection. The inspection was the first of the sort in sovereign Kazakhstan. It was held in an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual respect thanks to the correct stand of the Kazakh Defence Ministry's accompanying team on treaty obligations, said the Americans. The experts are sure Kazakhstan will continue to fully observe its military obligations.
