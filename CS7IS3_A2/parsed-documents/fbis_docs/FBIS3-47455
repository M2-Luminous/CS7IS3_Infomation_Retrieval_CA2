The source made this disclosure on 9 January. Concerning Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China, Hata and Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, had earlier agreed at their 8 January meeting in Beijing on working out plans for Hosokawa's visit at an early date. In the backdrop of the prime minister's making firm his intention to visit China as early as March is the fact that although he has visited the United States and the ROK since his inauguration, he still has not visited China, which, along with the United States, is a focal point of Japanese diplomacy. Furthermore, Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to work out details regarding the total value of the planned yen loan to China -- the fourth such loan program -- which Foreign Minister Hata put on the rails during his visit there. Regarding the schedule of Hosokawa's visit, Chinese officials have requested a 3-day visit starting 19 January. Japanese officials, however, are working primarily around a plan for a visit on 20-21 March, taking advantage of consecutive holidays. This plan also takes into consideration the schedule of Diet sessions, among other matters.
