The agents, calling themselves the Group of 23, were gagged last week by the Transvaal Supreme Court following an urgent interdict by Modise against them and the WEEKLY MAIL. The interdict was withdrawn by Modise this week. According to court papers, he feared that the disgruntled former Directorate of Covert Collection spies would make public names of their former informants. These were believed to include senior Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; MK] officers who are in line for high-ranking posts in the new SA [South Africa] National Defence Force [SANDF]. In an earlier letter to President Nelson Mandela, the group urged government to redress their "unfair dismissal" from the former MI front company Pan Afrik Industrial Investment Consultants (PAIIC). They asked that they be re-employed by the SANDF, or that they be paid compensation, despite having received retrenchment packages equivalent to 18 months' salary tax free. The former spies also wanted to be cleared for any alleged third force activities following a Goldstone commission raid on PAIIC's offices and a subsequent statement by former President FW de Klerk in 1992. De Klerk's statement resulted in 11 MI members being placed on early retirement and the closure of the front company. Forty-nine PAIIC employees were retrenched and the front company closed. Verbeek said Attorney-General Jan D'Oliveira's investigations after Goldstone's raid had failed to produce any evidence of criminal activities in the ranks of the directorate. He said that only four of the spies had identified themselves. Verbeek said that although MI was still involved in covert operations outside SA, the directorate no longer had any front organisations in SA.
