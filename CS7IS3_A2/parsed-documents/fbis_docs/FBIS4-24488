In the past dozen years, many new oil deposits have been discovered there and new oil-extraction techniques have been developed, so that now the oilfield again radiates the vigor of youth. For several years running, the oilfield's annual crude oil output has showed a yearly average increase of 300,000 tons. Last year, the oilfield produced 7.6 million tons of crude oil. For the past four years its output has been the fourth largest in China. Karamay oilfield was established at a deserted place -- with no grass, water or even a bird -- in the north-west part of the Junggar Basin in north-west China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Its first well started to produce crude oil on October 29, 1955. The annual output of the oilfield reached 1.6 million tons in 1960. But by the mid 1970s the oil output started to drop and no new deposits had been found. The oilfield was thought to be declining. The people in Karamay were worried about their future. When the Chinese Central Government started to adopt the policy of reform and opening to the world in 1979, the people at the Karamay oilfield were greatly encouraged. They launched a drive to tap the potential of the old area of the oilfield and open up new parts. Karamay is rich in reserves of heavy oil. Since the oil seam is close to the surface, the light elements and gases of the oil had volatilized long ago. So the oil looks like asphalt and is difficult to extract. In the light of advanced foreign and domestic technology, technical personnel at Karamay oilfield overcame a series of difficulties and succeeded in extracting the oil by injecting vapour into the oil below ground. As a result, the oilfield's output of heavy oil increased greatly and has stabilized at 1.5 million tons annually for three consecutive years. The technicians also used the latest technology to re-analyze the prospecting data of the old area of the oilfield, discovering three layers of oil deposits in the strata above and below the old oil- bearing stratum, thus paving the way for increasing the oil output in the old area. The oil experts and technicians, using advanced prospecting technology and equipment, discovered and opened up several new oil-bearing areas, including the Fengchen, Xiazejie, Dongpaizi, Maozhuang and Huoshaoshan oilfields. The oil output of the new oilfields has surpassed one million tons a year. As its oil output increases, Karamay has also developed its own oil-processing industries. The oilfield is now capable of refining 5.45 million tons of crude oil per year and producing over 190 oil products, 39 of which meet international standards. More than 20 of them are exported to Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and many countries and regions in South-East Asia. A plant to produce 140,000 tons of ethylene annually is now being built, due to be completed next year. Experts noted that with completion of the project, Karamay will again enter a golden age, both in oil production and oil refining.
