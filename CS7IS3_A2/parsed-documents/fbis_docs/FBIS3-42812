The government's unexpected reorganization opens up definite opportunities for restoring civil peace and achieving social harmony on the main social and economic policy avenues for the sake of the population and the state. It cannot be ruled out that this is the last chance which, if not used, will put us into the irreversible process of unleashing an avalanche of social conflicts and the disintegration of society. The executive branch, which has put itself above society and the law since September of last year, should take the first step. Only one true avenue exists for this step and creates the preconditions for achieving success. It is made up of the following components. First. The government should propose a program to get the country out of its crisis -- a program that could become the basis for achieving social harmony and consolidating the efforts of a majority of the population's active layers. Such a program should provide for concrete measures understood by everyone and aimed at reviving economic activity and increasing responsibility for effective management. First of all, order should be introduced in the state administration itself. It is necessary to establish control over the management of state property, the use of natural resources and state finances, the observance of foreign trade laws, and the functioning of the infrastructure. Establishing control assumes not only overcoming mismanagement and corruption but also introducing clear-cut and rather strict responsibility for the efficient use of state property and the proper performance of state control functions. Introducing order in the management of state property and finances and establishing control over the use of natural resources and the observance of foreign trade laws will permit the state's income to be increased considerably and the discipline of state expenditures to be raised. It will provide an opportunity to understand once and for all the real redistribution flows of resources and national wealth. This will permit opportunities to be found for conducting an effective policy in the area of stimulating the development of scientific and industrial potentials and a social and structural policy. Such a policy could include: determining the priorities in structurally reorganizing the economy, adopting state programs for their realization, establishing special financial development institutions to stimulate investment activity, and rationalizing the tax system and the existing social insurance system. This set of measures should replace the cellular distribution policy for preferential credits and budget appropriations, which is extremely convenient for those who love to fish in troubled waters and which is inaccessible to any honest examination. Credit emission should be put in order and formalized so that credits to finance the national economy will reach production facilities and contribute to realizing the priorities of the economy's structural reorganization and not whirl around in commercial bank accounts, incredibly enriching the people participating in their distribution. A clear and sound structural policy should replace the present vague practice of granting benefits and privileges to court firms and branches and the administration of state expenditures according to the principle: "We will give to this but we will not give to that." State purchases and the granting of benefits should be done clearly in accordance with structural reorganization programs and in accordance with a clearly tested and dependable procedure that excludes the arbitrariness of bureaucrats. Conducting an effective policy to revive the economy assumes not only introducing order into the executive branch system but also establishing the appropriate preconditions in industrial production organizations. The extraordinarily rapid and massive privatization of a large part of the state enterprises has brought about the destruction of the large production associations, which produced complicated types of products, and the formation of an eroded and extremely ineffective structure of property relationships. Today, the country's economy consists of barely viable production and economic units, which are poorly linked with each other and which are being formed in place of large production associations. They do not possess the production flexibility required to survive on their own and belong to a nebulous group of stockholders consisting of labor collective members, the enterprise board of directors and the retainers of the local bodies of authority. If one considers that the overwhelming majority of banks belong to state and privatized enterprises, it is not difficult to diagnose -- as a result of the massive privatization, we have received a property relationship structure that is closer to the Yugoslav model of the 1970s than to that of a developed country with a market economy. This model is characterized by economic inefficiency (the eating away of profits, low investment and innovation activity, strong pressure for an increase in credit emissions, and high inflation) and political danger (the economic foundation for separatist movements and the disintegration of the country's economic space). The set of measures required to rationalize the industrial production structure and correct the violations in production cooperation and the gaps in the technological chains for manufacturing complicated products, which have occurred as a result of the adopted privatization model, includes: eliminating limitations on vertical integration and the reintegration of related enterprises (including amalgamations, cross-ownership of stock shares, liquidations, the organization of holding companies, etc.), removing the ban on participating in the privatization of enterprises with more than a 25-percent share of state ownership, and stimulating the establishment of financial industrial groups. The same thing pertains to the state's import and export operations. Strict implementation of already adopted decisions concerning the competitive distribution of export orders for state needs and the competitive determination of firms to deliver centralized imports and strict observance of currency laws and export control norms must be achieved. A situation where government departments, which are responsible for purchasing and distributing centrally imported goods, delay transferring the earnings from their sale to the budget for months, essentially concealing an embezzlement of state property in enormous amounts, is intolerable at a time when the payment of wages to doctors, scientists and teachers is not being done and defense orders are not being paid for under the pretext that there are not enough budget revenues. There is no possibility here to expound in detail on recommendations for forming a wise economic policy responsive to the interests of the population and the state. Its elaboration will take quite a bit of time; however, it is already important to take decisive steps now that will demonstrate the executive branch's firm intention to introduce order -- if only in its own departments -- and to stop the embezzlement of state property and violations of the law, which are prevalent both in the machinery of the federal bodies of power and in the local areas. Second. Along with the adoption of anti-crisis measures and the introduction of order into the management of state property and finances, the government should demonstrate the ability and will to solve the more acute social problems. This, first of all, concerns protecting the vulnerable layers of the population against hunger and illness (especially children, half of whom live in conditions below the subsistence minimum and are malnourished), supplying the population with housing and reconstructing available housing, preventing the destruction of the secondary and preschool educational system, maintaining large-scale medical support at an acceptable level, and preparing for refugees from the former union republics. It is also important to begin reforming the social insurance system immediately. Third. The state's leaders should formulate an understandable idea of national rebirth, which is close to everyone. The population cannot be satisfied with abstract ideas of freedom and democracy and suffer appreciable losses for the sake of implementing poorly understood reforms. In order to achieve broad public consent and the consolidation of efforts to overcome the crisis, a popular ideology is needed -- one which would reveal the nation-wide goals of the social and economic development which the state is following in its domestic and foreign policy. Along with the ideas of freedom and the welfare of the individual, the following should be included in these goals: -- the building of a powerful Russian state capable of defending its citizens against internal and foreign threats and pursuing in the world an independent policy to protect its national interest; -- the maintaining of Russia's leading position in the area of scientific and technological development, industry, energy, and agriculture; -- the development of a national self-consciousness and the rebirth of national culture; the acquiring of a sense of national pride and historic continuity in the mass consciousness. The state's leaders should demonstrate their devotion to these goals and the ability to achieve them. The Federal Assembly, in which all major political movements and almost all subjects of the federation are represented today, should take on the main work to achieve broad social harmony regarding the prospective avenues for the country's social and economic development and the extension of the reforms. The main obstacle on this path is the ruling political grouping's line for radicalizing public opinion and splitting society, which has been in effect until recently. Right up to the 12 December elections, this line helped the radicals in government to maintain their power despite the evident failures in the social and economic policy and the pauperization of a large part of the population. The spreading of the myth of a communist threat and the lack of an alternative to the policy being conducted permitted the radicals to maintain power in 1993, successfully slip the referendum in and fire on a parliament, which the people had elected, with impunity. The elections, however, clearly demonstrated the development of a social consciousness which gradually acquired an immunity against the actions of political propaganda that would make a fool of one. The next attempt to introduce a split in society by intimidating politicians with a fascist threat also fell through. The main threat to the country and its population comes from continuing the adventurist and insufficiently considered policy, which has given birth to chaos and discord and which has led to an unprecedented drop in production and the lowering of the standard of living in peacetime. It is clear to everyone, who has not lost the ability to think soberly, that it is not the resistance by some conservative political forces to the progressive reforms but the inability to make these reforms correctly and the errors in the economic, social, regional and cultural policy that were the main reason for the swiftly deepening crisis. In order to rein in this crisis and begin to gradually extricate ourselves from the abyss, it is necessary to stop looking for enemies, admit errors, eliminate animosity, and unite the forces of all political and public organizations for the sake of preserving the main thing -- a sovereign Russian state and people. Today, the irreversible destruction of the state and the degradation of the population really threaten Russia. This process has already embraced a significant portion of the country's scientific, industrial and cultural potential. The sharpness of this threat is not a bit less than that of the threat in the time of the Great Troubles during the 16th century or, if one looks for analogies in modern history, during the time of the civil war from 1918-1919 or the winter of 1941-1942. Opposing this threat should be the main subject of concern for all authority structures and political and public movements today. The risk is too great to continue rocking the boat any more and arousing social conflicts in order to maintain power. It is necessary to extinguish political and economic radicalism of any stripe and suspend heartless radicals, adventurists and embezzlers of state property from making decisions in the executive power structures. Then, the road will be open to achieving national harmony on the general approach to carrying out social and economic transformations in the interests of the population.
