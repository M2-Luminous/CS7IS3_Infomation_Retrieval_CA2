FR940412-2-00058 FR940412-2-00039 [Docket No. OR94&hyph;7&hyph;000] Hunt Refining Co. et al.; Petition for Exemption From Jurisdictional Status April 6, 1994. Take notice that on March 17, 1994, Hunt Refining Company (Hunt) and East Mississippi Pipeline Company (East Mississippi), (referred jointly as Petitioners), filed a request that the Commission exempt the pipeline facilities of Hunt and East Mississippi from the Commission's jurisdiction on the basis that such facilities are not ``jurisdictional'' within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) but are private, proprietary systems. Petitioners submit that they are not subject to the filing requirements of sections 6 (schedule of rates and charges), 19(a) (maps and valuation data), and 20 (annual, periodic, and special reports) of the ICA. In the alternative, petitioners request that the Commission (a) exempt Hunt and East Mississippi from the filing and reporting requirements which otherwise would apply, or (b) recognize that Hunt and East Mississippi need not publish a schedule of rates and charges. The Petitioners state that the facilities for which an exemption is sought are owned entirely by Petitioners and will be utilized solely to transport crude oil to which Hunt holds title. No other refinery interconnects with the Petitioners' facilities and, due to the location and service performed by these facilities, requests for access to the facilities by any third party are extremely unlikely. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 21, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
