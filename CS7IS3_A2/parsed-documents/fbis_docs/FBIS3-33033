Defense Minister Oscar Camilion proposed a consensus agreement. Military Affairs Secretary Jorge Baeza and Planning Secretary Guillermo Etchechouri are responsible for its implementation. Thus the confrontation between the U.S. Navy on one side, and Smiths Industries and Lockheed is resolved. The two secretaries yesterday met with Brigadiers Ricardo Zini and Ricardo Coletti to discuss the participation of Lockheed in the deal without delaying the planes delivery schedule. This was the condition imposed by the Air Force, which considered recommending not purchasing the Skyhawks if the delivery of the planes was delayed for more than 24 months. [passage omitted] Faced with those arguments Camilion managed to find the solution: He will not completely remove from the U.S. Navy the business of repairing the planes, he will give some participation to Lockheed. Smiths Industries and with the other companies in charge of the electronic equipment of the Skyhawks will also participate. This solution has the endorsement of U.S. Ambassador James Cheek. Following the decision by the U.S. Navy and Smiths Industries to share part of their business, Lockheed finds itself participating in an operation worth about 250 million pesos. Camilion's idea is to support the participation of the Military Aircraft Factory in Cordoba, as planned by Lockheed. The brigadiers do not agree. They want the planes quickly.
