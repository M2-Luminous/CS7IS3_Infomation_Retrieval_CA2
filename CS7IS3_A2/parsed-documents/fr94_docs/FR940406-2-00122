FR940406-2-00122 FR940406-2-00073 In File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;84&hyph;27, which initially set forth the provisions and procedures of Rule 476A, 5 the Exchange indicated it would amend the list of rules from time to time, as it considered appropriate, in order to phase in the implementation of Rule 476A as experience with it was gained. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21688, supra, note 4. The Exchange is seeking approval to add to the list of rules subject to possible imposition of fines under Rule 476A its policy with respect to a requirement for new members of the Exchange to have their order executions observed by another member for a period of two weeks. As part of their training regimen, new Exchange members are required to participate in a New Member Orientation Program (``Program''). The Program, consisting of six one-hour sessions over a two-week period, is designed to familiarize the new members with regulations, systems and trading practices. Subsequent to the Program and passing the member examination (Series 15), a new member is required to wear a temporary badge (called on the Exchange today an ``orange badge'') for a minimum of two weeks, during which time the new member may execute orders only under the direct supervision of another experienced member. 6 6 According to the NYSE, a new member may execute an order under the direct supervision of any fully qualified NYSE member who is a disinterested third party to the transaction. The experienced member observes the trade, and reviews it for compliance with the relevant Exchange rules and trading practices. This review is evidenced by placing the experienced member's badge number on the back of the order ticket. See Amendment No. 1, supra, note 1. The purpose for the proposed rule change is to facilitate the Exchange's ability to ensure compliance with all aspects of the above-named policy. New members would be informed that, if they are found to have executed an order during the initial two-week period not under an experienced member's supervision, the requirement to wear the temporary badge and have their executions observed by an experienced member would be extended for an additional week. A second violation of the policy would result in a possible fine under the provisions of Rule 476A. 7 7 The Exchange has clarified that, because the initial violation of this policy would result in an extension of the probationary period, the second violation would be subject to the first time fine provided by Rule 476A. See Amendment No. 1, supra, note 1. The Exchange believes failure to comply with the requirements of this policy should be addressed with an appropriate sanction and seeks Commission approval to add violations of these requirements to the Rule 476A List. 2. Statutory Basis The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b)(6) of the Act in that it will provide a procedure whereby members and member organizations can be ``appropriately disciplined'' in those instances when a rule violation is minor in nature, but a sanction more serious than a warning or cautionary letter is appropriate. The proposed rule change provides a fair procedure for imposing such sanctions, in accordance with the requirements of Section 6(b) (7) and 6(d) (1) of the Act. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the Federal Register or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;05 and should be submitted by April 27, 1994. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
