FR940606-0-00067 FR940606-0-00019 (iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex, permanently, after the ``initiation of negotiations,'' (defined in paragraph (i) of this section), if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the amount determined in accordance with 24 CFR 913.107; or (iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either: (A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or (B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or (v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either: (A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or (B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable; or (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if: (i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the PHA determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance; (ii) The person moved into the property after the date described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, but before commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., that the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as a ``displaced person'' (or for assistance under this section) as a result of the project; (iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or (iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project. (3) The PHA may, at any time, ask HUD to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section. (i) Definition of initiation of negotiations. For purposes of this section, the term ``initiation of negotiations'' means: (1) For conventional or acquisition projects: (i) Where the PHA purchases the real property through an arm's-length transaction (as described in 49 CFR 24.101(a)(1)), the seller's acceptance of the PHA's written offer to purchase the property (i.e., the seller's execution of form HUD&hyph;51971&hyph;II), provided the PHA later purchases the property; or such other date, as may be determined by the PHA with the approval of the HUD Field Office; or (ii) Where the PHA's purchase of the real property does not qualify as an arm's-length transaction under 49 CFR 24.101(a)(1), the delivery of the initial written purchase offer from the PHA to the Owner of the property (i.e., the PHA executed form HUD&hyph;51971&hyph;II). However, if the PHA issues a notice of intent to acquire the property, and a person moves after that notice, but before the initial written purchase offer, the ``initiation of negotiations'' is the actual move of the person from the property; (2) For turnkey projects, HUD Field Office approval of the PHA's proposal incorporating the developer's proposal, provided the contract of sale is later executed; or (3) For major reconstruction of obsolete projects, the PHA's issuance of the invitation for bids for the project.
