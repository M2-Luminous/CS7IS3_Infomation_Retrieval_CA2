FR940720-2-00092 FR940720-2-00068 Houston Lighting & Power Company, City Public Service Board of San Antonio, Central Power and Light Company, City of Austin, Texas, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;498 and 50&hyph;499, South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, Matagorda County, Texas Date of amendment request: June 6, 1994. Description of amendment request: The licensee proposes to modify the South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, Technical Specification 3/4.8.1.1, ``A.C. Sources,'' to revise the action statements and surveillance requirements for testing of the standby diesel generators (SDGs). The proposed amendment would eliminate excessive and unnecessary testing of the SDGs consistent with the guidance provided in NUREG&hyph;1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' NUREG&hyph;1431, ``Standard Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Plants,'' Generic Letter 84&hyph;15, ``Proposed Staff Actions to Improve and Maintain Diesel Generator Reliability,'' and Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.'' This request replaces a request for amendment dated November 23, 1993, which was noticed on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 621). This revised amendment request includes elimination of additional identified unnecessary testing discovered since the original submittal. The changes include: (1) eliminating the requirement to demonstrate the operability of an operable SDG whenever an offsite AC power source is determined to be inoperable, or whenever a support system or an independently testable component of another SDG is inoperable, (2) eliminating the requirement to load the diesel in 10 minutes during testing, (3) replacing the minimum required loading for testing with a load band, (4) relocating some surveillance requirements to the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program, and (5) eliminating unnecessary loss of offsite power tests. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The Standby Diesel Generators do not initiate any accidents, therefore these changes do not increase the probability or [of] an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes will permit the elimination of the unnecessary mechanical stress and wear on the diesel engine and generator while ensuring that the diesel generators will perform their designed function. The elimination of this mechanical stress and wear will improve the reliability and availability of the Standby Diesel Generators which will have a positive effect on the ability of the diesel generators to perform their design function. Therefore, the consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not increased. The proposed changes are consistent with NUREG&hyph;1366, NUREG&hyph;1431, Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, and Generic Letter 84&hyph;15. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The elimination of these unnecessary tests does not affect the design bases of the SDGs, or any of the accident evaluations involving the SDGs. The SDGs are designed to provide electrical power to the equipment important for safety during all modes and plant conditions following a loss of offsite power. The test schedule established in accordance with GL 84&hyph;15 assures that operable SDGs are capable of performing their intended safety function. The proposed changes to the surveillance requirements are consistent with NUREG&hyph;1431, NUREG&hyph;1366, Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, industry operating experience, and South Texas Project operating experience. These changes are intended to improve plant safety, decrease equipment degradation, and remove unnecessary burden on personnel resources by reducing the amount of testing that the Technical Specification requires during power operation. Relocating the diesel fuel oil testing requirement to the STP Fuel Oil Monitoring Program outside of the Technical Specifications is an administrative change consistent with NUREG&hyph;1431 and consequently has no effect on accident probability, consequences, or margin. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes extend testing frequency and eliminate unnecessary mechanical stress and wear on the diesel generator in an effort to improve plant reliability and safety. These changes are consistent with NUREG&hyph;1431, NUREG&hyph;1366, industry operating experience, and STP operating experience and do not adversely affect the design bases, accident analysis, reliability or capability of the SDGs to perform their intended safety function. Relocating the diesel fuel oil testing requirements to the STP Fuel Oil Monitoring Program outside of the Technical Specifications is an administrative change consistent with NUREG&hyph;1431 and consequently has no effect on accident probability, consequences, or margin. Therefore the proposed changes do not involve any reduction in a margin to safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involve no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: Wharton County Junior College, J. M.

NRC Project Director: William D. Beckner. IES Utilities Inc., Docket No. 50&hyph;331, Duane Arnold Energy Center, Linn County, Iowa Date of amendment request: June 18, 1993 as supplemented on December 17, 1993 and May 5, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) by clarifying TS wording for the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) and Containment Spray modes of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system to assure consistency with requirements of the DAEC Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: (1) The probability or consequences of a previously-analyzed accident will not be increased by these proposed changes to the LPCI and Containment Spray LCOs and BASES because they merely clarify existing TS requirements and are consistent with the DAEC UFSAR accident analysis. The addition of the footnote clarifying LPCI OPERABILITY during RHR system operation in the Shutdown Cooling mode is consistent with the requirements in the NRC Standard TS (NUREG&hyph;1433). No changes in either system design or operating strategies will be made as a result of these changes, thus no opportunity exists to increase the probability or consequences of a previously-analyzed accident. (2) The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously analyzed will not be created by these changes to the LPCI and Containment Spray LCOs and BASES because they merely clarify existing requirements. The addition of the footnote clarifying LPCI OPERABILITY during RHR system operation in the Shutdown Cooling mode is consistent with the requirements in the NRC Standard TS (NUREG&hyph;1433). No changes in either system design or operating strategies will be made as a result of these changes, thus no possibility exists to introduce a new or different kind of accident.
