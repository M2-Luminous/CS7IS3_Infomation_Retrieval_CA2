FR940919-0-00028 FR940919-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 600 Institutional Eligibility Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as Amended AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Final regulations, correction, compliance with information collection requirements. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the regulations governing Institutional Eligibility Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as Amended to add the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control numbers to certain sections of the regulations. Those sections contain information collection requirements approved by OMB. The Secretary takes this action to inform the public that these requirements have been approved, and therefore affected parties must comply with them. The Secretary also corrects an error in the preamble to these regulations published in the Federal Register on April 29, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Cheryl Leibovitz, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Room 4318, ROB&hyph;3, Washington, DC 20202. Telephone (202) 708&hyph;7888. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m., and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 29, 1994, final regulations were published in the Federal Register governing Institutional Eligibility Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as Amended (59 FR 22324). Compliance with information collection requirements in 34 CFR 600.5, 600.7, 600.10, 600.20, 600.30, and 600.31 was delayed until those requirements were approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. On July 25, 1994 OMB approved those information collection requirements under that Act; therefore affected parties must now comply with those requirements. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the publication of OMB control numbers is purely technical and does not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest and that a delayed effective date is not required under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

The Secretary amends Part 600 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 600_INSTITUTIONAL ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965, AS AMENDED 1.

Sections 600.5, 600.7, 600.10, 600.20, 600.30, and 600.31 are amended by adding an OMB control number at the end of these sections to read as follows: ``(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1840&hyph;0098)'' 3. The following correction is made in FR Doc. 94&hyph;10139, published in the Federal Register of April 29, 1994, (59 FR 22324): On page 22324, column 1, the first sentence after the heading ``EFFECTIVE DATE'' is corrected to read as follows: These regulations take effect on July 1, 1994. However, affected parties do not have to comply with information collection requirements contained in §§600.5, 600.7, 600.10, 600.20, 600.30 and 600.31 until the information collection requirements contained in these sections have been submitted by the Department of Education and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
