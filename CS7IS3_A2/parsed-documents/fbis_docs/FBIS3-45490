Before his departure, Director Huang said: According to information from ROC units abroad, some U.S. congressmen are doing everything they can to reinstate the Super 301 provision. While Japan is the main target, the time is not favorable for our side for the negotiations because this is the time when the U.S. Congress and U.S. manufacturers are exerting pressure on the U.S. Government. Because of this, as well as the fact that only 40 or so industrial goods meet the terms of tariff reduction, as pointed out by the units concerned, I can (?see) that the negotiations will be very difficult. According to Huang, (?agricultural and industrial) departments do not have the so-called second optional plan. But if the U.S. side insists on discussing the issue of the range of variable tariff reductions, industrial departments should be psychologically prepared to discuss this issue with the U.S. side although they may not have to promise a specific range of reduction. The U.S. side has indicated time and again that the results of the negotiations will have a bearing on the timing of the formal ROC-U.S. negotiations on tariff reductions. As for whether or not the two sides will renegotiate a variable tariff reduction prior to bilateral formal negotiations on tariff reductions if the upcoming negotiations cannot satisfy the two sides, Director Huang indicated that this is not very likely because both the ROC and the United States intend to hold formal negotiations on tariff reductions in February. Huang also disclosed that of the list of 699 products which the United States demands have their tariffs be reduced flexibly, the percentage of tariff reductions for 31 industrial goods has already met the U.S. requirements, and so there will only be 668 products for which variable tariff reductions will be discussed.
