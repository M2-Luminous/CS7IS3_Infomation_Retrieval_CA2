The government said that it was unable to meet the demands made by the unions. Here with the details is Newton Ahmed Barry: [Barry] The demands made by the labor unions in response to the 5 April government responses are threefold: The first group, including 13 labor unions, reduced their demands. Regarding salary increases, Group-13 is proposing a 15 percent increase instead of the previously demanded 40-50 percent. Regarding the price of rice and fuel, this group is asking for a 10-percent reduction. Group-13 supports the exemption of the value added tax on water and electricity consumption -- up to 50 cubic meters for water and 150 kw for electricity -- as proposed by the government, but expressed concern with the increase in the price of a cubic meter of water. Therefore, the group still demands that FASOYA [expansion unknown] be reactivated and that the crisis facing small-scale businessmen be solved. Group-6, which is led by the TGCB [expansion unknown] maintains its demands in their entirety -- a 50 percent increase in salaries, the reestablishment of pre-CFA devaluation prices for rice, fuel, gas, and drugs. The only labor union that did not answer the government's call for counterproposals was the CSP [expansion unknown]. The prime minister stated that he was safisfied with the labor unions quick answer to the proposals, but regretted that because of budgetary constraints, the government was unable to meet any of the demands. The dialogue has not been disrupted, other avenues are still open, and the government will hold consultations with social partners over the coming days. [passage omitted]
