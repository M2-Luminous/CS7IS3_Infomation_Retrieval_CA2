The extremely low voter turnout and the greatly reduced quality of the candidates demonstrate major shifts in the Russian electorate. A number of the previous local authorities were wallowing in corruption, and voters are only too well aware of the fact. Many of the new candidates are merely running for office in order to get rich. Moreover, the speed of the economic reforms and the desire to do everything at one fell swoop, which may be borne out by history some day, has occasioned extremely profound disappointment among voters at these elections with regard to the present forms of Russian statehood and the institution of democracy as a whole. I think it very dangerous that the federal authorities do not realize the significance of these processes. They have not only failed to pay the slightest attention to the local elections, to say nothing of applying any sort of pressure, they have not even bothered to show the most basic interest in this process. I am afraid that against this background the struggle over the Memorandum of Civil Accord will appear to voters as merely a deal stuck between politicians in Moscow. The Memorandum of Accord should be presented as an appeal to the people by power structures and social organizations, letting them know that a new stage has been reached in the establishment of Russian statehood: "We have finished the power struggle, we have stopped pushing each other off our chairs. The Constitution has been adopted, and constitutional work lies ahead of us. If possible we will do everything in our power to correct mistakes. Our work aims to drastically change the nature of state power." The fact that the authorities have been preoccupied with themselves is justified and necessary up to a point: After all, we have been building a new kind of statehood and setting up new institutions. And time has been needed to establish these mutual relationships. However, the time set aside for this purpose has been somewhat protracted. Moreover it has been completely exhausted. There is no longer any need to address this issue. We now have a Constitution, and all parties are united in the opinion that consensus can and must only be reached within the framework of the current Basic Law. Thus we already have a basis for consensus in the form of the Constitution, and it is time to get down to specific tasks rather than the infighting between various authorities. We need consensus not just for its own sake, as a sort of agreement contest, but in order to open a path toward creative work, to correct the mistakes of the past and move ahead.
