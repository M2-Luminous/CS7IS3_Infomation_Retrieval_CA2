It turns out that the Russian Foreign Ministry has nothing in the least to do with this report. We contacted by telephone special envoy Sergey Sergeyevich Zotov, head of the state delegation at the talks with Latvia. This is what he said. [Begin Zotov recording] At the state talks, the Russian side has never posed the question of keeping military bases in Latvia and we are not planning to pose such a question. The state delegation is working exclusively under the mandate of the president of the Russian Federation, and in keeping with this mandate we have finished the practical discussion of the whole set of questions connected with the withdrawal of troops. Among the drafted and already initialed documents there is an agreement which concerns the legal status of the Russian radar station in Skrunda. But I want to stress that our radar station in this state agreement, which has already been approved by our country's president, is regarded as a military institution under civilian control. There can be no question of any bases. Questions with Latvia in this regard have been fully settled between us and are determined by the texts of interstate treaties and agreements which have been drafted and are incidentally ready for signing at the highest level. [end recording] [Announcer] To the question as to why absurd sensations of this kind appear in the press from time to time, the special envoy answered that this is due to bad, illiterate work by individual officials of the state apparatus, and it is their incompetence that leads to such misunderstandings in interstate relations.
