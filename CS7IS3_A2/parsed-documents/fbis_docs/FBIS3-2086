While vying with State-owned enterprises in the domestic market 2,000 private firms extended their businesses abroad last year. earning about 1.58 billion yuan ($181.6 million) in foreign exchange. The quality of workers in these plants is also improving as more university graduates and scientific and technical workers are looking for jobs in the private market. Another encouraging development, according to the newspaper, was that more private enterprise owners have switched their business focus to scientific and technological advisory services and the tertiary industry. Almost 60 percent of last year's 98,000 new private enterprises are engaged in the tertiary services, especially those providing high-tech services such as computer technology, software development and private education services. Despite the rapid development in the past decade, experts say, the private economy is only at an infant stage in China and its strength is still quite limited.
