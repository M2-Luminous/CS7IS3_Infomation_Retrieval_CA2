Some 144 Czech officers have received or are receiving training at military colleges in Germany, said Jaromir Novotny, head of the Foreign Relations Section of the Ministry of Defense. Joint training courses are under consideration and the first joint exercise of staff officers from both armies is planned for autumn, he said. Czech soldiers exercised together with Dutch troops in March, and in July a Czech-French staff officers exercise has been scheduled, he said. The aim is for the Czech Army to acquire the skills necessary for joint military peacekeeping operations, he said. General Karel Pezl, adviser to the Defense Ministry, told CTK the Czech Army was undergoing a very complex transformation process in which the method of leadership was being altered, military service shortened from 18 months to one year, and the 240,000-strong army reduced by a quarter.
