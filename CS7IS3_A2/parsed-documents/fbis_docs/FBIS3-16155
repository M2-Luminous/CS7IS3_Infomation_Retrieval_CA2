Kazannik believes that he has not broken the law or thereby provided grounds for being released from his post. He voiced confidence that Russia could have in him a really independent general prosecutor. To date, Kazannik has not received from the Federation Council an invitation to participate in the session at which his question will be discussed, and he does not intend to "angle" for this, although he reckons that the question of his resignation will not, all the same, be examined in the absence of the claimant. This statement appears strange, to say the least, if you recall that Aleksey Kazannik tendered his resignation to Boris Yeltsin of his own will and even against the will of Yeltsin, and it was widely rumored by the General Prosecutor's Office.
