FR940124-1-00018 FR940124-1-00005 III. Proposed Sanctions A. Finding Under Section 179(a) As stated previously, on December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 issued a letter notifying the state of its failure to submit a complete SIP revision on November 15, 1993, as required by the Act. EPA's letter constitutes a finding under section 179(a) that triggers EPA's discretionary authority to impose the sanctions proposed in this notice under section 110(m). Further, on June 28, 1993, EPA proposed to conditionally approve California's I/M committal SIP for both basic and enhanced I/M programs. EPA also proposed, in the alternative, to disapprove this commitment if the state failed to adopt authorizing legislation and to submit the required I/M programs by the November 15, 1993 date. California has also now failed to adopt and submit such programs. If sufficient progress has not been made by California toward the implementation of an approvable I/M program to be operational on or before January 1, 1995, EPA hereby announces its intention to impose sanctions on May 15, 1994. B. Rationale and Approach for Section 110(m) Sanctions Section 110(m) of the Act allows EPA to apply the highway and offset sanctions at any time (or at any time after) it makes a finding under section 179(a). Based on its finding dated December 30, 1993, EPA is proposing to impose both the highway and offset sanctions. EPA believes that the imposition of highway sanctions is appropriate because of California's failure to adopt legislation to enhance its existing smog check program. In the absence of improved smog check, the ability of the State's metropolitan areas to meet the Clean Air Act deadlines for attaining healthy air quality is severely compromised. As previously noted, enhanced smog check is the single most effective air pollution control measures available and delayed legislative approval of an acceptable program further burdens major industrial sources of air pollution with responsibility for cleaning the air. Under section 110(m), EPA may apply sanctions to any portion of the state it determines is reasonable and appropriate. During the 24 months following the finding, EPA may not impose the sanctions statewide if one or more political subdivisions within the state is principally responsible for the deficiency that is the basis for sanctions. EPA has proposed criteria for determining when a political subdivision is principally responsible (57 FR 44534, September 28, 1992). The criteria provide that a political subdivision is principally responsible if: (1) It has the legal authority to perform the required activity; (2) it has traditionally performed, or has been delegated the responsibility to perform, the required activity; (3) it has received, where appropriate, adequate funding, or authority to obtain funding, from the state to perform the required activity; (4) it has agreed to perform (and has not revoked that agreement), or is required by state law to accept responsibility for performing, the required activity; and (5) it has failed to perform the required activity. A ``political subdivision'' is defined as the representative body that is responsible for adopting and/or implementing air pollution controls for any combination of political subdivisions created by, or pursuant to, Federal or State law. If no political subdivision meets all 5 criteria, EPA may use its discretion to determine whether it is reasonable and appropriate to apply sanctions on a statewide basis. In this notice, EPA is proposing to use the above proposed criteria to determine if it may impose the highway sanction statewide for California because of the State's failure to submit a complete SIP revision complying with the I/M committal SIP revision. EPA believes that the first criterion has not been met by any political subdivision. Only the California legislature has the authority to revise the state statute to provide for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements. Once the legislature has acted, only state government agencies can adopt any implementing regulations. While individual air pollution control district or air quality management districts may request implementation of the state I/M program once adopted, this authority is meaningless unless the State has first established an appropriate program through legislation and regulations. Since the state legislature has not enacted the legislation required to provide the legal authority for an enhanced I/M program meeting the CAA and EPA requirements, an enhanced I/M program is not available to areas within the state that require the program.
