It shows that great changes took place in the following ten aspects of the city's commercial sector. Despite the fluctuating market, the city achieved a sustained high growth in retail sales, with total turnover for 1993 amounting to 65.35 billion yuan. This was an increase of 33.5 percent on 1992, and 11.5 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate. In an effort to establish a socialist market economic structure, it also expanded the market for consumer goods, removed various kinds of fees and brought the market economy into play. A new system for retail price control, professional negotiation for prices, overall control and major commodity reserves, also took initial shape. In addition, Shanghai established a number of exchanges and wholesale markets of national level for petroleum, farming resources, food, oil and meat. Taking the food and oil exchange as an example, the trading volume of food-stuff and oil in the first six months since its founding reached 31.3 million tons, totalling 54.2 billion yuan. It made contact with many of the world major food exchanges, and with REUTER's international high-speed information network. The city has also set up 204 regional markets, constituting an initial commodity market system. So far, about 700 large and medium-sized commercial firms in Shanghai have adopted the independent management system, with 4,177 small ones practising leasing and risk liability contracting systems. Some 168 such companies were sold by auction, and 28 comprehensive chambers of commerce and commercial groups were reorganized. The city also approved 19 joint stock companies, six of which were listed on the market. In 1993, the city earmarked at least 7.8 billion yuan for commercial development, about 1.5 times the amount in the previous year. There were 50 major commercial projects with an investment of over 30 million yuan each, with 12 completed and nine in their final stage. To gain more strength in developing the city's commercial sector, it made use of a total overseas investment of 660 million U.S. dollars, a rise of 2.24 times the figure in 1992. With its 179 foreign-financed projects approved last year, 1.77 times the number of the previous year, Shanghai has now 354 foreign- funded projects, totalling about 1.9 billion U.S. dollars, including foreign funds of 958 million U.S. dollars. As a result, the city's total export value surpassed 100 million U.S. dollars last year, and nine overseas commercial firms were set up. Also, the city has quickened its paces in developing the new commercial streets in Pudong new zone. The two-kilometer-long Wenden commercial street was completed in less than one year. Its turnover in half a year topped one billion yuan. The building of 17 large projects in the area of the Yangpu business center has already started. They are expected to be completed in two years. To meet the demands of the fast development in the sector, the city government is also accelerating the training process for financial and trading personnel. About 59,100 people received various kinds of business training last year.
