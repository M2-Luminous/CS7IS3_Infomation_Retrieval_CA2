This was announced by the Hesse Environment Ministry today. According to the ministry, a higher degree of radioactivity than usual was detected in a sample of the primary circuit on Friday [15 April]. Gaseous iodine 131 escaped from the apparently leaky fuel rod. Thus, the radioactivity of the cooling water is to be examined twice daily instead of once. The director of the nuclear power plant, Klaus Distler, however, spoke of a "routine procedure." Leaky fuel rods occur in every power plant and do not suggest a technical problem. Among the approximately 250,000 fuel rods that are being used in Block A, such an event cannot be ruled out. "Thus, years without leaky fuel rods are an exception," Distler stressed. According to the director, the fuel rods are used between three and four years.
