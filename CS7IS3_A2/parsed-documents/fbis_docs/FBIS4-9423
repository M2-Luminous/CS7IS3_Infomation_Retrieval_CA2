The immense military potential of the former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] provided the main strength for Serb conquest. But the Serbs also derived superiority from the military industry located in Serbia or on territory under Serb control. After the Croat-Muslim conflicts broke out, segments of the military which remained under control of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina were by contrast fragmented and disconnected, cut off from sources of production supplies and energy. That the linkup of these plants into a unified technological process is a significant threat for the Serbs can be seen from the fact that upon the first indications of Croat-Muslim rapprochement, they carried out an air attack against the largest factory making artillery guns in the former Yugoslavia: Bratstvo in Novi Travnik. Repair of Supersonic Aircraft! At the same time, the Bosnian-Croatian agreement opens up possibilities for setting its own military industry in motion at an enviable level. On the eve of the war Croatia had almost no military industry at all, except for shipbuilding. Within the shipbuilding industry we should mention the Skorpik Repair Yard in Sibenik, the well-known large shipyards (Split, Rijeka, Pula), and the Shipping Institute. Although in the near future it still will not be possible to produce a missile-carrying fast attack craft or submarine, it will be possible to make smaller vessels. Although the public is getting very little information, or there is hardly any mention of this at all, it has still been made public that the initial phase of production of armament in garages and small workshops was accomplished in Croatia long ago. According to officially published data, the infantry weapons put into production include industrial production of pistols (the PHP, which stands for First Croatian Pistol, patterned after the Walter), sniper rifles (12.7 mm and 7.9 mm, and a third with NATO caliber), and pirated machine guns, patterned after the Israeli Uzi. The Pleter, Sokac, and Zagi were trial designs. An improved version of the Kalashnikov, like the Israeli 7.62-mm Galil, is also being produced. Various mines and explosive devices, mortars of all calibers with corresponding mortar shells, even very modern ones, recoilless cannon and shells, as well as portable light antiaircraft systems are also being produced. The level of production now achieved guarantees successful organization of the production of other automatic and semiautomatic infantry weapons. Hand grenades are also being produced.... Infantry land mines (20 types) are also being produced. The repair of supersonic aircraft and engines has also been restored in a very short time. The same is true of the repair of cannon and howitzers. Nevertheless, the largest plants of the confederal military industry possible in the future, already installed and with a world reputation, are located in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In Vitez the HVO is supervising perhaps Europe's largest factory making gunpowder, rocket propellant, and explosives. The Osa Project, whose problem was propellant, becomes realistic with the liberation of Vitez. In the untouched plants it is possible to begin immediately, without any lag, to produce high-quality propellant for all types and calibers of multiple-barrel rocket launchers, gunpowder for all types of artillery pieces, as well as all types of explosives. Even before the Croat-Muslim conflicts, production of gunpowder for infantry weapons had been organized in Vitez.... The installed capacity for manufacturing propellant for the long-range missiles of the Orkan type in and of itself amounts to 2,000 units a year. A Factory Worth a Billion Dollars! When the HVO took over the factory, there were about 4,000 finished propellant charges, which were supposed to be delivered to Iraq, stored in the warehouses! The value of the factory in Vitez is estimated at a billion U.S. dollars. A complete and usable older manufacturing line for the production of gunpowder is stored on the grounds of the factory and could be set up very quickly. It is certain that for a long time the Serbs will not be able to attain the technological level of the factory at Vitez. The HVO is also overseeing the former Soko Aircraft Factory in Mostar. Although the Serbs withdrew some of the equipment, with certain investments the factory could be outfitted, if not for the production of entire aircraft, then at least to continue production of parts for large factories in the world and high-quality aircraft repair. In addition, many parts are still in warehouses all over Bosnia-Herzegovina and could be used to assemble aircraft (in Busovaca and near Tuzla...). There are also quite a few air-to-surface missiles (RX 57 Lightning) stored in Bosnia-Herzegovina which the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was unable to use. The largest factory for cannon and multiple-barrel launchers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia is under supervision of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Novi Travnik. The RAK-12, a copy of the Plamen, is being manufactured in Croatia. Aside from repair of all types of artillery weapons, cannon and howitzers of all calibers, from the 75-mm hill gun to the 155-mm howitzer, were produced in Novi Travnik. The production of very large guns is being prepared; equipment has been installed to machine 203-mm cannon barrels, and all types of mortars and mortar shells are being produced. It should be mentioned that the production of gun barrels is very important because they are used unsparingly, and it is well-known that they wear out. Mortars are produced, however, in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Tesanj, along with mortar shells. In Travnik the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is also supervising a large repair plant for infantry weapons. The Slavko Rodic Factory in Bugojno, which is now being attacked by the Serbs, produces all types of fuzes, both for artillery and also for airborne weapons. Although the Serbs have also developed a fuze factory in Valjevo, they have been unable to produce the most up-to-date radio fuzes. The Orkan missiles, which have been falling around Jastrebarsko, had the poorer electronic fuzes, which were manufactured at Krusik in Valjevo, by contrast with those from Slavko Rodic in Bugojno. Ammunition for NATO The Igman Infantry Ammunition Factory is in Konjic, buried deep in the ground in the vicinity of an underground command center built for the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Presidency and JNA General Staff. The factory's production line is newer than that of its sister, the Prvi Partizan ammunition factory in Uzice, and it has a capacity of several million rounds per month. The quality of this factory is indicated by the datum that it has produced infantry ammunition even for NATO. The steel mill in Zenica has begun to manufacture 105- and 122-mm ammunition using old cartridges.... There is a chance that in Novi Travnik the Muslims have succeeded in producing even Kalashnikovs, using barrels from the former warehouses of the JNA. Gorazde has a detonator factory, the only important segment of the military industry which does not have its counterpart in Serbia. In Vitkovici, near Gorazde, there is also a chemical plant producing components for making explosives. If we also add to the total capacity the former tank assembly line in Slavonski Brod, the potential of the future confederal military industry attains an enviable level! The steel mill in Zenica can produce armor plate, it can make the turret, and the engine can be bought. But it is still more important that it can also produce fast armored vehicles.... All the Factories in Serbia The voluminous documentation of the UNIS Defense Production Institute in Sarajevo has remained under control of the Croats and Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, the Serbs razed to the foundations the Zrak sighting device plant in Sarajevo. The military industry for the former JNA was designed to produce weapons and all supplies necessary for what then was nationwide defense, and to do so completely independently and in virtually complete isolation. Almost all the plants of the military industry were located in the central mountains of the former joint state. That location was justified by the strategic rationale of waging nationwide defensive warfare, but Serbia then became almost completely independent and self-sufficient in the production of armament, while the other republics were put in the position of depending on one another for technology and production. For example, the plastic mounts for rocket launchers and motors were produced at Kamnik in Slovenia, gunpowder came from Vitez, sights from Sarajevo, rockets from Vogosca.... The final assembly took place at Prilep in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. The Slobodan Princip-Seljo Explosives Factory in Vitez developed a technology for the production of plastic explosive and then the entire production operation was moved to Ivangrad in Montenegro. Up until 1992 its total capacity was quadruple the needs of the rump "Yugoslavia." Until that time the former federal army had wherever possible built duplicate production facilities on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro. For example, the "mate" of the Explosive and Gunpowder Factory in Vitez was Prva Iskra in Baric, Serbia; the Soko Aircraft Factory in Mostar had its counterpart in UTVA in Pancevo; the Slavko Rodic Fuze Factory in Bugojno had Krusik in Valjevo; the Konjic Ammunition Factory had Prvi Partizan in Uzice; the Pyrotechnics Factory in Gorazde had Krusik in Valjevo and Sloboda in Cacak. The "twins" of FAMOS, the engine factory in Sarajevo, were the Motor Industry in Rakovica outside Belgrade and FAP in Priboj. The Zrak sighting device factory in Sarajevo was supplemented by the plants of Teleoptik in Belgrade. The VMA (Military Medical Academy on Banjica) developed medical protection, field surgery, protection against all NBC [nuclear, biological, chemical] weapons, and all other aspects of military medicine to meet the needs of the ground forces. All those institutions had the most up-to-date equipment and devices. The centrifuge at Batajnica for testing pilot behavior under the most difficult flight conditions alone cost more than a million dollars. Prototypes manufactured under license, as well as those made in our own industrial plants, and imported weapons, were also tested not far from Belgrade -- at the Aircraft Testing Center at Batajnica and the Ground Forces Testing Center at Nikinci in Srem. What is more, there was also the Technical Test Center on Prevlaka, from which the Serbs withdrew the equipment and moved it to the Montenegrin side. Supersonic Plane Out of the Question! The restructuring of the military-industrial complex of the remainder of Yugoslavia began in the summer of 1992. But the Serbs, although almost completely equipped with the technology, still have not managed to restore production of all types of weapons. Production of the Orao airplane has been interrupted and is no longer even mentioned. Development of a new supersonic plane is out of the question. That was too difficult a task even for the entire military industry of the former Yugoslavia, much less the present Serbian industry. Nor has production of the Gazela helicopter, the SA-341/24L, been resumed under French license at Mostar. Informed sources say that the Serbs are unable on their own to repair MiG-21's, which was done in Velika Gorica although they took away most of the machines and special tools. They have completed new production buildings three km long at Pancevo and built a new runway alongside the factory.... Almost all the craftsmen and engineers with a world reputation at Soko, who in addition to meeting the needs of the former army also worked for the largest world aircraft corporations, like Boeing, Airbus, Dornier... have remained in Mostar. The same is true of the repair plant in Velika Gorica. By contrast with them, the greatest attainment of the UTVA aircraft factory in Pancevo was the light piston plane, the UTVA-75. Nor did the piston trainer Lasta ever go into series production, and independent series production of jet planes is out of the question so long as the sanctions are in place. Ships Under a Coat of Rust The Serbs have not even begun to rebuild production to meet the needs of the navy. And the ships they have in the Bay of Kotor have a heavy coat of rust. To meet the needs of the ground forces, in addition to the factories that were already on their territory before war broke out, the Serbs have managed to rebuild and replace the factories they lost in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most of the Serbian military industry is located along the eastern and western Morava and in Belgrade, and one portion is in Bosnia under supervision of Karadzic's forces. The Crvena Zastava plants in Kragujevac are the largest facility of the Serbian military industry. They produce all types of infantry weapons and antiaircraft cannon in calibers up to 40 mm. Their most recent product is a 9-mm pistol (whose production has been transferred to the Sartid 13 factory in Smederevo), the 12.7-mm sniper rifle, and the 40-mm infantry grenade launcher. The Kragujevac automatic rifle, manufactured under the license of the Russian AK-47, which the Croatian fighters called the "Gypsy," is also produced there. Krusik in Valjevo produces all types of light armor-piercing missile systems as well as the AT-2 and AT-3 guided armor-piercing missiles, manufactured under license, and they were also planning to produce the AT-4. Before the war they produced the Strela 2-M light portable antiaircraft system, and production under license of the Igla antiaircraft system, which is also light, was also being prepared. The Lightning air-to-surface 128-mm missiles, which are not guided, and the BR-1 57-mm rocket launcher are also made in Valjevo. The Serbs Have No More Money! According to unverified information, rockets for the Plamen, Oganj, and Orkan multiple-barrel rocket launchers are also made there. At Lucani near Cacak all types of infantry ammunition are made at Prvi Partizan, and gunpowder for infantry ammunition in the plants of Milan Blagojevic. Prva Iskra of Baric is the main producer of rocket propellant. The Serbian military factory in Bosnia with the largest capacity is in the UNIS plants in Vogosca, where all types and calibers of artillery ammunition are produced. According to foreign sources, the Serbs have managed to restore production and repair of 100- and 125-mm tank cannon and also the repair of all types of artillery pieces. A recent brief communique of the Supreme National Defense Council stated that only priority activities of vital important to defense of the country would be financed to meet the needs of the army, and salaries and pensions of military personnel would be paid. All capital investments and new projects are being halted. And the recent strike of workers in the special-purpose section of Crvena Zastava has shown that it will be difficult for Milosevic to fulfill his promise that the Kragujevac factories will operate even on three shifts if necessary. By late 1993 total Serbian industrial output had fallen to only 30 percent of its prewar level. Half of this consisted of wartime production to meet the needs of preserving the territory conquered in Croatia and Bosnia and Hercegovina. Although their effect has been gradual, the sanctions have been having a disastrous impact, even on the Serbian military industry. The miserly salaries, insufficient even for survival, have resulted in large-scale departure of highly trained personnel, mainly to countries overseas. Specialists in the numerous military engineering institutes and factories have joined the people with an engineering education. Another important process is halting the development of projects which were almost finalized and the suspension of investments to develop new armament technology. Serbia simply no longer has the money for that. The immense amount of military-technical documentation stored in Belgrade will simply go out of date. The large amount of knowledge about the production of weapons and military equipment, paid for with the money of all the republics of the former Yugoslavia, will become utterly unusable.
