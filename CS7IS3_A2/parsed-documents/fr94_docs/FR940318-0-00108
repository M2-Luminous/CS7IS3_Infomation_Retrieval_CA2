ACTION: Notice; confirmation of effective date. SUMMARY: On January 12, 1994, RSPA published a final rule to extend the compliance date for the continued construction of cargo tank motor vehicles to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331, and MC 338 specifications. The effective date of the rule was March 14, 1994, contingent upon RSPA receiving no comments opposing the extension by February 11, 1994. This document confirms that RSPA received no opposing comments and, therefore, the effective date of the final rule is March 14, 1994. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jennifer Karim, (202) 366&hyph;4488, Office of Hazardous Materials Standards, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590&hyph;0001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 12, 1994, RSPA published a final rule to extend the compliance date for the continued construction of cargo tank motor vehicles to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331, and MC 338 specifications from April 21, 1994 to August 31, 1995 (Docket HM&hyph;183, Amdt. Nos. 173&hyph;212 and 180&hyph;2, 59 FR 1784). The January 12 rule was in response to comments received from several cargo tank manufacturers requesting an extension to allow them additional time to implement engineering procedures and design modifications required for manufacture of cargo tank motor vehicles to the new DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications and to the revised MC 331 and MC 338 specifications. RSPA stated in the final rule that the effective date would be March 14, 1994, unless by February 11, 1994, RSPA received comments that illustrated extension of the compliance date would not be in the public interest. RSPA received three comments to the final rule; all comments were in support of the extension. Therefore, this document confirms that the effective date of the January 12 final rule is March 14, 1994. Issued in Washington, DC on March 14, 1994, under authority delegated in 49 CFR part 106, appendix A. Alan I. Roberts, Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety.
