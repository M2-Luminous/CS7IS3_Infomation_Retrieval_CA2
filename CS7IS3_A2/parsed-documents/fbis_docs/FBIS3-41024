The issues that have been submitted for your consideration are of an exceptionally important significance. Without exaggeration, the future of Ukraine as an independent state depends to a large extent on the the decision you will adopt today. As you know, on 18 November 1993, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a resolution on the ratification of the START Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol, with certain reservations. Among other things, it also contained an instruction to the president of Ukraine and the government to hold appropriate negotiations between interested states and international organizations with the aim of due protection of both Ukraine's security and its material interests, which would open possibilities for the START I Treaty to enter into force and would initiate the process of genuine international nuclear disarmament. You are aware of the world's reaction to the adopted resolution. After this decision made by the parliament, Ukraine stood before the threat of full isolation, and the negative image we earned for our state because of this began to intensify to a level which opened the possibility of imposing more than just economic forms of pressure. [passage omitted] The nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine from the former USSR not only cannot be used to support Ukraine's security, but are a threat to it. We do not have the appropriate scientific nor the manufacturing infrastructure -- for which tens of billions of dollars are needed -- to independently manufacture new nuclear weapons, nor do we have a place where such weapons could be tested. I hope that the majority of people and people's deputies of Ukraine had the possibility to see and hear the opinions of leading Ukrainian scientists on this issue, which was shown on Ukrainian television. If we cannot be a true nuclear state and gain something positive from this, then why not accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, along with the other 180 world states? [passage omitted] Ukraine is now being accused of something very serious: If we do not act in accordance with the position we announced earlier, we are halting further world disarmament. START II comes under threat, and it is this for which Ukraine is being accused. Although the state of our economy and the possibility of reforming it depends in the first instance on us -- and this is true -- without support from international financial institutions, leading Western states, and not only with money but also with experience, private investments, and the granting of access to their markets, we will not manage. Certainly we would not be able to manage without the Russian market. Can we really expect the development of normal, I stress, normal relations with Russia without deciding this painful problem? If someone thinks we can then he is deeply mistaken. [passage omitted]
