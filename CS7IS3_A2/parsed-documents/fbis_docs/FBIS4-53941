FBIS4-53941 "dreas100_d_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 South Korea Poll Shows `Progress' Made by Democratization Poll Shows `Progress' Made by Democratization SK2305133194 Seoul YONHAP in English 0803 GMT 23 May 94 SK2305133194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- A majority of South Koreans believe that democratization has made considerable progress under the Kim Yong-sam administration compared with those of his two immediate predecessors. An opinion poll found, however, that Koreans also think there has been little meaningful change in "the quality of life." Compared with President Chon Tu-hwan's government, cleaning up corruption, fair trials, protection of human rights and equality for women have made great strides under the Kim administration, many people said. But the present government has achieved little in the areas of law and order, medical welfare and housing, they said. The opinion poll, conducted by the Social Science Research Center of Seoul National University, involved 1,198 men and women above the age of 20 across the nation. Titled "Democratization and the Quality of Life," the poll was commissioned by the Education Ministry. Conducted since November 1993 and giving no figures for margin of error, the report was published Monday. Asked to rate democratization on a scale of one to 10 with the lowest score representing "complete dictatorship" and 10 denoting "complete democracy," the Chon Tu-hwan regime earned 3.35 points, the No Tae-u government 4.85 points and the Kim administration 6.63 points. With regard to the quality of life, the pollees gave 4.53 points to the Chon government and 5.82 points to President Kim. Concerning their expectations for an improved quality of life in five years, provided that the current democratization efforts succeed, the respondents gave 7.04 points. If, on the other hand, democratization fails and the military grabs power again, the quality of life will plunge, they said, giving only 3.98 points in that event. Asked about the quality of life for the nation as a whole, the Chon administration received 4.57 points and the Kim government 5.88 points. Had Chon Tu-hwan continued to rule the country, the people thought the quality of national life right now would rate 4.65 points, the poll found. Invited to predict the situation five years from now if democratization succeeds, the quality of life earned 7.5 points. The figure plunged to 4.01 points when the pollees were asked to predict life in five years under a military government. Queried on the impact democratization has had on the quality of economic life, political activities and individual lifestyles, 52.6 percent replied that there has been little effect. Some 40.2 percent felt there has been a "slight" improvement in their lives because of democratization while 2.4 percent said "very much." Some 3.7 percent said the quality of life has worsened slightly while 0.7 percent said it has become "very bad." Asked to evaluate the Kim administration's reforms and classify them into three categories -- success, no change or failure -- the approval rating for cleaning up corruption was 86.5 percent, fair trials (63.9 percent), reflecting the people's wishes in government policies (57.1 percent), guarantees on equality for women, (54.4 percent) and protection of human rights (50.4 percent). On the whole, 50 percent of the respondents said the Kim administration has succeeded in its reform efforts. On the other hand, the approval rating for equal distribution of wealth was a mere 32.6 percent, establishment of law and order (35 percent), housing problems (35.6 percent), medical welfare system (38.6 percent), rise in educational opportunities (24.2 percent), press responsibility (49.1) and economic development (49. 1 percent). When asked to single out the most important element in democracy's development, 24.5 percent said a guarantee of economic well-being: 23.2 percent opted for economic development: 20.8 percent for fair and just execution of the law: 15.9 percent for elimination of the gap between the haves and have-nots: 10.2 percent for political freedom, and 4.7 percent for free competition among political parties.
