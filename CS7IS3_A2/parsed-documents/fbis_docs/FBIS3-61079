Yeltsin, the government of Moscow has prepared a draft edict on special features of privatization in the capital of Russia. Moscow's Mayor, Yuriy Luzhkov, emphasizes the main point of the edict: The size of the charter capital and appraisal of entities' property on the territory of Moscow are subject to approval by the government of Moscow in accordance with the methodology developed by it. [INTERFAX] May we say that the preparation of the draft edict marks the end of the protracted argument about the ways to privatize Moscow's property? [Luzhkov] The discussion on the principles of implementing privatization in Russia and in its capital city of Moscow is not yet over. Speaking about the capital, our opponents accuse us of allegedly attempting to secure special status for Moscow in matters of privatization. Actually, this is not so. On the other hand, every person, even without being a specialist on the subject, understands that the value of capital assets in the capital infrastructure should be different than the value of, for instance, an identical enterprise in another Russian city. A uniform measure cannot be applied to privatization rules in this respect. The most important point is that we disagree with the purpose of privatization and the methodology attached to this process by Mr. Chubays et al. [INTERFAX] Have you tried to convince A. Chubays and his entourage, attract their attention to your conclusions, in order to work out a common point of view? [Luzhkov] Unfortunately, A. Chubays does not even make an effort to grasp the substance of our objections. He simply replies: We will continue to conduct privatization the same way as before. Since discussion is not working out, I would like to explain publicly where, precisely, we disagree on substance. First, a purpose of privatization is to transfer property that the state can no longer manage. I do not see any ways of realizing this goal in A. Chubays' privatization program. What that program does is to reduce to a minimum the number of enterprises in which the state retains ownership; everything else is subject to privatization. I think that a real proprietor would try in the current inflationary conditions to hold back on selling off real estate. It is easy to sell off everything you have accumulated over time. The second purpose of privatization, in my firm opinion, is to transfer an enterprises to an owner who will use it better and more effectively. We do not see this purpose being realized at all. It is no secret that both across the country and in Moscow major plants are being sold and purchased as a mere piece of real estate. People bet on the fact that the voucher, which at this point has low value, once invested in the purchase of, for instance, a plant, will eventually produce a 1,000-fold return on investment... [INTERFAX] Could you give a specific example? [Luzhkov] Certainly. Take the ZIL [imeni Lenina Plant]. The controlling share of this giant's stock has been purchased for 4.5 billion rubles [R]. This is the price of the vouchers purchased earlier on the cheap. As a result, this miserly amount bought not only the right to manage, but also the right to ownership of a huge ongoing enterprise. Let us look, however, what is R4.5 billion--it is $4.5 million. There is $300 million worth of imported equipment alone installed at the ZIL. And then twice as much worth of domestic-made equipment, buildings, and communications. Even all these details are not enough to appraise the full value of the enterprise. The ZIL is a functioning system, which manufactures a competitive, needed product that is selling well. This is far from a mere piece of real estate. Neither can I disregard this aspect: This technological structure employs people who know their business, know how to develop and improve it. It is a living, promising system, and it must be appraised using completely different measures and parameters. When we speak of this, we assume that as a final result a privatized enterprise must acquire a good master, who will manage it better than the old one. Where is the logic in the ZIL example? The third purpose of privatization is to earn money on a sale of an enterprise. The state is poor right now. There is no money for social programs, the military, the conversion. There are many other pressing needs as well. At the same time, the country essentially sits on a fortune in property. Of course, some of it should be sold. In our estimation, if this selling is done sensibly, Russia may get R200 trillion-R250 trillion, that is, several times as much as its annual budget. What are we going to get from privatization "according to Chubays"? His program says it straight: R1.5 trillion. What is there to gain from such privatization? Political points, perhaps? But this aspect is short-lived. Then we will sober up. I am also very concerned with respect to this point: When such complex processes are under way in the economy as we have now, we have to protect the state from having its property bought up by foreign companies and firms. We have to try to leave as many key enterprises as possible in the sphere of operations of domestic capital, not let foreigners buy up Russian riches for peanuts, taking advantage of the situation. I do not like high-sounding words, but I think that the meaning of what I have said is clear to everyone. In the estimation of one serious economic expert, today's privatization prices are such that the entire of Russia may be purchased for $60 billion. In 1994 our privatization policy will open the gates for foreign capital to start buying up Russia. Such foreign company may buy more than one plant such as the ZIL at voucher auctions. I am convinced that we have to think more about domestic capital.... [INTERFAX] But this is protectionism. [Luzhkov] And what is wrong with that? Let the young Russian capital get its legitimate privileges in the course of privatization. As to protectionism, as long as the capital's residents vest their trust in me, it is simply my responsibility to express the summary will of the Muscovites. [INTERFAX] What specifically are your proposals? What is their substance? [Luzhkov] First. To change substantially the methodology of appraising the value of everything that is to be privatized. To make it so that the enterprise's price reflects its real value. We have many examples where the initial appraisal of a plant has turned out to be 200 times lower than its real worth. This only surfaces at auction sales. As of 1 July 1992 the price of enterprises was frozen, including those in Moscow, and that was it. There has not been any revision since. Money has devalued, and many enterprises can now been had almost for free. Second. A territory's right in the privatization process. So far it does not have any rights whatsoever. All we can regulate, for instance, is the transfer into private ownership of dental offices, sea ports of local significance, and cemeteries. Such is the legal space of local bodies of power, including those in Moscow. I, for instance, cannot make a decision to put on hold privatization of hotels in the capital. If the collective decided to privatize the water supply or sewer system, for instance, they could do this through the courts in a matter of one or two months. We know that hotels and farmers markets in Moscow are highly criminalized structures. So why should we hand state property over to the mafia on the cheap? Who gave the current privatizers such a right? Let the city itself dispose of its property! But Mr. Chubays says: "No, we, and only we, will conduct privatization--the State Committee for the Administration of State Property" [GKI]. During a personal encounter two or three weeks ago, I asked Chubays: "Anatoliy Borisovich, why is it that you mistrust us so much? What is it that I have done, for instance, for you to harbor suspicions?" I want to remind you that I was there when the cooperative movement was just taking off in Moscow; we developed it further than anywhere else. And there were quite a few specialists at the time who tried to do away with this undertaking. The first commodity exchange also was in Moscow. It was G. Popov and I who launched it. This was the beginning of a market infrastructure, after all! The government of Moscow facilitated in every way possible the development of a commercial banking infrastructure. Trading houses and chambers of commerce were also our initiative.... But Chubays just keeps repeating the same thing: "You will halt, slow down privatization...." We say: We need all peoples' privatization. The vouchers should have been personalized from the very beginning, so they could be traced. Then there would not be machinations involving them. But they did not make the voucher this way. I do not know whose ill intent this was. And instead of people's privatization we got a concentration of voucher capital and the use of the latter for buying up property appraised literally at pennies. [INTERFAX] In your opinion, where will all this lead? [Luzhkov] If Moscow loses its property now, it will be for good. The euphoria will pass; what will remain is deep and bitter disappointment. So what do we do then--begin reshuffling once again? I gathered directors of defense enterprises for a meeting recently. What did we talk about most? They are concerned with the course of privatization. They also say that a different approach is needed. [INTERFAX] What did the president tell you on this subject? [Luzhkov] He is much better than Chubays; he understood our concerns. He believes, for instance, that Moscow should decide on its own what to privatize and what not. He said the same to Chubays, straight. I deliberately asked B. Yeltsin to have a meeting with both of us together. The president asked my opponent why, for instance, Moscow enterprises have been appraised so low. The head of state pointed out that Moscow is an infrastructure that is completely different from any other city in Russia. And why are the rights of local authorities so limited in privatization process in general, inquired the president. [INTERFAX] So what conclusion did B. Yeltsin reach on the basis of this conversation? [Luzhkov] The president said that he is willing to sign an edict that will give Moscow the right to establish special privatization terms. He also told us that he is willing to grant the 10-12 largest enterprises in Russia special conditions in this process. [INTERFAX] Of what class are these enterprises? [Luzhkov] Well, for instance, the GAZ [Gorkiy Auto Works]. There are such enterprises in Moscow, too.... On the basis of this conversation, the government of Moscow has prepared a draft presidential edict. By the way, I do not understand in general why we, while constantly talking about demonopolization, have created such a monster--a supermonopoly such as the GKI. The USSR had 140 sectoral ministries, and they still could not cope with this enormous task. And now it turns out that Chubays on his own can manage this property colossus. In my opinion, the GKI should only develop a methodology for the process, and implementation should be left to the territories. Chubays and his agencies in essence have become a supermonopoly. Is this not dangerous? Dictatorial methods of privatization will not result in any good. What is happening with respect to property right now is a 1917 Revolution, except in reverse. Have we not had enough social experiments and cataclysms? By the way, Moscow city property had been appraised at R100 billion at the old prices. How much then should it be worth now? As a minimum, let us multiply the price by a factor of 1,000. Chubays, however, wants to privatize the entire of Russia for R1.5 trillion. It is laughable, although this is a laughter through tears. And this property is not owned by some bureaucrats--it belongs to Muscovites. It is our responsibility to bring it to them. Speaking again about domestic capital and its role in purchasing Moscow property. It needs help. Let them buy it on credit--not everyone has been able to save the necessary means. And what will such a buyer do, for instance, having acquired such a plant? He will try to set the production in such a way that would allow him to pay off the debt as quickly as possible. There is no other opinion about it. This is the road to increasing the volume of production. An outsider, however, having acquired the controlling share of stock, will look at this same plant as a piece of real estate. What option is better for all of us, Russians and Muscovites? That is why there is such a boom around privatization, which often leads to physical violence. And finally, on the national and city budget. Moscow is literally scraping up subsidies for pensioners, the disabled, and so on these days. We could proceed with these measures on a much greater scale had we received everything due us from the sale of city property. [INTERFAX] By the way, what is your position on the idea of transferring the mayoralty building (formerly COMECON headquarters) to the State Duma? [Luzhkov] First, we are disciplined people and comply with the president's decision. The Moscow government does not merely treat the decision of the head of state with respect--it supports the president, and sincerely is on his side. Keeping all this in mind, however, we reported to B. Yeltsin that this building is not capable of accommodating the State Duma. This is an objective economic evaluation. The former COMECON building has 489 offices. Of them, 157 have reception rooms. There are very few conference halls that could be used for commissions' work and joint sessions. It is not as though we were holding onto this property. The point is quite different. Moscow is the capital of Russia. When it comes to providing accommodations for the bodies of authority, it is the responsibility of the city government to do it. I personally think that the building of the former Academy of Social Sciences will provide better accommodations for the State Duma. [INTERFAX] Why? [Luzhkov] There are only about 100 people studying there now. In the entire huge, prestigious complex. The rest of the space is rented out. As to the contention that this building is too far from the center of Moscow, this may even be for the better. Lawmakers should work in peace, away from the pressure of the street, away from the everyday hustle and bustle. By the way, there are many examples of this in the world. As for me personally, I want normal relations with the deputies of Russia's new parliament. By the way, if the issue comes to the point where it is decided that Moscow should build a new building for the State Duma, we will; we will find a good place for it. There is such an option. We will build it quickly. We have the resources and abilities to do this. And we will build a building for the Federation Council, taking into account the specificity of this chamber. [INTERFAX] Yuriy Mikhaylovich, you yourself have mentioned that the fight for property caused by the existing methodology of privatization often shifts into the mode of physical violence against the competitors. Here is another murder--the chairman of the Rosselkhozbank's board of directors is dead.... [Luzhkov] The situation is very difficult. Murder of top officials of commercial structures is becoming a regular occurrence. Unfortunately, not only in Moscow. What happened to Nikolay Likhachev makes us think again about the situation in the capital. We need major measures aimed at normalization of the situation in the city as a whole. I also think that tougher measures need to be taken to provide individual protection for persons of interest to criminal structures. Maintenance of law and order is first and foremost a task for the state. But the territories should not just stand on the sidelines. I do not want to promise much to Muscovites. Words are just words. I would like to draw their attention to just one fact: Over the past year, Moscow has allocated more money to beef up law enforcement organs than the total they have received since the beginning of the century. This includes everything: communications, housing, personnel pay, transportation. I think we will soon have the right to demand of the Moscow militia more effective work in maintaining law and order in the city. Even what has already been implemented in Moscow in this respect is producing results, though. We will do everything possible to develop this trend further.
