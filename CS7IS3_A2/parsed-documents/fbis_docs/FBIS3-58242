[passage omitted] Today was the first part of the Brussels NATO summit, which will continue tomorrow. Mr. Juppe, at France's request the Bosnian issue has at last been discussed. Do the Americans and the French agree on air strikes? Which ones? Against whom and by whom, Mr. Juppe? [Juppe] Mr. Cavada, like everyone else, I am deeply distressed by what I know and what I see. [passage omitted] It is necessary to put pressure on all parties today in order to convince them that there is no military solution and that the only solution is a political settlement. What have we tried to do at this alliance summit? First, we spoke about Yugoslavia. It had been decided that 16 heads of state and government would gather to discuss security and stability in Europe, while setting Yugoslavia aside. But, because France said last week that this was inconceivable, we talked about Yugoslavia today. We obtained three things, which will be included in tomorrow's final declaration. They may seem insignificant to those who are listening to us, but they are important for the future. First, we managed to have the 16 countries of the Atlantic alliance approve the peace plan of the European Union. We are often told that there is no political aim. I am sorry, but there is a political aim. The aim is peace, as fair a peace as possible. We Europeans have committed ourselves to this. We said: This is the plan we suggest. I discussed this plan myself with Mr. Izetbegovic. I remember very well the moment when, in Geneva, on 29 November 1993 I asked him: What do you want? He wrote on a piece of paper before my eyes: 33.3 percent of Bosnian territory. This is what he said. So this is what we suggested: 17.5 percent for the Croats, 33.3 percent for the Muslims, and the rest for the Serbs. There are many other aspects to this plan: access to the sea, the international status of Sarajevo, the European status of Mostar, access to the Sava River and the Danube in the north. Anyway, the plan is on the table, and we are now in a position to say: The 16 countries of the Atlantic alliance are telling all the parties that this is the plan which must now be approved and accepted. There will be no other. The second thing we obtained, and this is very important, is the commitment of the 16 to contribute to the enforcement on the ground in Bosnia, by sending troops to implement this plan if it is approved. I say to those who are listening to us in Sarajevo: President Clinton himself, and the other heads of state and government, said today: If peace is signed, we will go to Bosnia with NATO soldiers to guarantee the enforcement [of the plan]. It is a solemn commitment. Finally, the third thing we obtained is that the Atlantic alliance says it is ready to support the UN in enforcing Security Council resolutions. This means two things in concrete terms. First, as Francois Leotard and General Briquemont have said, it is necessary to reinforce UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] troops. For months on end we were told that an extra 7,000 men would be dispatched. France did its duty and sent 1,000. Where are the others? As early as tomorrow, we will meet UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali in Paris, and we shall say to him: Where are the others? They must come. The second aspect of this commitment on NATO's part is to say: If UNPROFOR is attacked, if it cannot carry out the mission it was given by the Security Council, then we are available for air strikes. At the initiative of France once again, with our partners who have troops on the ground, we have tried to define more precisely the operations we could undertake in order to restore UNPROFOR's credibility. As Francois Leotard explained earlier--and I will be brief--the first intervention is to force open the road to Srebrenica to relieve Canadian troops, and the second is to open Tuzla airport so that humanitarian aid can land there. We warn those who might want to oppose these two operations that if they do so, air strikes will be used. As I am talking to you, while heads of state and governments are still discussing this, this is the outcome of today's talks in Brussels.
