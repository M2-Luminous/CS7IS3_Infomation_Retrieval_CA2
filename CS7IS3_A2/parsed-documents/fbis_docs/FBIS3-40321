Cebalovic: "When Will the Oil Start Flowing in the Pipeline?"] [Excerpts] The normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia calls for, among other things, the beginning of the operation of the Omisalj (on the island of Krk)-Pancevo oil pipeline. Zagreb wished for something like that to happen earlier, and so did Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, which used to receive through this pipeline significant quantities of petroleum that they needed, especially since the once brotherly USSR route "had dried up." In spite of a great number of problems that are difficult to resolve, it is possible for oil to start flowing in the pipeline as soon as Belgrade and Zagreb agree. However, one should not forget that 120 km of the pipeline pass through the republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and it is thus clear that the agreement between Yugoslavia and Croatia is very unlikely to be effective without the consent of Knin. When we wrote about the pipeline earlier, Knin repeatedly stated that "the oil can continue to go to Zagreb only if they return the confiscated Serbian oil and if they pay for the transit through the RSK." Is Knin going to maintain this position? If it is, it is very unlikely that the oil pipeline will start operating very soon. Everything happened on 6 September 1991, when the official on duty at the oil pipeline in Novi Sad recorded the information he received at 1404 hours from Sisak that, due to damage, the pipeline had stopped operating. [passage omitted] Because of this act, 130,000 metric tons of oil intended for the Pancevo refinery and 82,000 tons for the Novi Sad refinery remained on Krk. Before the closing of the pipeline, blackmail had been arriving from Zagreb for several months, and every oil delivery intended for Serbia was charged a higher tax. Everything was paid for regularly, together with the transit costs. Zagreb did not permit even the unloading without proof of payment. But they were mistaken in Zagreb when they thought that they could cut off the delivery of oil to Serbia and deliver it in an undisturbed manner to the Slovene firm Lendava, to Hungary, and to former Czechoslovakia. The control valves were in the RSK, in Banija. The oil, of course stopped coming. [passage omitted] The story of the pipeline is a long one. It started in 1966. [passage omitted]. All the accumulated problems continued up to 1991. Nothing has been resolved: who the owners are (Croats say that they are), how much oil there is in the pipeline and to whom it belongs, the cost of transport, and who will manage the facility. Nor has it been established who invested in the construction of the pipeline and how much. How can now all of that be resolved?
