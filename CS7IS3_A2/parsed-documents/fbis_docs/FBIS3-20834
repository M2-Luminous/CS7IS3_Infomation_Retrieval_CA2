At first glance one could say there is nothing controversial about this; every advertisment has to be paid for; television cannot waste its valuable time and does not have to make exceptions. Anyway, one second of prime time for an ad costs, depending on the program, an average of 50 dinars. However, RTS did broadcast the military ads for a certain period of time. It is true that it aired the ads during programs that do not have a large number of viewers, such as "Dozvolite" [Allow Me] and "Srbija Danas" [Serbia Today], but then it decided not to show them anymore. While large television stations decided to take this step, the small ones continued to air the ads. Free of charge, of course. The Montenegrin and all the local Belgrade television stations agreed to run the ads free of charge. It is said in the army that POLITIKA TV and Studio B were the first to respond: They understood the situation of the Yugoslav Army. As soon as the request by General Momcilo Perisic arrived, they agreed to provide several spots daily, although the financial status of these television stations is not particularly good. On the other hand, the state television did not yield to the army's request to have a few seconds alloted for the armed forces even though the airing of the ads on military schools is of public interest. The army has calculated that it would have to pay 50,000 dinars (German marks) to state television for it to agree to broadcast the ad on four RTS channels, and this only for a few days. Of course, such a sum was simply shocking to the Army, which asked the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] to do something through his "connections." FRY President Zoran Lilic made a request to RTS, but even this did not help.
