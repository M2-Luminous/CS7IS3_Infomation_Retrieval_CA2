Were that to happen, there would be no other solution than to go back to the electorate with a majority that would be confirmed and strengthened by the experience. I hope this does not prove necessary." Silvio Berlusconi has thus added his voice to those who think there might be a new general election if Giovanni Spadolini were to win. Earlier the Northern League's Roberto Maroni had warned: We will have another general election and "we will say that the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the PPI [Italian Popular Party] were in cahoots to bring the institutions to a standstill and we will ask the nation for greater power."
