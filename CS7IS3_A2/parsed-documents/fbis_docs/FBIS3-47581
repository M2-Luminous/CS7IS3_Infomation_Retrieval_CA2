The technique makes it possible to store data equivalent to some 80,000 Japanese newspaper pages or two hours of VHS-format video movie pictures on a magneto-optical disc which measures 13 centimeters in diameter, the same size as a music disc, the company said. A magneto-optical disc is based on a recording method that combines laser and magnetic technologies to create high-density erasable storage discs. Its surface is made of a magnetic recording material that records magnetic spots or bits using a laser to pinpoint them. NEC's new technique combines a signal-processing technology called the partial response maximum likelihood (prml) method with a red-color data-reading laser. NEC said it plans to develop products using the technique for commercial use as it can be applied to a range of multimedia equipment.
