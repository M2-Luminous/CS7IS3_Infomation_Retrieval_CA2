Han Zhaokang, Chinese representative from the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, told reporters after the meeting that the Chinese Government attaches equal importance to the settlement of the three major issues, namely the localization of public servants and law, as well as officialization of Chinese language, stressing that all of them are equally important to the smooth transition and transfer of power in Macao. He pointed out that no matter the localization of public servants or the localization of law, language is a question that can not be ignored. So the three issues are of equal importance, he added.
