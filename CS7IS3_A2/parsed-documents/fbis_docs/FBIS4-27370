FBIS4-27370 "dreas105_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 South Korea Dailies View UN Statement on DPRK Issue Dailies View UN Statement on DPRK Issue SK0106071594 SK0106071594 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of editorials and articles carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 1 June commenting on the UN Security Council presidential statement on the North Korean nuclear issue. Conservative CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled "Though Another Presidential Statement Has Been Released...." which starts out by saying that this statement is a "very soft statement," then notes that "North Korea is unlikely to comply with this statement" and that "this may have merely added an ace card to North Korea's hand of nuclear cards." Pointing out that "the stronger the North Korean position, the more carrots the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the ROK, the United States, and the United Nations have offered," it concludes by saying: "Even if the international community imposes sanctions on North Korea, North Korea, which is enjoying the nuclear game, is not expected to promptly change its attitude. Also, if the international community tries to resolve the issue through negotiations even while going in the direction of sanctions, North Korea will try to take ill advantage of this, as well. Therefore, resolving the nuclear issue requires our side's resolute will." The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries a 1,000-word editorial on page 3 entitled "Quickened Pace at the Security Council." The editorial first describes the background of the UN Security Council's adoption of the presidential statement and notes that "if North Korea refused to accept the UN Security Council's presidential statement, the Security Council will, unavoidably, pursue sanctions." It then says that "we cannot accept any negotiations in which North Korea's past nuclear activities will be overlooked" and that "the carrots that will be available to North Korea once the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved diplomatically have already been made public." The editorial finally expresses the hope that "North Korea will make a wise choice." The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 1,000-word article by correspondent Chong Yon-chu in Washington on page 3 entitled "Sanctions Will Be Inevitable If North Korea Continues To Replace Fuel Rods." The article starts out by saying that the adopted presidential statement is likely to lead to the resumption of negotiations between North Korea and the IAEA, and that it is speculated that North Korea may stop short of replacing fuel rods at the last moment. The article then notes that if North Korea should continuee to replace fuel rods, "this should be interpreted as North Korea's determination not to disclose its 'nuclear past' at all costs." Moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries a 1,200-word article by reporter Kang Yong-chin on page 3 entitled "Government's Measures on the North Korean Nuclear Issue." The articles says the ROK Government is busy mapping out measures as the uncertainty over the North Korean nuclear issue increases and is even examining the possibility of imposing sanctions against North Korea by the ROK, the United States, and Japan if North Korea refuses to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue and if international sanctions are not possible because of China's veto at the UN Security Council. It also says that even though it considers military sanctions to be undesirable, the ROK Government is looking into possible measures should the United Nations or the United States choose to impose military sanctions. The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word article by Kim Su-chong, the correspondent at UN Headquarters. The article points out that "China's flexible position made it possible for the UN Security Council to adopt the presidential statement immediately," and quotes a Chinese diplomat as saying "China is concerned about the possible situation to be resulted from the rupture of North Korea-U.S. talks if North Korea continues hurried replacement of fuel rods." The article says that "without any concrete countermeasures against the North Korean nuclear issue, the United States seems to expect that the presidential statement of the UN Security Council will induce Chinese influence upon North Korea as well as urge it to accede to dialogue." The article concludes by noting the possibility that "North Korea will break through the crisis caused by its fuel rods replacement by using its unique tactic," and saying: "North Korea has used a hide- and-seek tactic. While driving the nuclear issue to a critical phase, North Korea has strung the United States along by offering dialogue whenever the UN Security Council was going to take measures against it." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word article by New York and Washington-based correspondents Pak Su-man and Yi Chong-yon. After explaining the background of the adoption of the recent UN statement on North Korea, the article reports that "the IAEA's abandonment of negotiations and the abrupt adoption of the UN Security Council president's statement on the North Korean nuclear issue has made the prospect of U.S.-North Korea dialogue very cloudy." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a 900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Kyong-hyong. The article stresses the following three points as being significant in the adoption of the UN statement on North Korea: First, the statement "supports the IAEA position on future measurement of nuclear fuel rods;" second, the implication in the statement that "the UN Security Council's will to take immediate follow-up measures, such as sanctions, if North Korea rejects the future measurement of fuel rods;" and third, the promptness shown in adopting the statement. It stresses that this reflects the UN Security Council's recognition that "the issue of replacing North Korea's fuel rods is an imminent problem in need of a speedy solution." Regarding China's position, the article cites experts' analysis that "in view of smoothed relations with the United States, China will take great account of the fact that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula complies with its own interests." Quoting diplomatic sources in the United Nations and Washington, the article also reports that China will "inactively participate" in taking possible follow-up measures against North Korea.
