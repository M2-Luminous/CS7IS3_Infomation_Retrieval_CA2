The farmers said the agreement would deepen rural poverty, hunger, and joblessness. The farmers spoke during a hearing yesterday at the Senate on GATT. Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, chairperson of the committees on trade and commerce, said her committees will hold judgment on GATT until all sectors are heard. She said the Senate set October as the deadline for acting on GATT to enable the Philippines to catch up with the implementation of the accord.
