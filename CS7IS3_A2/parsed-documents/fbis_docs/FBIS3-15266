Eight days have passed since the presentation and sending of the president's message to the Federal Assembly. Quite a few deputies have already voiced agreement with the main provisions of the message. The long-awaited outlines of a common approach to the resolution of economic problems are becoming clear. I intend to do everything possible to strengthen it. This is all the more necessary in the present situation, when the danger of confrontation has appeared. I refer, first and foremost, to the political amnesty. I am fully aware of how contradictory the Duma decision is and of how hastily it was implemented. I considered, and still do consider, that a violation of the Constitution, the law, and moral standards has been committed here. The amnesty decision posed a most acute question for me as president: either a new schism, a new round of implacable struggle or, despite everything, the preservation and growth of a base for interaction, for cooperation in the state and in society. For the country, for the benefit of its citizens, for security, for civic peace, the first path is ruled out. It can only lead to confrontation. The address to the Federal Assembly spoke of the need for all healthy forces in society and all authorities and political forces to cooperate in what is currently the main issue -- the strengthening of the state, nor was it said for the sake of style and form. Russia now is an altogether different country: it has a constitution, it is able to resolve its problems peacefully. I think that together we will be up to the task of breaking the habit of always struggling and that we will be able to neutralize the adverse effects of the amnesty. I am convinced that a majority of our deputies' corps does not suffer from political amnesia and that it does understand the absolute need to link efforts to surmount the crisis and to strengthen the state. There is a platform for consensus -- the presidential address. I think the time has come to create firmer guarantees of civic peace in the country. The president, the Federation Council, the State Duma, the government, the power-wielding structures, parties, movements, and public organisations should share the responsibility for preserving that peace. The adoption of a memorandum on civic peace in Russia could become the first step along this path. Such a memorandum should to include not just a declaration of intent, but also mechanisms stipulating accountability for decisions that are being adopted. The leadership of the State Duma has reacted positively to this proposal. I have no doubt that the government will also support it. Today in Russia democracy means first and foremost stability, order, cooperation. The government is faced with an extremely important task. I would like to start with the situation in the coal-mining areas. It is inadmissible that wages should not be paid for several months. I shall keep an attentive eye on the development of events, on the position of the trade unions. Naturally urgent decisions will be made, but in the future let those first and foremost who are late in paying for the coal, who hold up wages bear responsibility. The entire legal mechanism regarding liability for breaches of labor legislation needs to start working, beginning right from the very bottom. One should not rely solely on the government for everything. Judges and the procuracy should at last take a more active stand regarding workers' complaints. You see what things have come to. The Norilsk city court rejected several actions brought for breach of the collective contract. Some similar cases have come to light in the Kuzbass, too. In the immediate future I intend to submit to the State Duma, by way of a legislative initiative, a package of amendments to the criminal code and to the law on collective contracts. Liability for breach of labor legislation needs to be stepped up. Let those who fail to honur obligations pay fines. Of course the problems cannot be solved by strikes today, but the liability of those who condemn the workers to strike must be stepped up. That is our common task. The government has to determine the mechanisms to implement the strategy for the new stage of the reforms as set out in the message and to determine the tactics. It will not be easy to do this. This year the situation in the economy remains difficult. The sociopolitical conditions are rather tough. There is not much freedom of maneuver. The government has a program which was adopted in August 1993. It must, of course, be refined, but the main thing is that it must be fulfilled. What is required of the government today is for it to have a long-term policy. Economic reform at any price is a mistaken slogan. People could reject a reform which is too burdensome. Life has shown that it is not just the reform, itself, which entails certain costs. Even greater losses are caused by delaying changes which are urgently needed. The main thing today is the energetic transformation of the economic mechanism. The government has to continue to take upon itself the main burden of the problems. This is a sign of weakness of state power. The reform of the economic mechanism leaves the state those problems which the market system does not cope with. It will become not only strong but also cheap. A qualitatively new stage of privatization is one of the main reserves of reform. The voucher stage must be completed without hindrance and on time, but it is necessary now to create the legislative basis and to create the organizational mechanisms which will make it possible to obtain from privatization much more than now. It is necessary to attract into it Russian and foreign investors in order to use this money for the technological renewal of production. Of course, it is time to coordinate privatization with the structural and other areas of economic policy. The drafts of the Russian Civil Code and other top-priority laws will be sent to the State Duma very soon. Their adoption will lay a stable legal basis for the market economy and will help Russian entrepreneurship gain a firm foothold. Both parliament and the government need to support it, not only by adjusting regulation procedures but also by tax reform. The urgent necessity of this is obvious, as is the difficulty of implementing it under inflationary conditions. All the same, tax reform must not be postponed until the summer, as is sometimes proposed. There are outlines and they should urgently be made use of. The system of settlements and the work of the banking system constitute a bottleneck in the reform. Profound changes are needed here, including reform of the Central Bank with the aim of creating a Russian federal reserve system and this should also be begun without unnecessary delays. The anti-monopoly reserve of the reforms needs to be skilfully managed. It is clear that the de-monopolization of our economy will require time. So preventive measures blocking the emergence of new monopolist structures are particularly important. At the same time, we must not regard everybody as having been tarred with the same brush. Not every enterprise behaves as though it is a monopoly enterprise. Natural monopolies are another matter altogether -- an effective state control is needed here. The system of management of state enterprises is to be seriously transformed this year. To be more precise, this system, to all intents and purposes, must be built anew. State property is being used in a most ineffective manner. State property, or at least a proportion of it, is here to stay and in this area the Federal Assembly and the government alike have a great deal to accomplish. The importance of creating Russian financial and industrial groups is well known. It is a way to concentrate resources in growth areas and maintain investment activity and competitiveness. The government must find a correct line -- not to impede nor accelerate this process, but to control it, eliminating harmful effects. The reform of economic mechanisms in the agrarian sector is a problem of enormous importance. It will continue to falter if no mechanism is created to implement the right to private ownership of land and if a modern banking infrastructure continues to be absent, along with a great deal else that is also lacking. Financial discipline must be firmed up and this goes for the state itself, first and foremost. The primary task is to make inflation moderate, controllable, and predictable. The guidemark remains as before - about five percent per month toward the end of this year. The government has enshrined this mark in its program adopted on 6 August last year, and there is currently no convincing evidence to necessitate a review here. It is, of course, necessary to bear in mind that, in Russia's present conditions, the war against inflation will be a positional [pozitsionnyy] one. I think that military terminology is fully appropriate in this matter. Inflation cannot be beaten by a single fierce attack. To win the battle, total coordination of the actions of the president, the Federal Assembly, and the government will be required. It is necessary to involve all the forces that are available, all resources -- both monetary-credit and financial and structural-investment resources--and fiscal policy. The inflation-proofing of the economy must be completely guaranteed. This is a vital political limitation from which we cannot depart. An exclusively inflationary budget is unacceptable. The other limitation is the due level of social protection for those who are unable to do without state assistance. Any draft decisions causing the standard of living to fall below the minimum levels must be referred back for reconsideration. They are not to be implemented. This applies primarily to the budget. Any reduction in the share of expenditure on culture, science, and education is impermissible. Acting within the framework of these limitations, the government has to immediately activate schemes to address the full acuteness of the nonpayments crisis. This year, it is time to make a real start on registering debt in the form of securities, reorganizing and improving economically unviable enterprises, and applying the bankruptcy procedure. An economy in which factories calmly feel that they have no prospects will never be a truly market-based, efficient, and non-inflationary economy. The government must at last launch a structural investment policy. Otherwise the technological retreat of Russian industry will not be halted, and we may lose even what little we have: industries which have kept their staff, technologies, and well-established positions in the world market, as well as our country's intellectual potential. We have no alternative now to using the potential of reforms to get us out of the crisis and restore the economy. I am convinced that together we are capable of making 1994 a year in which we see a steady fall in the inflation rate, stabilization of living standards, a significant slowdown in the decline of output, an increase in investment activity, and positive structural changes.
