First of all, I would like to express thanks on behalf of our Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] for the support just given by their excellencies and mesdames to the RGC's plan to redress our national economy. Besides, the RGC promises to to take for further study any well-founded suggestions you made to take concrete measures for their implementation. As for the issue of our forests, which constitute one of the nation's resources, the RGC has given this maximum attention because not only does this issue affect the environment of the nation as a whole, but it also concerns the survival and future of Cambodia itself. The RGC has already decided to impose a moratorium on the export of both whole logs and processed logs from the Kingdom of Cambodia as of 1 April 1994. The madame representing the commission concerned just now talked about the import-export imbalance, and there is also an imbalance in the national budget, which normally relies on tax income from our rice, rubber, and log export, especially during the times of Sangkum Reas Niyum. At the present, however, we are not in any position to export, say, our rice of which we even experience a serious shortage. As for our rubber, it can be exported but does not generate enough revenue. So, only our forests remain the main resource. I would like, therefore, to remind the National Assembly that when UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] was here, it advised us to stop exporting our logs. Now, when the time has come for it to provide us with aid to fill our national coffer, when it heard that we would impose a log export moratorium, UNTAC tried to dissuade us from doing that. It said: Where would you get the money you need; why not sell your trees to get money for your budget? Moreover, in his capacity as a member of the RGC, the state minister in charge of finance and economy [Sam Rangsi] supports the RGC's stance on the log export ban, while in his capacity as the minister in charge of finance and economy, he too has some reservations. Thirdly, it should be noted that no new trees have been felled. Considerable amounts of already felled logs are lying in huge piles all over the country. If we do not take appropriate measures to deal with them, they can only rot and go to waste. This log export ban is prompted by the RGC's plan to divert the export of raw material into local production. This would generate, first, employment and, second, what you called the added values [two preceding words in French] to our natural resources. However, because of the shortage in capital investments, our internal markets cannot cope with the excessive quantities of the decomposing timber. For this reason, while the RGC continues to maintain the log export ban, all ministries concerned should survey the quantities of the already felled trees. Although the RGC continues to uphold the export ban, some exporters will always be permitted to export logs just as pointed out by His Excellency [H.E.] Son Chhai [MP, Siem Reap constituency]. Briefly, the RGC must face many major issues. The first issue is the question of protecting the nation's environment. The second issue is the question of national budget, which is experiencing a serious imbalance or the question of trade imbalance. Currently, in our state the national budget relies mainly on tax income. So, in this regard, we do not have any objection to H.E. Son Chhai's call to increase the severity of the punishment. However, this issue has already been dealt with by law. Yet, should our National Assembly deem it necessary to pursue this matter by adding that provision, the RGC has no objection. We merely ask that more appropriate wording be reached. This is because just saying "to consolidate the Forestry and Wildlife Department" and adding "by meting out an urgent punishment" seems to be mismatched phrasing. Therefore, I ask the commission or H.E. [Planning Minister] Chea Chanto on behalf of the RGC to rearrange this sentence so that it includes the two conditions -- to consolidate the department and increase the severity of punishment -- to fight this crime. So, the RGC only asks for a rewording. Other than that, as a question of principle, the RGC has no objection. H.E. Son Chhai also talked about the issue of specialists. I would like to inform all of you that the RGC has asked France and France has responded by sending their specialists to help the RGC compile a forestry and wildlife code to ensure a correct logging and reforestration policy that would conform with the nation's needs as well as the international norms and laws observed in other countries. Once more I would like to inform you, excellencies and mesdames, that the RGC is paying maximum attention in line with the august idea of our revered king concerning the protection of our nation's natural resources and environment as part of our efforts to ensure the future of Cambodia, the future of our younger generations. I take this opportunity, in my capacity as the first prime minister, to make some observations on the points just raised in its report by the commission. First, on the assertion that the imbalance between production and consumption is a major problem that the entire national community must confront and solve and particularly the assertion that this imbalance is essentially caused by the insufficient means of production, the low level of technology, and the lack in human resource, I would like to inform you, excellencies and mesdames, that the RGC has a plan to ask the Education Ministry to change the aim of our national education. We must emulate post-World War II Germany, which needed labor to meet its national reconstruction needs. Therefore, the RGC will order the ministry concerned -- namely, the Ministry of Education -- to give priority to setting up vocational institutes. After finishing secondary education, our students should be diverted to receive at least three years of vocational training. If we fail to do that, if we continue to encourage our students to further their study in colleges or universities, we will surely have graduates in the forms of engineers, scholars, and doctors with substandard academic degrees. In real life, these graduates will be incapable of finding jobs although many investors have vacancies to fill. So, there will be a serious social problem in the future, and we will not be able to meet the demands of our nation. For this reason, the RGC once again asks the Education Ministry to effect a reorientation. Let us compare Germany and France. France at this moment is experiencing a serious unemployment problem whereas Germany is able to solve this same problem. So is Japan. Japan and Germany after the war took the correct steps in national educaction. Based on this reasoning, the RGC will ask friendly countries who wish to help us to do so by creating as many institutes as possible for vocational training to meet the demands of the country and the needs of foreign investors. If we can provide only what they call low-skilled labor, Cambodia will remain poor forever while our neighbors will prosper. For this reason, we must start with producing the so-called low-skilled labor first and in the very short future we must have the ability to produce the so-called finished-skilled labor before reaching the state of labor category achieved by Singapore, which is called high-tech labor. Nonetheless, we are able to provide the low-skilled labor now. Cambodia has very great potential. It has been said that the cheapest labor in Southeast Asia can be found in Indonesia, where the lowest wage is $68 to $70 a month. In Cambodia, our monthly wage is only $35 to $40. So, our labor is the cheapest. It is almost half of what is earned in Indonesia. For this reason, we must attract as many foreign invesments as possible. Regarding this investment issue raised by the commission, the RGC has already drafted a bill on investment in Cambodia. The RGC will submit this bill for cabinet approval and will submit it for the National Assembly's scrutiny and passage as soon as possible. I met with foreign diplomats and major would-be investors. They clearly told us that our current problem is not the Khmer Rouge. What stops them from coming in now is the absence in our country of a legal investment law. We have created distrust in them. So, they have proposed that we pass an investment law as soon as possible. We have already drafted such a bill, and some of those foreign experts to whom we have submitted it for examination have assured us that if such an investment law is promulgated, we will be the star of Asia [preceding three words in English]. We have drawn up this investment law with outside help. We have modeled it after the laws of many other countries. We also studied the stipulations of the IMF. We have made it better than others. If we do not do that, no one -- no major investor -- will come to invest in our country. They would rather go to Vietnam. For this reason, the National Assembly will have to study and pass this investment law as soon as possible. The investors have told us they are not afraid of the Khmer Rouge. If they have not yet come in it is because no investmment law is in effect. Furthermore, they have told us that Cambodia is too slow in making decisions. Who is responsible for making these decisions? Some firms have submitted their applications as long as 18 months ago already. These are major firms such as Germany's Siemens and others. We keep holding endless discussions and debates on their applications. So, it is not the question of insecurity but the question of our lack of an investment law, lack of sufficient guarantees, and lack of ability to make prompt decisions. If we continue to be as deficient as we are now, no countries will have the patience to wait; they will surely take their investments elsewhere. This is a point that I would like to impress upon you. Moreover, concerning this investment matter, sometimes it is smart to ignore a few insignificant mistakes committed by the investors. We must not hesitate to let major firms of international standing, those coming from big countries, proceed with their investments in our country even if to a small extent they affect our own interests. In the long run, Cambodia can only benefit from such companies. For example, if major firms from America, France, England, Japan, or Australia invest in our country we will not have to go around begging for their assistance. They will automatically help us because they will need to protect their interests in our kingdom. So, the interests will be mutual. This is a response to the question raised by Madame who just now said that we are lacking in human resources. I say we have the human resources. What we need to do is to transform this human resource, and make it meet the demands of the nation and of foreign investors. The RGC has the plan to redirect our national education from now on. On the other hand, the madame representative's assertion that the lack of balance between import and export is noteworthy is most correct. In the past we had agriculture as our asset. Now the RGC is making great efforts in its water conservancy and irrigation policy, restoring ditches and canals, selecting good seeds, and providing farmers with fertilizers. However, if in dealing with agriculture we keep relying on traditional methods, we will not be able to achieve much. So, the new objective of the RGC is also reorientation. We are aiming our focus on industrial crops. Talking of industrial crops, the first thing that comes to mind is rubber plantations that I and Samdech Hun Sen agreed the other day to set aside. I would like however to inform their excellencies and mesdames who are the representatives of our state and nation that the new objective of the RGC is to develop industrial crops. For example, in agriculture today's Vietnam has become a bigger coffee producing nation than the African nations. Why can Cambodia not do the same? What is the difference between the two sides of the political border? There is no natural border, of course. If the land is good for coffee in Vietnam it should be good for coffee in Cambodia, too. Another crop is the oilseed, soy beans, or [word indistinct]. The competent departments are studying possibilities and several major firms have been prepared to invest in this field. Yet another industrial crop is the castor-oil plant. We have a large market for this crop, in particular Thailand, which has just built a large refinery to extract this type of oil. However, Thailand has no land to grow this crop. It has contacted us and leased some 200,000 hectares of our land for the planting of this new crop. So, in summary, we must change our objective and focus on industrial crops. If we continue to stick to our traditional crops, we will not be able to meet our demands both at the present and in the future. The RGC plans to build an assembly plant for tractors, such as Massey-Fergusson. There are many regions like the plains around the Tonle Sap lake where during the Sangkum Reas Niyum era there were as many as 200 tractors engaged in the cultivating the floating rice. Now there are only about 60 to 70 tractors for this purpose. The local farmers have appealed for somebody to import additional tractors. I would like to inform you that we are going to borrow money and use it to assemble or produce these tractors for sale to the people at low prices so that they can cultivate the 30,000 hectares which even without the use of fertilizers yield from 2.5 to 3 metric tons per hectare. This is a great yield, and it is something that the kingdom can do and will do in the near future. The imbalance of our national budget, as I said before, results from the fact that our national budget relies on two main sources of incomes: taxes and foreign aid. H.E. Chea Chanto said just now that foreign countries cannot help us forever, and we cannot depend entirely on our tax incomes. However, as I have just informed you, there are means to beef up our national budget. Up to this point, the RGC has been able to balance the budget in terms of service although in terms of construction we still incur a budget imbalance. This, however, should be seen as an achievement by the RGC. Besides, it was proposed to increase the national product from 2.5 percent to 8 percent in 1994 if possible. Normally, we need a bigger growth because ours is a newly developing country. A growth of 7 or 8 percent is seen as a natural development in Southeast Asia. Thailand's growth remains at 9 percent. In 1993 we recorded a 7-percent growth. This year -- H.E. Sam Rangsi is here to confirm it -- maybe we will be able to reach 8-percent growth. Considering the needs of our nation, an 8-percent growth is insufficient, and we need much more than that. However, under the current circumstances, we cannot do better than that. But this 8-percent rate is the average growth rate of countries in our Southeast Asia. The RGC is paying attention to the raising of silk worms. The Agriculture Ministry is closely following development in this area because presently we are importing silk from foreign countries. However, I have asked our people why they did not grow mulberry trees. They said there was no need to plant these mulberry trees to raise silk worms because it was much more convenient and much cheaper to buy silk from abroad. This was a problem. We have decided that we must grow mulberry trees to raise silk worms, but the weavers insisted that they did not need to plant them because it was cheaper and faster to buy silk from Vietnam and, to top it, this silk from Vietnam was of better quality. However, we must solve this problem for the people. Now let us talk about industry, trade, and tourism. Concerning the issue of factories, I would like to inform you that the RGC has a plan to privatize the nation's industrial enterprises. However, there are a few national enterprises that are considered to be strategic. The RGC cannot privatize all our state industrial enterprises. A few will remain under the control of the RGC because they are regarded as strategic. Concerning the private factories, I would like to inform you of this: Some Japanese wish to rent our state-owned factories, but they have asked the RGC to seal off the border and stop the smuggling of similar goods from abroad. The Japanese has asked us to set up a customs wall [two preceding words repeated in English]. This is because should they invest in our country and produce consumer goods for local consumption and export, especially for local consumption, and should we be unable to seal off our border, the factories in the country would not be able to compete with the same goods, the same products that can be sold at much lower prices because of mass production and higher technology. As a result, our factories will be forced to close their doors one after another. There is also the issue of duties and profit taxes. We are not resorting to a protectionist policy, but we have to find a way to enable the local factories to compete with the same products imported from abroad. Moreover, the imported products that outsell our local products are made abroad. What we need -- even if we make only a small profit -- is the employment opportunities for our people. This should be a priority. Without such opportunities, our people will become poorer and poorer. Consequently, the RGC would like to make the following plea to you, excellencies and mesdames: If you feel that we are imposing too low taxes, you should realize that the job opportunities given to the unemployed populace should more than compensate for the relatively small incomes into the national coffer. Employment is a priority to be immediately solved otherwise we will be confronted with a serious social problem in Cambodia in the very near future. Furthermore, there is the issue of electric supply. Not only are we experiencing a massive power shortage but the people of Cambodia are paying a much higher price for their electricity. Ours is not one time but five times higher than the electricity sold anywhere else in the world. So, despite the cheap labor, products made in our country remain costly because our electricity is very expensive. For this reason, the RGC has another goal. We will not just set up power plants, but our strategy is that our electricity will rely on water, on hydroelectric sources, because we have so many possibilities in this area and many international organizations, countries, and companies are prepared to help us in this field. Without speaking of dams on the Mekong River, just the dams to be built on other rivers throughout the country would produce 17,000 megawatts. This production far exceeds the needs in our kingdom. Another area that we should talk about -- which madame the representative has raised just now -- is tourism. This is a major issue, an important issue. Almost every day the RGC is studying ways to exploit tourism. However, it is not possible to deal with tourism without taking into consideration the question of security as a whole. The issue of prices in our country must also be tackled. Our hotels and restaurants are very expensive compared to those in our neighboring countries. The RGC therefore has a plan to help reduce to the maximum capital necessary in this vital field of tourism. The RGC, despite some shortcomings, is working to restore not only the airport in Siem Reap but also the Pochentong airport. Our Pochentong airport is incapable of taking in large- bodied aircraft of the Boeing-747 type. This weakness has led many potential tourists to go to neighboring countries instead. These neighboring countries are making profit at the expense of all of us Cambodians. For this reason, the RGC has an urgent plan to build a new runway at the same Pochentong site. This new runway will have the international standard length of 3,600 meters. Its construction will be finished within two to two and a half years and it will allow Boeing-747 planes to land. Otherwise, there would be no end to the so-called bottleneck [preceding word in French]. The RGC also has a plan to build another terminal [preceding word in French] to be completed within two to two and a half years at Pochentong. Concerning the issue of the airport in Siem Reap just raised by the commission, I would like to say that we will not permit large aircraft like the Boeing-737's or Airbus-300's to land on the Siem Reap runway although this runway is capable of accommodating these planes. This is because we fear that the landing tremor might shake up and damage our ancient temples, such as Angkor Wat. The RGC therefore has decided not to permit large jet aircraft to land at the Siem Reap airport, but we are going to restore this Siem Reap airport, and in the future we will find means to build another airport some 30 to 40 km away from Siem Reap city. In the meantime we must permit small propeller-driven planes to shuttle between Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. In this field of tourism, the RGC has a plan to open up Sihanoukville and turn it into Asia's largest tourist site if possible in the future. This is because we have many more conditions favorable to us to do just that than any other country. The RGC has also already decided to build another international airport in Sihanoukville. All of that, in principle, is good enough to bring about success in the tourist field. Briefly, we accept all the proposals or observations of the commission concerning the restoration of roads as a priority task. As you know, National Routes 12, 13, 18, 19, and so on are receiving close attention from the RGC. In the name of the RGC, we have just visited Koh Kong, Ratanakiri, and Mondolkiri and we talked about this priority issue there. However, we currently lack the budgetary funds, and these routes need considerable funds. Nevertheless, the RGC will do its best to restore them at all costs, especially the routes linking Phnom Penh with the eastern and western regions of the country. This is because of the concept that development without roads is not possible. In two or three provinces, such as Mondolkiri, Ratanakiri, and Stung Treng, there are huge natural resources, and these provinces are very lightly populated. Mondolkiri's population is 20,000 and Ratanakiri's is 60,000. Several big firms plan to invest in our country in growing industrial crops. So, this is a great guarantee for the future of our kingdom. What the RGC asks for is merely this: to a number of youths who seem to be restive over the issues of security, or the lack of it, and development, I would like to take this opportunity to remind them that before the elections H.E. Lee Kwan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, told our august and most revered king father that after the war comes to an end and when there is 100 percent security Cambodia will need at least 10 more years just to become equal to what it was under Sangkum Reas Niyum. Mind you, we will need 10 years not to catch up with Singapore but just to be as good as when we were under Sangkum Reas Niyum. The RGC is now only eight months old. Therefore, you should not pass judgment on us for what we have done in only eight months. That is not 10 years with total security. We are just eight months old. Therefore, I ask the respected National Assembly to kindly allow the RGC to continue working with the limited resources at its disposal to lead the nation for a little while longer. Please consider my request. Thank you.
