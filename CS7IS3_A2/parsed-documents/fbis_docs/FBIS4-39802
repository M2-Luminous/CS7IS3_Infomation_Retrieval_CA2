Volodin: "Only Together Can We Work Efficiently"] [Text] Participants in the briefing held by Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Ye. Saburov on 28 May for media representatives assessed the events in the Crimean Supreme Soviet of the previous week when a number of deputies protested against the government's program, without even reading it. Ye. Saburov read a statement calling the incident "a constitutional coup exemplified by the legislature's desire to replace the Executive Branch." According to the deputy prime minister, this scenario is identical to the developments in Moscow, cited by Saburov, when the former Russian Supreme Soviet embarked on a path of dangerous opposition against the Executive Branch represented by the president of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, the paradox of the Crimean situation lies in the fact that numerous members of the Russia deputies' bloc opposed President Meshkov, those very people who used to pledge their loyalty to the president a while ago. Saburov believes the banal fight for ministerial portfolios to be the primary cause for the parliamentary "mutiny." It is understood that the Russia bloc has the right to recommend its candidates for the posts in the Crimean Government. However, the deputy prime minister maintains that he is ready to consider only the candidacies of highly-competent professionals. The views of the Crimean president on personnel issues coincide with those of Saburov. Unfortunately, their opponents in the legislature take an absolutely different approach. That is why they are persistently supporting the myth of the "invasion of bureaucrats from Moscow," despite the fact that only five Muscovites are actually working in the government. The deputy prime minister rejected the accusations by lawmakers who claim that the government has no distinct program for overcoming the crisis. Saburov pointed out: "We have already started implementing this program despite the clandestine sabotage by a number of senior officials, including the management of Crimea's National Bank. Due to the fact that the latter refused to obey the Crimean president's edict granting local enterprises the right to sell currency at market prices, Crimea has probably lost several million dollars. The implementation of the program is also being upset by populist claims by a number of deputies who are demanding "liberalization" of taxes, in disregard of the fact that the government is facing grave difficulties financing the Crimean budget." Putting spokes in the government's wheels in the current critical period, planting a mine under the relations between the president and the legislature of Crimea, the people's deputies, according to Saburov, push Kiev officials toward harsh measures against Crimean autonomy. Asked by a KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA reporter about possible measures to be taken by the government in case the Supreme Soviet takes no steps to meet the Executive Branch half-way on personnel issues, Saburov briefly answered: "The government will continue to perform its duties proceeding from the interests of the people of Crimea." He strongly recommended the legislature not to stand in the government's way and to finally get down to serious lawmaking. Saburov stressed: "Only together can we work efficiently."
