He said this today at a meeting of the Public Chamber under the Russian president, which is examining the position of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic countries -- to be precise, in Latvia and Estonia -- since, according to the participants of the discussion, "normal conditions have been created in Lithuania for ethnic Russians." Having pointed out that "the infringement of the rights of the Russians and Russian-speaking population in Latvia and Estonia is giving cause for great concern," Vitaliy Churkin underlined that the discussion of this issue by the Public Chamber proves that this problem has "really a political connotation." At the same time, according to him, "this is not paying tribute to the present state of affairs. Our treatment of this issue is being dictated by the concern for Russians who have found themselves beyond the borders of their fatherland." The problem is extremely complex and the Foreign Affairs Ministry is striving to show maximum flexibility in solving it, the deputy minister said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "You can understand the anxiety of Latvians who think that having 40 percent Russians in their republic is a lot," Vitaliy Churkin said. "But the problem needs to be and can be solved in the framework of cooperation, taking into account, if nothing else, the fact that it was the Russian Federation that helped Latvia attain independence, and not at the price of forcing out Russian-speakers from territory on which they have been living for many years, many of them even having been born there." In the opinion of Vitaliy Churkin, the time has come to equate Russophobia with such phenomena as aggressive nationalism, chauvinism, and antisemitism. Vitaliy Churkin said that Russia's Foreign Ministry was implementing three main policies in its work: the maintenance of direct communications with Russians in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia to be of practical assistance to them in adapting to new conditions of life; a bilateral dialogue with the Baltic states; and the use of international organizations and contacts with leading countries of the West to draw attention to this problem. He noted, among other things, that the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation was constantly drawing the attention of the CSCE and the Council of Europe to the situation of Russian-speakers in the Baltic countries. A Russian delegation at the permanent committee of the CSCE has regularly been initiating debate on this matter, urging it to take specific steps in this area. After stressing that Russia "does not intend to distance itself from the resolution of the problem," the deputy minister said that the Foreign Ministry had detailed a program for the defense of the rights and interests of ethnic Russians in the countries of the CIS and Russia, which laid out a range of measures needed to be implemented to assist where necessary compatriots who had found themselves in a difficult situation abroad.
