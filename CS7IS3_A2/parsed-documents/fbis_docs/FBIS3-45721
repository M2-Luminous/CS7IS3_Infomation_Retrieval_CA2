British business circles are no longer concerned about whether his constitutional reform package will be passed by the Legislative Council, and they have noted that his unilateral legislation was an erroneous action. His countrymen asked him to make it plain how the trade interests of British business would be harmed and whether British-Chinese relations would turn for the better after the talks on the Hong Kong issue broke down. Therefore, this time, Patten was in no mood to put on "political shows" by appearing on British television or arranging interviews with British newspapers; instead, he hastily consulted some "China hands" about countermeasures, and tried to cope with the huge pressures from the British business community. He discussed ways to deal with the Chinese with former foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe, and discussed how to handle the deadlocked situation after the breakdown of talks with Ambassador McLaren and Foreign Minister Goodlad. When he was appointed Hong Kong governor and was on his way to take office in Hong Kong, he vowed to maintain good relations with China in front of some British businessmen who supported his appointment. He said that he would build up trust with his Chinese counterparts and would be able to solve many issues by just dialing the phone. He meant that as Britain had appointed such an able Hong Kong governor, British businessmen would gain favor everywhere in their China trade. However, all people have seen that he behaved in an extremely irresponsible way by challenging the established agreements between China and Britain, refusing to make things converge with the Basic Law, and recklessly bringing part of the controversial constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council before an agreement had been reached, and all this was unnecessary. Patten ruined all of the progress that had been made in the past and caused the breakdown of the talks without regard to the interests of the residents of Hong Kong and the interests of British businessmen. He simply made a mess of the situation and broke the promises he made when he took office. Therefore, at a hearing in the British Parliament, David Howell and other Conservative MP's questioned him about whether he had expected the strong reaction of the Chinese side, what had caused the current deadlock in Sino-British relations, and whether Patten formulated China policy and had forced the British Government to adopt it, or, would he, as Hong Kong governor, obey the British Government. Patten still stubbornly fought with his back to the wall. He did not dare to speak clearly, and just said that "the British Government supports my constitutional reform package." It seems that his superiors are only able to support a subordinate and do not have the power to correct what the subordinate has done. Such an arrogant attitude will only arouse strong criticism from the British business community. At the hearing, Patten still tried to conceal faults and gloss over wrongs and to deceive the British public. He said that he did not know about any agreement between China and Britain in 1990 at all, because when he consulted Percy Craddock about constitutional reforms, Craddock did not tell him that an agreement had been reached on electoral arrangements, so he did not have to worry about that. All people in Hong Kong have long known about the seven letters exchanged between the Chinese and British foreign ministers, and Chinese officials also told him that the seven letters represented an agreement, but he still declared in a session of the Legislation Council's that he "would not recognize any secret agreements" and "would not create any more secret agreements." The deadlocked situation was created by him deliberately, and he is trying to shirk all his responsibilities. Now, Western countries, including the United States, Japan, Germany, and France, are all vying with each other to march into the Chinese market. Will Britain still allow Patten to continue his blunders and harm British-Chinese relations? Even the Labor Party's Allan Rogers also said that the Conservative cabinet should bear the responsibility for the worsening of British-Chinese relations. The parliamentary hearing enabled British voters to clearly see who has caused the worsening of British-Chinese relations. It is Chris Patten who should bear responsibility for the current situation. John Major is now bogged down in a predicament, and does not want to be blamed for the worsening of British-Chinese relations. Therefore, on the one hand, the Conservative Party summoned Patten to give a testimony; on the other hand, it has again dispatched McLaren back to Beijing to deal the deadlocked situation left to him by Christopher Hum and to sound out China's reaction. Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin explicitly replied to the British side: The Chinese side hopes that the British side will withdraw the partial constitutional reform package that has been submitted to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for deliberation and returns to the negotiating table. "If the British side refuses to withdraw it and brings the second part of the constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council for deliberation, then this will further show that the British side is determined not to return to the negotiating table, and that the British side will thus have to bear responsibility for all consequences." "The Chinese side will not accept any legislative decision on the 1994-95 elections made by the Legislative Council, and all institutions formed according to such decisions will only be able to function up until 30 June 1997." The position of the Chinese side is firm, and the British side should carefully weigh up the consequent gains and losses, restrain Patten's confrontational policy, and remove obstacles to Sino- British cooperation.
