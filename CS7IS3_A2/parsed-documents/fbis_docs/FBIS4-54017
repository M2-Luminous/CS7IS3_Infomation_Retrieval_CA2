FBIS4-54017 "dreas101__a94025" FBIS-EAS-94-101-A Daily Report 24 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Plans for Optical Fiber Network Disclosed Plans for Optical Fiber Network Disclosed OW2505114594 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2505114594 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Details of a report, prepared by a telecommunications policy department of the Telecommunications Council (chaired by Fumio Watanabe, adviser to Tokyo Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.), an advisory panel to the posts and telecommunications minister, were disclosed on 23 May. The council has been studying how the government should build a foundation for the information telecommunications system for a multimedia era in the 21st century. The report says that an optical fiber network, which can transmit a large amount of information, should cover all offices and homes in the nation by 2010 and thereby create a social system adoptable to a full-scale multimedia era. The report also proposes that the government should aim at reforming people's lives and the national economy for the 21st century. To do that, the report sets three stages, proposing that the optical fiber network should be created to cover metropolitan areas and prefectural capitals by the year 2000, all cities with a population of 100,000 or more by 2005, and all cities in the nation by 2010. Moreover, the report points out the need to utilize the private sector's vital power as much as possible by allowing the project to be carried out mainly by the private sector. The report will be submitted to a general meeting of the council for deliberation on 31 May. After that, it will be submitted to Post and Telecommunications Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa. The report comprises seven chapters. The first and second chapters present a vision of upgraded communications based on the optical fiber network serving as a key to solve pending problems, including the aging of society and decentralization of the population. Moreover, the report predicts that creation of new multimedia-related businesses to serve the network would produce a 123 trillion yen multimedia market and about 2.43 million jobs by 2010. In the third chapter, which explains concrete plans for the network construction, the report says a total of 33-53 trillion yen would be needed to construct the optical fiber network. If the cables are placed underground, an additional 42 trillion yen will be necessary, the report predicts. To reduce the financial burdens of private companies that create the network, the report urges the government to consider setting up zero-interest loans and special tax relief. The report sets the year 2000, when Japan's population is expected to peak, as a target for completion of the optical fiber network. The report emphasizes that introduction of the network in public institutions nationwide, including schools, libraries, hospitals, town halls, and welfare facilities, should be completed by 2000 and that the network should be used as a means to trigger demand for the network, especially in depopulated local communities. In regard to construction of the network, the report clearly states a plan designed to carry out the project mainly by the private sector. As for the government's role, the report says that it "should be limited to creating a favorable environment for private companies and to keep gaps between localities at a minimum to secure consumers' interest."
