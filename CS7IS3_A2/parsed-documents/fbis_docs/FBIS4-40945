At least, such a conclusion is indicated by the results of a survey conducted by the independent polling company "Mnenie" (Opinion) among a representative sample of four thousand people in 30 Russian districts. However, there is a large danger that the presidential elections, if held today, would not be valid or would be an only partly meaningful political exercise. Of those questioned, 38 percent said they did not trust any of the likely candidates, and 18 percent are already planning to skip the elections altogether. Yeltsin proved that he is still considered the lesser of all the evils, receiving 11.3 percent of the hypothetical votes. In second place was Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" electoral bloc, with nine percent. Yeltsin received proportionately more support among citizens over thirty years of age. The 18-29 age group pinned their hopes for Russia's future more on the leader of the Yabloko bloc, who received 9.5 percent of their votes, compared to Yeltsin's 7.4 percent. Yavlinskiy also appealed to the middle and upper classes. 13.7 percent of those with monthly salaries of 100,000 rubles or more (50 U.S. dollars) supported Yavlinskiy, while 11.5 percent preferred Yeltsin. The president's support among respondents with 50,000 or less rubles a month was 10.2 percent. Ex-vice-president and opposition leader Aleksandr Rutskoy gets most of his support from the countryside and small towns (seven percent each), although Yeltsin had higher figures among both types of rural dwellers. Extreme-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy did not get into the top three slots except among country people, who gave him third place behind Yeltsin and Rutskoy.
