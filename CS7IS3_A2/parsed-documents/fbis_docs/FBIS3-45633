Wang Shiyuan, vice-minister of the State Commission for Economic Systems Restructuring, told a press conference that to achieve the purpose, the government will work hard to maintain a balance between China's total supply and demand and bring the money supply under control. New price reform measures, commensurate to the financial capabilities of both the state and the people, will be published at an "opportune date," said Wang, who was attending the press conference with fellow Vice-Ministers Liu Zhifeng and Hong Hu. The three officials insisted that on no account will this year's reforms in banking and taxation affect actual prices as they are only meant to rationalize the banking and taxation systems. XINHUA has learned that the principle for the reforms, as described by the three vice-ministers, is one of "seizing the current opportunity to advance the reforms and accelerating development while ensuring stability." They said that reform measures for 1994 are greater in number and more extensive than for any previous year. "The deeper and more extensively the reforms develop, the greater will be their repercussions and the difficulty in executing them," they told Chinese and foreign reporters at the press conference. This calls for correctly handling the relations of reforms, development and stability and summing up experiences in good time, so that reform plans can be improved in times of necessity, they said. Meanwhile, they said, what is also needed is boldness in exploring ways for pushing the reforms forward to ensure each one's success. The officials spoke specifically on the urban housing reform in the wake of a State Council order to prohibit selling of publicly- owned housing at excessively low prices. Recently, state-owned enterprises and institutions in some places rushed to sell their own housing as a fringe benefit for their staff. "The State Council is finalizing the plan and will publish a decision on the housing reform for nationwide application," said Liu Zhifeng, a top official in charge of the housing reform. "The State Council prohibition is meant to ensure success of the housing reform instead of halting it and help the government raise enough money for building new housing for the people," he added. Work is under way to formulate reform-related laws and government decrees, according to these officials. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is expected to publish a securities law in 1994. A draft of the law is being passed around among China's legislators, officials and experts for opinions and criticisms. The State Council will soon publish a set of regulations on China's futures trading and is putting the final touches on a draft of the "Regulations on the Management of State-Owned Property and Assets." Consultations are going on between the State Economic Systems Restructuring Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission to choose 100 large-sized state-owned enterprises to experiment with modern enterprise management. Meanwhile, 13 cities have been chosen to try out what is called "comprehensive reforms." These are Changzhou, Chongqing, Anshan, Yanji, Quanzhou, Tangshan, Yantai, Tongling, Ningbo, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Harbin.
