"I am not asking you to depict the situation in the Yugoslav Army as being better than it really is," General Perisic told the correspondents. He urged the building of better mutual trust through various forms of cooperation. General Perisic recalled that not a single member of the Yugoslav Army is outside Yugoslav borders, except for diplomatic and consular missions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia abroad. He added that the Yugoslav Army is not causing any incidents on the border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. These incidents, he explained, come as a consequence of an undefined internationally recognized border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Yugoslav Army CGS also stressed that the process of depolitization of the Yugoslav Army has been completed, and spoke about the Army's high technical and technological level which has been maintained despite the sanctions.
