However, the unity forces's concern and ethical and religious commitments make them dutybound to safeguard the lives of innocent people. The grudges and bloody whims of these secessionist forces as well as their Communist missiles will make our people and army of unity and legitimacy more concerned about our fathers, mothers, and sons in beloved Aden, al-Dali', and other areas. Therefore, we would like to reassure our people in beloved Aden and in other areas that the army of unity and legitimacy does not harbor grudges or seek liquidation. This army will put before everything the welfare of all fathers, mothers, and defenseless children wherever they are in Yemen. Their unity army, which fully abides by the values of Islam, will only behead, with its iron hand, the separatists who tampered with Aden and with all (?lofty) southern governorates and their good people for approximately 30 years. It is a blessed advance toward a new Yemen which is free of secessionist butchers, God willing. We only ask that our brother citizens in the beloved Governorates of Aden and Lahij remain calm, do not cooperate with the gang of apostasy and separation, and do not respond to their separatists.
