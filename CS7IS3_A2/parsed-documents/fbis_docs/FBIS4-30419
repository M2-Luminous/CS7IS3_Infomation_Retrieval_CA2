However, if North Korea persists on having talks in Pyongyang first, the government will accept this on the condition that the first talks be held in Pyongyang in July and the second are held in Seoul in August. In the event that the two sides fail to reach an agreement to designate Seoul and Pyongyang as the venue for the talks, the government will propose Panmunjom as the first alternate place, and Seoul or Pyongyang as the venue for the second talks. The government will submit to President Kim Yong-sam for approval on 27 June a draft of "the agreement for holding a North-South summit between the North and the South," which will be presented to the North Korean side during a preliminary contact for a North-South summit slated for 28 June. This draft agreement includes various conditions and forms to be proposed by the South side pertaining to the summit, including the time and place of the talks, itineraries, entourages, and the number of accompanying reporters. Earlier on Sunday 26 June, the government made a final review of the preparatory works for the preliminary contact by conducting a mock conference in the office of the North-South talks in Samchongdong, Seoul, attended by our side's delegates to the preliminary contact, including Yi Hong-ku, vice prime minister and unification minister; Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for diplomatic and security affairs; and Yun Yo-chun, special assistant to the prime minister.
