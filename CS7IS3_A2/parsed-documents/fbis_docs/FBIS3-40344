Designing a satellite means integrating the know-how from many disciplines: Computer-aided design [CAD]; mechanical, thermal, acoustic, and electrical engineering; electronics; impact propagation; propulsion; space and flight environments; payload.... All specialists from these disciplines must work as one if the satellite is to be successfully developed and launched. Until recently, however, such specialists have tended to act sequentially rather than concurrently: "The design department and the engineering department have always worked quite independently from each other," explains project manager J.C. Amieux. Potential configurations are developed by the design department, while the engineering services study their compatibility, first with the launcher, then with the space environment. Development of the satellite then proceeds with the project being shuttled back and forth between the design department, which designs systems, and the engineering department, which throws light on a number of design weaknesses; the design department makes corrections, the engineering department runs its computational codes once more, and so it goes until the configuration meets the mission's requirements. Thus the problem is both simple and complex: While such an iterative process is obviously very time-consuming, unifying the two worlds of CAD and engineering is a real challenge with respect to technical, information-technology, and human aspects. Technological Challenge First of all, for the various participants to act concurrently, they must speak the same language. However, the design department and the scientific disciplines in charge of the various calculations do not share the same representation of reality: CAD specialists work on complete models very similar to the real thing, while engineers use idealized structures. J.C. Amieux: "In fact, this is a problem of multirepresentation. There are two ways around it. We can either start with the CAD model and simplify and abstract it in order to build an x-number of models corresponding to an x-number of scientific disciplines. Or we can begin with simple structures used in engineering, and then flesh out the model: Why construct a complex CAD model when the various groups have not come up with a final configuration yet?" While the second solution may appear preferable, it creates another problem: All projects soon need to be expressed through an artist's view, a realistic rendering whose purpose is the management of interfaces between satellite and launcher, between boxes and support plates, between antennas and payload plates.... Not to mention interfaces with the outside world: between Matra Marconi Space [MMS] and its customers, between MMS and its subcontractors.... It must also be possible to consult with the latter at any time during the project. However, the multirepresentation problem is not as critical as in other fields: No-one would dream of developing a consumer product without knowing very early on what it will look like. So there is no single solution: "No matter which way is chosen, each discipline is going to stick to its own model...and our task will be to manage those models, and to make sure they can actually communicate," J.C. Amieux explains. Information Technology Challenge MMS's first goal was to consolidate the computer environment so that all models could communicate. "Rewriting all programs, thousands of lines of code, would be neither realistic nor useful," says J.C. Amieux. "We had to come up with other solutions: direct connection with data structures or the use of communication standards." The first approach is only conceivable if there is access to the data structure, which is easier said than done.... Furthermore, this does not necessarily solve problems arising as part of relations with the various partners: One can hardly compel them to use a given software package.... The alternate route is that of data exchange standards. While it may appear an easier one, it has its own set of problems. Some highly specialized fields have almost no standards. As for those standards that do exist, they are not always "standard": Some designers use their own substandards...which make transferring data from one software package to another highly perilous! Unless, again, one is in touch with the designers of the software. The ideal solution would be an opening and a standardization of packages as wide as possible: "Exchange standards are sheer hell...but since we are not locked in one place, anything goes," says Matra Datavision Marketing and Communications Director Jean-Yves Guinemer, who also supplies MMS with packages such as Euclid. For the time being, since there is no simple solution, MMS has chosen one that is a compromise. Close links with Matra Datavision have led to an interconnection of the tools used by the design department and the engineering department, the tools having been made compatible with the ESABASE European satellite modeling language. The result is Systema, a computerized system which consists in a number of integrated and interconnected tools and makes it possible for specialists belonging to different disciplines to talk to one another. "However, this is not a centralized system which a single operator could use to `design' a satellite: All we did was to interconnect the various departments in order to let them work together on the same project," explains J.C. Amieux. This tool drastically reduces a satellite's design time: Over a 10-year period, MMS has cut this time by half, with spacecraft becoming increasingly complex. "What remains to be done now is to interconnect the three integrated sets we have created: the tools the satellite will use to respond to its environment, structure-oriented computational tools, and CAD tools," says J.C. Amieux. This is one of the subsequent phases on the road to concurrent engineering: integration, from the design stage, of all elements of a satellite's lifecycle. Human Challenge So concurrent engineering is based on methodology and tools. But there is more: "In this concurrent engineering project, we started with the tools -- if there are no tools, people do not begin to change their methodology. But because they have the tools does not guarantee they will change methodologies!" Thus, as always, convincing people to change their ways takes a lot of work. MMS has a powerful argument, however: "A critical review of the way people work never fails to show that they increasingly refuse repetitive and costly work. Transcribing a model from one standard into another is hardly productive...," explains J.C. Amieux. However, one basic principle must be kept in mind: "All this work must not be visible to the end-user, who must only think: I could not do this before, and now it is both possible and more efficient...." Let us take a project group as an example: Experts of the various disciplines used to meet in the flesh, with all their paraphernalia of pens and papers. Now, they can work together via the large screen of a workstation: They will have access to the project's history and to all calculations already performed; they will be able to make changes and see very quickly their impact on the various disciplines.... In other words, it is possible to work concurrently and in parallel on several disciplines. Moreover, much better use of the results of other projects can be expected: Cross-fertilization, which currently takes place only within the various departments, should now be possible at the upper level also. "A wholly new concept of engineering is emerging. This was made possible by, among other things, networking and ever-cheaper and more powerful workstations. This new approach is essential if productivity, quality, and prices are to be improved. Especially in an industry which is characterized by fierce international competition," Jean- Claude Amieux concludes. Engineering Workshop The concept of "framework" -- single development environment or engineering workshop -- is a difficult one. "This is an information technology notion, an essential one for the development of concurrent engineering. However, there is currently no consensus as to what a single development environment really is," says J.C. Amieux. Conventional CAD/CAM software packages generally offer a single work environment, albeit...a proprietary one: Developing a special module entails calling on the package's developers. The problem? Engineers want to make such tools their own.... "We developed our concept around Matra Datavision's Euclid software, among others. But we now realize that this was not the best approach to total integration. So we talked with Matra Datavision and this led to a completely reversed proposition: the Cascade software package. This product is an answer to single development environment concerns: It is a software system, a tool kit through which engineers will be able to access all the tools required in a concurrent engineering environment," J.C. Amieux says. In fact, the conditions have been entirely reversed: It is no longer a software package that is being supplied, but the tools necessary to put together the appropriate system. "Cascade also represents a substantial technological leap. It cannot be implemented all at once; therefore, we are going to integrate Cascade into the existing tool, little by little," J.C. Amieux explains. MMS in Toulouse Matra Marconi Space (MMS) was born of the 1990 merger between Matra's Space Division and British conglomerate GEC Marconi. As a result of the merger, MMS became Europe's first space-oriented integrated company. MMS' Toulouse center specializes in satellite engineering and integration: In addition to the actual platforms, its engineers design everything upstream and downstream, including instruments, on-board systems, control centers, and ground facilities. This expertise is put to use in several space-related domains. First, Earth observation satellites: Meteosat 1 through 6, SPOT-1 through -4, Helios...up to and including the future polar platform Columbus. These are instrument-carrying satellites. The basic module is reusable; only the on-board instruments are changed: from two cameras for SPOT-1, to six or even 20 on the future Columbus platform. Here, the central idea is to design and build elements that can be used in various configurations. Concurrent engineering should make this much simpler. Second, telecommunications satellites. While Earth observation satellites follow a quasi-polar heliosynchronous orbit at an altitude of 800 kilometers, telecommunications satellites are on a geostationary orbit at 36,000 kilometers. Hence, very different environments and therefore specific technologies and system constraints. The third field of activity, scientific satellites, is a highly specialized business; however, costs remain moderate: "These are one-of-a-kind platforms," says Jean-Claude Amieux. For instance, Hyparcos, the "star surveyor," beams back results with an accuracy of 2 milliseconds of arc. Then there are strategic satellites, a field where circumspection is of the essence. However, as with scientific satellites, this is a field where second-best is not an acceptable proposition. The last domain relates to manned spacecraft, with one specialty: on-board data processing. While MMS has been a participant in such projects from the very beginning, the current sundry vacillations on the subject do nothing to comfort the company's belief in the future of these activities.
