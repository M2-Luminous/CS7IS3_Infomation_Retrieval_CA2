FR940214-2-00022 FR940214-2-00011 Public Participation You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the project. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative routes for the loops), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: •Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Washington, DC 20426; •Reference Docket No. CP93&hyph;672&hyph;000; •Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Mark Jensen, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., room 7312, Washington, DC 20426; and •Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, DC on or before March 10, 1994. If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Mark Jensen of the Commission staff at the above address. Becoming an Intervenor In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want to become an intervenor, you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by §385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. In certain cases environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. Section 385.214(d) applies to grants of late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered. Additional information about the proposed project is available from Mr. Mark Jensen, EA Project Manager, at (202) 208&hyph;1121. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
