Jozo Curic reports from Vienna. [Curic] Minister Granic and Prime Minister Silajdzic are holding talks with cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. At around 1300 the two delegations ended this round of talks, which was held in preparation for the Geneva conference scheduled for 18 January. Both sides accepted a peaceful political resolution of the crisis. The talks were constructive despite a difficult situation on the ground. Both sides acknowledged the situation and the danger of a wider escalation of the conflict. Croatia firmly insists on Neum and is against [granting the Muslims] access to the sea near Prevlaka, which the cochairmen proposed. A joint statement was coordinated and issued. Both sides confirmed that an urgent cease-fire, a permanent cessation of hostilities, and a permanent normalization of relations between the Croat and Bosniak peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including territorial, political, humanitarian, and other aspects of a permanent resolution, were in the long-term and strategic interest of both peoples and the two states. In light of this, it was agreed that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and President of Bosnia-Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic should meet in Bonn on 8 January 1994. Special attention at the talks was devoted to the need to fully and consistently respect previous cease-fire agreements, particularly because of the situation in central Bosnia. The two sides confirmed that in preparing for the summit, efforts would be made to prepare a comprehensive plan for implementing the cease-fire along the entire front line and ending all combat operations to create conditions for a permanent cessation of hostilities, the protection of the population, and the implementation of confidence-building measures, the joint statement says. Both sides confirmed that the disputes on territorial demarcation should be resolved only by peaceful, political means without the use of force and in accordance with the Sarajevo declaration dated 12 November 1993. As far as humanitarian issues are concerned, it was agreed that a commission for humanitarian issues should meet on 7 January to reach an agreement on free movement of humanitarian convoys, including discussion on establishing new routes as well as securing the evacuation of the wounded and providing permanent supplies for hospitals. It was agreed to provide all necessary guarantees and documents for free passage of a field hospital for the eastern [Muslim-held] port of Mostar by 6 January. It was also agreed that the commission for exchange of prisoners should meet on 11 January. A meeting of the Mostar commission should be held on 7 January in the headquarters of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Spanish battalion in Medjugorje to prepare a program for the revitalization of Mostar and the return of citizens of Mostar to their city, in keeping with agreements reached at the last round of negotiations in Brussels. The agreement on the establishment of a free port zone in Ploce was confirmed. We should also mention that for the first time proposals were put forward for the bilateral demarcation of the two republics [Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia]. The proposals are different but they represent a basis for more concrete talks. The Muslims have demanded sovereignty near Neum and the Croats have firmly rejected this. There are areas about which the two sides could negotiate bilaterally, without the third side. A meeting with the cochairmen, Owen and Stoltenberg, is in progress.
