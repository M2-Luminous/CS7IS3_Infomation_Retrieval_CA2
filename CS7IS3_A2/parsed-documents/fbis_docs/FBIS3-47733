On 8 January at 1100, a MiG warplane fired many rockets on the houses of the inhabitants in Chreh village, Reang Khvay commune, Leach District, Pursat Province. As a result, many houses were damaged, and a number of cattle were killed. 2. The NADK wishes to join our nation and people in vehemently denouncing and condemning the criminal activities against the aforementioned people committed by the two-headed government whose masters are the communist Vietnamese and an alliance. 3. The action by the two-headed government constitutes a continuation of the communist Vietnamese aggressors' policy of eradicating the Cambodian race and an action against the king and the Cambodian nation and people, who have repeatedly called for national reconciliation to restore peace in accordance with the five-point initiative of his majesty. For more than six months, the two-headed government group has done nothing but stubbornly continue the war to destroy the nation and people at will. Also, it has given Vietnam a free hand to ship its people to Cambodia -- the Vietnamese in the country now number nearly 4 million -- and to cut off and seize part of Cambodia's maritime territory and some of the country's islands. Their crimes are extremely serious. The people in both the rural and urban areas and those living abroad are judging their crimes and sentencing them. No force is more vigorous than the people's force. Aggressors, old and new alike, have already tested the Cambodian people's force. The latter have no intention whatsoever to eliminate anybody; they only want to achieve national reconciliation in compliance with the five-point plan of the king so that the nation can regain peace and the people can have the opportunity to earn a living, look after their families, and rebuild a Cambodia with genuine independence, unity, and territorial integrity as in the epoch preceding 1970. [Dated] 12 January 1994 [Signed] NADK spokesman
