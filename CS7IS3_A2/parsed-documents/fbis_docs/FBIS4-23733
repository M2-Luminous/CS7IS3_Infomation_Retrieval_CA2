No arrangements for compensating the owners has been made, officials of the Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU) said on Friday [10 June]. They said government officials had since mid-May been posting or hand- delivering letters to farmers stating: "The president has acquired this land." The farms became the property of the state on March 16 and the owners were given three months to leave. "In other words, the owners have been farming on property not belonging to them for three months," CFU Director David Hasluck said. [passage omitted] A few of the 17 farmers have had government valuers on their properties, but the government committee dealing with compensation had not yet convened, CFU officials said.
