FBIS4-14468 "drsov062_u_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Latvia Cabinet Statement on Troop Withdrawal Agreement Cabinet Statement on Troop Withdrawal Agreement WS3003145394 Riga LETA in English 1231 GMT 30 Mar 94 WS3003145394 Riga LETA English BFN ["Unofficial translation" of statement issued by the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers concerning a package of agreements on Russian troop withdrawal signed in Moscow on 15 March] [Text] In support of signing and ratification at the Saeima [parliament] of the Republic of Latvia of a package of agreements initialed at the intergovernmental negotiations between the Republic of Latvia and the Federation of Russia on March 15, 1994, the Government of the Republic of Latvia stresses that signing and ratification of the agreement on Russian troop pull-out from the territory of Latvia by August 31, 1994. After talks which had lasted for two years, for the first time there has finally emerged a chance to solve a part of issues which are of vital importance to Latvia, which would lead to strengthening the sovereignty of Latvia. By stating the deadline of Russian troop withdrawal, the chances to secure international control of the process are considerably increased. Signing of the agreement will show once again Latvia's willingness to join the community of European nations as a full- fledged member of the community. A number of countries over the world have voiced their support of initializing the agreement, describing it as a success of Latvian diplomacy. Drafting an agreement on temporary operating of the Skrunda radar base in the Republic of Latvia was a compromise, and the Latvian Government had set a series of conditions for adopting it, which have been accepted by the Russian part, namely, internationalization of the site, establishing the international control over the facility, its civil status, and security guarantees for Latvia. The aspects have been discussed at numerous consultations with Western countries. Signing the agreement would rule out a possibility to put to operation the second tier of the Skrunda radar base and would allow to launch an immediate dismantling of the eventually most dangerous part of the facility. An exact date for terminating the operations of the remaining part of the Skrunda radar base, 31 August of 1998, has been stated. The Skrunda site being stationed in the territory of Latvia without a respective agreement stating the exact deadline for its operation, would mean uncontrollable functioning of the facility in Latvia to last for an unspecified period of time. Under the agreement the Russian part would be allowed to use only a strictly stated limited number of its own experts to secure functioning of the site. The agreement does not envisage any possibility to bring to the site a new equipment or additional contingent of experts, or to carry out modernization of the facility. Compliance with the agreement is to be monitored by a special tri-lateral commission, including also representatives of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The control over the process of carrying out the agreement exercised by the CSCE, is not the sole guarantee, it is secured also by Latvia's participation in the NATO "Partnership for Peace" programme. The agreement would foster cooperation opportunities between Latvia and Western structures of collective security by showing that Latvia is a politically mature nation which is able to implement a compromise policy also in the interests of the international community. Additionally to the rental to be paid for the Skrunda radar base being stationed in Latvia, the Russian part commits itself to compensate for the damage caused to the local environment, if any. Persons which would arrive to Latvia to maintain the facility, would go under the general visa regulations. The agreement on social status of the Russian retired militaries and their families does not provide for their legal position in the Republic of Latvia, which would be envisaged by the legislation of the Republic of Latvia. The claims by the Russian part to grant these people Latvian citizenship are ruled out. In the agreement the Russian part commits itself to continue payments of pensions to the retired militaries, as well as to compensate the health service provided for these people. The Government of Latvia admits that the agreements contain some concessions which would bear hard on Latvia. The government, however, maintains that stating the deadline for Russian troop withdrawal is the top priority which would open the door for a real pull-out of the army from the territory of Latvia as soon as possible.
