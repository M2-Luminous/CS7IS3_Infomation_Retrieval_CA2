Washington -- which pays about 30 percent of all peacekeeping costs -- has been condemned for refusing to authorise the extra 8,500 soldiers because of uncertainty of financial support from Congress. Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said: "The Americans have no troops on the ground in Bosnia. It is a great pity that they are not willing to pay other countries to do what they are unwilling to do themselves." The United States already owes more than 50 million pounds sterling for the Yugoslav operation, estimated at more than 600 million pounds sterling a year. It is being urged to approve a compromise text to renew the force for six months and authorise another 3,500 troops needed immediately. U.S. envoys startled Security Council members last night by announcing that Washington needed another 30 days before it could consider a resolution it had helped negotiate. More than half of the extra troops are already in Bosnia, including a 900-strong battalion group based on the Duke of Wellington's Regiment and 2,700 troops from Turkey. And diplomats reminded U.S. officials that the new troops were to enforce ceasefires around Sarajevo and in central Bosnia that the United States had helped negotiate. "There is a momentum which has to be kept," Council President Jean-Bernard Merimee said. "If it is impossible to deploy new troops, there would be a risk of ceasefires being broken and agreements being jeopardised." A British Government source said: "There is no question that the operation will not go ahead. The success of the peacekeeping operation has gone too far. There is no way it will be allowed to falter now." Meanwhile, reports that Britain had offered to place 4,000 troops on permanent standby for peacekeeping operations around the world were dismissed as "nonsense" by ministers. British officials met UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali earlier this week to explain the kind of military expertise the UK could make available in future operations. "This was merely to give a flavour of what might be available," said a Whitehall source. "We are not going to see blue berets on Salisbury Plain and there will be no troops on permanent standby." Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, supported by service chiefs, insists that troops will be selected to match the specific type of operation on a case-by-case basis rather than having earmarked peacekeeping forces.
