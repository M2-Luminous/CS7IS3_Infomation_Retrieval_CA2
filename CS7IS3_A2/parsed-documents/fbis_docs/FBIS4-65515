As a result, the PPI senators are expected to vote against the government which they accuse of showing no opening whatsoever to the opposition forces in parliament. It was also learned that life senator Giulio Andreotti, a veteran Christian Democrat, discussed various scenarios with the PPI senators in the event the government does not win the confidence vote in the Senate. In the document released by the party leadership this evening, the People's Party decried the government program put forth by Berlusconi as a mere list of promises with no indication as to how these generalized goals are to be achieved. The PPI was especially sharp about the fact that Berlusconi in no way settled the problem of the conflict between his role as premier and his ownership of a large part of the means of communication in this country.
