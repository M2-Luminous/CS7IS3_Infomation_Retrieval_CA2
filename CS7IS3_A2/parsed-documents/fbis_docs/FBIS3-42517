D. Noskov, Tomsk State University; UDC 524.7-77] [Abstract] According to radio astronomy data, many cosmic radiation sources have a spectrum in which F(_n_) is proportional to _n_[.sup]-_a_[/] in the frequency range of 10[.sup]6[/]-10[.sup]9[/] Hz, with F(_n_) representing the radiation intensity. The spectral value of the radiation, _a_, is usually 0.5-1. Its distribution is gaussian, with a mean value of 0.75 and a standard deviation of 0.15. Since that type of spectrum cannot be attributed to thermal radiation, the nonequilibrium cosmic radiation is generally described with a synchrotron model. Particle polarization and the spatial coincidence between the system of cosmic magnetic fields and the sources of the nonequilibrium radiation point to the verity of such an approach. In proposing a new mechanism for the origin of the power-law spectrum of the cosmic radio emissions, the researcher demonstrates that, under the right conditions, the power-law spectrum can be a consequence of the fractal geometry of the spatial distribution of radiating relativistic electrons. Fractal dimensionality D of the distribution is related to spectral value with the formula D = _a_ + 1/3. As obtained from an analysis of observed values of the spectral values, the distribution was found to be 1.08 +/-0.15 in the range of 10-10[.sup]5[/] cm. References 10: 6 Russian, 4 Western.
