Kukan, Slovakia's permanent representative to the UN up to date, said Slovak-Czech relations were good and that it was necessary to rule out beforehand any possible disputes. Slovak diplomacy will also continue to focus on the gradual integration into European structures, creation of good neighborly relations and contribution to the country's economic development, Kukan said. He said he would also see to the most effective possible functioning of the existing diplomatic representations abroad whose staffs are limited due to financial reasons. In this connection Kukan did not rule dismissals of some diplomats.
