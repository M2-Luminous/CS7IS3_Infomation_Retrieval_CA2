Like Christian Democrats; Unless League Wins, It Is Finished'; Maroni and Future of Pole of Freedoms" first two paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] [Text] Milan -- The official watchword is: victory for the pole of freedoms; we will govern with [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. Then there is the issue of what will happen to the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] and the Center Union, regarded as mere slaves, and the problem of the National Alliance, rejected by Umberto Bossi [Northern League Secretary] and Roberto Maroni [League lower house floor leader], but desired by Berlusconi, who sees Gianfranco Fini [Italian Social Movement (MSI) and National Alliance (AN) leader] as the antidote to the federalist toxins of the League. According to Bossi, if the pole does win, Maroni must be prime minister. Maroni himself commented: "This will be decided by the voters in the proportional quota, but note that the League believes that the vote in the north deserves some consideration." As far as Berlusconi is concerned, it is a simple matter: He will be prime minister. So, leaving aside official stances, it is no coincidence that some people within the League are hoping for a defeat for the pole for freedoms, which would hit Berlusconi hard (he has staked everything on the premiership) and boost the League as the country's only opposition force, confining the Democratic Alliance to a subordinate role. When Bossi said, "We will perform the role performed by the PCI [Italian Communist Party] and later the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] in previous parliaments," he was issuing a strong political indication of the League in opposition to a government composed of left-wing forces, but performing a role of stimulus and supervision. To do what the PCI or the PDS has done means, despite being in opposition, claiming the speakership of the lower house, the chairmanship of prestigious parliamentary committees -- in other words, establishing its status as the only real opposition force. [Passalacqua] Mr. Maroni, what will happen if the left-wing forces win? [Maroni] Achille Occhetto [PDS Secretary] will have an absolute majority, throw out [Communist Renewal leader] Fausto Bertinotti, bring in Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI] and Bindi [PPI Venice regional secretary], and we will be in opposition. [Passalacqua] What will Berlusconi do? [Maroni] He will not have the strength to resist; he cannot be in opposition; he is convinced that you can change things only if you are in power. He does not have our background; he does not have the background that Bossi has, having stayed in the Senate alone, undaunted. [Passalacqua] What will happen to the pole of freedoms? [Maroni] It will be destroyed, it will disintegrate. Each will go his own way. But the blueprint remains. [Passalacqua] What does that mean: that you will inherit Forza Italia? [Maroni] The pole must be granted credible prospects. If that does happen, we will have a parliament that will last at least two years. Then it will be necessary to form a liberal democratic party under the banners of federalism and liberalism. A party that will stand united and compact in the next elections. Call it what you like, but it will be a united party. [Passalacqua] Will it be called the Northern League? [Maroni] If you want a clever remark, it will be called the liberal democratic party, section of the Northern League. [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? [Maroni] The only path open to Berlusconi is to accede to government. But this is not the only path open to Bossi and, with him, Bertinotti and Fini: They are people who have engaged in opposition and who can do so again. [Passalacqua] Are you saying that unless Forza Italia scores an overwhelming victory it will not last long? [Maroni] Forza Italia is like the DC [Christian Democratic Party]: It can only exist if it can distribute power as it wants, if it can rationalize power. Not so, with us. [Passalacqua] Let us consider another hypothesis -- a victory by the pole of freedoms. What will happen to the National Alliance? Will it be in or out? [Maroni] Officially, it will be out. [Passalacqua] Please clarify that. [Maroni] It is a mess. Is there a possibility that the pole will win and gain an absolute majority without the National Alliance? In that case, the people will decide who will be prime minister. [Passalacqua] What if the National Alliance were to prove decisive to forming a majority? [Maroni] It will still be possible to govern, using the votes of the National Alliance's elected representatives that are not declared MSI members. A clear sign from Berlusconi on the subject of federalism will be enough. If the first item on the government's agenda is a constitutional reform to open the way to federalism, then we are willing to implement it even with Fini. [Passalacqua] What if, as it is likely, nobody gains an absolutely majority? [Maroni] The hypothesis is that there will be another election; a government will be formed for six months. The political program will be a new electoral law -- a plain single-candidate system and the direct election of the prime minister. [Passalacqua] This may be the hypothesis, but what do you think? [Maroni] I am working to ensure that the League accedes to government. [Passalacqua] What if you were able to choose? [Maroni] Again, not entirely seriously: My favorite scenario is that nobody will win, because it would be fun for me. But what I hope for is that the League, together with Forza Italia, will gain an absolute majority. [Passalacqua] If that happens, you will be put forward for the premiership... [Maroni] Do you want to know who will be in my team? If I were prime minister, which is not what I want, I would appoint Marco Formentini super-minister for the economy, Vito Gnutti industry minister, Francesco Tabladini environment minister, Forza Italia's Antonio Martino finance minister, and Gianfranco Pagliarini budget minister. What about foreign affairs? Marco Pannella. Defense? Franco Angioni. Justice? I would have to think about that, but Mino Martinazzoli is not to be discounted. Interior Affairs? For a year it would be delegated to the prime minister's office, during which time all the secret services would undergo a thorough cleansing.
