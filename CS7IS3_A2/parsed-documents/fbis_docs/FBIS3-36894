The Point of Departure and Our Hopes The first year of Prime Minister A. Slezevicius' government is drawing to a close. Undoubtedly, Lithuania's current social and economic situation depends largely on objective reasons. A deep crisis has enveloped all states of the former Soviet Union and countries in its zone of influence without exception. However, it is no less obvious that a country's situation also depends on the wisdom, competence, and subordination of government institutions, on the so-called subjects of the management system. The vital hopes of Lithuanian inhabitants which they pinned on the new government (formed by the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party, which won the elections) were substantiated. First of all, people expected that the declines in industry and agriculture, which came to light after the declaration of independence and the introduction of hasty and ill-considered reform, would be prevented. They also hoped that the government would manage to halt the drop in living standards. Lithuanian inhabitants placed particularly large hopes on more effective fights against crime, corruption, and shadow structures plaguing the country. We would be biased if we overlooked the positive efforts of the current government to direct Lithuania's economic and social development toward a positive outcome, and, first of all -- the introduction of the litas, the restraint of inflation, the vitalization of political and economic relations with foreign countries, and so on. However, have the expectations of Lithuanian residents been justified, if only partially, over this past year? We are also raising this question because the political opposition is always ready to transform the accumulated social tensions and mistrust into ultimatums demanding early Seimas [parliament] elections, which, we are convinced, would only aggravate our country's social situation even more. That is why, in the name of Lithuania's future and its citizens' concord, it is important to assess the work accomplished by the government and its subordinate structures and the country's current economic and social situation objectively, without any embellishments or cover-ups. This must be done not to pass judgment on the government's activities but to search collectively for more effective resolutions to the current situation on the basis of the conducted analysis. II. The Fall Syndrome Beginning its work, the government understood the difficult condition of Lithuania's economy and the people's low living standards. [passage omitted] The new government managed to halt the decline in people's living standards. According to the Statistics Department, the average monthly increase of prices and tariffs for consumer goods in 1993 was 9.2 percent, while that of the average monthly wage was 10.7 percent. Real wages, which dropped by 69 percent in 1992 against those in 1990, were already stabilized in early 1993 and began to grow slightly thereafter. The average wage in November was approximately $64, that is, it rose by $36 in comparison with February. One must also state, however, that the living standards of the majority of Lithuanian people remain unjustifiably low, and that positive changes fail to eclipse the generally depressing picture. The comparative analysis allows us to draw the conclusion that the larger half of the employed population in Lithuania received lower wages than the real subsistence minimum (170 litai). We hardly have any reason to state that a positive breakthrough has occurred in the so-called policy of culture (incidentally, in the organization of education, science, and health care). The criminal situation has not yet been stabilized, and the number of unsolved crimes has not been reduced. [passage omitted] In our opinion, the key reason for the current social situation and its possible deterioration in the future is the continuing dangerous decline in Lithuania's industrial and agricultural production. For example, in 1993, sales of industrial production plunged by 46 percent, those of cattle, poultry, and milk -- by 30 and 12 percent, respectively. The volume of construction and retail turnover skidded by 40 and 37 percent. Thus, there is a basis for stating that the decline in industrial and agricultural production is continuing and even gaining momentum, and that the so-called "bottom of the pit" has not yet been reached. This fact is also dangerous in terms of hiding in itself and bringing ever closer an outburst of the most painful effect -- mass unemployment. In 1993 alone, hidden unemployment in industry effected about 335,000 people. [passage omitted] III. Looking for Ways Out One of the key reasons for the crisis we are experiencing is that the laws of a command economy ceased to operate in Lithuania, while those of a market economy have not yet begun to function. This is a peculiar "death zone" from which one can get out only by applying special tough measures of state regulation. The liberalization of prices under conditions of macroeconomic instability and a high level of monopolistic capital have highlighted the position of the monopolistic capital that overshadows the emerging shoots of an open market. The power of the Energy Ministry, whose price policy is leading producers to bankruptcy, or the monopolistic dictate of food processing enterprises to farmers could serve as examples. Meanwhile, the essence of state regulation or antitrust measures is that a flexible financial and credit policy should create equal conditions for competition among different economic units. Positive moves in improving people's social situation are largely associated with the introduction of the litas and a tough monetary policy. However, there are also some shadow elements in this sphere of economic policy. It need not be reiterated what negative effect the artificially high litas exchange rate exerts on Lithuania's industry. The current credit system may have the most negative effect on producers. Actually all enterprises are indebted and driven to bankruptcy by force by remarkably high credit interest rates, and they are choking in the financial policy loop. Given the fact that a large part of the current budget revenues (more than one-third) comes from industrial enterprises, we can understand what is in store for Lithuania if the activities of banks destroy the financial matters of industrialists. We do not mention the loop of financial settlements on Lithuania's agriculture which is no less painful. At the same time, we are convinced that there are certain reserves for a more rational utilization of the organizational possibilities of the monetary and fiscal policy. First of all, this applies to the necessity of implementing radical and well-considered reform of the financial and credit system. The analysis of various draft laws regulating the financial process, which are either in preparation or under review, shows that they are drafted without a unified approach or system. [passage omitted] One must admit with regret that thus far we have only talked about reform in the tax system. Our analysis of the delayed draft law "On the Principles of Taxes" has revealed that it was created without a well-considered concept. The absence of the latter is also responsible for the ambitious debates on the declaration of incomes. One could add that tax laws are drafted without coordinating them with the law on banks, tariffs, and so on. One must also admit that the current government has appeared incapable of properly controlling the collection of taxes, by leaving a large share of the state budget to shadow structures, the so-called uncontrolled free trade, and corrupt and impudent officials. Undoubtedly, the privatization of industry and agriculture could also be ascribed to the unexhausted reserves for improving Lithuania's economic and social situation. The fact that former governments arranged the privatization of state assets as a campaign of property distribution is a well-known fact. There have been several public statements that the privatization of state property for investment coupons is economically ineffective. Despite the carelessness and obvious mistakes in privatizing the state property, no program for the upgrading of reform was drafted, the experience of this process was not analyzed and assessed critically, and the remaining unprivatized assets were not inventoried. [passage omitted] Other unutilized possibilities should also be mentioned. Little was accomplished in developing small and medium-sized businesses. The faults of the monetary and fiscal policy prevented the influx of foreign investments. The problem of settlements among economic entities both inside the country and with partners in the CIS was not resolved. Foreign policy related to the national economy was conducted rather ineffectively. The free trade agreements among the Baltic states and with Belarus and Russia were not properly applied. The drafting of the concept of economic restructuring was protracted, to say nothing of its implementation. It is actually impossible to conduct a flexible customs policy without a clear concept of restructuring. Everyone understands the important role played by the competence of government officials, and an honest understanding and performance of duties in the state's life and the functioning of its structures. The world knows a number of examples when these traits decided the defeat of a serious crisis. Is everything being done to achieve the impeccable level of such traits and duties, even under the current cultural conditions? Are plans for the training of government officials responsible enough? There are serious grounds to doubt a positive response. IV. The State's "Achilles' Heel" It is necessary to deal with agrarian reform separately. In its April 1993 statement, the current government noted aptly that agrarian reform was most often conducted by administrative methods through imperfect laws, that it was much too politicized, that the ill-considered restoration of land was going on under the cover of reform, and that former economic structures were heedlessly destroyed. Therefore, unpromising small farms measuring from 7 to 8 hectares began to emerge. What can be their future and role in Lithuania's economy? Being aware of the advantages of large and technologically well-equipped farms, nevertheless, the government lacked determination in correcting the forerunners' mistakes. The actual reason for unsuccessful agrarian reform begun by the former Supreme Council was its goals which were incorrect in principle. The restoration of land was turned into an end in itself. Unfortunately, even after the current government upgraded land reform and the law on property restoration, the restitution of land has remained the same goal in itself. Attempts to introduce conditions for land ownership proved futile. The trouble is that the privatization of land was not included in agrarian reform as its integral part. Thus far, agrarian reform has not been directed at creating an economically more effective and competitive agricultural system. [passage omitted] It should be stressed that the ill-considered and erroneously implemented Lithuanian agrarian reform not only ruins production but also sets people against each other. Even farmers are more opposed to the government today than landless peasants. Instances of social discord, as the effects of unwise economic and social decisions, are becoming more frequent in Lithuania's rural areas. Such conditions cannot be ignored because they are one of the key sources of general social tension and political opposition, as well as of disappointment and apathy in Lithuania. By mobilizing all intellectual potential, it is necessary to return to the basic laws on agrarian reform. A seriously ailing countryside also poses a threat to Lithuania's nation and statehood. V. Lithuania, Were Are You Going? We repeat once again: There is no reason to believe that the one-year activities of A. Slezevicius' government alone are responsible for the current situation. We should hardly doubt the fact that his government sincerely tried to fulfill its duty. It is unlikely that a coalition government could improve the situation if the former legacy with its structural, functional, and mental basis remained. There are serious grounds to state that thus far ministries and other offices have not become centers of the state's intellectual and organizational activities that could exert essential and qualitatively new influence on the strengthening of statehood. [passage omitted] We claim that reform in the bureaucratic government system inherited from the past has become protracted, and that the entire state system of economic management remains seriously sick, with new symptoms of the disease emerging. In general, thus far, there has not been any more definite vision of the lines along which the Lithuanian nation should develop its statehood. What are the social goals of the restored state? Will the "free market" continue to expand, and will the so-called libertarianism (civilized anarchy) take root? Will Lithuania orient itself consistently toward the model of a state of social accord, welfare, and citizens' democracy? Will it always glance at other states and copy their manners, stereotypes, and norms, or will it, nevertheless, show more determination in looking for the forms of self-awareness (self-organization) that are more suitable to our identity and national character, and that would strengthen not only the chances for the survival of the Lithuanian nation, but also for its more extensive contribution to world culture?
