The sources quoted Robert Lis, director of the PBEC International Affairs Division, as saying earlier this week that four PBEC member nations -- Taiwan, the United States, South Korea and Australia -- will be required to change their designation in the private regional economic cooperation organization. "We have asked the four to change their names in the PBEC in accordance with their designation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum," Lis noted. The move is expected to facilitate the PBEC's bid to join APEC as an observer to increase its influence in regional economic affairs, Lis explained. Taiwan became a full member of the Hawaii-based organization under the name of "Chinese Member Committee of PBEC in Taipei" in 1983. Lis confirmed that the PBEC has decided to admit Mainland China, Russia and Colombia as its new members during its 1994 annual meeting scheduled to open Saturday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Mainland China will be called "China Member Committee of the PBEC," Lis reported. Jeffrey Koo, president of the Taipei PBEC Committee, said Taiwan has not opposed Beijing's admission to the PBEC. "We only regret that Beijing once tried to force PBEC authorities to ask us to change our designation in the organization," Koo noted. After long consultations, the PBEC finally decided to ask Taiwan and the above-mentioned three other countries to simultaneously change their designation in accordance with their names in APEC, a 17-member governmental-level forum founded in 1989 to promote economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Koo, heading a delegation of business executives and economists, left for Kuala Lumpur Friday to attend the May 21-25 PBEC annual meeting. The PBEC was founded in 1968 by a group of business leaders from the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. It provides a forum for bankers and business executives in Pacific basin countries to exchange views and forge cooperative ties. It had 22 members at the end of 1993.
