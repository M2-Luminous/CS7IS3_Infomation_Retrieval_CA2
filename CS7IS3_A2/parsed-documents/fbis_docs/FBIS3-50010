He arrived on Sunday [16 January] for a visit to Italy, at the invitation of the general secretary of the ministerial body supervising Italian secret services. "Secret services in today's civilized societies assist in the battle against crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and the mafia," Fuzessy said. "Although Central and Eastern European countries freed from the former Soviet bloc are a promising ground for all criminal rings in East and West, there is no immediate danger at present," he said. Fuzessy's discussions in Italy also concerned supervision experience, governmental and parliamentary practices of licensing the use of secret service means, and controlling it through the central budget.
