According to the Bosnian Serbs' military sources, the Moslem attacks on Kupres continued for the sixth day. The same statement said the Bosnian Serb forces were forced to return fire and repel the attack as well as re-gained some 80 percent of the territories the Moslems seized several days ago. The fighting in the Kupres war zone was another step in the preparations for a major Moslem offensive planned for spring this year. The attack on the Serb positions, 15 kilometers east of the town of Kupres, was somewhat of a surprise as the Moslem forces were not expected to show a stronger interest in this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina at this stage of the war. The third warring party -- the Croatians, who traditionally deem the area of the Kupres plain their "own" zone of interest, were expected to take a much keener interest in this part of the R.S. However, the Moslems too, seem to have become increasingly aware that the Kupres pass was of strategic significance as it opened the way via Bugojno, Gornji Vakuf, Travnik to the Sava River, in which way the Serb territories in the former Yugoslav republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia were being divided in two, thereby bringing the Serbian people into a position of dependence in the future peace talks. Also, the Kupres plain was in the former Yugoslavia one of the most favorable areas to execute airdrops, something which at this time did not imply much but could be decisive in case of an outside intervention. The recent attack only on the Serb positions near Kupres seems to be at this time more of a tactical than broader significance. This would primarily entail taking possession of positions to deploy heavy artillery which would have played a significant role supporting attacks on Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf). Thus, the assessment that one of the attacks by the Moslem forces, planned as part of the spring offensive, would be directed towards Srbobran and Jajce to form a springboard for further "unification" of the territory of the "independent, integral and sovereign Bosnia-Herzegovina" was borne out. It was indicative that the attack in the Kupres war zone occurred at the time of signing of the Moslem-Croatian federation pact on Bosnia and its subsequent confederation with Croatia. By way of an agreement with the Croats, Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic won the needed political accord to try a breakthrough towards those areas which have thus far not been given him in the territorial division of interests. Also, a significant part of the Moslem forces engaged so far in fighting with the Croatian forces was now free to fight the army of the Bosnian Serb Republic.
