The threat came in a leaflet claiming responsibility for last week's murder of Israeli soldier Shahar Simhoni. The leaflet carries a photocopy of Simhoni's ID card. Meanwhile, arrests are continuing in the Janin area, of Hamas members connected to the Hadera bombing. More on these developments from reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: The Hamas leaflet distributed in the Gaza Strip says that members of 'Izz-al-Dan al-Qassam's Squad No. 6 kidnapped and killed soldier Shahar Simhoni last week. According to the leaflet, which reproduced the soldier's ID card and driver's license, the terrorists passed themselves off as Jews, grabbed Simhoni, who was on his way to his girlfriend from his Army base, and after a short struggle, killed him. [passage omitted] The leaflet is addressed to Prime Minister Rabin and demands that he immediately release all Hamas prisoners, especially the Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin and Hamas members captured in recent weeks. If not, the leaflet warns, the killing or kidnapping of Israelis will continue. The threats are coming against the backdrop of a major crack down on Hamas by security forces. [passage omitted]
