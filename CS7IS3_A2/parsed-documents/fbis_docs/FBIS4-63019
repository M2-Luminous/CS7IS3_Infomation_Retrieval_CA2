Foodstuffs were up 1.9 percent, nonfood goods 1.2 percent and paid services to the population were up 1.9 percent. Prices for goods and services grew most noticeably in the cities of Eastern Siberia, which recorded Russia's biggest rise in the price of foodstuffs and paid services to the population. The smallest change in consumer prices last week -- less than 1 percent -- was recorded in the Northern Region. Prices in the unofficial trading system continued to rise faster than in the official trading system. Price increases in Moscow for the main foodstuffs, nonfood goods, and services corresponded to the average Russian level; they were higher in St. Petersburg -- at 2.9 percent. Spring is to blame -- specifically, the month of May. The seasonal increase in the cost of fruit and vegetables (by 11.9 and 5.2 percent respectively) affected prices as a whole. Moreover, prices for meat products and salt were up more than 2 percent over the week, while the price of dairy products, butter, vegetable oil, sugar, and flour increased by less than 1 percent. The only things unaffected by the spring are chickens and alcohol producers -- egg and vodka prices were unchanged. The average cost of the basket of a month's worth of the 19 most important foodstuffs on 10 May was 49,700 rubles [R] -- up 2.4 percent on the week and 4.4 percent since the start of the month. The variation between the maximum and minimum cost of the basket in different Russian cities remained at last week's level -- 270 percent. The most "expensive" area is still the Far East Economic Region -- the basket there cost R83,100 for the whole month. After a week's break, the "cheapest" area is once again the Central Chernozem Region -- R38,900. Price growth for nonfood goods during this period has been minimal this year -- 1.2 percent. Notable increases continued to be recorded by matches (up 4 percent), wallpaper (up 3.8 percent), and medicine (up 3 percent, including a 10-percent rise for nitroglycerin). The cities of the Far East Region -- Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Nakhodka, Yakutsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and Magadan -- are constantly on the list of the 10 cities with the highest price levels for certain types of nonfood goods. Thus, last week Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy was in the top 10 most "expensive" cities for half of the 40 industrial goods surveyed, as was Nakhodka for 17, Yakutsk and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk for 14, and Magadan for 7.
