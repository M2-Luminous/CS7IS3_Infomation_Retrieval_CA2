The two pime ministers talked primarily about the European integration process, the development and vision of a more united Europe, and about future Czech membership in the European Union. Dehaene told journalists afterwards that the meeting had been productive, and said he shared Klaus' "vision" of Europe. Klaus said the two of them agreed that a country like the Czech Republic must increase its ties to NATO, the EU and other international organisations. "We have to find something between association and full membership in the European Union," he said, adding that Dehaene had accepted his invitation to visit the Czech Republic in the near future. Afterward Klaus met with European Commission President Jacques Delors. Commissioner for Foreign Relations Hans van den Broek was unable to attend the meeting as had been expected, since he was out of town in connection with talks on Norway's admission to the EU.
