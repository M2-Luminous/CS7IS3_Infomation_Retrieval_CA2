FR940920-1-00041 FR940920-1-00007 The overall incremental national average cost per unit of waste combusted of $13.50/Mg (presented in section III.B.4 of this preamble) breaks down as follows: $11 for acid gas/PM and metals control; $0.40 for Hg control; $1.80 for NO X control; and $0.35 for testing, reporting, and recordkeeping. The $1.80 cost for NO X control is for large MWC plants only, because no small plants will incur NO X control costs. The standard will have a wide range of impacts on the price of combustion services. To study these potential impacts, the EPA first applied a cost accounting procedure that approximates the one that would be used by an individual publicly owned MWC. Then, using a 1993 average tipping fee of $57/Mg of MSW combusted (1990 dollars) and assuming the full cost of meeting acid gas, PM, Hg, and NO X requirements is passed directly to MWC customers, the EPA found that the lowest and highest tipping fee increases for the model plants used in the EPA's economic analysis would be about $11/Mg and $85/Mg, respectively. The majority of tipping fee increases would be in the $13/Mg to $18/Mg range. This increase would be equivalent to about $1.00/month to $1.50/month for a typical household. The EPA projects that, regardless of how the regulatory costs are financed, most of the burden will find its way directly or indirectly to households served by MWC's. Costs that are directly assessed to households are likely to be in the form of increased collection fees and/or increased taxes. Indirect household costs are price increases charged by businesses that similarly are faced with increases in collection fees and/or taxes. For the 1991 NSPS and the standards being proposed today, the EPA projects an increase in the average annual household cost of waste disposal of about $21 for communities that construct new MWC's. The actual cost per household will depend on local conditions, including the extent to which recycling and landfilling are also used within the affected community. Approximately 54 percent of the total average household cost is a direct cost, thus the annual direct household cost would be a little over $11. The EPA estimates that the average annual household cost breaks down to $17 per year for communities over 250,000 in population, $23 for communities with populations between 100,000 and 250,000, $29 for communities with populations between 50,000 and 100,000, and $27 for communities with populations under 50,000. This range represents 0.04 to 0.09 percent of household income. The EPA expects that comparatively few communities under 100,000 will be affected by the standards, because such communities tend to rely on landfilling. The adoption of new regulations increases costs for a community and at some point has the potential to affect abilities to issue bonds. To address this issue, the EPA used demographic and financial data to project potential difficulty that might confront communities planning to construct new MWC's with bond financing. Applying generally accepted criteria for issuance of revenue and general obligation bonds, the EPA found that no community, large or small, should experience difficulty with bond financing as a result of the proposed standards. To address the issue of cost increases, the EPA identified five private firms that plan to construct one or more MWC's that will be subject to the standards. Of the five, four are small (i.e., have less than $6 million in annual sales). (Firms for which annual sales data are not available are assumed to be small.) Financial data are available for only one firm, which is a large firm. Total annual costs of the 1991 and proposed NSPS as a percentage of sales is less than 1 percent for that firm. Potential tipping fee increases, based on the full pass-through of emission control costs (i.e., passing all control costs to consumers via the tipping fee) and an average tipping fee of $57/Mg (1990 dollars), will average about 28 percent for MWC's owned by small firms, and about 17 percent for MWC's owned by large firms.
