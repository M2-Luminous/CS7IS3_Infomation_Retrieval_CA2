In a fatal way, the cause of the suicide resembles the failure of the United Nations and the superpowers in Bosnia. In October 1935, Mussolini's Italy invaded Abyssinia and a few days later the League of Nations put its spluttering machinery of sanctions into operation. Oil in particular was not on the list; Nazi Germany supplied large amounts of war materiel; under cover of official indignation, England and France virtually gave the Italians a free hand because they hoped to win Rome for an anti-Hitler alliance. In May 1936, after a cruel war, Abyssinia no longer existed and the League of Nations was in a coma from which it was never to wake up. Since April 1994, its successor, the United Nations, has gone off the rails in the same way and is heading straight for disaster. Gone are the days of the post-postwar era (approximately 1990-94), the times of high hopes and good intentions, where world powers, more or less in harmony, aimed at a world order where the violation of peace and genocide had to be prevented. This worked in the case of Saddam Husayn, but not in Somalia and Haiti, and even less in Sudan, the CNN-less and thus forgotten war. So far, at least good intentions, accompanied by endless diplomatic interferences, the employment of latent military power in the form of 14,000 blue helmets, and even the half-hearted use of real force in the form of a handful of bombs, have been valid in Bosnia. And now that the Serbs have softened up Gorazde and can take it anytime? In view of the "catastrophe" (UN General Rose), it is not only the humanitarian impulse that fails, but also mere vanity, which normally plays the stronger part in the lives of people and nations. After all, the Serbs staged the greatest of all provocations in Gorazde. With their hypocritical cease-fire promises, they fooled UN chief civilian officer Akashi twice. They took blue helmets hostage and attacked the Britons on land and in the air. They brought a UN protection zone under area fire -- which not even Saddam dared to do in northern Iraq. And finally they even duped the Russians, that is, their halfwilling protecting power, who are risking their relations with the West for the benefit of a wild rabble of soldiers and their masterminds in Belgrade. Let us hear what excessively smooth mediator Vitaliy Churkin meanwhile has to say about the Serbian friends: "It is high time for Russia to break off the talks with the Bosnian Serbs. Moscow has to decide whether it may permit a group of extremists to rope in Great Russia for its objectives. Our answer is clear: Never." And what about Bill Clinton, the successor of Jimmy Carter in the art of "zigzags and flipflops?" Sometimes bombs are dropped, sometimes talks are held. Now Defense Secretary Perry holds forth: "We will not enter into the war to prevent that (the fall of Gorazde)," then Clinton's security adviser Lake threatens: One has to make it clear to the Serbs "that the costs of continued stubbornness are high." However, the costs -- the Serbs have meanwhile learned this as did formerly the Italian fascists -- are not high at all. The reasons for it can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The United States is still trying to digest the disgraceful withdrawal from Somalia and to avoid a confrontation with the Russians. Hard national interests are neither at stake for Washington nor for London or Paris, and the Germans do not participate anyway in actions where politics requires the addition of bullets. Solid interests -- do they really exist? They also did not seem to be at work in Abyssinia's case, but afterward it was shown that the Italian machine guns had mowed down more than only Abyssinian warriors with bows and arrows. The belief in the international institutions' power to maintain order was broken; all those who hoped to implement their objectives with sheer force were spurred on. The fact that Serbian imperialism is meanwhile raging within the European civilization makes the matter even worse. The last chance has not yet been missed. Bill Clinton, former governor of Arkansas, can still live up to his responsibility as a great power, Washington and Moscow can still combine their joint interests against the Serbs, who present both of them as paper tigers. Well-measured, but decided force can still play an important part in the Balkan war -- not as a peacemaker per se, but as a handyman of diplomacy. For: Always when the Serbs felt the firm hand of the big ones, they yielded.... And if not, what then? Then the United Nations can relapse again into its old role of a debating society, then NATO can limit itself to cleaning guns, and then the United States can prepare itself for the long farewell to power in Europe. Those who fail against a third-rate power like Serbia will neither show the courage nor the wisdom to face a more powerful challenger.
