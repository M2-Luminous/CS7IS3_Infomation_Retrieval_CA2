He has also played the role of spokesman for the North Korean mission because of his outstanding English. [Chong Yon-chu] An agreement has finally been reached through the talks. How do you feel after the settlement? [Ho Chong] We now can expect a third round of high-level talks and a package-deal settlement of not only the nuclear issue but also general issues between the DPRK and the United States in the third round of talks. In light of this, it is very fortunate that, although belatedly, the United States withdrew unfair [pudanghan] preconditions and an agreement was successfully reached. Now each of us has to exert maximum efforts so that peace on the Korean peninsula can be achieved through the package-deal resolution of the abnormal DPRK-U.S. relations. [Chong] Why did the talks last longer than expected? [Ho] Because the United States insisted on unfair preconditions. [Chong] What were the preconditions? [Ho] I cannot tell you concretely. The preconditions were unacceptable to us. [Chong] Could you tell me about the contents of the agreement? [Ho] The basic contents are as follows: "The DPRK and the United States, according to the principles of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement announced on 11 June 1993, have had several meetings in New York with the aim of exerting joint efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. Based on the negotiations, the DPRK and the United States agreed to take the following four measures on 1 March 1994. First, South Korea and the United States announce the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. Second, inspections for the assurance of the continuity of nuclear safeguards, which was agreed on 15 February between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency, begin on 1 March. Third, a working-level contact for the North-South exchange of special envoys will resume in Panmunjom. Fourth, the DPRK and the United States will hold the third round high-level talks on 21 March 1994 in Geneva." [Chong] According to the agreement, a working-level contact for the North-South exchange of special envoys will resume in Panmunjom on 1 March. [Ho] If the South requests a working-level contact, it will be held immediately on 1 March. [Chong] There were reports that you would be summoned home. [Ho] I read from South Korean newspapers that I would soon leave. As a public official, I would leave if the government asks so. But I have not received such news. [Chong] Will you be at the Geneva talks as well? [Ho] We have to wait and see.
