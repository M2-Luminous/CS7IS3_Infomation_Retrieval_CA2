Meanwhile, EU policy-making bodies are working on a plan to keep such a union operating efficiently after accepting new members. Foreign ministers of the existing 12 EU nations gathered in brussels on Tuesday to discuss for the first time technical details on how to restructure the enlarged union. However, following major disagreements over a voting mechanism, the meeting closed without reaching any conclusions on Wednesday morning. While negotiations between the EU and Norway about its entry are undergoing some difficulties, it is believed in Brussels that an agreement could eventually be reached. Further talks were held from Sunday through to Tuesday between the EU and Norway but, once again, they broke down with the two sides agreeing to reopen them on March 15. The rights of fishing have been a thorny issue in the enlargement talks between Norway and the EU. Norway says it can not make any more concessions to meet demands that EU fishing fleets from Spain and Portugal be granted more fishing rights in Norway's North Sea waters. But spain, which has the EU's largest fishing fleet, insists that it must be able to fish more in Norwegian waters and threatens to block Norway's membership bid if more fishing rights are not given. Observers here believe that even if Norway refuses to comply with the concessions demanded by the EU, the enlargement program, which involves admitting Sweden, Finland and Austria, will not be effected. However, they do stress that if the eu's reform of its internal structure, especially the vital voting mechanism, is not completed smoothly, all efforts to progress an enlarged union will have been wasted. When the European Community (EC), the EU's predecessor, began talks to lay a foundation for enlargement by admitting Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway in February 1992, it made it clear that the plan was to energize the grouping instead of weakening it or restricting the limits of its authority. The European parliament has also made it clear that if the enlargement has a negative effect on the operation of the community, it will not approve the admission of new members. When it was founded in 1957, the EC only had six member nations. But over the past 30 years, the number has doubled. However, it's policies have remained basically unchanged. If everything goes to plan, by January 1995 the number of members will have jumped to 16. This, though, means that its original practices and principles will no longer be suitable and institutional reform will become a major priority affecting its ability to accept new members. The council of foreign ministers is the EC's highest policy- making body and enjoys legislative power. It consists of 12 ministers respectively from the 12 member nations. However, each minister's voting rights differ, depending on each country's population. The number of votes allocated to each minister can vary from 2 to 10. At present, the council's tally of votes is 70: Germany, Italy, Britain and France each with 10; Spain 8; The Netherlands, Greece, Belgium and Portugal each with 5 votes; and Luxembourg 2. According to reports, if the 12 nations fail to conclude an agreement on a voting mechanism or "iron out" their other difficulties for an enlarged union in the next two weeks, it will be impossible for the European parliament to give its approval for whatever has been decided before June 1, thus delaying the process even further.
