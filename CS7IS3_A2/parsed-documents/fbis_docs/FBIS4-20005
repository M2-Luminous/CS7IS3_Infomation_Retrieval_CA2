[La Malfa] It is very simple: We are in the opposition. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] However, the Segni Pact, which includes yourself along with Zanone and Amato, has the Michelini and Tremonti lines, which maintain the need for cooperation. [La Malfa] During the election campaign, we maintained that the two groupings on the Right and Left are full of contradictions because of the contrasts between the various components of the two poles. However, the Right won the elections, and therefore the government, even though I am convinced that they will not manage to govern. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] So, there will be collaboration with the Berlusconi government? [La Malfa] Neither Segni, nor Amato, nor myself have any intention of changing our minds. We are neither on the Right nor on the Left. We are waiting and watching. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] However, being at the center, with the notorious Mattarella law [on election reform], there is the risk of disappearing. [La Malfa] I understand someone being concerned about the lack of government posts and wanting to go with the majority. We have to wait for public opinion -- which voted for the Right -- to change its mind. If the Right shows that it knows how to govern, there is always time to change one's mind. If, on the other hand, it does not manage to do so successfully, as we feel will be the case, public opinion will grow weary and will turn back toward the center, which is governed by us. [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] You wish. Do Segni, Amato, and Zanone share this view? [La Malfa] It looks to me like they are thinking along the same lines, and that it could end up that none collaborate with any forces of the Right. We cannot work together with a government that includes fascists in its ranks, a Berlusconi with the open problem of the monopoly on private TV, and a League that has yet to make it clear what sort of federalism it wants to impose on the country. Therefore, in the confidence vote, as things stand, we will have to vote against. Our dream is to found a liberal democratic party capable of bringing together all the nondenominationalist, socialist and Catholic forces to the right of the Democratic Party of the Left [PDS] and to the left of the ground currently held by the government. [IL CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Do Segni and Amato agree? [La Malfa] Amato is very close to our way of thinking, while Segni shares my position although he is more pessimistic about the future evolution of the PDS.
