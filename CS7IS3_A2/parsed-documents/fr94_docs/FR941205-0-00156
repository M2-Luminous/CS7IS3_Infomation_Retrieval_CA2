FR941205-0-00156 FR941205-0-00029 Since the functions proposed for delegation are integral to the insurance process, the Department has determined that the delegation would be legally sustainable if HUD retains the authority to make adjustments to the insured mortgage amount during the period up to and including the time of final endorsement, which it has done in ยง266.417 of the rule. HUD's reservation of final authority to adjust the insured mortgage amount is not meant to suggest that HUD will, as a matter of policy, routinely review all decisions of HFAs about the insurance of advances and cost certification processes. For example, the Commissioner could review the insurance of advances and cost certification processes on a random basis and, up to and including the time of final endorsement, correct errors by adjusting the amount of mortgage insurance. Examples of such reviews of the insurance of advances process could involve a HUD evaluation of an HFA's approval of advances to determine whether such approval is consistent with construction progress. The Department could assess whether other mortgageable items were supported with proper bills and/or receipts before funds were approved. The Department also could consider whether the loan remains in balance by comparison of actual disbursements against a project completion schedule and other loan closing documents. Unless additional requirements are imposed by HUD because it insures more than 50 percent of the risk, the review at cost certification would only involve an assessment that the maximum insurable mortgage amount is supported by costs incurred and approved for the project by the HFA. By this reservation of authority to adjust the mortgage amount, HUD also is reducing any adverse effect from fees, which are linked to mortgage amount, that the HFAs may earn in connection with the project loan. Notwithstanding the retention by HUD of ultimate authority to adjust the insured mortgage amount, the HFAs still would be carrying out an important function in connection with the insurance of advances and cost certification processes. The delegation of this function is consistent with Congress' view in section 542(a) of the 1992 Act that the relationship between HUD and HFAs is to be a partnership and that major functions are to be the responsibilities of the HFAs as evidenced by the direct assignment of underwriting functions in section 542(c)(2)(E). The regulation will be contained in a new part 266 in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which consists of six subparts. A brief summary of each subpart follows. Subpart A_General Provisions Subpart A sets forth the purpose and scope of the regulation. It cites the legislative background, and indicates HUD's policy decision to vest broad responsibility for the conduct of the program in participating HFAs. Subpart A also includes definitions of terms used throughout the regulation. Section 266.10, Allocations of Authority and Credit Subsidy, states that HUD will issue notices in the Federal Register inviting State and local HFAs to apply for participation in the program. Earlier provisions contained in the interim rule relating to planned HUD allocations and state-wide caps on the amount of assistance are deleted in this final rule. Those topics instead will be covered in the Federal Register Notice. Section 266.15 describes key components that must be included in the risk-sharing agreement executed between HUD and the HFA. Among other things, the risk-sharing agreement will reflect the agreed upon risk apportionment; the number of units allocated to the HFA; description ( i.e., incorporation by reference) of the HFA's standards and procedures for underwriting and servicing of loans; and a list of required HFA certifications designed to assure its proper performance under the program. (The list of certifications is not comprehensive and is subject to change as circumstances and experience dictate.) Appraisals of all properties must be performed by Certified General Appraisers, licensed in the State in which the property is located, and must be completed in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. In addition, 24 CFR part 267 (see final rule published October 3, 1994 at 59 FR 50456), establishes a reporting requirement for the gender and minority classification for appraisers. Compliance with this reporting requirement will be included in the risk sharing agreement. Subpart A contains sections indicating that future regulatory amendments will not impair previously recognized contract rights and that HUD has no obligation to recognize or deal with parties other than the HFA, in the latter's role as mortgagee of record under a contract of mortgage insurance. Section 266.30 provides that the provisions of 24 CFR part 246 (Local Rent Control) do not apply to this program. The Department will not be utilizing its constitutional authority to preempt local rent control laws for projects with mortgages insured under part 266. Representatives of HFAs have advised the Department that many HFAs, both State and local, already have such authority and, therefore, the absence of access to the Federal preemption authority would in no way restrict or interfere with the manner in which HFAs currently operate. Since the program involves risk to both HFAs and the Federal government, the Federal interest will be adequately protected by HFAs who use their preemption authority to protect their own interests. The interim rule also contains a general waiver provision in ยง266.35. Under that section, the Commissioner may, upon a finding of good cause, waive any provision in part 266 that is not a statutory requirement, except that the Commissioner will not consider waivers of financial requirements for participating HFAs or underwriting standards required by HUD for Level II participants. All waivers granted under ยง266.35 will be in writing and will be published in the Federal Register , as required by section 7(q) of the Department of Housing and Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)). Subpart B_Agency Requirements Subpart B describes the criteria HFAs must meet to qualify under the program. It became evident during HUD's review of the applications for participation in the pilot program that there was some confusion as to the interpretation of the term in section 544(2)(B) which defines a qualified housing agency as one that ``receives a rating of `A' for its general obligation bonds.'' Some agencies interpreted this to mean that an ``A'' rating on bonds financing a particular project met the definition. This interpretation would be inconsistent with sections 544(2)(A) and (2)(C), which require evidence of a strong financial capacity on the part of the agency. Such a construction would permit an HFA with one strong bond issue and several other issuances with ratings below ``A'' to claim that they met the qualified agency criteria. The Department does not construe this to be in accordance with the intent of Congress. In this final rule, HUD interprets the phrase ``general obligation bonds'' to mean the rating on bonds issued by the HFA based on the strength of the general obligation of the agency itself. Like the ``top-tier'' rating, a rating of ``A'' on general obligation bonds is provided by nationally recognized rating agencies only after thorough review and analysis of an agency's financial, administrative and operational capacity. This rating based on the strength of an agency's general obligation pertains to issuance of bonds and other debt instruments that are backed by income/resources from unencumbered fund balances rather than by cash flow from a particular project or projects. Two levels of approval_Level I and Level II_are described in ยง266.100. The primary distinction between the two levels is in the level of risk apportionment an HFA agrees to undertake. HFAs participating at Level I are those that will assume 50 percent or more of the risk associated with a loan default. Level II participants will assume 10 or 25 percent of the risk. The regulation requires any applicant HFA (whether it selects either Level I or Level II, or both Level I and Level II approval) to meet eligibility standards and application requirements. Eligibility is predicated on an HFA's demonstrable high financial capacity and/or experience and capability in the field of multifamily housing. Application requirements are designed to elicit the HFA's (legal and other) capacity to function in the program.
