Gen. V. Nadibaidze Was Confirmed as Georgia's Minister of Defense"] [Text] Arguments of the Opposition Did Not Affect Results The meeting of the Georgian Parliament, which was held yesterday, was declared closed. And no wonder. The question concerning the confirmation of the candidacy of the Republic's Minister of Defense was submitted to the verdict of members of Parliament. Head of the State Eduard Shevardnadze put forward the candidacy of Lt-Gen V. Nadibaidze, who until yesterday served as Deputy Commander for Armaments of the Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus. This factor caused dissatisfaction on the part of the opposition and, at the same time, was the main argument "for" in the camp of the parliamentary majority. Irina Sarishvili, deputy of the National Democratic Party of Georgia, declared: "I am of the opinion that it was not obligatory to confirm the candidacy of the Minister of Defense today. We have bitter experience with such a hasty appointment for this post. The head of the state could have appointed General Nadibaidze and observed for some time whether he justified such high trust. Unfortunately, professionalism, of course, is obligatory, but by no means the only quality that a minister of defense must have. Although, I do not deny, most of the opposition's arguments sounded simply foolish. "I could not vote for this candidacy, because I do not know this man and I simply do not trust the personnel policy of the head of the state. In general, today reminded me of the ratification of Georgia's entry into the CIS. In any event, the composition of deputies was the same as then, which does not happen often." Nevertheless, the position expressed by I. Sarishvili in no way affected the voting results. Deputies voted for the confirmation of the minister's candidacy by a majority vote. Out of the 158 present in the hall seven abstained and three voted "against." The parliamentary majority was 118 people. Naturally, we were interested in the opinion of parliament deputy Tengiz Kitovani, who, as is well known, held the post of Minister of Defense at one time. "Undoubtedly, V. Nadibaidze is a man with experience," Kitovani said. "And I will be very happy if he manages to do something for Georgia. Although I suspect that it will be difficult for him to work with our ambitious generals." The Majority Is Certain That the Choice Was Made Correctly With regard to the parliamentary majority Vice-Speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili expressed its arguments. "The chief thing that acted in V. Nadibaidze's favor was his professionalism," he said. "We were convinced that a normal battleworthy army could not be established with good intentions and patriotism alone. Professionalism is needed here. Taking into consideration the path traversed by General Nadibaidze in the Russian Army, this is one of the worthiest candidacies for the post of the minister of defense. "If we want to build an army, naturally, we need Russia's help and, of course, real help. Keeping in mind our past and geopolitical situation, the Russian Army is a loyal ally for us. Undoubtedly, General Nadibaidze's personal contacts will help us to establish contacts with the Russian Army. Confrontation with Russia did not and will not bring us anything good. The policy adopted by Georgia for rapprochement with Russia and with the former Union republics and, above all, for a real functioning of CIS mechanisms requires precisely such a person at this post. "The opposition's guarded attitude in connection with the fact that Nadibaidze was in active service in the army of a foreign state has no basis. In the world there are dozens of examples of a state, which does not have its own personnel base in a certain sector, inviting its compatriot from abroad for service. Estonia's Minister of Defense is an Estonian by birth, who served in the American Armed Forces and at one time took part in the Vietnam War." `I Will Try To Justify the Trust and To Perform My Duty to the Homeland...' The minister of defense himself, immediately after the confirmation of his candidacy, gave an exclusive interview to SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] What is your main task at this stage? [Nadibaidze] The chief thing for me now is to build, or rather, to continue building Georgia's Armed Forces on the basis that we already have. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Does building the Georgian Army imply the possibility of Abkhazia's return by military means? [Nadibaidze] Abkhazia is an issue for politicians. I am a soldier and my business is to establish the army. [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Are you not afraid that the lot of General Kamkamidze, who left Georgia at one time, will befall you? [Nadibaidze] I do not know which lot of Kamkamidze you are talking about. Today he is one of the best military figures. I have information that he left Georgia voluntarily. Personally, I will try to justify the people's trust and to fully perform my duty to the homeland.
