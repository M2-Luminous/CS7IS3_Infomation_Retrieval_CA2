[Ganic] If the Serbs have not withdrawn their artillery by 21 February, NATO must bomb them. Otherwise, there will no longer be any NATO. The decision is clear: The ultimatum will not be extended, the only alternatives are withdrawal or attack. [DER SPIEGEL] The order to the planes to attack must still be given by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. [Ganic] NATO has imposed the ultimatum so as to act and not to wriggle out of its responsibility again with administrative excuses. Formally, Butrus-Ghali decides on the operation -- in reality, Clinton and Mitterrand give the orders. [DER SPIEGEL] Are the attacks designed to give the inhabitants of Sarajevo some breathing space, or is the intention to end the war in Bosnia, if necessary by militarily defeating the Serbs? [Ganic] A soon as Sarajevo is liberated, the Serbs will immediately show readiness for compromise. The psychological effect will be thorough. [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Serbs could give up Sarajevo and, in retaliation, destroy Tuzla, Gorazde, or other Bosnian towns. [Ganic] They will do this only if NATO hesitates and once again demonstrates leniency. So far, throughout this war, the West has not yet done anything specific. However, the Serbs cannot be impressed with appeals and resolutions. [DER SPIEGEL] Serbian leader Karadzic does not seem to be very intimidated. He is threatening retaliatory strikes. [Ganic] This is simply ridiculous. The Serbs are only a small regional power, but before any potential intervention there are Western critics who conjure up the danger of a world war -- this is the same situation as before the Gulf war against Iraq. The UN blue helmets in Bosnia spend 90 percent of their time barricading and entrenching themselves, even though the Serbs are cowards, are strong only with artillery. There is no reason to fear them. [DER SPIEGEL] Can Serbian superiority be broken without the use of ground forces? [Ganic] I guarantee that Milosevic will not wage war against NATO. He will never risk the bombing of Serbia. He will also call his puppets in Bosnia, such as Karadzic, back in time. [DER SPIEGEL] Does a NATO intervention bring peace closer, or does it just lengthen the war? Hoping for Western help, your President Izetbegovic has so far rejected any compromise at the negotiating table in Geneva. [Ganic] Why should we share our house with thieves? We do not have the authority to relinquish any land to the Serbs. It is the property of our people, who have been driven away. Are our fellow-citizens supposed to vegetate as refugees in Germany or Austria instead of returning to their homes? According to the ethnic map, 45 percent of Bosnia belongs to the Muslim population. [DER SPIEGEL] In Geneva you are offered about one-third of the state territory. Are you not succumbing to an illusion if you hope to receive more? [Ganic] Germany has been united, Israel is negotiating with the Palestinians about the return of the occupied territories. Peace without clearing out of conquered territories is inconceivable. If the Serbs do not withdraw, there will be chaos in Bosnia for a long time. Europe is constantly calling on us to end the war and does not understand that our giving in would just end the first stage of the war. If Bosnia is divided into three parts, the Serbian Republic will continue to attack the Bosnian Republic. [DER SPIEGEL] Can you actually survive as a nation in the Serbian-Croatian embrace? What kind of Bosnia do you want to push through at the Geneva negotiations? [Ganic] A sovereign state, which may be structured in autonomous areas, but with a central parliament and a central government. [DER SPIEGEL] Your government had already agreed on the principle of a tripartite division.... [Ganic] ...the temptation to resign oneself to a small piece of land, if this could ensure that one never had to see Chetniks again, naturally existed. However, now we have to strengthen our resistance so as to decisively weaken the Serbs. [DER SPIEGEL] What happens if the ultimatum passes and the Serbs only pretend to give in just to attack with all the more force a few weeks later? [Ganic] If NATO gambles away its opportunity, the war will spread. We will begin a guerrilla war and stake everything on one card. Perhaps the Turkish Army will then help us. The Islamic countries have frequently offered us their support.
