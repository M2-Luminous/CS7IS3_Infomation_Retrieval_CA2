Japan's yen-based loans to China have been Japan's most powerful diplomatic card to play with China, which is a "political power." The Japanese Government seems to have intended to shorten the renewal period of the loans to maintain a say in pending issues in Asia because China is seeking to use its influence in clearing up the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development program, settling the issue of democracy in Hong Kong, and the issue of Japan-Taiwan relations. With regard to the shortened period of the fourth set of yen-based loans, a source traveling with the foreign minister pointed out that: 1) With the five-year formula, Japan would be unable to deal with China's drastically changing economic situation and exchange rates; and 2) Other Asian nations have been complaining about Japan's "special treatment" of China in granting that country the five-year formula. The meaning of Japan's yen-based loans to China is that from an official posture, Japan cooperates economically with China's reform and opening policy, and from a spiritual standpoint, Japan provides China with the loans as "Japan's postwar reparations." It can be said that this is a good time for the Japanese Government to alter the conventional practice because of the nonexistence of major issues currently pending between the two countries. Although the same source said that Japanese-Chinese relations are at their best level compared to any time in recent years, Japan's diplomatic influence on China remains limited. Japan announced its decision to unfreeze the yen-based loans to China, which had been isolated from the rest of the world following the Tiananmen incident in 1989. At the G-7 summit talks, Japan has championed China. Whether Japan's attitude has served to increase its influence on China remains questionable.
