FR940223-0-00024 FR940223-0-00014 In practice, the final rules will not affect reimbursement of travel expenses of a representative whose travel originates within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing. This is because the expenses incurred and allowable under the regulations for such travel would be less than, or equal to, the maximum amount allowable for travel to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate geographic area. We are amending §§404.999c and 416.1498 by redesignating paragraph (d)(3) as (d)(4) and adding a new paragraph (d)(3) to state and define the limit on the amount of reimbursement for a representative's travel expenses mandated by section 5106(c) of OBRA 1990. The final regulations state that the amount of reimbursement for travel expenses for a representative shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable for travel to the hearing site from any point within the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing; define the geographic area of the office having jurisdiction over the hearing; and explain how we determine the maximum amount allowable for travel by a representative based on the distance to the hearing site from the farthest point within the appropriate geographic area. We also are amending §§404.999c(c) and 416.1498(c) to change the reference from 41 CFR Part 101&hyph;7 to 41 CFR chapter 301, where the Federal Travel Regulations are now codified.
