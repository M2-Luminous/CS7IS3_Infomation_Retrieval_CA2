What can and should politics contribute to the rectification of this condition? [Herzog] Politics in both the old Federal Republic and in the new laender must have a clear idea of how far unification should really go. In terms of the economy, the question is easy to answer. As far as this famous overcoming of mental barriers is concerned, the aim is, in my opinion, being set too high in the discussion of it--at least in the old federal laender. I have never shared the view that all Germans have to think alike. I regard it to be absurd: It is unhistorical, it is not pluralistic, and it is also not democratic. The idea of this Wall in the Mind and the dismantling of this Wall I consider to be two-thirds west German imperialism. [DIE ZEIT] Was it not also "western imperialism" to translate this slogan of "Freedom for the east Germans" into "Property for the west Germans"--to wit, the property ruling? [Herzog] This is the first issue on which I am not allowed to comment. That is before my court. [DIE ZEIT] You would, to be sure, like to become federal president but expect the public--because of your present office--to buy a pig in a poke? [Herzog] In regard to this issue, that is correct. On the other hand, it is the Federal Assembly that elects me and I am doing everything conceivably possible to explain my convictions and my person. There are problems, however, that I cannot comment about. [DIE ZEIT] After unification, hardly anyone wanted to open the constitutional debate--let alone conduct it aggressively. Nonetheless, we talk day after day about aspects of our internal and external constitution. The current federal president has embarked upon a rather exhaustive criticism of the partisan political state. Would not the constitutional debate have offered an opportunity to clear up the inadequacies of the partisan political state? [Herzog] I do not believe that at all because here we are dealing for the most part with things that cannot be regulated by law. To be sure, one can stringently regulate--and I want to do so and have been calling for it ages--the issue of party financing and similar things. One of the faults of our system that has resulted in the scandals of recent years is that all of that was not regulated. [DIE ZEIT] Not even as a result of the by-no-means-consistent legal rulings from Karlsruhe...? [Herzog] That too is completely right. But the issue of internal party democracy and the issue of limiting the negative consequences of internal party democracy that exist as well--those are issues that cannot really be regulated by law. [DIE ZEIT] If the political process is to be reformed it would have to be reformed against the interests of the parties and at the same time with the cooperation of the parties--and one cannot have both. How can you prevent parties from cooperating, as it were, among themselves? [Herzog] Do you want to do away with the parliamentary system of government? The parliamentary system of government, which I consider to be a very momentous breach of the principle of the division of powers, consists of the parliamentary majority simultaneously dominating parliament and the government--as a result of the majority principle. The attendant consequences can only be avoided by introducing a presidential system--something I can hardly imagine now. [DIE ZEIT] If it cannot be solved by a presidential system, would not the introduction of enhanced plebiscitary elements in our constitutional life be a means of overcoming this incestuous relationship within and among the parties? [Herzog] There are two things to be distinguished here. One is the question of to what extent the parties should really have influence on the appointments to leading positions in individual areas. In southern Germany the mayors have been elected by the people since time immemorial. In Bavaria, even the district magistrates are elected by the people. The popular election of mayors is now, so to speak, penetrating northward. It has proven itself in the south. The second thing is the plebiscitary element. I have always said that I am not against it. I come from Bavaria where that has been customary for ages. I was a minister in Baden-Wuerttemberg where it has existed for ages. I have no problem with it. The problem is different. The issue is plebiscitary elements and some say Yes and others say No. Yet the discussion of it, after all, must take place: What can be decided by a plebiscite and what not? This discussion is not really being conducted here. [DIE ZEIT] How should we treat the Basic Law as revised following unification? Do we need a referendum on the final text? [Herzog] I would welcome the newly formulated constitution being submitted to a plebiscite because that is customary in democratic nations. [DIE ZEIT] How should this unified nation interpret its external role? There are a lot of people now who want to go merrily charging into international affairs--to a certain extent with military means even. [Herzog] The military question--we have that before us as well and therefore I cannot comment on it. Furthermore, the whole problem consists of many aspects. The nice little pigeonholes have been gone now for some years. The northern hemisphere was neatly divided between the Warsaw Pact and NATO and the very concept of "Third World" shows that the rest of the world was defined in terms of these two pigeonholes--something that cannot be true. This is past. I use the following somewhat silly example for this: To date, it has been a game of pingpong between the East and the West and now it is Rastelli with an unlimited number of balls. It is an entirely new way of thinking that all of us have not yet mastered. Moreover, there is no question at all that in the long run we will not be able to shirk the responsibility on the international scene that results from this country's importance. And we are not doing that either. [DIE ZEIT] From German history and World War I and II we have thus far drawn the following conclusion regarding Germany's role in Europe: Germany should conduct itself with the greatest reserve in international affairs. Now it looks as if many people are throwing this practical knowledge overboard. Can we once again be completely normal in our foreign policy? [Herzog] No, we cannot. For a long, long time we will have to make allowances for the sensibilities that we have created in our own history. What in the early days of the Federal Republic was regarded as a limitation upon our sovereignty and a burden became, however, an advantage as it were over the course of the intervening 40 years. Although we have every reason to draw our conclusions from history, no one will be willing any longer to accept in the long run that we, with a reference to our misdeeds of the past, claim for ourselves a position that others today regard as a privilege. [DIE ZEIT] In reference to East Europe, there is the quotation: "That which we did not gain in war will fall into our lap in peacetime." [Herzog] That must not be allowed to become policy. Even the appearance of it must not arise. That is, moreover, the reason--and I am permitted to state it now that it has been ruled on--why in the final analysis I was also for the Maastricht Treaty. [DIE ZEIT] After unification there has been a growing chorus of voices claiming that we no longer need our close ties to the West, that our linkage to the West was a special course and now we can go our own way. [Herzog] That is sheer nonsense: We cannot. He who leans far out of the window--and we have to do that in East Europe--must ensure that there is someone there holding onto him--that is our integration into the West--so that he does not fall out of the window. And finally: Who knows, to put it this way, what the national character of our own people will once again bestow upon us? [DIE ZEIT] If the future Berlin Republic therefore has to be in essence a continuation of the Bonn Republic, what is the situation with the catchword "constitutional patriotism?" Dolf Sternberger characterized the concept by stating that the republican rules of the constitution are the core of our society, and thus it is sufficiently defined. More and more it is now being said that a purely republican constitution is not sufficient, that we need in addition a national consciousness. [Herzog] Because of everything in my entire background, my sense of national pride and such things is downright underdeveloped. I love the German people, who are a difficult people, but I really love them in all their branches--and I do not say that just since I have become a candidate for the office of federal president. But one has to proceed with caution in these things. [DIE ZEIT] The sociologist Lepsius once said: "We simply cannot identify with Germany's history...National Socialism has made this absolutely impossible." [Herzog] I think that we are dealing only with a difference in wording here. The word "nation state" is, after all, an archaic word. The phenomenon of the nation state in the form in which it used to exist is a thing of the past. Basically, it was already relegated to being put in quotation marks by the entry into the world economy, and then it was really put in quotation marks by West European integration and it has been basically antiquated. But nonetheless the peoples of Europe live in states that constitute their nations. And they want their states. No Frenchman would ever be prepared to give up France just for Europe. It is exactly the same with us. [DIE ZEIT] Steffen Heitmann once said that the identity of the country must be culturally defined. [Herzog] Now here again I can do relatively little with that because already during the time of the classic nation state I considered culture to be something that transcends nations. In addition--and I would really like to emphasize this once again--culture was always international or predominately international. [DIE ZEIT] When the RAF [Red Army Faction] was terrorizing this country, society--the state--was prepared to undertake the most extreme measures. Is it unfair to say that this society did not act so decisively against the Right? [Herzog] There was a phase of perplexity, of irritation--that is entirely correct. I no longer see this, however. [DIE ZEIT] Konrad Adenauer was extremely suspicious regarding the Germans' democratic loyalties in general. [Herzog] Yes, we have to be on guard. To be sure, I go on the assumption that the great majority today is at heart faithful to democracy, yet the times are past when the ultraleftist and ultrarightist groupings, which exist in any nation, were quiescent. For more than a generation they were disqualified by Stalinism and National Socialism. That, of course, has changed with the expiration and succession of generations. For that reason I have always said: Pay attention to these people, do not let them drift away. [DIE ZEIT] The Federal Republic has always lived in the shadow of the past. Now we are living in the shadow of a double past. What should we learn from the years after 1945 for our dealing with the dictatorship in East Germany and its legacy in the form of the Stasi [State Security Service] files? Should we make amends there for what we failed to do in 1945, or did we learn after 1945 what must not be neglected in coming to terms with the past? [Herzog] I believe the latter. One thing must be clear: Flagrant violations of human rights, the killing of people, arbitrary incarceration of people, torture and the like must be exposed and must be documented--as has been done in the final analysis in the case of the Third Reich as well, albeit with large delay factors. [DIE ZEIT] But mean-spirited denunciation, spying on people, snooping around? [Herzog] I would make considerable distinctions in regard to what happened. It is a different matter in cases where people were really harmed than it is if someone submitted a report about a trip to the Federal Republic or to France. The "arrangements" that someone made with this regime over 40 years--that is, after all, something known from the period after 1945 as well--you cannot pursue either politically or through the criminal law. [DIE ZEIT] But you are not advocating a "sealing of the files" either, are you? [Herzog] I, too, do not advocate sealing the files for a very simple practical reason: Sooner or later it will come to light after all. [DIE ZEIT] We have a year ahead of us in which the anniversaries will pile up and one has the impression that, like 1984-85, we are once again stumbling somewhat clumsily into the situation. Should we be present [at the commemorative ceremonies] on the Atlantic coast? [Herzog] It depends upon the nature of such ceremonies. We should, I believe, have nothing to do with those that basically celebrate victory over the Germans. It is proper that we are not being invited and, in my opinion, it is also proper that Helmut Kohl says he would not go there at all. When it comes to ceremonies that point to the future from the perspective of that time--that say that was the beginning of a new European policy--then the matter is entirely different. But in all these things I would be very much opposed to a we-have-to-participate-in-everything mentality as well as opposed to a mentality that feels itself disqualified when the others celebrate their victory. [DIE ZEIT] Are we at least able today to acknowledge that the military defeat of the German Reich was the sole prospect of achieving a free Germany and a free Europe? [Herzog] I do not have the impression that that is disputed in our country. If you direct the question to me--it is to be answered in the affirmative. It is my view that we should be able to see that and not to worry further about it at all. [DIE ZEIT] All federal presidents to date have suffered from the fetters of the office and occasionally have tried to tug on the chains. What attracts you to this basically weak office? [Herzog] What interests me about the office are two things. The first is: We have a pluralistic society and it is proper that we do. I feel comfortable in it. The only thing is that a pluralistic society naturally develops centrifugal forces, yet it only functions when the sum of the centripetal forces is at least equally great as--if not somewhat greater than--that of the centrifugal ones. And there are, after all, many communalities among our political camps, but they, in fact, get lost in the business of politics. What actually emerges all the time are only those things that divide them, not those that unite them. [DIE ZEIT] That means that you, as president, would be the personification of the "Round Table." [Herzog] No, but to that end one must look around and see where there are integrative agencies. And my opinion on that score has always been that one is the federal president and another is the Federal Constitutional Court--in different areas and with entirely different methods. The other thing is that I have the feeling that the parties, to a certain extent for easily explainable reasons--and that is not just their failure but that is a part of the system--also have to deal a lot in these political discussions with details, and that the citizens see the larger problems and therefore feel to a great extent that they are not being understood. [DIE ZEIT] That means that the federal president would then on occasion be the spokesman for the citizenry to the parties as a whole? [Herzog] Yes, publicly. [DIE ZEIT] You are thereby attributing a compensatory function to the federal president. He would jump in... [Herzog] That is not incorrect. But it is not just the job of the federal president to act as a counterweight, rather it belongs to those people who ought to do it. [DIE ZEIT] That means now and then taking the parties to task then? [Herzog] Yes. Only it is a question of whether to do it publicly. That has to be decided on a case-by-case basis. [DIE ZEIT] Did not Richard von Weizsaecker's administration raise expectations for this office much higher than the office can in fact live up to? [Herzog] Yes. [DIE ZEIT] Will not then a period of normalization set in following Richard von Weizsaecker's administration? [Herzog] I would not say normalization, but it is very clear that it will be terribly difficult to toil in the man's footsteps. That, however, will apply for anyone who assumes the office. [DIE ZEIT] Mr. Herzog, the liberals in this country say that Roman Herzog is not nearly as conservative as a Christian Democratic Union (CDU) candidate could be. Many CDU supporters, even in the conservative press, say that Roman Herzog is not as conservative as he should be. In that quarter you are considered to be ideologically a bit unreliable. How liberal are you? How conservative are you? [Herzog] That is the old story, and once again I have to say: Pigeonholes do not do any good. [DIE ZEIT] In general, what does this society as it is presently constituted need more: a bit more liberality or a bit more conservativeness? [Herzog] Now you would have to hold a long discussion as to what is liberal and what is conservative. I believe in any case that solutions can only be found in free discussion. On that score I am an almost childlike liberal: I still believe in the freedom of discussion.
