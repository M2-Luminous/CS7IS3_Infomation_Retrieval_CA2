Following the failure of the Vienna talks, the various countries involved in the Cyprus issue are tending in this direction. According to I SIMERINI's information, there will be a period of background negotiations to prepare new proposals with new procedures after Butrus-Ghali submits his report to the Security Council. Unofficial efforts to urge the Turkish side to accept the confidence-building measures are not being ruled out. Foreign diplomats in Nicosia said the new effort will focus on these new ideas and the confidence-building measures, but added that they hope that during the procedure the Turkish side will accept the confidence-building measures in some form. They insist that this is the basis of the talks on a solution. Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas puts his side's demands in coded language and he persists in creating a pseudodilemma, with the goal of showing that there are only two choices in the Cyprus issue: recognition of the pseudostate or union of the occupied areas with Turkey. During the Vienna talks, Denktas' advisers clarified the positions that were advanced during this period. 1. Joint management of Famagusta and promotion of separate sovereignty; this would be a model for a future settlement. 2. Rejection of the proposal to reinstate the law that existed until December 1963. They want laws to be approved by both communities and the directors of the two areas. (This position stems from their view that they do not recognize the Republic of Cyprus) 3. Because the airport will not go into operation at the same time as the opening of Famagusta, they want to control the passages there in order to be able to block off the city if they are unsatisfied with the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, and UN political adviser John Paul Kavanagh yesterday worked hard to prepare Butrus-Ghali's report. Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, has finished briefing the British Foreign Office. Talks are expected in the next few days on the various scenarios that will be followed. This will be done in a period when the United States, just like Britain, is acting especially quietly because it does not want to disturb Turkey. This is a fact that will be considered in the UN secretary general's report and the UN Security Council resolutions.
