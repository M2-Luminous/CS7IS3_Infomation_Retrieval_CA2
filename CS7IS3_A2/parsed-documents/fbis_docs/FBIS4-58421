CONTENTS: 1. Israel's Rabin Seeks Russian Accord Against Islamic Movements 2. Asyut Residents Criticize Police Handling of Islamic Groups 3. Sudanese Vice President, Others Address Islamic Conference 4. Party Official Attacks Regime, Notes `Islamic Solution' 5. Doctors' Union Holds Conference in Support of Bosnian Muslims ISRAEL'S RABIN SEEKS RUSSIAN ACCORD AGAINST ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS In an approximately 140-word front-page report by Mahmud Bakri under the heading "U.S.-Russian-Israeli Agreement To Confront the Islamists," AL-SHA'B claims to have learned that Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's talks in Russia dealt with an agreement to confront the "growing" Islamic movements in the region. Information indicates, Bakri adds, that there is an intention to sign a strategic agreement between Israeli and Russian intelligence services in this regard, the first such accord between the two countries. Bakri states: "The information confirms that the Israeli proposals in this respect include one about finding a formula for tripartite cooperation involving Russia, Israel, and the United States within an integrated plan called "Handling Security in the Middle East." The plan stipulates a tripartite cooperation based on halting all forms of agreement and military engagement between Russia and the Arab countries for fear that some Islamic trends may gain control over the sources of some of these weapons. Bakri notes that the plan also provides for penetrating the security of some religious institutions and calls for interest in the role of research and information. The author concludes by saying that the tripartite plan's details are not yet clear but the U.S. side approved it earlier. ASYUT RESIDENTS CRITICIZE POLICE HANDLING OF ISLAMIC GROUPS A 180-word front-page report by Jahal Imbabi says that Asyut residents have denounced police excesses against the population, the violation of human rights, mass punishment, random shooting, and the wounding of innocent people. In interviews with AL-SHA'B, the report adds, people from various part of Asyut affirm that the police have handled the Islamic Group's "excesses" with their own "excess" against the population, which paid for "both sides' mistakes." Imbabi claims the residents also criticized the state media policy and pointed out that undermining the legitimate parties, violating the trade unions, weakening al-Azhar's role, and rigging elections have found the youths lose hope in change through the ballot box. SUDANESE VICE PRESIDENT, OTHERS ADDRESS ISLAMIC CONFERENCE In an approximately 1,000-word report on pages 1 and 7 by Qutb al-Arabi from Khartoum on the opening of the 14th session of the Islamic Propagation Organization [IPO], the paper says the Sudanese vice president, Major General al-Zubayr Muhammad Salih, the chairman of the IPO Board of Trustees, Marshal 'Abd-al-Rahman Siwar-al-Dhahab, and Qatari Shari'ah College Dean Yusuf al-Qardawi addressed the delegates. In his speech, the Sudanese vice president defended the Sudanese Government and Islam, saying: "The Sudanese Government has devoted itself to God in defense of Islam and the oppressed everywhere. The threats of the United States and the West do not frighten us because God is with us. We will not submit to the enemies of Islam and there will be no concessions on any of God's commandments unless it is over our dead bodies." He gave his "assurance" to the Islamic nation that the Islamic regime in Sudan is "firm and able to confront the Islamic nation's enemies." He said: "We are a peaceful nation, do not wish to fight anyone, and have nothing to do with terrorism. But we have truly revived the spirit of jihad in the Sudanese people so that they can be vigilant and can defend themselves against any potential aggression." In his address, the IPO official denounced the "world order that is hostile to Muslims." He noted that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali halted a NATO decision to attack the Serbs in Gorazde because a British soldier had to be moved from there. Thus the UN secretary general was "concerned about one British soldier, yet did not care about 70,000 Muslim men and women besieged in Gorazde." Defending the Sudanese Government and its Islamic policy, the Qatari Shari'ah College dean addressed the conference, saying Sudan will not bow and will only kneel before God. He added that Sudan will offer a great deal to the shari'ah so that it can live a "sound Islamic life." The author notes that the mufti of Albania was among those who addressed the inaugural session. PARTY OFFICIAL ATTACKS REGIME, NOTES `ISLAMIC SOLUTION' Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn writes an approximately 3,000-word article on page five strongly criticizing the prime minister and other government officials for "corruption and mismanagement." In his article, Husayn cites the government's "failed" policies in various economic, industrial, agricultural, and other spheres and accuses the prime minister of covering up fraud and corruption. He claims that the government acts on orders from world financial institutions and disregards people's interests. He says: "We" reject the U.S. "instructions" on Egypt's economy and adds that the IMF and World Bank promote their instructions on the grounds that these instructions represent the "Anglo-American school's" successful experiment in market economy. He remarks that what is good for the United States is not necessarily good for other countries. He says that the "Anglo-American school's principles of materialism and consumer inclination," which do not strike a balance between capital owners and the nation's interests, are not compatible with the "Islamic solution" in economics. From the mere economic point of view, he says, a worker offers more effort as his loyalty to his establishment increases and as his sense of security and stability strengthens. He then claims that the "Anglo-American School" says the opposite and that "Asian experiments" led by Japan have proved that what "we" advocate on the basis of "Islam and tradition" is right. Toward the end of his article, the author suggests: "Prolonging this situation is impossible. If national dialogue will not serve as a means to change this situation then it will be no more than a waste of time. At the very least the nation requires a guarantee for its humanity, demands rulers with resolve and a clean hand, and demands safety for its physical wellbeing, honor, and property." He adds: "At most, we should move toward a comprehensive change that will restore Islam to its dominant standing while all the religious Egyptians turn toward building a new civilization and a strong state that integrates and unites with its Arab brothers." He claims: "We" do not agree with the advocates of violence, their methods or their vision of an Islamic solution, and asks: What is the use of rejection if there is no better alternative way? The author concludes by contending: "The nation wants change; it wants it peacefully. But if you do not meet its wish, an explosion is inevitable." DOCTORS' UNION HOLDS CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS In an approximately 420-word report on page 7, AL-SHA'B's Khalid Yunus says various men addressed a "mass popular conference" organized by the Doctors' Association in support of Bosnian Muslims. In his address, Dr. 'Abd-al-Hayy al-Faramawi, professor of Koranic interpretation at al-Azhar University, attributed the "tragedy" of the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Muslim rulers' weakness and languor, which have led to the loss of Palestine, Eritrea, Somalia, Burma, Kashmir, and finally Bosnia-Herzegovina. Al-Faramawi is quoted as saying that resolving the Islamic nations' causes can be achieved by rulers who are conscious of such causes and want to see the "inviolability of Islamic blood" and respect for the ulema and the nation's belief in the "sanctity of all forms of jihad." Addressing the conferees, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali said: "History repeats itself. As Jerusalem fell amid the silence of the Islamic world, Bosnia falls today while no member country of the Islamic Conference Organization moves." He is cited as adding that the European countries and the United States do not know the "language of conscience" but know only their interests. He is also quoted calling for applying the Koran so that the nation can emerge from its predicament. Dr. Ahmad al-Malat, deputy general guide of the Muslim Brotherhood, also addressed the conference, stressing the importance of every Muslim performing his duty toward "his brothers" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: "The Islamic nation--both the rulers and the governed--has not played its role toward this unarmed people, although they belong to Islam, with which they conquered various parts of the world."
