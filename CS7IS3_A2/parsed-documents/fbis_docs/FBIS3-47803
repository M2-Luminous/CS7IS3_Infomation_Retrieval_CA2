On 12 January, the puppet Ministry of Home Affairs set the period from 12 January to 11 July as the second planning period to ensure the stabilization of public welfare and ordered the police offices in cities and provinces throughout South Korea to keep intensive control over violent crimes. During the 13 January meeting, the puppet police decided to maintain an emergency duty system by mobilizing 65 percent of police forces and, at the same time, decided to crack down on crime by conducting surprise operations once every three or five days, thus babbling about the so-called perfect crime prevention system. Also, they have decided to arrest criminals by establishing a special task force against four major crimes, such as organized violent groups and robbers, and to take strong steps against commanding officers in charge of areas where violent crimes take place frequently by removing them from their posts, thus applying the regional responsibility system. South Korea seems to have taken steps to root out crimes, but, actually, it intends to suppress more brutally the just struggles of South Korean youth, students, and people who aspire for independence, democracy, and reunification under the pretext of rooting out crime. This has been clearly proven in the 180-day operation to root out crime, which the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique started last year after he took office. The Kim Yong-sam clique set the period from 1 April to September 1993 as the 180-day operation period to cleanup crime and oppress the people, thus loudly talking about the operation as if it would remove crime from South Korea. The rate of crime has not decreased, but rather further increased. Also, more vicious methods have been employed in crime. The South Korean paper TONG-A ILBO reported some time ago that murder, rape, robbery with violence, violence, and theft, which are called the five major crimes in South Korea, are being committed every 125 seconds; fraud, which is called an economic crime, every 296 seconds; embezzlement, every 18 minutes and 36 seconds; and traffic crime every 64 seconds. It also reported that robbery and rape cases in South Korea have increased by 500 times over the past ten years, which is a world record. Despite the Kim Yong-sam ring's raving about crime eradication operations, the crime rate has been rising continuously in South Korea because they used their suppressive force to suppress the people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification under the pretext of such operations. Last year as well, the Kim Yong-sam ring mobilized all their suppressive force to suppress the South Korean people's just struggle -- such as the struggle calling for the clarification of the truth of the Kwangju massacre and the punishment of its main culprits, which was waged on the occasion of the 13th anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising,and the meeting to launch the Korean Federation of University Student Councils and the struggle to realize the 12 June North-South student talks in Panmunjom. On 20 July, the Kim Yong-sam ring even exercised the right of emergency coordination, which the preceding dictators dared not mobilize, and brutally suppressed the labor dispute of the Hyundai Motor Company workers. Thus, the Kim Yong-sam ring did not use the police force to crack down on crime, but mobilized it to suppress the people's just struggle, thus allowing a steady increase of crime in South Korea. The crime eradication they rave about is after all an excuse to suppress the South Korean people's just struggle. The Kim Yong-sam ring has been conducting a 180-day campaign for the eradication of crime since early this new year in an attempt to block the South Korean people's intensifying struggle for the country's reunification and to suppress the South Korean students' antigovernment struggle, which will be stepped up this spring. Through the Kim Yong-sam ring's fascist terrorist rule for nearly one year, the South Korean people have become aware that as long as the ring remains in power, it is impossible to realize the country's reunification or the democratization and independence of South Korean society. They, therefore, are launching themselves into the antigovernment struggle against the ring. In particular, the traitorous act of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who opened up the rice market, breaking his promise not to open up the rice market under any circumstances, is causing surging indignation among the South Korean people. At the same time, it is expected that the South Korean students and people will further step up their antigovernment struggle on the anniversaries of the April popular uprising and the Kwangju popular uprising. Hence, the Kim Yong-sam ring set aside the period from 12 January to 11 July as a 180-day crime eradication campaign period and is frantically engaged in fascist suppression of the people. However, fascist suppression cannot be a measure for their survival. Rather, it will hasten their own ruin. The Kim Yong-sam ring, which claimed to be a civilian regime, is walking along the way of fascist suppression in open cooperation with his predecessor military fascist dictators. This is a last-ditch effort of one who is destined to meet with his doomed end. The Kim Yong-sam ring should squarely see the developments in South Korea, act with discretion, and step down from power without delay as demanded by the people.
