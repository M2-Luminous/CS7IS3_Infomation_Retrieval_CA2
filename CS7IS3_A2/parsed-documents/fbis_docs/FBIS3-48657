Branding this row of the South Korean puppets as an act going against the desire of the nation for reunification, the news analyst says: The puppets are carping on the North, crying over its "commandos" and "provocation". But it is an old tune which everyone is weary of hearing and a foolish phrase that can convince no one. "Emergency preparedness" on the lips of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique means to make a war against the North a fait accompli on the Korean peninsula according to the outside forces' policy of aggression and to be prepared for mobilizing all the human and material resources of South Korea. The Kim Yong-sam clique ceaselessly staged military exercises in league with foreign forces of aggression last year and mobilized even para-military forces in them beside the puppet Army. The puppets' outcries for "completion of allout combat posture of civilians, government and Army" and "exercises simulating actual war to provide against regular warfare" suggest that they would be more frenzied in war rackets against fellow countrymen by mobilizing even citizens this year. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is trying to divert elsewhere the attention of people with the row of confrontation against the North and thus tide over the crisis of the fascist rule. The foul attempt of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, stands no chance of success. Its confrontation row against the DPRK will invite fiercer resentment of the people and precipitate its own destruction.
