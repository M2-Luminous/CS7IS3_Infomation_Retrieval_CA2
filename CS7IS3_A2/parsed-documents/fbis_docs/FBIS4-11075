"It is not a question of competing just for the sake of competing, but in order to boost the country's productive capability, with tangible benefit for Mexican workers," Salinas added. The president said that in our country we have the force of law, the basis that guarantees compliance with social and labor rights. Much has been accomplished, but we know there is still much to do because there are still social needs and the requirements of isolated communities. Salinas told labor representatives that training the work force is a strategic necessity. In Mexico, the worker comes first and is the subject of the change and purpose of the new arrangements to bolster quality of life and productivity. In our country, Salinas said, workers are the basic element at the forefront of change. We inherited a sociopolitical tradition that cares especially for the rights of workers, and our Constitution clearly states that respect for their rights is an overriding and substantive aspect of development. In a ceremony in the Manuel Avila Camacho room in Los Pinos Presidential Palace, Salinas de Gortari explained that Mexican social institutions are meant to guarantee the quality of life of their workers through access to medical services, dignified housing, adequate work conditions, participation in business utilities, and insured retirement savings. Mexicans, he added, understand productivity as an essential element to make more effective our labor legislation guarantees. If our businesses are more competitive, there are more jobs, better wages, and job stability and viability are guaranteed. Boosting productivity is fully compatible with the strictest respect for workers' rights. That is why we want to efficiently compete in the international market for goods and services, he said. In addition, we have contributed to setting a worldwide precedent with NAFTA. We negotiated a special package of labor standards, respectful of the environment, always in agreement with our laws, and taking into account our labor laws, Salinas said. Mexico -- Salinas told the union representatives, businessmen, and workers -- is a country that builds for the 21st century, to come out ahead in democracy and freedom, and compete efficiently in international markets. We reaffirm the traditional links of cooperation between Mexico and the ILO by signing the Inter-Institutional Agreement for Agreed Actions [Acuerdo Interinstitucional para la Concertacion de Acciones] between the Labor and Social Welfare Secretariat and the ILO. The agreement is part of the new policies of cooperation with the ILO with the creation of more effective agreement mechanisms to raise the workers' quality of life and labor. Labor Secretary Arsenio Farell Cubillas said that the ILO, which has its own legal basis, is part of the state of law that keeps tabs on all political organizations in society. Also present were Emilio Morgado, acting director of the regional ILO office for Latin America; Fidel Velazquez, secretary general of the Confederation of Mexican Workers; and Genaro Borrego, director IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute].
