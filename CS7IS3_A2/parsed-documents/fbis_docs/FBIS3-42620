The output of sectors producing for the consumer market declined by 12 percent, and of those manufacturing producer goods--by 18 percent, which to a certain extent is the result of diminished investment demand. In the chemical and petrochemical, timber, woodworking, pulp and paper, and light industry, output fell by 18-25 percent as compared to 11 months of last year; in the fuel and raw material sectors (power generation, gas, coal, ore mining for ferrous metallurgy), output fell by 6-9 percent. During the last few months, in the fuel and energy complex, one sees a characteristic increase in output of major energy resources. Over 11 months the output of gas amounted to 560 billion cubic meters; coal--277 million tonnes; and oil--314 million tonnes (including gas condensate), which is less than over the analogous period of last year by 4 percent, 10 percent, and 13 percent, respectively. The volume of power generation declined overall by 5 percent, and at thermal electric power stations by 8 percent. In ferrous metallurgy as compared to 11 months of last year output of finished rolled metal dropped off by 7 percent, and of steel pipe by one-quarter. At the same time, certain structural changes are taking place in the sector. While total steel smelting fell off by 12 percent, output of converter steel declined by 3 percent. The share of this advanced method in the total volume of production currently is 38 percent as compared to 34 percent in 1992. In machine building, over January-November 1993 as compared to the same period of last year, production of construction cranes declined by almost one-half; freight railcars and large electric machinery--by one-third; main line diesel locomotives--by more than one-quarter; and metal-cutting machine tools and alternate current electric motors--by almost 20 percent. In the chemical and petrochemical industry over January-November of 1993 the output of chemical fiber and thread amounted to 74 percent of that for last year, and automotive tires--89 percent; the output of mineral fertilizer has not exceeded 80 percent of the level of the corresponding period of last year. At the same time, positive structural changes are manifesting themselves in their production: The share of mineral fertilizer in granulated form has increased from 58 percent to 63 percent. In 1993 there were structural changes in the production of chemical fiber and thread. The share of artificial thread and fiber requiring less expenditure of material resources increased (from 43 percent in January-November 1992 to the current 49 percent), as did the production of those closest in quality to natural thread and fiber--rayon textile thread (from 6.5 percent to 8.1 percent) and rayon fiber (from 28 percent to 34 percent). In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry over the elapsed 11 months, output of cardboard and sawn lumber declined by one-quarter; of woodchip board--by 12 percent, and plywood--by 18 percent. There was also a decline in the production of window and door units, mine props, prefabricated homes and sets of home-building components made of wood, and wood containers. Despite the seasonal increase in the production of commercial wood that began in November, its monthly output ended 27 percent below that of last year, and over January-November overall--28 percent. At the same time, the decline in paper production slowed down somewhat--from 25 percent in the first half of the year to 13 percent in July-November. The output of writing and notebook paper, as well as some varieties of printing paper produced predominantly for the domestic market, declined by 25-43 percent. In light industry the output of footwear declined by almost one-third as compared to January-November of last year; of fabrics, knitwear, and some varieties of sewn items (coats and short coats, jackets, and shirts)--by 25-29 percent; and of hosiery--by 13 percent. Production of items for children declined to a greater extent--by 31-49 percent. In the cultural, personal, and household goods market the situation is more favorable. To a certain extent due to new capacities being brought on line and conversion of defense enterprises, production of a number of complex appliances and machines increased over January-November 1993 as compared to the analogous period of last year; this includes freezers, two- and three-chamber refrigerators, kitchen food mixers, color television sets, goods for use on private farms and auxiliary and garden plots--modular engines, motorized cultivators, and mini-tractors. At the same time, the low degree of attractiveness of domestically produced goods as compared to imported ones and the population's limited buying power resulted in a reduction of output in the communication industry--such as video cassette recorders, radio receivers, and tape recorders (18-38 percent), and of photo cameras by instrument-making industry enterprises (by 46 percent). In the food processing industry output of basic foodstuffs is characterized by the following data: Product Production November (average daily output) as % of September October November November October 1992 1993 Meat, 319 324 274 77 85 including category I subproducts, thousand tonnes Whole-milk 600 608 578 88 98 products recalculated as milk, thousand tonnes Granulated 397 923 722 115 78 sugar--total, thousand tonnes Vegetable oil, 39.1 78.4 88.4 93 116 thousand tonnes Bread and 1,277 1,265 1,143 96 93 bakery items, thousand tonnes
