HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater are also being sued for compensation totaling around 14 million markkas. The reason for the writ against HUFVUDSTADSBLADET is that in her column entitled "Bad Taste" and published on 14 April Jutta Zilliacus called Zhirinovskiy a "madcap" [galenpanna]. Zhirinovskiy considers the word to be synonymous with the word "mad" [galen]. He considers this to be defamation. "This interpretation is completely incorrect. The word `madcap' is synonymous with the words `daredevil, adventurous, hothead' and is often used in the context of political activists," said Mikael Reuter, the head of the Bureau for Swedish Terminology and Usage. For its part the Swedish Theater has offended Zhirinovskiy by using in the play "Mein Kampf" a speech of Zhirinovskiy's as a continuation of a speech by Hitler -- something which, according to Zhirinovskiy gives the impression that it is "the same person or an incarnation of Adolf Hitler who is speaking."
