The document urged all localities, in the new situation of developing a socialist market economy, to effectively strengthen the party's leadership over armed work and to properly carry out enterprise militia and reserve service work. The document said that all localities should take various measures to effectively publicize and carry out the "regulations," strengthen leadership over enterprise militia and reserve service work, conduct annual inspections and evaluations, commend outstanding units and individuals, and penalize those who have performed poorly. It said: While carrying out structural reform and transforming enterprises' operating mechanisms, all localities should ensure the independence and stability of enterprises' armed service units. Enterprises -- including wholly owned enterprises, joint ventures, and cooperative enterprises -- which should have established an armed service unit but have not done so should establish an armed service unit as soon as possible. Those that have abolished their armed service units should immediately reestablish them. Enterprises' armed service organs must not be abolished or merged without approval. If organizational changes are needed due to changes in the enterprise system, they must be subject to the approval of the provincial CPC Committee, the provincial government, and the provincial military district. The document also clearly set forth regulations on the mechanisms of commendation, punishment, and giving incentives for carrying out enterprise militia and reserve service work.
