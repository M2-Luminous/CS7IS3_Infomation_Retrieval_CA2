Although the framework talks failed to agree on the substance of the objective criteria, there had been some agreements reached in procedural matters. Japan has to underscore its efforts toward opening its market if only to dissuade the United States from imposing unilateral sanctions. Furthermore, the government also intends to expand its action program on government procurement, and study measures to ease regulations in the insurance sector to compile new market liberalization measures in time for the meeting of leaders of the advanced countries (Naples Summit) in July. Responsible government officials from concerned ministries and agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of International Trade and Industry will meet on 15 February to discuss how to deal with the framework talks. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and concerned cabinet ministers will also meet as early as this week to start formulating concrete measures to open the market. The objective criteria were supposed to be set to gauge the extent of foreign participation in the market. Even the recent bilateral summit meeting was not able to narrow the gap between the United States, which wanted the introduction of targets for the future, and Japan, which opposed such targets. This led to a breakdown in the framework talks. However, basic agreements had been reached in areas other than the objective criteria. Japan will implement these agreements on its own initiative. One of these is the promotion of the improvement and extension of procedures for government procurement, one of the priority sectors in the framework talks. Early this month, the cabinet decided upon an action program on government procurement, which provided for the creation of a new organ to handle complaints, among other things. It was also agreed at the framework talks that the floor prices of telecommunications and medical equipment subject to competitive bidding be set at 100,000 SDRs (IMF special drawing rights; around 15 million yen). In insurance, another priority sector, concrete measures will be drawn up for matters agreed upon between Japan and the United States. The Finance Ministry is aiming at a reform of the insurance industry in fiscal 1996, which includes the introduction of an insurance brokerage system, and a public hearing system where foreign insurance companies will be allowed to express their opinions on the insurance market. Regarding how to deal with the framework talks from now on, Prime Minister Hosokawa has said: "The ball has been thrown to us. We have to come up with ideas." Apparently, the government has decided to take the initiative in implementing market liberalization measures. After the framework talks broke down, the United States hinted at imposing sanctions and taking other unilateral actions. It is believed that the government's decision is partly meant to ward off such retaliation.
