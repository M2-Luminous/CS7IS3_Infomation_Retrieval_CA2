The compounds are blamed for contaminating marine life. The report, submitted to a subcommittee on chemical substances within the agency's central council for environmental pollution control, said there has been a slight improvement in the level of contamination from the compounds in the two years since the introduction of the restrictions. But the report also said contamination from toxic substances, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and dioxins, though at low levels, is still continuing. In a survey of 17 potentially harmful substances, eight, including the herbicide simetryn, were found in water and fish. The substances are only mildly toxic and were detected in small amounts, but the report said more investigation is required since simetryn is reportedly capable of affecting marine plants at even low concentrations. The report also said PCB was detected in 37 of 72 samples of sea bass and other fish taken from Tokyo bay and other parts of the country. Dioxins, some known for their high toxicity, were present in silt at the bottom of Tokyo, Ise, and Osaka bays. The densities and frequency of occurrence were the same as in 1991. A spokesman for the agency said they are unlikely to have an impact on humans, but noted that there is a need to assess the distribution because of the apparently wide area in which they are found.
