And in the Sich, at the very heart of European-type democracy--the Leninskyy Rayon of Zaporizhzhya--the electoral commission registered as many as 30 candidates. More than 100 persons had originally been put up there. One contender has already died.... The activists in election matters complain that most of the candidates cannot even write up their own biographical sketches without making mistakes. They need to work on their A,B,C's.... An analysis of the pre-election lists leads us inevitably to the following conclusion, which may seem paradoxical at first glance: The nomenklatura of the local power structure has, in effect, withdrawn itself from contention for the deputies' seats. Not a single presidential representative is on the ballot, nor are any chairmen of local or rayon councils. Not even those bureaucratic officials of the state administration, who have not withstood the temptation to scamper off to Kiev, have any desire to beat their own bosses soundly. In a country where elections are won by the group that organizes them such behavior in Zaporizhzhya by the "party of Kravchuk" and the "party of Plyushch" must seem surprising at the least. However, their tactics may be easily explained: The nomenklatura here does not wish to win the elections; it intends instead to lose them. And that certainly does not require much effort. Inasmuch as an outright victory by any one candidate on the ballot in Zaporizhzhya seems highly doubtful in the first round, the second round could indeed put an end to these elections with all the hustle and bustle around them. The people in Zaporizhzhya might very well ignore their obligation to go somewhere and vote for someone for a second week in a row. And unless two-thirds of the body of deputies has been elected after these two rounds, the elections may be deemed a political nullity. In that case the present-day Supreme Council would automatically continue its powers of office--an eventuality which would fully suit the nomenklatura of Plyushch and Kravchuk. At present they are more concerned with the elections to the local councils--elections for which they must, indeed, prepare. And in order to prepare, they need a time-out.... Under such conditions the deputies' seats will be divided up amongst themselves virtually without a struggle by the agrarians and the clan of industrialists (if, indeed, the elections take place at all). Judging from how very carefully the card game of solitaire for the election districts has been laid out from the "left-wingers," it has become understood that these elections are being directed from a single center. This center is, without a doubt, the headquarters staff of the "party of industrialists"--the gigantic Motor-Sich Aircraft Engine Plant, which is headed up by General Director V'yacheslav Bohuslayev, who is also president of the Inter-Regional Association of Industrialists. This association combines the industrial structures of seven oblasts in the southern and eastern portions of Ukraine. It claims the status of an independent organization, although--at the same time--it is contriving to join up with the Ukrainian Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. It is interesting that the largest party organization in Zaporizhzhya--the Labor Party--which was created, incidentally, by the above-mentioned Inter-Regional Association of Industrialists--put up only four persons as candidates. This party's leaders have taken a different path. Taking note of the fact that Zaporyzhzhyans have traditionally leaned toward communists and socialists and that the Labor Party is little known by the "work collective," they have recruited a large number of recent party organizers from various enterprises. Zaporizhzhya is probably the weakest link in the Inter-Regional Bloc for Reforms. Leonid Kuchma is regarded quite coolly here, especially because he chose Volodymyr Hrynyov as an ally. Furthermore, the Zaporizhzhyan industrialists have their own influential leader--the above-mentioned director of Motor-Sich, Bohuslayev, who has laid claim to primacy throughout the entire southern region of Ukraine. As we have learned from the corridors of political power, after Fokin's resignation, Bohuslayev's name--along with that of Kuchma--was prominent in the lists of contenders for the position of prime minister. With regard to Volodymyr Hrynyov, he is an extremely unpopular person in Zaporizhzhya--regardless of the fact that this oblast is a Russian-speaking one, i.e., with quite a high percentage of ethnic Russians. It is noteworthy that, when he ran for the office of president, Hrynyov garnered less than 1.5 percent of the votes. He is not supported either by the Zaporizhzhyan entrepreneurs or by the industrialists. Volodymyr Hrynyov intends to rely on the president of the Zaporizhzhyan Commodity Exchange, Kalika, although it seems the he does not have very much support from that quarter either. The national-democratic parties have virtually no chances in Zaporizhzhya. They lack any dazzling, charismatic leaders. The overwhelming majority of them live by old slogans, which are quaint and ridiculous in the environment where the average Zaporizhzhyan citizen lives. If in the Kam'yansko-Dniprovskyy Rayon victory is gained by the candidate from Energodar--the site of the Zaporyzhzhyan nuclear specialists, in the Komunarskyy Rayon of the oblast center--by the Zaporizhzhyan capitalist, Petro Saboshuk, and in the Leninskyy Rayon of Zaporizhzhya--by the leader of the parliamentary faction of the PDVU [Party for the Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine], Ukrainian People's Deputy Serhiy Sobolev, then it can be considered that the national-democrats will have succeeded in gaining 3 out of the 18 seats involved here. The remainder of the "travel passes" to the Supreme Council will be divided up approximately equally among the "party of the state directors" and the agrarians. By the way, that is also the present-day composition of the Zaporizhzhyan body of deputies.
