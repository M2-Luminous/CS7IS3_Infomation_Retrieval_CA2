However, the government is in trouble due to differences of opinion between government offices. As a result of a series of recent policy meetings, the government made a rough decision to present to the United States our initial proposal for a package solution that includes the ROK's promise to lower tariffs at the minimum level and to improve related systems. However, it is undergoing difficulties in mapping out a final draft for the solution to the issue since government offices, such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance, failed to narrow differences of opinion on the scope of tariff reduction and on the necessity of lowering domestic duties. A Foreign Ministry official said on 13 June: "As the scheduled 24 June Washington meeting of the ROK-U.S. Economic Council headed by both countries' deputy foreign ministers draws near, related government offices held discussions on measures for it, such as lowering tariffs and domestic duties. However, they have only agreed to the necessity of a small-scale tariff reduction and the improvement of related system and failed to prepare concrete measures." This official also said: "It is inevitable for us to show a sincere attitude by making some concessions in the upcoming Economic Council meeting because the United States considers the car import issue as a pending core trade issue between the ROK and the United States, and because of the serious imbalance between the ROK's car exports to the United States and U.S. car exports to the ROK." The official said that the Foreign Ministry, as the office in charge of negotiations, is in trouble since, as the Ministry of Finance noted, it is in fact impossible to simply change the system of domestic duties -- such as special excise tax, acquisition tax, and education tax. He added: "I am very much concerned about the possibility that, if we do not propose satisfactory compromise terms in the upcoming meeting, the United States will use it as a ruse for invoking the Super 301 provision, regarding the ROK's attitudes toward the car import issue and the sausage clearance issue as unfair trade practices.
