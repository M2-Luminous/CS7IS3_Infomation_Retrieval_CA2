Around 84 percent of all the profit in the oblast was earned by industrial enterprises and transport organizations. The higher profits in these branches were mainly due to higher wholesale and retail prices. The majority of industrial enterprises and agricultural, transport, and construction organizations are experiencing financial difficulties. This is attested to by data on the status of mutual settlements between the buyers and producers of goods. Overdue payments on incurred debts (or nonpayments) increased by 586.2 billion rubles (or 42 percent) in November 1993, and nonpayments on credit debts increased by 482.1 billion rubles (36 percent). (Incurred debts are all of the debts owed to enterprises--Ed.) Almost one out of every two enterprises was unable to pay its debts to creditors on time. Financial conditions are particularly unsatisfactory at the Otdelochnik-20 and Sibkomplektavtotrans joint-stock companies of the closed type, the Tobolsk Meat Combine, the Surgut Municipal Dairy, the Gydansk Fish Plant, the Vagay Joint Timber Association, the Feniks joint-stock company, the Mir Sovkhoz, and the Sibir Kolkhoz. There were no overdue payments on credit debt in the Kogalymtruboprovodstroy Trust, the Ishim Reinforced Concrete Products Plant, the Surgut Meat Processing Combine, the Tyumenskiy Dom Khleba open joint-stock company, the Akva joint-stock company, the Pyshminskoye closed joint-stock company, and the Marma Oil Company. Enterprises in the petroleum refining industry now owe the budget 567.2 billion rubles, or 80 percent of all nonpayments to the budget in the oblast. Overdue payments to the budget amount to 127.3 billion rubles for the Yuganskneftegaz joint-stock company, 79.2 billion for Langepasneftegaz, 62.4 billion for Kondpetroleum, and 43 billion for the Noyabrskneftegaz Production Association. Oblast enterprises applied for bank credit and loans to supplement their financial resources. Their total debt amounted to 341.6 billion rubles (including 19.3 billion in overdue payments). This figure is lower than the figure for 1 November 1993. Deposits in State Bank branches in the oblast from savings banks in 1993 were 24.4 times as high as the 1992 figure, receipts from rail, air, and water transport were 20.6 times as high, the receipts of enterprises of the Ministry of Railways were 15.9 times as high, local transport receipts were 6.8 times as high, and the receipts of consumer service enterprises were 9.6 times as high. The rate of increase in receipts in the oblast was slightly lower in January-December. The amount of money put into circulation in the oblast was 2.0721 trillion rubles. This was 11 times as high as last year's figure.
