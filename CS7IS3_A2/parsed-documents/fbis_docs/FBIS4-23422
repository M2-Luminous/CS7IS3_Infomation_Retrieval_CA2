The money will be used to pay off its debt, because at this stage the debt is "quite large," the party's senior officials disclosed. Among the most sought after properties which could come under the hammer are a six-bedroom house in Washington worth about 50 million U.S. dollars; as well as a farm in Zambia with an estimated value of 1 million dollars. At the current exchange rate the farm is worth about 3.6 million rands. The ANC said the total value of its properties abroad is estimated at about 20 million rands. The proceeds from the sale of the ANC's properties will apparently not be enough to pay off all the organization's debts. The election has cost the ANC a lot of money. Before the start of the campaign there had been the cost to establish an infrastructure in South Africa while the organization was in exile for several decades. Debt Burden Relief No doubt the money to come in from the property transactions will contribute toward making the ANC's debt burden lighter. To further supplement the organization's coffers, it was announced this week that MPs elected under the ANC's banner will have to make a contribution toward the coffers. This includes President Mandela, ministers, deputy ministers, and senators. Amounts of between 750 rands for an ordinary member and 2,000 rands per month for a minister have been mentioned. ANC Treasurer General Thomas Nkobi, Administrative Secretary Henry Makgothi, and Deputy Administrative Secretary Mohamed Moosajee spoke to RAPPORT about the organization's financial matters. They said it is not true that the ANC had bags full of money as so many people seem to believe. It is no longer a liberation movement and can therefore no longer depend on funds from abroad. From now on the ANC is to be run along business lines, and it is to become financially self-sufficient. Offices Rented Another possibility being considered is to rent out ANC office space at the ANC headquarters, 51 Plein Street in Johannesburg. The ANC's impressive property portfolio abroad has in the past attracted attention. Before the legitimization of the ANC the property had not only been an investment but a necessity as well. The organization was being run from abroad and for that it needed space. This need has now largely fallen away, and property which is not going to be sold will most likely be rented out. The first step toward getting rid of the properties began this week. On Tuesday ANC offices were already being closed down. Due to administrative reasons, it will take a while before all the offices are closed as various administrative procedures still have to be concluded. The ANC's office in Washington was one of the first to close its doors. Among the properties in question are two houses in the U.S. with a total value of 83,000 dollars, five premises in London with offices and houses with an estimated value of 2.7 million rands; a house in Australia valued at 805,000 rands; and houses in Germany, Sweden, and Belgium. Also in the neighboring states the ANC has built up a strong property portfolio. Especially in Zambia, where its headquarters was situated before the organization was unbanned, it has property, among others the farm, a block of flats with 30 apartments, and two offices measuring 1,500 and 800 square meters, respectively. In Zimbabwe the ANC has offices and 39 houses with an estimated value of 4.5 million rands. Mr. Nkobi said a new company is to be created to see to the properties.
