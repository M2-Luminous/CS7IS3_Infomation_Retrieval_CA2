("IHI") consists of aircraft engines and ships. Although the company's business has grown to the current level keeping pace with the equipment expansion of the Defense Agency, it is now facing the worldwide arms reduction and the national defense budget cut as a result thereof. Therefore, the company is hurrying to shift its focus from the defense-related business to commercial targets in the aircraft engine business, while, in the defense ship business, desperately seeking a prescription for its survival amidst the volatile demands. Since the Japanese defense industry has no means of exporting its products, the Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program is its lifeline. The original budget for the front-line equipment in the Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program for FY91-95 was about ¥5 trillion, a reduction of 2.3% from the actual spending during the previous term. This figure was further reduced to about ¥4.44 trillion due to the financial reasons of the government and various overseas situations. One thing that is surely to be affected, as a result, is their defense ship business. Eight ships originally planned to be built under the Mid-Term Program is now reduced to six. Two have already been ordered, where IHI got the contract to build one of them. Of the four more ships to be ordered, two are expected to be ordered in FY94 and the remaining two will be ordered in FY95. The order IHI received for the hull is said to be about ¥28 billion, and is a substantial chunk of business for the IHI's Ship and Ocean Division whose total sales was ¥130.2 billion in the year ended in March 1993. Since "the outlook for the next Mid-Term Program is not particularly bright," according to an IHI source, they must be wanting to secure an order of one ship each for the next two years as soon as possible. The difficulty with the defense ship building business is that the company has to maintain a certain number of professional engineers all the time regardless of whether they have orders or not. While the hull and general equipment can be manufactured with the help of commercial ship engineers, "there is absolutely no way to use the stand-ins on the weapon system," says Yoshito Igarashi, General Manager of Defense Ship Division. The Tokyo No. 1 Plant (Kohtoh-ku, Tokyo), the core of its defense ship production, has 750 employees including 150 engineers. When it had absolutely no orders during FY87-FY90, "We couldn't just tell them to cut grass in the plant to kill time. We had to keep our engineers by letting them study for building large ships in the next time around, or work on repairs of defense ships, or sending them abroad for advanced studies," says Mr. Igarashi. There is no question the company paid a fortune for this. Therefore, the plant finally began to take in works for building commercial ships including a 35,000 ton class tanker and a 20,000 ton class ferry boat when they didn't have defense ship building jobs. This was done just to "keep the building berth occupied." On the other hand, about 70% of the total annual sales, ¥132,792 million (for the year ended March 1992), of the Aerospace Division comes from the defense-related business, consisting mainly of the manufacturing and repairs of the fighters and trainers engines for the Self-Defense Forces. Noting this critical situation that "the defense demands are already showing declines at the incoming order level" (Mototsugu Ito, Assistant General Manager of the Aerospace Division), they are currently planning to change the defense/commercial business ratio to 50/50, and increase the annual sales to ¥200 billion. The key item in the scheme for expanding commercial sales is the gas turbine engine for electric power generation, a product based on the conversion of aircraft engines, for which they have a high hope of "reaching ¥80-85 billion sales in the year 2000." During the months of February to July this year, 20-30 engineers were added to the gas turbine design group, while adding about 20 to the sales department as well. Their target is "South-East Asia where a good demand should exist for power stations and co-generation facilities, because of their chronic shortage of electricity (Mr. Ito)." However, it is still uncertain how the domestic demand will be affected by the lingering depression. Although they are working on several medium to small co-generation projects at the moment, order issuing is often delayed. In addition to gas turbine applications, they are also trying to develop a market for commercial aircraft engines as a means of expanding commercial sales, but the problem there is "the tough cost competition that deteriorates profitability (Mr. Ito)." The difficulty of the defense industry is that once you pull out, it will be almost impossible to rejoin the business. Since they are well aware that "the defense business takes a lot of time to nurture; once you destroy it, it is almost impossible to restore it (Mr. Igarashi)," the biggest challenge for them is how to preserve their engineering capability.
