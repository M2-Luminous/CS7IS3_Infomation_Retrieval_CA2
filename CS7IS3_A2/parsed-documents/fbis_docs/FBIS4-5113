In addition, Korean Air [KAL] and Asiana will increase flights between Seoul and Singapore to 14 times and five times a week, respectively, from mid-April. KAL will expand service between Seoul and Manila to four times a week in mid-April and Asiana will begin flying the route three times weekly in mid-May. Korean Air's service on the Seoul-Moscow-Amsterdam route will be divided into Seoul-Moscow and Seoul-Amsterdam routes in May. The Transportation Ministry asked the two national carriers to cooperate in selling tickets and carrying passengers on the Seoul-Manila route to avoid excess competition, but the two airlines refused and will fly the route separately. Korean Air and Asiana will begin working-level contacts on allowing passengers to use both airlines' tickets on domestic routes and cooperating in carrying international travelers.
