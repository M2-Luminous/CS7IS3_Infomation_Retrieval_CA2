FR940912-0-00056 FR940912-0-00010 24.16(b)(16)_Definition of ``Regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'' Comment: Regarding the definition of ``regularly-scheduled administrative workweek'', the following sentence should be added, ``This section is not meant to prohibit consideration of alternative work schedules at a local level'' to reflect the provisions of 5 CFR 610.121 and Article 21, Section 3A of the National Agreement between Customs and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU). Customs Response: The pay reform provisions of the 1993 Act do not affect or otherwise address the question of alternate work schedules (AWS), which has a separate statutory basis. See, 5 U.S.C. 6120 et seq. We believe that the addition of the requested sentence is unnecessary. Accordingly, no change to §24.16(b)(16) is made. 24.16(d)_``Work assignment priorities''/(annuity integrity) Comment: The NTEU objects to the inclusion of work assignment priorities provisions in the regulations (§24.16(d)), as these issues are negotiable under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act. Especially objectionable is the inclusion of the overtime earnings ``band'' in §24.16(d)(2). Response: Customs agrees that the inclusion of the equalization provision in the work assignment priorities may be overbroad as written and could be subject to negotiations under the terms of the Civil Service Reform Act; however, Customs believes that the other two principles (alignment and least cost) are properly contained in the regulations, as they are in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(1), which require the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate such regulations as will prevent the abuse of callback work assignments and commuting time compensation. Accordingly, §24.16(d) is revised by deleting the equalization principle and replacing it with a more restricted ``annuity integrity'' principle that is more in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(2), which requires the Secretary to promulgate such regulations as will prevent the disproportionately more frequent assignment of overtime work to Customs Officers who are near to their retirement. Annuity integrity is based on the average yearly amount of overtime Customs Officers worked during their career with Customs. Under annuity integrity the amount of overtime that can be worked by a Customs Officer who is within 3 years of his/her statutory retirement eligibility, see, 5 U.S.C. chapters 83 or 84, is limited to the average yearly number of overtime hours the Customs Officer worked during his/her career with the Customs Service. If the dollar value of the average yearly number of overtime hours worked by such Customs Officer exceeds 50 percent of the applicable statutory pay cap, then no overtime earning limitation based on this annuity integrity provision would apply. Waivers concerning this annuity integrity limitation may be granted by the Commissioner of Customs or the Commissioner's designee in individual cases in order to prevent excessive costs or to meet emergency requirements of Customs. Customs believes that this principle of annuity integrity is in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 267(d)(2) and, as such, properly belongs in the regulations. 24.16(e)(2)(ii)_Including workers compensation benefits in list of payment categories for work not performed Comment: The NTEU requests the inclusion of workers compensation benefits to the listing of categories for which Customs Officers may receive payment for work that is not performed. Customs Response: Unlike the form of workers compensation enumerated in this section (continuation of pay under the workers compensation law, which is paid by the employing agency), workers compensation benefits_in the form of compensation for lost wages_are paid by the Department of Labor. See, 5 U.S.C. 8101 and 20 CFR part 10. As this latter form of workers compensation is not within the direct control of the Secretary of the Treasury, its inclusion at §24.16(e)(2)(ii) would be inappropriate. Accordingly, no change to §24.16(e)(2)(ii) is made.
