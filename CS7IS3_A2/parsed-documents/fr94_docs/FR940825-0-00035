FR940825-0-00035 FR940825-0-00009 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;05&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9017; AD 94&hyph;18&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives; Univair Aircraft Corporation Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to Univair Aircraft Corporation (Univair) Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes. This action requires installing inspection openings in the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion, and repairing any corrosion found. Several reports of corrosion in the outer wing panels of the affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent wing structural damage, that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure. DATES: Effective October 7, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Univair Aircraft Corporation, 2500 Himalaya Road, Aurora, Colorado 80011; telephone (303) 375&hyph;8882; facsimile (303) 375&hyph;8888. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Roger P. Chudy, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, Denver Aircraft Certification Field Office, 5440 Roslyn Street, suite 133, Denver, Colorado 80216; telephone (303) 286&hyph;5684; facsimile (303) 286&hyph;5689. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain Univair Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on April 12, 1994 (59 FR 17288). The action proposed to require installing inspection openings in the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion, and repairing any corrosion found. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Univair Service Bulletin (SB) No. 29, dated January 27, 1994. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the three comments received from one commenter. The commenter states that installing inspection openings forward of the main spar constitutes a major change to the aircraft wing airfoil that would affect stall/spin characteristics, and requests the FAA delete these particular inspection openings from the AD. The FAA does not concur. The analysis accomplished by the Univair Aircraft Company in developing the service bulletin shows that the 15 percent chord placement of the inspection openings on the bottom wing surface is in a positive pressure zone well aft of the travel range of the forward stagnation point throughout the flight envelope. In addition, the FAA has not received any service difficulty reports or adverse comments from any of the affected airplane operators that have installed these inspection openings. The AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. This same commenter believes that 16 inspection openings is excessive and that a accurate appraisal of corrosion can be made with just the inspection openings aft of the main spar. The commenter recommends deleting the requirement for installing inspection openings forward of the main spar. The FAA does not concur. Corrosion in a wing is not necessarily a widespread condition. Corrosion may occur as a localized effect (example: corrosion induced by rodent urine) forward of the main spar and may not be visible through the aft openings until a critical deterioration has occurred. The FAA has examined the analysis of the Univair Aircraft Corporation and has determined that the number and placement of the inspection openings on an outer wing panel was developed carefully, accurately, and provides the proper assurance that corrosion can be adequately detected before structural deterioration. The AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.
