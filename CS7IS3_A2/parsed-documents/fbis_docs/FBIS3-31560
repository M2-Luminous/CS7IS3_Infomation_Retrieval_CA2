[Begin Koljevic recording] It is important that it is five to twelve. The turning point happened at the last moment, the moment after which there can be no other turning point. I think that this is a great success for the Russian diplomacy, and, I would add, a great success in recognizing what the Serbs have been committed to from the start. This is not an issue of the siege of Sarajevo, but an issue of defense, of two sides, of the strategic balance between the Serb artillery and the Muslim infantry. The Russian initiative has solved that problem. The arrival of Russian units will enable the withdrawal of the Serb artillery that will not endanger the safety of the Serbs around Sarajevo. The only danger now, in my opinion, is that in the coming days of the so-called ultimatum, there might be provocations and incidents. The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] is obliged to prevent any misinterpretation of such incidents, incidents that can be expected. Finally, the regular UNPROFOR reports can be enough to prevent such attempts by the Muslims. [end recording] [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] Mr. Koljevic, we understand that you are saying that further developments depend on the behavior of the Muslim side and, of course, its western allies that support it. [end recording] [Begin Koljevic recording] Of course, of course, particularly because the Serbian side has been cooperative to the maximum and, I would add, now it is protected, after the Russian initiative there is no more concern about the disruption of the strategic balance. It is known from the UN Charter that the basic thing in all peace operations is that no side can profit during the peace process. That would compromise the United Nations very much, and that is what UNPROFOR fears the most. We hope that this will have a considerable effect on overcoming this crisis, this need of theirs, that no side should benefit from this. [end recording]
