Sources from the Tianjin Municipal Land Administration said that more than 800 square kilometers of virgin land, mostly with saline- alkali soil, is scattered outside the urban areas of the city. Most of them, near the city proper and convenient for transportation, have a large development potential. Experts say it is rare for such a large industrial city as Tianjin, about two hours drive from Beijing, to have so much waste land. However, some of the land is now being utilized. In the Dagang District, a petrochemical zone, a chemical plant to manufacture 140,000 tons of ethylene annually is being built within an expanse of 120 square kilometers of waste land. Another project to produce 200,000 tons of polyester will also be built there. Another 200-square-kilometer piece of land, along a major highway leading to northeast China, rich in water supply and near the urban area, will become another industrial zone for the city. In addition, a third tract of about two ha. [hectares] of waste land will be used to grow vegetables and to raise livestock. Some other areas will be developed for tourism. Mu Xueming, deputy chief engineer at the Tianjin Municipal Planning and Design Bureau, said that the waste land will provide an important site for the development of Tianjin and Beijing as well. "While Beijing will become China's political and cultural center, Tianjin, which is only 137 kilometers away, will be turned into an economic center in northern China, and the large amount of virgin land makes it possible to do civil construction and to expand industries," he said. XINHUA has learned that over the next ten years Tianjin plans to build, within some 350 square kilometers of land, a new city and an economic zone involving the metallurgical sector, the chemical industry and commerce, finance and tourism.
