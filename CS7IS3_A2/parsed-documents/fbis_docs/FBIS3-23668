In responding to the question of Russia's claims to a special role in the post-Union territory, Konstantin Morozov declared that Moscow has no basis for this and, moreover, without the sanction of the UN cannot perform the role of peacemaker utilizing its armed forces. In the words of Konstantin Morozov, the military conflict in the Dniester Region arose largely precisely because of the presence of the 14th Russian Army there and "they drew Georgia into the CIS because of a military conflict." Konstantin Morozov declared that he supports the demand for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from foreign territories and that in his possible action as a deputy he will never allow Ukrainian forces to participate in operations in hot spots without UN permission. And in general, with respect to the resolution of the delicate problems in interrelations between former allied republics, Konstantin Morozov called on everyone to "get used to the fact that there is no longer a territory of the former USSR and there is no young, sovereign, or some other Ukraine, but simply the independent state Ukraine." Konstantin Morozov said that he supports Ukraine's signing the Lisbon Protocol to the START-1 Treaty because this would allow it, along with Russia, to be a full participant in the world process of nuclear disarmament and to be a country responsible for destroying its share of nuclear weapons. The only mistake of the Ukrainian leadership, in the words of the general, is the fact that it did not define the new status of Ukraine, with which it must join the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Treaty. In his opinion, Ukraine must join with a special declaration of its support of the idea of the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons on the planet and the control of their transfer to third countries, and it must define its status as a "temporary nuclear state that is reducing its share of nuclear weapons from the former USSR." In this connection, Konstantin Morozov spoke out in favor of the establishment of an international commission to monitor the dismantling of the nuclear weapons removed from Ukraine, because "Ukraine really does not have full assurance that the missiles will be destroyed rather than redistributed." The former minister of defense also made a number of other comments differing from the point of view of official Kiev. In particular, he criticized the trilateral Moscow declaration, calling it a "naked declaration that does not even guarantee the political interests of Ukraine." In the opinion of Morozov, it is necessary to sign a trilateral agreement that would be subject to ratification in the parliaments of the three countries and that would provide for international control of its fulfillment by them. It should be noted that this is perhaps the most widespread point of view in Ukraine, which finds a large number of supporters in different political and military circles. Touching on the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Konstantin Morozov stated that he supports any solution of the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, whether it be a gift, a transfer to Russia, or division and destruction, but under one mandatory condition -- the removal of the Fleet and its infrastructure from Ukrainian territory. In his opinion, the most advantageous solution for Ukraine is the 1992 Yalta agreement on the division of the Black Sea Fleet into Ukrainian and Russian parts and the establishment of naval forces of Ukraine and Russia on this basis. At the same time, Konstantin Morozov declared that the military forces of Ukraine are adequate to resolve the problem of the Black Sea Fleet in favor of Ukraine, but "these forces must not be the basic argument; rather it is necessary to seek political solutions for every question." Konstantin Morozov also said that he supported a political solution with respect to the Crimean problem, which he called artificial and produced by the political passivity of official Kiev. In the opinion of Morozov, Kiev must pass laws that would first stabilize the situation in the Crimea and then would make Crimean legislation correspond to that of Ukraine.
