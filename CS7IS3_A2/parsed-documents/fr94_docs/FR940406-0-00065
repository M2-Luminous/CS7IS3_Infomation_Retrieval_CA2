FR940406-0-00065 FR940406-0-00005 The Department of Defense has determined that this interim rule is not a significant regulatory action, as defined by Executive Order 12866. The rule does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. It provides for transfer of paid-for federal installations no longer needed for economic development purposes. This will benefit the economy and the communities in which the closing bases are located. (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12886. It has been certified that this interim final rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because the interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary effect of the interim final rule will be to reduce the burden on local communities of the Government's property disposal process at closing military installations and to accelerate the economic recovery of the relatively small number of communities that will be affected by the closure of nearby military installations. The rule is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act because it imposes no obligatory information requirements beyond internal DoD use.
