Thai Narcotics Suppression Bureau chief Kowit Phuphanit said yesterday Nigerian police had seized 259 kilos of heroin after a tipoff by Thai officials. The heroin was seized on December 30 in a joint effort by Thai, Nigerian and British police as well as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), he said. In four separate swoops in Bangkok in December, Thai officials found 166.65 kilos of heroin and arrested six Nigerians and one Thai woman, he said. A Nigerian drug dealer, Joe Brown believed to be the boss of a drug smuggling ring, was arrested in Nigeria on December 17, Kowit said. The December 30 raid in Nigeria followed the discovery by Thai police that heroin had been shipped from Bangkok to Lagos. Thai police got the information after they raided an apartment rented by a Nigerian in the Pratunam area on December 7. Seven kilos of heroin were found in the raid. The December 7 operation also led to the arrest a week later of two Nigerians, the seizure of another 37 kilos of heroin and the discovery that a man identified as Joe Brown was a key figure in the ring. Thai police subsequently contacted the Nigerian authorities who later arrested the man. Another Nigerian was arrested in Thailand on December 22 with 25 kilos of heroin hidden in a water cooler to be sent to Lagos. Two days later three more suspects were arrested with 97 kilos of heroin also hidden in water coolers.
