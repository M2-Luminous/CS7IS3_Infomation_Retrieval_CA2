FR940630-2-00129 FR940630-2-00099 [Docket 70&hyph;143; License SNM&hyph;124] Confirmatory Order Modifying License (Effective Immediately) I In the Matter of: Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc., Erwin, Tennessee. Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (NFS), located at Erwin, Tennessee, is the holder of License SNM&hyph;124 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to 10 CFR Part 70. The license authorizes the licensee to receive, possess, use, and transfer special nuclear material under the conditions specified in the license. The license was originally issued on September 18, 1957, and was last renewed on June 9, 1992. II During the course of licensed activities and until June 28, 1981, when on-site burial of waste contaminated with special nuclear material was no longer permitted by former 10 CFR 20.304, NFS buried certain wastes contaminated with special nuclear material, such as specific process wastes, contaminated equipment, and other like debris, in an area on the licensee's premises now designated as ``Pond 4.'' Pond 4 has also been designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as Solid Waste Management Units 2, 4, and 6, and is subject to the requirements for remediation and management for ground water protection of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 USC ยง6901&hyph;6986. In order to comply with the decommissioning requirements of the Commission, NFS must ultimately decontaminate the above identified areas used for waste management and disposal to a level suitable for release of the property for unrestricted use. 10 CFR 70.38. To do so requires the removal or reduction of the special nuclear material present, either in its discrete form or as part of other materials present. III In order to comply with requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regarding solid waste management, and with NRC decontamination and decommissioning requirements, the licensee proposes to engage in a program of remediation of the Pond 4 area, as detailed in its ``Decommissioning/Interim Measures Workplan for the Pond 4 Area, Solid Waste Management, Units 2, 4, and 6'' (Interim Workplan). Although the licensee believes that its license already contains adequate authority to carry out Phase I source removal of the decontamination and decommissioning activities outlined in the Interim Workplan for Pond 4 and other areas, the staff of the NRC has concluded that the decontamination and decommissioning activities proposed represent a significant change from past practices so as to require additional license conditions to assure protection of the health and safety of the public, workers, and the environment from unexpected radiological conditions resulting from the material excavated, stored, and ultimately disposed of. In accordance with 10 CFR 70.38(c)(2)(i)(A)&hyph;(D), the licensee is required to submit a decommissioning plan for approval by the NRC prior to undertaking decommissioning work, which poses potential health and safety impacts, if procedures would involve techniques not applied routinely during cleanup or maintenance operations; or if workers would be entering areas not normally occupied where surface contamination and radiation levels are significantly higher than routinely encountered during operation; or if procedures could result in significantly greater airborne concentrations of radioactive materials than are present during operation; or if procedures could result in significantly greater release of radioactive material to the environment than those associated with operation. Pursuant to Clause H.015 of the NFS/U.S. DOE contract DE&hyph;A&hyph;C12&hyph;90 SN 39106 incorporated into NFS license Chapter 7, the United States Deepartment of Energy (DOE) is responsible for providing funds to decommission and decontaminate Pond 4 and other areas covered by the Interim Workplan. DOE has established funding to recognize and support the immediate commencement of the decontamination and decommissioning of Pond 4 and other areas subject to the Interim Workplan and as directed by this Order. NFS has kept DOE, EPA, and the State of Tennessee informed of the schedule for commencement of decontamination and decommissioning activities under the Interim Workplan. Decontamination and decommissioning activities proposed by the Interim Workplan will involve techniques not applied routinely during operation, cleanup, or maintenance operations, in that bulk soil and waste material excavation will take place using heavy equipment in an enclosed structure. Additionally, procedures used in the excavation and processing of contaminated soils and debris will result in the material becoming highly disturbed and thereby creating a potential for release of radioactivity to the environment through liquid and gaseous effluents, and a greater potential for exposure of workers though inhalation of airborne radioactivity, than that associated with operation. The currently scheduled date for commencement of those activities is June 23, 1994. Therefore, the Commission finds that the public health, safety, and interest requires that the NFS license be further conditioned and modified with special conditions to protect the health and safety of workers and public in the performance of the decontamination and decommissioning of the Pond 4 area of the NFS site, with respect to activities proposed by the Interim Workplan. The licensee has consented to these conditions and modification of the license by issuance of this Order.
