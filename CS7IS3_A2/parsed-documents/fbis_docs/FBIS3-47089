The meeting was attended by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, and two other North Korean diplomats and by inspectors at IAEA Headquarters. The meeting lasted for two hours from 4 in the afternoon, it said. "There had been the working-level contact (between North Korea and the IAEA) on problems related to inspection of North Korea's reported nuclear facilities," IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said. "The two sides agreed to continue their contact early next week." It has been reported that the two sides agreed in principle that they will resolve problems related to inspection activities through negotiation. Sources said the North Korean officials conveyed Pyongyang's official position but the two sides could not reach any agreement on the scope and number of inspections or on the size of the inspection team and date of its visit to North Korea. One North Korean official described Friday's meeting as "very productive," however, and said that there are some items left for further discussion and the two sides have decided to solve the problems, according to an IAEA official.
