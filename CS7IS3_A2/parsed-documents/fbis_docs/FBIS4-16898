The first bank to fail -- the "Siberian Development Bank" -- has been on its last legs for more than a year. This led to a change of management and the attraction of considerable amounts of funds to rescue the situation. It did not help. Experts believe that the collapse was inevitable. The Novosibirsk management of "Mosbiznesbank" lent a hand to their bankrupt colleagues. But, naturally, not in the form of money. They offered staff from the failed bank jobs at their new branch. The second victim of competition and market conditions has been the "Novosibirsk Innovation Commercial Bank."
