According to the spokesman, "the technical solution of the non-payments problem is the prerogative of the government, but, since that question has grown into a political one, it has entered the competency of the president". Kostikov said Yeltsin's "memorandum should stimulate the process of economic reform". He explained that, in the same memorandum, the president "calls the attention of the lawmakers to the fact that they have been too slow in enacting laws in the economic sphere".
