FBIS4-51655 "dreas085__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-085-A Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Minister on Approving Rice Importing Firms Minister on Approving Rice Importing Firms OW0305041294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 26 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 5--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0305041294 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Eijiro Hata [now Minister of International Trade and Industry] disclosed in an interview on 25 April that, as a result of agreeing to minimum access for rice imports, the ministry will accept applications for the registration of trading firms to engage in importing rice. However, it is difficult to understand the standards for approving the applications, because it is stipulated that the approval will be based on "experience and credibility" (as stated by a source at the Import Division of the ministry's Food Agency). With an increase in the quantity of rice imports, there is a great possibility that trade in rice will become a big business operation. In this connection, it is most likely that stronger requests will be made for revising the ambiguous standards for approval. Trading firms engaged in the rice or wheat business, importation of which is under the government's control, are designated by the Food Agency. At present, there are 20 registered trading firms engaged in rice trade, with 26 firms in wheat trade. Due to the need for emergency imports of a large quantity of rice, more than 10 trading firms applied for registration in March. However, since all the designated trading firms had already started the process of rice importation, applications for new registrations have been shelved. Among the requirements set by the Food Agency for applying for new registration are: the corporation must have capital of over 100 million yen [Y] and it must have experience in the rice trade in trilateral trade operations. Based on these conditions, "the decision on approval for registration has been made from the standpoint of experience and credibility" (as stated by Import Division Chief Kyuzo Saito). And he added that "no firms that have applied this time have met these requirements." Nevertheless, there is a strong complaint indicating that "it remains unclear as to how the examination was conducted and the decision was made" (as stated by small and medium-sized trading firms). Some of these trading firms did not even know that the agency was accepting applications. It is most certain that due to continuous imports of rice following the partial opening of the rice market, there will be a major change in the rice trading system. And to prepare for next year, the Food Agency will probably be forced to disclose the requirements for registration and also the process for making decisions on the approval.
