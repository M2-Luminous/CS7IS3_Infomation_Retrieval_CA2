A senior aid official who in the past had given a figure of 20,000, said he believed up to half a million people had died since the start of the current fighting at the beginning of April. Other reports say the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front, the RPF, has expressed support for the idea of a UN humanitarian force in Rwanda but says it should be smaller than the one proposed by the world body. The RPF said Rwanda's neighbors and any country that had backed the government in Kigali should be excluded from the force. The guerrilla group also stressed it will not abandon the strategic positions under its control.
