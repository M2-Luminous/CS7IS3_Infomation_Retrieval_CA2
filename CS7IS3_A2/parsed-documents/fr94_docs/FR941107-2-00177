On November 1, 1994, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs executed the following determination: On August 24, 1993, I determined that the Chinese Ministry of Aerospace Industry, to include China Precision Machinery Import/Export Corporation (CPMIEC), had engaged in missile technology proliferation activities that required the imposition of the sanctions described in Section 73(a)(2)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 279b(a)(2)(A)) and Section 11B(b)(1)(B)(i) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. app. 2410b(b)(1)(B)(i)). Accordingly, the required sanctions were imposed. Pursuant to section 73(e) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 22797b(e)) and section 11B(b)(5) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. app. 2401b(b)(5)), I hereby determine that it is essential to the national security of the United States to waive these sanctions with respect to the foreign person named above. This waiver shall take effect immediately, 20 working days having elapsed since my intention to waive these sanctions was notified to the Congress. The waiver shall remain in effect unless revoked. Signed: Lynn E. Davis, Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This waiver also applies to the divisions, subunits, and any successor entities of the Chinese Ministry of Aerospace Industry, to include China Precision Machinery Import/Export Corporation (CPMIEC). Such additional entities include, but are not limited to: China National Space Administration, China Aerospace Corporation, China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation, China Great Wall Industrial Corporation or Group, Chinese Academy of Space Technology, Beijing Wan Yuan Industry Corporation (a/k/a Wanyuan Company or China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology), China Haiying Company, Shanghai Astronautics Industry Bureau, and China Chang Feng Group (a/k/a China Changfeng Company).

In addition, U.S. government contracts related to MTCR Annex items no longer are prohibited with these entities. The waiver takes effect as of November 1, 1994, and shall remain in effect unless revoked.
