In recent days, Hong Kong and foreign press units carried reports saying that China has "detained more dissidents", and prepared a list of about a dozen people. Sources from the ministry said that only Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi are being investigated according to law by public and state security organs as they are suspected of being involved in unlawful acts in inciting turmoil and disrupting social order or in criminal cases. The rest of the people on the list, including Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, are not put under detention, the sources said. It is learned that Wei Jingsheng yesterday submitted an application to the Public Security Department to go out of Beijing for some private matter and his application has been approved.
