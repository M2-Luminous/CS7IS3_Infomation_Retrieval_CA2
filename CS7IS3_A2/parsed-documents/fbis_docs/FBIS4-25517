FBIS4-25517 "drchi112_v_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 TAIWAN Government Honors Indonesia's Habibie Government Honors Indonesia's Habibie OW1006103194 Taipei CNA in English 0833 GMT 10 Jun 94 OW1006103194 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, on behalf of the Republic of China [ROC] Government, decorated Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, Indonesia's state minister in charge of research and technology, with the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon Friday [10 June] in recognition of his contribution to promoting substantive ties between Taipei and Jakarta. The decoration ceremony was not open to the media because the Indonesian Government asked the ROC to keep Habibie's visit low profile in order not to irritate Beijing, with which Jakarta maintains diplomatic ties. After the ceremony, Chien and Habibie exchanged views on matters of mutual concern. Chien later gave a luncheon in honor of Habibie, an engineer-turned administrator. Habibie, heading a large group of Indonesian trade, technology and agriculture officials as well as business leaders, arrived in Taipei Thursday evening for a three-day visit. Habibie helped arrange president Li Teng-hui's itinerary in Indonesia when Li made a groundbreaking unofficial visit to the Southeast Asian nation in February. He accompanied Li to tour many Indonesian industrial and agricultural institutions. Habibie told local reporters that although he is not a member of the organizing committee for the 1994 summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, he will try his best to have Li invited to the meeting, slated for November in Jakarta. Nevertheless, Habibie said, he cannot at the moment predict whether Li will be able to attend the meeting. Because of Beijing's boycott, Li failed to attend the first-ever APEC leadership meeting held in Seattle last November. Both Taipei and Beijing are APEC members. Habibie, the chief architect of Indonesia's aerospace industry, said he will explore the possibility of Taipei-Jakarta cooperation in aerospace technology development during his stay here. "There is still ample room for our two countries to cooperate," the Indonesian minister noted. Habibie will leave Taiwan for Japan Saturday. Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, substantive relations between Taiwan and Indonesia have grown steadily in recent years. According to statistics released by the Indonesian Government, aggregate direct Taiwan investment in Indonesia reached US$8.68 billion at the end of April, making Taiwan the second largest foreign investor in that country after Japan.
