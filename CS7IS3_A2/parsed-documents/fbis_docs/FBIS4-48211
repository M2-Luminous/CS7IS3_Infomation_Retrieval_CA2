This came with the signing of the minutes of the meeting which is known as the Algiers meeting. The signing, supervised by the Algerian diplomacy, gives a fresh impetus to the Bamako agreement, and puts an end to the differences which for years prevented the carrying out of this agreement. Our colleague Bechir Hedibel attended the signing ceremony and sent us a report: [Begin Hedibel recording] [passage omitted] The agreement provides for the integration of all the Azawad fighters in the Malian Government organs: army, police, customs, and administration. A tripartite committee has been formed and put in charge of implementing this provision, and it will start work next month. The committee is composed of representatives of the Malian Government, the unified Azawad movements and fronts and the mediating state, i.e. Algeria. It has been agreed to integrate 1,500 fighters in the regular Malian Army, and 4,860 fighters in civil sectors, i.e. in the civil service. In the Algiers agreement, it has been agreed also to remove the military bases of the unified Azawad movements in northern Mali. In return, the northern population will benefit from development projects to break their isolation and integrate them in the regular administrative life of the state of Mali.
