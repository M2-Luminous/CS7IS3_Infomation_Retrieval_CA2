But politics is impeding economics, and that is why the principle chosen has been that there should be no abrupt moves and that an attempt should be made to improve the mechanisms for cooperating and resolving any disputes that arise. That was the main gist of the Council of Heads of State and Government session held in Moscow 15 April. While the heads of state were meeting behind closed doors at the Kremlin to sort out their political differences, the premiers met at the President Hotel to discuss primarily economic problems. Key among these are the formation of the structures of an economic alliance and the provision of the legal conditions for its functioning. In all there were around 30 points on this CIS leaders' "summit" agenda. But this impressive package of documents should not serve as a screen to hide the acute contradictions between Commonwealth members. These are rooted in the continuing problem of the redistribution of property and the fear on the part of certain leaders of being bound fast to the Commonwealth by means of compulsory decisions. The most noteworthy point in this respect is the conflict over the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the problems relating to the creation of a single economic area. The latest conflict in Odessa over the hydrographic vessel Cheleken, and the Ukrainian assault troops' strong-arm actions against Russian servicemen show that there are as yet no forcefully effective mechanisms for resolving disputes in the CIS and that politics prevails over economic expediency. The previous day the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers had talks on this issue, but did not reach agreement. Admittedly, A. Zlenko told IZVESTIYA's correspondent that "there is hope of neutralizing this source of tension. It may prove possible in Moscow to eradicate the nervousness in relations between Ukraine and Russia [no closing quotation marks as published]. According to unverified information, there should be a meeting in the Kremlin between B. Yeltsin and L. Kravchuk outside the framework of the general heads of state meeting. In turn, Russian Defense Minister P. Grachev also had talks with his Ukrainian colleague, but the result was the same. "It has not yet proved possible to reach an understanding on this issue," the minister said. "I see this as being a seizure by force. The fact that the subunits that were attacked were small in number and isolated on Ukrainian territory was exploited. I made a resolute protest about this. I am hoping for a meeting between the two presidents with the defense ministers' participation." As for the key problem (the single economic area), there too the principle is clear -- to cooperate but not to be compelled. On the eve of the opening of the summit it was decided at the insistence of the Turkmen delegation and, it is claimed, certain other countries to abandon the plan already agreed at expert level to set up an Interstate Economic Committee (IEC) and to create an Economic Community Commission. The difference is obvious -- the IEC presupposes the formation of a common trading regime binding on all, antimonopoly and customs regulation, the convergence of corresponding legislation, and the free movement of labor. The commission -- and it is being set up under the existing Coordination and Consultation Committee, is seen as an expert working organ which can only recommend similar decisions. Although V. Mashchits, leader of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation with the Commonwealth Member States, believes that the Heads of State Council or the Heads of Government Council could, if necessary, vest the commission with the right to make supranational decisions on specific issues. A more hopeful point in the relations among the CIS countries is the agreement on the free customs zone. This document presupposes the gradual abolition of duties, taxes, levies, and quantitative restrictions on trade, the creation of a system of mutual accounting and payments for trade operations, and other things. The sides reserve the right to implement state regulation only on issues relating to the arms trade or the trade in precious metals and stones or fissionable materials. The free customs zone agreement is seen as a transitional stage on the road to the creation of a customs union. At the time this newspaper was being put to bed the heads of government had signed all the documents that had been prepared. They supported proposals to replenish the peacekeeping troops in Tajikistan and to provide material support to Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] to remedy the consequences of its natural disaster, and they also heard information about the work of a group which has been studying the question of the creation by states in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia of formations to safeguard their borders.
