They protested against the accident involving U.S. military aircraft and called for suspension of flights over residential areas. It was an emergency rally designed to protest against an accident involving two FA-18 Hornets from Kadena Air Base [KAB] which flew into each other in a training area over the Pacific southeast of Okinawa on 17 December. About 60 people, including members of the labor union, attended the rally. They expressed their feelings by raising their fists at the KAB. At the rally, Yoshimasa Karimata, vice chairman of the Peace Center; Kazuo Senaga, vice chairman of the Central Region Labor Union; and Seiyu Nakamura, representative of the Joint Struggle Council Against Noise, made speeches at the rally. They stressed the need to promote daily struggle [nichijoteki na tatakai], saying: "We cannot sleep at night because a similar accident could happen over land. Danger is always involved in the military trainings." Moreover, after Akira Nakane, member of the prefectural assembly, and other representatives expressed their resolve, the rally adopted a "protest resolution to denounce the FA-18 aircraft accident and to call for immediate suspension of flights by U.S. military aircraft over residential areas." Copies of the resolution will be forwarded to the director of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, and other officials.
