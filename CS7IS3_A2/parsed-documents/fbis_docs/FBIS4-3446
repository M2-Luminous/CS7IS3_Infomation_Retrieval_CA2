The "Torch Plan", which was approved by the State Council in 1988, is now being implemented in the country's 120 high and new technology development zones, which have been set up either by local governments or the central government. According to officials from the State Commission of Science and Technology, the major technologies being developed in the high-tech development zones are new materials, biotechnology, electronics and information, integration of machinery and electricity, high- efficient new energies and energy-saving technology and environmental protection technology. Last year the country's high and new technology development zones had a total income of 57.3 billion yuan from their technology, industries and trade, while their exports reached 0.73 billion us dollars. Of the 10,000 high-tech enterprises, which employ 700,000 people in the development zones, 106 have an annual output value of more than 100 million yuan. In addition, foreign businesses and joint ventures in the high- tech development zones now number more than 4,000. For example, Beijing New Technology Industry Development and Experimental Zone, which was established six years ago, now has 112 high-tech firms each of whose total income from technology, industry and trade has reached 10 million yuan. In 1993, the total income of the development zone's technology, industry, and trade exceeded 10 billion yuan. Over 200 products from the zone were exported to more than 20 countries and regions, earning 70 million U.S. dollars. At the moment, a number of new enterprises with advanced technologies, scale-production, good potential market, and qualified employees are emerging and growing rapidly in China's high-tech development zones. Some high technologies, such as optical fibre communications and electronic information, have grown into major industries, the first in Wuhan and the latter in Beijing development zone. "To develop China's high-technology industry, we must chiefly rely on our own efforts and technology advantages while bringing the country's new and high technology products to the international market," said Huang Qitao, vice-minister of the State Commission of Science and Technology. Recently, the State Commission of Science and Technology, in cooperation with overseas financial organizations, set up "China torch plan new high technology industry investment foundation," which is expected to provide a fund of at least 120 million U.S. dollars. According to Huang, by the year 2000 the sales and exports of new and high technologies of China will account for about 15 percent of the country's GNP and its total exports respectively.
