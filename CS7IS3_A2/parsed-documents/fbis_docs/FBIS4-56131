A blueprint for tightening Army discipline would be ready by June 30, Baudys says in the statement. Fifty-six percent of offenses committed by ordinary soldiers break military codes, the statement reads, listing desertion, disregard of the leave deadline, bullying and non-observance of patrol and supervision duties as the most common violations. The overall state of society is the most powerful single factor influencing army discipline, Baudys says. Some blame lies with officers and staffs but it is mostly non-commissioned officers who have low standards of behavior and work, setting the privates a bad example and even inciting trouble. The standards of common soldiers worsen over the time served. The longer-serving soldiers have a negative attitude to service, Baudys says. Broad measures involving civilian consulting bodies will have to be adopted to stamp out bullying, the statement reads.
