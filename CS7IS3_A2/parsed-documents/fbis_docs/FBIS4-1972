Peng Yu, head of the Chinese delegation, was speaking at the third session of the preparatory committee for the International Conference on Population and Development, which opened here today. Peng said, only by promoting socio-economic development can the population problem be solved in a reasonable way. "Population policies and programs should be treated as an integral part of national socio-economic development strategies," Peng said. She pointed out that as the situation differs from country to country, the government of each country should set its own policies and objectives that reflect the best interests of the nation, local communities, the families and individuals. Governments are duty-bound to achieve their population goals through improving economic conditions and upgrading the quality of life for their people, Peng said, adding "family planning should be promoted without any forms of coercion." Peng also noted that it is of major importance to enhance women's status, protect their legal rights and interests, offer them with more opportunities for education, and encourage them to participate in the process of political and economic developments. The international conference on population and development will be held in Cairo, Egypt, from September 5 to 13.
