FOCUS learned this from Manfred Opel, defense policy expert of the Social Democratic Party of Germany Bundestag group. The price demanded for these planes could be deducted by Bonn from Moscow's considerable debt account, the former general says. Opel: "Otherwise we will never get the money back we lent them!" The offer by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev was received by the Finance Ministry two weeks ago and is currently being examined as to its profitability. If the deal goes through, the Bundeswehr, which is being torpedoed by Theo Waigel's red pen, will fly with a total of 224 "Fulcrum" planes. At the moment, 24 planes of this type -- 20 combat jets and four training planes -- out of the legacy of Honecker's National People's Army are being used. The further use of the second-hand jets from the East is sensible in the view of Opel and other security policy experts: "The extremely efficient MiG-29 can be used -- even though only as a transition solution -- as a substitute for the F-4F Phantom interceptor." The U.S. oldie will be finally taken out of service in 2002 despite expensive equipment. And the acquisition of its successor, the Eurofighter 2000, is still extremely uncertain. Insiders now ask themselves: Will the Russian combat plane, which was repeatedly discussed as an alternative to the Eurofighter after unification, now be able to win over the often disputed high-tech plane of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa)? After all, the unit price of Eurofighter 2000 is estimated at more than DM100 million. In addition, there are the costs for armament. Given 140 planned combat planes, this is an additional blow to the scarce funds of Bonn's national defense politicians.
