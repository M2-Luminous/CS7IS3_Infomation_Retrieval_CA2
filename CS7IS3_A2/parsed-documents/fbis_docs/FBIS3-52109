['Arafat] I would like to tell all Palestinian children, women, and men that Palestine is being resurrected anew as a beautiful homeland for each of our children, a free homeland for each of the Palestinian men. None of these men has abandoned sacrifice. Palestine now stands as a prosperous and fair hope for each of the Palestinian women who are protecting our existence, safeguarding our everlasting fire, maintaining the glowing spirit, and carrying the secret of eternal steadfastness. Palestine will be a homeland in which the children of Palestine, who are our new generals, will hoist the Palestinian flag on the land of Palestine, and on the walls, churches, and minarets of Jerusalem. It will be a homeland for free men who will create a free homeland and a new torch of light, hope, and faith. ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman: In a message to a U.S. Jewish leader, you said Israel wants to turn the Gaza Strip and Jericho area into an Indian reservation. Does this mean that the agreement, according to the Israeli viewpoint, cannot be accepted by the Palestinian people? In this case, what will be the alternative, or the path the Palestinian leadership will take, in order to meet the Palestinian people's demands? ['Arafat] It should be understood that we signed a peace [agreement] between the PLO and the State of Israel. Thus, Israel should honor its signature. I only demand an honest and precise implementation of what we signed. ['Amarah] What if implementation does not happen? ['Arafat] If you please, withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho means withdrawal, not redeployment. This should be understood by everyone everywhere. We will not live in a ghetto or in a bantustan. They should understand this matter. Therefore, we will never accept these conditions, which Rabin and others try to impose on the Palestinian people. I want to tell Rabin that he should honor what he signed, and that implementation should be accurate and literal. ['Amarah] What if this does not happen? ['Arafat] Let the world answer this question. This agreement was also signed by the Russian and U.S. cosponsors of the conference, under the supervision of President Clinton. The entire world witnessed the signing of this agreement. I want to tell Rabin: You can continue your occupation of our land for another period of time. However, Rabin should understand that he cannot at all impose on us injustice or humiliation. None of the children of Palestine will accept the humiliation they are trying to impose on us. They have been occupying our country for 45 years. They could continue to occupy it for 47, 48, or 50 years, but they will never be able to humiliate the Palestinian people. There is a powerful people in Palestine. This should be understood. I believe our children, whom I call the new generals, can confront this Israeli arrogance. ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman: President Mubarak is seeking to bridge the gaps separating the PLO and Israeli positions. How successful has he been? ['Arafat] Let me here thank my brother His Excellency the struggler President Muhammad Husni Mubarak for the considerable efforts he has been and is exerting in pursuit of a just and comprehensive peace in the region and to promote a faithful and accurate implementation of the accord. At the last round, convened by the Liaison Committee under Peres and my brother Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], my brother Egyptians did a fine job, with their foreign minister taking time off for this thing, and, instructed by President Mubarak, he did not spare himslef. I take this opportunity to thank them for their time and effort. ['Amarah] The delay in implementing the accord has apparently led to increased Palestinian opposition, even within the Fatah ranks. How do you feel about that? ['Arafat] Who said we mind opposition? I do not think a single Palestinian would allow me to agree to humiliating terms, against the wishes of the Palestinian people to set up a national authority on the first Palestinian territory, where a Palestinian flag will fly over the first Palestinian land to be liberated from occupation. I have no doubt that all Palestinian men, women, and children stand by me to defend the Palestinian people, dignity, and sanctities, most of all Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Palestine. Do you think I rule over sheep? ['Amarah] No. ['Arafat] I am responsible for free and mujahid strugglers, each of whom is entitled to his or her own opinion. Let me quote 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab [the second khalif after Prophet Muhammad]: Blessed be the person who has corrected 'Umar. ['Amarah] Rabin said that 13 December, on which Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho was to have started, is not a sacrosanct date. He now says the 13 April deadline for completing the Israeli withdrawal is not sacred, either. What do you think? ['Arafat] This says something about the Israelis. Are they men of their word? Do they honor the agreements to which they put their signatures? Let them be judged by the world. ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman, do you believe that the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva will help the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? Do you think this submit will activate the peace process in the Middle East, especially on the Syrian-Israeli track? ['Arafat] No doubt, this summit was arranged in such a way as to be a basic pillar for proceeding on the Syrian-Israeli track. Undoubtedly, this summit will facilitate movement on other tracks. I wish this summit meeting success, so we can actually proceed together in order to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region--peace that preserves the Arab nation's dignity, existence, and rights. ['Amarah] Israel and the Vatican yesterday signed an agreement which was described as historic. This agreement has ignored the Jerusalem issue. How do you evaluate this Israeli-Vatican agreement? ['Arafat] It does not (?mean) an agreement on Jerusalem simply because the Vatican is aware that Jerusalem is not an Israeli responsibility. Jerusalem is a Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, and Christian responsibility. ['Amarah] How do you view Israel's announcement that it is not in a hurry to implement the agreement? ['Arafat] Wind cannot shake a mountain. We are not shaken by a statement here and a statement there. Our steps are firm. ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman, can you address a message from Radio Monte Carlo to all the listeners and the steadfast people in the West Bank? ['Arafat] I would like to tell all the Palestinian children and women from the bottom of my heart and conscience that this new year is the year of resurrection. Palestine is resurrected, a national entity on the road to an independent state. It is the year of the harvest. After years of struggle and sacrifices, we are having our aims materialize on our national soil. In this month and in this year, the month of the nocturnal journey of the prophet to heaven, the month of the Palestinian revolution, the emergence of Fatah, the revolution of all the noble and free men in the Arab nation, this month and this year will witness the beginning of the new historical era for our people. This year will be the year of freedom for all our heroic detainees, the knights whose heroism built our historic achievement. To all our faithful martyrs, I say: Peace be on your chaste souls, our brothers, comrades, beloved ones, and leaders--Abu Jihad, Abu-Iyad, Abu-'Ali Iyad, Abu-al-Walid, Abu-al-Hawl, Majid Abu-Sharar, Abu-Yusuf, Kamal 'Adwan, Abu-Sabri, 'Abd-al-Fattah (Nur), Kamal Nasir, Ghassan Kanafani, Nazzal, and the many other leaders, cadres, and martyrs fighters who have continued the fight of al-Qassam, 'Abd-al-Qadir al-Husayni, and Hakam Salamah and other heroes who fell in defense of Palestine and Jerusalem. I tell them: The clock has chimed: Victory for us and freedom for Palestine. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, and we wished to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to make them leaders in faith, and make them heirs and to establish a firm place for them in the land. And those who strive in our cause, we will certainly guide them to our paths; for verily God is with those who do right. [Koranic verses]
