Kundzins: "Latgale Does Not Want To Secede, It Craves Development."] [Text]We say very little about folks on the Latgale side, and even then, as if we are observing them from the sidelines. We would like to hear from the Daugavpils natives, themselves --Valdis Lauskis, City Mayor, Anatolijs Susko, President of the Latgale Joint-Stock Commercial Bank, Janis Spagis, Chief of the Immigration Department, Arturs Prieditis, State Language Commission Chairman, and Inara Ostrovska, Director of the Saules School. The discussion, which was moderated by the editor of the "Lauku Avize", Voldemars Krustins, started emotionally and about decentralization. Valdis Lauskis: If there is talk about solving the economic problem and the necessary loans, then, in all these years, it has not gone beyond the Riga rayon. Control is held by the administration, the Saeima, and this also applies to the educational and cultural programs. But these are also essential factors for the development of Latgale. Do we have any permanent banks? Yes, a grand total of two. Where else do we see this? An envoy arrives in Daugavpils and says: "I came because I realized - Latvia is not only Riga." This was the realization made by a particular state envoy, but our administration does not realize this. The matter revolves around the fact that we are asking for decentralization, not the creation of an autonomous region. In addition -- there is financial decentralization. Disguised as reform, all of our financial strength is being removed, or more precisely -- it is being turned over through taxes on our profits, and we are told-- work! But we have nothing to work with. The administration cannot provide us with solutions to our problems of education, project development and realization. Therefore, leave us the money, and we will find solutions here on location -- that is the type of decentralization we are asking for. We have been allowed to play around a little with privatization, licensing, and the sale of alcohol. But even that is being taken away from us, and we are told that licenses will be issued in Riga, in collaboration with the municipal governments. But they have forgotten about collaboration and no money has been left for the municipal governments. We are not asking for a Ministry to be relocated here, although that would not be such a bad idea with respect to national development. Why couldn't we have, for example, the Ministry of Economics, since there is a great industrial potential concentrated here? We also have a good railway network. A. Susko: Why haven't the deputies from our city done anything in the Saeima? V. Lauskis: I represent the Latgale Democratic Party. We grew tired of waiting. Tell me, how much longer do we wait before we are noticed and heard in Riga? That is why we decided to think for ourselves. There are entire institutes sitting around in Riga, and they cannot work out a program. They need funding and also to operate in Latgale. But the experts are not receiving money. Where are the plans being developed for education, and other specific questions? If there are no plans, there won't be any action. If Latvia doesn't have any plans, then there won't be any for Latgale. In a comparison of our region with other national regions, we have 20 percent less investment -- this is according to the data from the Latvian Development Agency. There is an entire list of specific questions -- how many choral groups, how many Latvians, how many national schools, what will receive financial support, what priority does the Latgale language have in schools, etc. Is someone considering this at present? This is why we are exhibiting political activity, but there is no desire to secede or become autonomous. When Latvia was in the process of becoming an independent nation in Kurzeme and Vidzeme, we, in Latgale, were living under the rule of the Vitebsk province. And Latgale was the one to come out for a unified nation of Latvia. Whose idea was it to create the Saules school? Was it needed by the state? No, they thought of it independently, and it was a good thing that there were understanding people in the Ministry in Riga. I. Ostrovska: We don't have funds, so it's a good thing that the municipal government is helping. Yes, there is a Latgale program -- we are starting to develop. This school was founded in 1922, but it was closed in 1954 because it was too nationalistic, and then reopened in 1992. It is one of the oldest art schools in Latvia. We presented the proposal to the Latgale program, but where is it? The school needs a great deal of funding, so that we can serve our area. We are also receiving students from Jekabpils, Preili, and Ludza, and the competition is four applicants per one opening -- even more intense than for the university. But they can't even show us the Latgale program. V. Krustins: Daugavpils has a future in both business development and in economic activities. V. Lauskis: I think we have to change our status. Is Daugavpils one of the provinces, or is it the second largest city in the nation? That is the basic question. It must be answered by everyone who lives here. We formed the Latgale Democratic Party because it was one of the parties founded by Francis Trasune. Seventy years have elapsed, and the attitudes towards education, the church, the Latgale language have changed profoundly. V. Krustins: Our Russian language press emphasizes that Daugavpils is a unique city, and that this unique character must preserved. What do we interpret this uniqueness to be? A. Susko: We still have the publication of "Soviet Youth" -- "SY". Why? Daugavpils also has a newspaper called "Dinaburga". Why -- because the Russians don't want to call the city by its Latvian name. They specifically found a historic name. These people, supposedly unintentionally, want to delay the development process. Our city has the company "Vladlen" --from the name Vladimir Lenin. People were also given such names in the nineteen twenties -- Vladlen, Vilen, Viulen. But this company was formed recently. When its owner came to the bank, I asked him -- are you preparing to work, or to scare people? He answered -- who knows, but that name is sacred to me. And, as long as it remains sacred to him, we will be unable to move forward. V. Krustins: These activities can be stopped by the entrepreneurs, since they need your money to thrive. You shouldn't despair, just provide support. V. Lauskis: Up to 1990, Daugavpils was faring very well. This was a good training ground for the cadre. People came to the city, went through the "Lokomotive" plant, on to the Communist Party committee, and into the Ministry. They were living high off the hog. When the government was chased out in 1991, a vacuum was created. Loyal forces were forming in spots, but there were no longer any connections. We are fighting for a change in any way we can. If we could receive concrete support from the top down, then it would be much simpler -- we could get out of the crisis, deal with the Russian "Dvinskies". If the state wants the press to be active, then the administration should personally provide financial support for publishing a newspaper. If this is not done, then this region will be lost. We created our own television and radio, and the government took away all of the resources. We cannot get any financial support for anything through the budget. The loyal forces, which we represent here, are being further taxed by the circulation tax for last year. And we have no one to sue in court. We, the loyal forces that stand and fall for Latvia, must sue the Saeima or the Cabinet of Ministers! V. Krustins: Mr. Lauskis, you elected the Saeima. Isn't anyone there from Latgale? V. Lauskis: Show me the legal state organ that can help solve this financial problem! On what basis did the Cabinet of Ministers take away 643,000 lats from the city budget? Who should we complain to? We don't have a constitutional court. Providenko can voice complaints, but I have to keep silent. And yet, I can't keep quiet -- if just by writing something. V. Krustins: We are hearing from all sides that the administration is destroying culture, education, industry, the ballet -- everything. Now you are saying that the administration also wants to silence Daugavpils, since you didn't use the word "destroy". Aren't we piling too much on the administration? I don't believe that Birkavs wants to harass anyone. V. Lauskis: The administration doesn't have any money. Thus, I can't get any money from them, nor can I hold on to what I have. A. Susko: The manager or entrepreneur must see results. You can't just keep taking their profits away. If he knew that such and such would remain for him, then it would be worth the effort. Taxes are around 80 percent in Israel, and still the country is thriving. V. Lauskis: There is a great deal we could do. The land is fertile for various applications, which should be noted, and the same is true for industry. There is Ventspils, which is sitting on a petroleum pipeline. V. Krustins: Daugavpils is just like Ventspils, but on dry land. Where could you find a more convenient location? V. Lauskis: Forgive me, but there is a major difference right now. We must restore the proper order of yesterday, but it is desirable that this be a joint effort. Where is the investment in industry? In shipbuilding, there is no need to wonder, since their salaries are five times higher than ours. Petroleum goes to Ventspils, but for us, everything was orientated towards the East. Reorientation requires a longer period of time. If Mr. Birkavs would familiarize himself with the documents he has in front of him, he would see that already over one year ago the German side presented a proposal for the reconstruction of the airport. Four times we asked that the proposal be evaluated. The state does not recognized Daugavpils. J. Spagis: Does the state have a grudge against Daugavpils for some reason? Maybe they have some complaints. I have some. Maybe we have earned such an attitude. Most of the managers in the manufacturing plants have not been replaced. Riga doesn't like that. What do you in Daugavpils think -- that we will make investments and give you subsidies, if there are others more deserving than you? Lembergs is talented and has earned it. If we are crying about how we are forgotten, then there are many points on which we deserve to be. Who should receive these investments, Providenko? I know where he stands on the ballot, and the press supports him. But he has an achilles heel, and we will get to it -- the Latvian National Independence Movement. People are being tested for their knowledge of the language. I turned to Mr. Lauskis, thinking -- he, as a teacher, would best understand. We have a student production line -- a major railway technical school with 900 students. And do you know what happens there? With the help of certain Daugavpils natives, they are continuing along in the old spirit -- Latvian language studies are ignored, Leninism in being taught. The military wives are the teachers. Going into a savings bank, you will only hear "what" in Russian. I don't know, Mr. Prieditis, where you pay for your public services, but as being responsible for promoting the state language, you should be upset, because no inroads have been made into the attitude towards language in the city. Our people are calling me and asking if I have read Prieditis' response in the newspaper to the complaints by the National Front members. If this is the attitude, then subsidies in Riga, as well, should only be paid after the job is completed. And that is only one instance. V. Krustins: The discussion has drifted away from economic matters. The banker has not yet had a chance to speak. A. Susko: If people are saying that they are oppressed and cannot get into the Saeima because they don't know the language, then I am indignant. What good is a person in parliament, if, because of language, he cannot become actively involved in the work. I wish to help those who want to work. When someone comes to me, I can already see from the hands who needs the thousand for a tractor so that he doesn't lose what he has started, and who wants to "do business". I would never give 200,000 dollars to some risky venturer. I wouldn't even give it to Providenko, because I know his destructive politics. On the other hand, there are entrepreneurs, like Locs, Pocs, Ambainis, and others, who are truly working for the good of Latvia. Right now, a problem has come up that there is no one to receive the loans. I could get 100, even 500 million dollars, but I need the administration's guarantee. And I also need guarantees that I will get back the money loaned. Unfortunately, there are many of those who will not return the money. Worldwide, banks plan on writing off loses of 3 to 5 percent. V. Krustins: How many borrowers do you have? Seven? A. Susko: Not much more than that. V. Krustins: So, the Latgale Bank has a few million kicking around? A. Susko: We are not exactly on the verge of failure. If this was a free market zone, then there wouldn't be a problem with where to put the money. There is now a lack of people active in business who would be able to borrow a good sum of money. V. Lauskis: There is a whole category of people who are not unwilling, but are unable to pay back the money. State policies also have to get involved. When the borders are properly regulated, then, within six months, the policies will change both here and in Russia. More precise legislative actions are needed. We should know what we will be dealing with at least three or four years for now. As recorded by A.
