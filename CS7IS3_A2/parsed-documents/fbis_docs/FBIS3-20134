Clinton's letter to Tansu Ciller came when there was a deadlock on the Cyprus issue, when Turkish intransigence had once again torpedoed the talks. This is why it causes surprise but also gives rise to deep thought about the U.S. President's position. How is it possible, at the time of the unofficial failure, for Turkey to be praised--indirectly--because there has allegedly been progress on the Cyprus issue? How is it possible that Mr. Clinton, who declares his interest and pledges personal intervention, does not know that not only is there lack of progress but even regression? It has been quite some time since Turkey has been considered the occupation force, the country that violates internationally recognized principles and rights. It has been quite some time since Turkey disassociated itself from the Cyprus problem and every time it becomes implicated in the problem it merely refers to the two communities. Ankara's systematic policy of complete disassociation from the problem has borne fruit and proof of this is the allegedly good intentions that many circles see on the part of Turkey. However, to be sincere and realistic, this has not happened behind our backs, it has happened with our own tolerance if not with our indirect promotion. When the one who is directly concerned accepts Ankara's disassociation, when he accepts the downgrading of the problem to a bicommunal conflict, when he calls upon Turkey to persuade Rauf Denktas to cooperate, no foreigner would intervene in a contradictory way, especially when the foreigner's interests coincide with those of Ankara. That is why, along with the disappointment caused by such international moves as the content of Clinton's letter, it would be right to look for our own responsibilities, too. In the last analysis, the foreigners follow their own policy. We, what do we do? Do we compromise with it so that we do not feel "isolated" or do we demand what belongs to us? No support is given to people who do not struggle and, unfortunately, this is what happens in the case of Cyprus.
