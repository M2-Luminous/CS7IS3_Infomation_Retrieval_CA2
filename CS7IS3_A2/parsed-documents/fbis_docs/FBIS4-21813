In the afternoon, cars using roads near the embassy were checked very thoroughly. It seems that several locations were chosen where a great number of police have been posted. [passage omitted] According to police, stepped-up security is to be in force over the next three to four days. After that, these activities will not be stopped altogether but decreased to a ``normal level.'' An Embassy spokeswoman said that security standards are very high, anyway.
