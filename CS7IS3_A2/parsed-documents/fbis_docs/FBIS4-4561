In the past, the United States had demanded [yokyu] that Japan prepare a plan to buy U.S.-made auto parts, and Japan accepted this request. The recent request is the second of its kind. Because of this, Japan, which aims to resume the framework talks by taking advantage of the announcement of the recently approved "foreign economic reform plan outline," is faced with a new difficult task. As for an expansion of plate glass purchases, Japan and the United States have already signed an accord. The two countries are supposed to review this accord at the framework talks. The United States is asking for independent purchasing plans prepared by Japanese companies--including aluminum sash and prefabricated home builders, plate glass wholesalers, and glass fitters. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is strongly rejecting this U.S. demand, saying, "Because there is no regulation of plate glass, we cannot give guidance to domestic companies asking them to increase their purchases of certain goods." There are some 1,000 glass wholesalers and glass fitters in Japan, and most of them are small to medium-sized companies. Because of this, MITI says that "it is impossible for us to ask each company to prepare an independent plan." In January 1992, Japan mapped out an action plan designed to help foreign companies make inroads into the Japanese market. To implement the plan, MITI has been taking various measures, including introducing Japanese wholesalers to U.S. plate glass manufacturers.
