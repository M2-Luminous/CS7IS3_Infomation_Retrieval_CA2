It supports transmission speeds of between 64 kbit/s and 2 Mbit/s and is suitable primarily for undertaking services with large quantities of information. One principal application will be the videoconference service which Telekom will switch from the Transmitted Broadband Network to the Globand network at the end of 1993. The starting point for the development of the Globand network was the European Community's RACE (Research and Development for Advanced Communications in Europe) program. Within the framework of the European Broadband Interconnection Trial (EBIT) project innovative data applications were to be realized, for which a suitable data network with a bit rate of at least 2 Mbit/s was needed. The EC in 1988 asked the CEPT (Conference Europeenne des Administrations des Postes et des Telecommunications) whether it was able to supply within a short time such a transparent switched data network with the existing technology. As early as April 1989 19 Telekom organizations from 14 European countries signed a corresponding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). DBP Telekom, which was also among the signatories, participated in the project with the satellite-supported, area-covering DFS network (German Telecommunications Satellite). In the course of the test preparations it turned out, however, that only very few applications actually needed 2 Mbit/s; in most cases 64 kbit/s were enough. The signatories therefore decided to halt the Ebit project. Those participants who had already made investments for adjustment work and calculated their market opportunities signed a new MoU in March 1992 and together formed a consortium which was given the name of GloBanD (Global Bandwidth on Demand). By July 1993 network operators from Finland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Switzerland, Portugal, Hong Kong and Australia had joined the consortium. Telekom participates as a so-called associate partner, since the technology it supplies does not permit full partnership according to the MoU. User Facilities and Applications The Globand network offers the customer the following user facilities: - Switched connections, - bandwidth on demand - bit transparent transmission with a speed of n x 64 kbit/s (n=1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 23, 24, 30), - customer interfaces G.703, V11, X.21, Q.931W (planned), - closed user groups, - point to multipoint connections, - reserved connections. This list makes it clear that the Globand network belongs to the Corporate Network category. To be sure, some user facilities for traffic relations with the German network component are not offered for technical reasons: - Bandwidth on Demand is not available through the customer in the DFS network, but is switched on by request by the operator; - at the moment only transmission rates of 384 and 1,920 kbit/s are offered; - no reserved connections; - no closed user groups. Globand is suitable primarily for the following applications: - Self-dialled videoconferencing including multipoint conferencing; - rapid data transmission, for example between host computers; - LAN-LAN coupling; - remote printing and setting; - back-up for rented lines or overflow traffic; - audio lines for hifi transmission; - remote consulting and diagnosis in the medical field; - CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing). The main application of the DFS/Globand network will be the videoconference service. At Telekom this service will for technical (selection ability) and cost reasons (charge standardization) be switched at the end of 1993 from the Transmitted Broadband Network (VBN) to the DFS network. From the DFS Network to the Globand Network The Globand partners are using exclusively terrestrial networks. The DFS network, on the other hand, is a satellite-supported, digital switched network with transparent data channels. It consists of 30 connection stations with the transmission-technical installations, two reference stations for network internal control purposes and one operating control center. The connection stations are operated unmanned and remotely serviced and monitored. They consist of the antenna reflector with the IF/RF installations (intermediate frequency/radio frequency), the TDMA installations (Time Division Multiple Access) for allocation of satellite transmission capacity and the communications unit (ANPE, adapter unit) for the network connection. This consists of 24 2 Mbit/s ports, which if needed can be divided into entry and exit ports. The technology is based on the S12 system from Alcatel SEL. The communications facilities are in part also terrestrially interlinked. This was necessary because of the transfer of the videoconferencing service to the DFS network and the resulting danger of overloading. For the subscribers this has the advantage that they can get a terrestrially routed connection if they want to avoid potentially undesirable delay time on the satellite link. Moreover, the transition to foreign networks also takes place through the communications facility. The network terminus is located at the subscriber's and is connected through a 2-Mbit/s connection line to the communications facility. The switching procedure takes place either software-controlled with a commercial PC or with the keyboard of a commercial multifrequency selector telephone. With the exception of the German component, the Diax concept is used in the Globand network. This network concept, named after the Danish company with the same name, consists of three components: - The local transmission station (Vst) can accept up to 22 2-Mbit/s connections. It can be operated as a stand-alone Vst or as a part of a larger network. - The Transit-Vst can process up to 80 2 Mbit/s PCM systems and supplies the necessary functions of a gateway station. It is comparable to the ANPE in the DFS network. - Dikonet 64 and 2000 form the network terminus for 64 kbit/s and 2 Mbit/s. With junctions to networks with a different technology (such as the DFS network), the Transit-Vst must be modified at the gateway station in question for the required performance characteristics in the entire Globand network. This is done with new software releases. The principal difference between the DFS network and the infrastructure of the other Globand partners lies in the signaling: Both technologies make use of the CCITT-No 7 system, with a central time division channel. The Diax technology uses the so-called Telephone User Part (TUP) for this, while Telekom uses the so-called Data User Part (DUP). The required adaptation functions are in each case implemented in the transmission nodes of the gateway stations for the immediately adjacent network components. In the case of the German network component, this is ANPE. These functions are supplied at the stations in Hamburg, Duesseldorf and Offenburg. Ultimately, the performance characteristics of the network junctions determine all the services offered by the network. Thus, the offering of German network components can be expanded within Globand if the corresponding modifications are introduced into the ANPE of the gateway station and the foreign network junction in the immediate vicinity. As an example of this the supply of additional transmission speeds (in addition to 384 and 1,920 kbit/s) is mentioned. A central operating control center for the entire network is not necessary. Each network component has its own center available, which in addition is equipped with a Globand help desk. Operating, monitoring and error elimination are integrated into the overall concept of the respective network operator. Standards for the Competition The international call number in the Globand network consists either of the Country Code (CC) or the Data Network Identification Code (DNIC), including the national portion. Call data postprocessing takes place at the operating control center. Accounting for the international charges takes place only between the directly adjacent network operators and according the rules of the telephone service. The quality of services can be specified with respect to the connection and the customer service. For network operators who support the complete palette of Globand performance characteristics, the following examples of values are to be understood as standards to be aspired to. Connection parameters: - Bit error rate: 10<sup> -6</sup> , - max. delay time (without satellite): 200 ms, - connection setup time: 12 seconds, - lost calls: 0.4 percent. Customer service: - Installation time for the connection: 90 days, - length of time for interference suppression: 36 hours, - manning of the "help desk:" official service hours, - malfunction reporting: around the clock Telekom regards the DFS network in the Globand network as a transitional solution until broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) based on ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) is ready in about three to four years. After that, it can be employed as a backup for B-ISDN, if necessary. The other Globand partners position their network components in the same way. Transmission speeds similar to the Globand network are also offered by the narrow band ISDN (S-ISDN). When using inverse multiplexers for bundling B channels, for example, the service quality of S-ISDN for bit rates over 128 kbit/s will be below Globand's, however.
