[passage omitted] Asked why the talks between the republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia had been delayed and when they will resume, Martic said: "This is not up to us. We insist that the talks take place at a neutral venue and on equal footing for both sides. The condition for continuing the talks is the removal of Paragraph 12 of the UN Security Council Resolution 820, relating to exports and imports. Making any concessions to Croatia, even when it comes to transport links, is out of the question unless we are treated equally. Gaining transport links would mean nothing to us if we cannot export or import goods, and for that it is necessary to remove Resolution 820." Asked to comment on the increasingly frequent statements by western and Croatian politicians about the reintegration of the republic of Serb Krajina into Croatia, with a high degree of autonomy, Martic said: "These are merely their wishes." He added: "We are convinced we are fighting for the survival of the Serb people and we will persist in it to the very end." "We will not give in on our basic demand -- the right to self- determination of our people, as guaranteed to all other peoples in the world."
