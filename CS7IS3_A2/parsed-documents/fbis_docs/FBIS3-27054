At a weekly press conference here this afternoon, the spokesman said China is a country that pays great attention to the rule by law. He said the regulation fully shows that the Chinese Government respects the freedom of religious belief of foreigners in China and of Chinese citizens, protects their normal religious activities, and preserves normal friendly contacts and cultural and academic exchanges between foreign and Chinese people in the religious field. Meanwhile, he said, the regulation also demonstrates the principles set forth in China's constitution that China's religious bodies and religious affairs will not be subjected to any foreign domination. The spokesman said foreigners in China should abide by Chinese laws and should neither harm the country's public social interests nor interfere in its religious affairs. When asked to confirm whether the Chinese Public Security Department had arrested foreign Christians, the spokesman said three American citizens and two citizens from Indonesia conducted illegal religious activities between February 9 and 11, 1994, in Henan Province of China, thus violating the regulation on the maintenance of social order of the People's Republic of China and the regulation on the management of foreigners' religious activities in China. On February 11, the local public security bureau, in accordance with Chinese laws, conducted an investigation, instructing and giving warnings to these people, and shortened the term of stay in China for one American citizen among them, the spokesman said. These people acknowleged that they had violated Chinese laws, made guarantees that they would no longer conduct such activities and left for Hong Kong on the afternoon of February 15, he said.
