We asked Party Chairman Vilmos Bereczki, who used to be a deputy for the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], about the Democratic Party's foundation and its chances at the parliamentary elections. [Bodnar] You also actively participated in the reorganization of the FKGP. What made you create a new party? [Bereczki] I did indeed participate seriously in the creation of a multiparty system and in the reorganization of the Smallholders' Party from 1988. It was clear to me that, among the parties that were emerging at that time, the ideas of the Smallholders were closest to mine. Unfortunately, this party later fell apart and, thus, I had to join the group of independent deputies in Parliament with the intention to engage in politics in a smallholders' spirit until the end of the current parliamentary cycle. I also accepted lobbying work in the course of my activity as a parliamentary deputy, and I presented various bills under discussion to the representatives of various trade union organizations and asked their opinions. A lot of modification motions emerged from this activity. The need then emerged for a party that deals with the real problems of society at the legislative level, a party that seeks a consensus and, at the same time, also controls the activity of Parliament and of the government to a certain extent. This is how the Democratic Party emerged. [Bodnar] How would you characterize the Democratic Party? [Bereczki] The Democratic Party is a program party in the center, and it is trying to give an adequate political answer to society's challenges. Within this, in the current situation, given that the challenges of the left are rather strong in Hungary, according to its program, the Democratic Party represent a bourgeois leftist trend, one similar to one wing of the Smallholders' Party before 1945. I think that our party provides an alternative in the sense that those who do not want to vote for a party that lies more to the left than we do can find a proper bourgeois organization in the Democratic Party. [Bodnar] On whose votes are you primarily counting? [Bereczki] We have recently enjoyed some success primarily to the benefit of the fallen middle classes. In addition, we have achieved results among people working in health care and welfare. Among our supporters, I can also mention the approximately 100,000 victims of the "bio-earthwarm" affair, whose interests no one dared to represent in Parliament, apart from myself. [Bodnar] What is the financial situation of your party? [Bereczki] We do not receive any government support at all. Our opinion is that we must return to the previous practice in which parties did not operate using taxpayers' money. [Bodnar] Which parties are close to the Democratic Party? [Bereczki] Primarily those parties that think that the players in political life should come to a certain minimum agreement. There can be opposing ideas, but not conflicts. We do not have any reason for this because, apart from the economic difficulties, no other pressure is being exercised on this country and, therefore, it is useless to be hitting, kicking, and biting one another. We must find a way to settle conflicts in a European way and, in our view, the fate of this country will be primarily decided on economic and social issues, and not issues that express superficial political helplessness. [Bodnar] What election results are you counting on? [Bereczki] I think that we will reach the 5-percent threshold in any case. We hope that many citizens who would not otherwise have voted will vote because of our appeal, because they are interested in all the things that we have already succeeded in achieving. I would like to mention here that my proposals were taken into consideration on the issue of increasing pensions, and the government's media proposal is also very similar to my original motion. We find it promising that our party has thousands of members, we have more than 200 organizations in the provinces, and a lot of people are asking to become members. I think that this definitely deserves attention in the current situation.
