Before attending an award ceremony held by TA KUNG PAO, Zhang was asked by reporters to comment on the British Hong Kong authorities' argument that the credit line of HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars] was only part of the credit arrangements made by the Hong Kong Government. Zhang said: The Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the airport issue clearly specified the credit limits and arrangements. That is, on 30 June 1997, the British side should leave HK$25 billion in financial reserves for the SAR Government, and the British side can arrange loans of less than HK$5 billion with the endorsement of the Chinese side. Any loan arrangements that exceed HK$5 billion which must be borne by the SAR Government must be first discussed by the Chinese and British Governments before a final decision is made. All this was clearly spelled out in the memorandum. He pointed out that the airport memorandum of understanding did not indicate that "loans arranged by the Airport Authority and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation would not be included in the 5-billion-dollar limit." Zhang said that the British Hong Kong authorities changed the Airport Authority into a corporation in an attempt to dodge the relevant provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding. He criticized the British Hong Kong authorities for trying to shirk their responsibilities to the future SAR government while unilaterally making a decision without consulting the Chinese side and without the endorsement of the Chinese side.
