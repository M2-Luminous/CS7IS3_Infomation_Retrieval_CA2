FR940426-2-00120 FR940426-2-00075 (J) Post Approval Processing The HAP Agreement may not be executed nor may construction or substantial rehabilitation begin until the certifications required by HUD Notice 94&hyph;19 are submitted to HUD and found acceptable. (K) Contract Administration The statute calls for assistance to be provided through ``a contract entered into by the Secretary and the owner''. It is the Department's intent to enter into a HUD/Private Owner HAP Agreement and Contract. HUD will then enter into a contract with an HFA or PHA that has jurisdiction over the geographic area in which the project is located. For a fee, the HFA or PHA will carry out certain administrative or ministerial functions that otherwise would be the responsibility of HUD as the Section 8 Contract Administrator. Any administrative fee payable to the HFA or PHA will not exceed 5 percent of the published 2 bedroom Fair Market Rent for Existing Housing for the area and will be payable out of the Section 8 contract and budget authority reserved for each project. (L) Project Construction and Completion Project construction, completion and cost certification requirements are contained in HUD Notice 94&hyph;19. HUD may perform field reviews if necessary to substantiate compliance with program requirements. (M) HUD-Private Owner HAP Contract If the pension fund and owner are in compliance with HUD Notice 94&hyph;19, HUD will execute a HUD-Private Owner HAP Contract with the owner. The contract will contain provisions relative to: (1) The terms of the contract which may be not less than 5 nor more than 15 years; (2) the responsibilities of the owner for project management and maintenance; (3) a prohibition on the use of other Federal programs so long as the contract is in effect; (4) a limitation on assistance for the project to the housing assistance payments available under the Contract; (5) the requirement that in the event the project is refinanced to lower the interest rate and/or debt service payment, HUD may reduce the Contract rents; and (6) the right for HUD to terminate the Contract for cause if the owner fails to perform in accordance with the provisions of the Contract. (N) Supplementary Program Information Coincident with the preparation of this NOFA the Department has been developing more detailed information and instructions for program participants in the form of HUD Notice 94&hyph;19. The Office of Insured Multifamily Housing Development at HUD Headquarters, Room 6134, Telephone (202) 708&hyph;3000, will make these instructions available to pension funds and other interested parties upon request. II. Other Matters (A) Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with the Department's regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. (B) Federalism Impact The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that this NOFA does not have substantial, direct effect on the States, on their political subdivisions, or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among the various levels of government, because this NOFA would not substantially alter the established roles of HUD, the States and local governments.
