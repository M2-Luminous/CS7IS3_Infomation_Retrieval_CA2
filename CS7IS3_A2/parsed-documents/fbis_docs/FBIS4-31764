FBIS4-31764 "dreeu114__a94027" FBIS-EEU-94-114-A Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 ANNEX Poland Deputies Protest Article by Defense Spokesman Deputies Protest Article by Defense Spokesman LD1106193994 Warsaw PAP in English 1914 GMT 11 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY LD1106193994 Warsaw PAP English BFN [Text] Warsaw, June 11 -- The presidium of the Sejm Defence Committee in a statement made public Saturday charged spokesman for the Defence Ministry Wieslaw Rozbicki with incompetence, disrespect for civilian politicians and lack of understanding of the fundamental principle of full control of the state authorities over the Armed Forces. The statement came as a response to an article published by Rozbicki in the Thursday issue of the "GAZETA WYBORCZA" daily. The deputies are expecting an explanation from the defence minister whether the contents of the article is compatible with a respective official stand of the ministry. The Defence Committee's presidium stated that it is highly inappropriate that the official spokesman for the ministry put in doubt the advisability of Poland having signed international disarmament agreements. According to the presidium, the suggestion that these agreements should be renegotiated is inconsistent with the official position of the Polish Government. Authors of the statement recalled also that the disarmament agreements had been signed at the time when the present Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk had been serving his first term in office. in the opinion of the deputies, the suggestion that in result of these agreements poland has diminished the combat readiness of its army in comparison with its neighbours is completely false and attests to the spokesman's incompetence. The deputies expect the defence minister to address the issue.
