Government subsidies are one main means of protection, that is, a government directly or indirectly protects agricultural development and farmer interests through subsidies in various forms, thereby ensuring the relative stability and continuation of agricultural yields. China is in the process of changing from a planned to a market economy. The market economy assault on agriculture may be greater than that upon other industries. Agricultural development will be greatly affected and peasants come to grief if mishandled. Therefore, drawing on foreign experience, it is extremely important under market economy conditions that China, such a large country with a huge population, ensures sustained stable agricultural development. Subsidies of various countries surpass highs and lows--brief introduction to foreign agricultural subsidy methods Considering the issue of foreign agricultural sub sidies as a whole, although subsidies emphasize different things, take various forms and are of infinite scope, various gove rnment agricultural subsidies mainly start from three things: One subsidizes the agricultural production process, the second subsidizes agricultural products in the process of exchange, and the third subsidizes agricultural products in the consumption process. Some of these directly support agricultural production. Others are indirect supports. Production subsidies The main forms of these subsidies are: 1) Agricultural infrastructure building subsidies. Peasants are indirectly subsidized through state subsidies for agricultural infrastructure building and agricultural science research. For example, Japanese Government subsidies for farmland capital construction are as high as more than 90 percent. Central government fin ancial assistance is the source of 45 percent of funds; 50 percent comes from local governments and farmers themselves only be ar 15 percent of the burden. To promote agricultural modernization in member countries, the European Economic Community stipulates that it shall provide 25 percent of the funds for purchasing large-scale agricultural machinery, land amelioration or construction or repair of irrigation projects, with 75 percent resolved by the country itself. India and other countries are in the midst of a "green revolution" through free government improved variety development selection and promotion. 2) Production cost subsidies, including various subsidies from planting to pesticides. For example, the EEC implements various production subsidies for mountainous grain farmers. The Japanese Government subsidizes backbone farming by supporting production. Subsidy costs can account for 50 percent of total costs. In many developing countries, there is a wide scope of production cost subsidies. In particular, chemical fertilizer subsidies are rather common. Chemical fertilizer subsidy rates in these countries almost surpass 30 percent in transport costs and sometimes are as high as 90 percent. In general, subsidy levels are 50 percent to 70 percent. 3) Credit subsidies. This mainly means states provide low interest or interest-free bank loans to agricultural producers to see that they obtain needed funds. The government subsidizes banks for differences between loan interest rates and the domestic financial market. For example, Brazil frequently has increased agricultural credit and lowered loan interest rates to support agricultural production. In the mid-1980s, in one year Japanese farmers received 1.5 trillion yen in subsidies in the form of low interest loans. The United States Government practices low interest loans for low yield farmers: in 1992 560,000 farmers received low interest production loans of $2.3 billion. Circulation subsidies This mainly refers to price subsidies implemented for producers in the process of exchanging agricultural products. 1) Protectionist price subsidies. Different agricultural product production costs, the supply and demand situation and price levels in recent years individually determine protected or target prices. When market prices are l ower than these prices, the government procures agricultural products at protected prices. For example, the Japanese Government adopts a high price grain procurement policy to protect grain farmers. Their prices often are six to eight times higher than international market prices. Approximately two-thirds of agricultural products in the United States enjoy price support. There are target prices on 70 percent of EEC agricultural products. 2) Trade price subsidies. In order to protect imports and exports or ensure domestic market price stability, governments implement price subsidies for grain imports and exports in international agricultural product trade. For example, when importing foreign grains, EEC countries levy a price differential tax which is used to subsidize and protect the agricultural development of the importing country. The United States and other excess agricultural product producing states often hold down agricultural product export prices; the government s ubsidizes differences between domestic and export prices. The United States Government generally subsidizes 20 percent ot 3 0 percent of its toal agricultural product exports, and in some years the figure exceeds 80 percent. Agricultural product price differential subsidies are at more than $20 billion, or even more. Consumption subsidies This is a form of indirect agricultural production subsidy directly aimed at protecting consumers. For example, Japan, India, the ROK and other countries normally procure grains produced by farmers at relatively high prices and then resell them to consumers at relatively low prices. The government subsidizes price losses. The United States implements a "food stamp" policy to assist low income households. At present more than 20 million people in the United States nationwide draw food stamps which costs the gove rnment more than $10 billion. The government's consumer price subsidies actually are acts of procuring agricultural products and processed goods. They play an undeniable role in stabilizing domestic agricultural product prices and protecting agricultural production and farmer interests. Other forms of subsidies Some market economy countries, particularly developed countries which have excess farm produce, often have other forms of subsidies. For example, the United States Government implements subsidies to limit yields because it has excess farm produce. Any farming household which has signed a limited production and sale contract with the government can enjoy such subsidies. Subsidy scope and standards continuously fluctuate and are readjusted depending on crop yields and domestic and foreign market conditions. In the past limited production subsidies were implemented only on wheat, corn and cotton, but at present have expanded to more than 20 items and the trend is increasing. Limited production subsidy standards are target prices set by the government. When market prices are lower than the target price, the government pays qualified farmers who enjoy subsidies the difference. The United States and other countries also have idle field subsidies which are issued by land banks which restrict the total output of certain agricultural products by reducing the input of land. Specifically, at a high rent corresponding to approximat ely 60 percent of the value of the land, the government leases back land on which there is a serious surplus of agricultural product which is left idle or soil conservation measures are taken. Some countries also have disaster subsidies. For example the United States Government gives to qualified farmers disaster subsidies based on the area affected, scope of reduced ou tput and target prices. Japan grants subsidies for major crops on a national scale through agricultural assistance insurance; the government grants subsidies of approximately 15 percent of insurance costs. When there is a disaster, it grants insu rance costs of 10 to 30 percent of a normal year outlook. Some developing countries grant disaster subsidies in the form of free government grain supplies or agricultural tax reduction or annulment. Subsidies have advantages and disadvantages, rarely used appropriately foreign agricultural subsidy advantage and disadvantage analysis In general, under market economy conditions, there are advantages and disadvantages to government subsidies for agriculture. Advantages analyzed Subsidies promote production and development. Direct government subsidies have improved greatly agricultural production conditions, in particular, agricultural infrastructure, technology, equipment and agricultural scientific research. They have strengthened agricultural productivity and can turn the fruits of agricultural research into productivity as soon as possible. For example, because the United States practices a series of agricultural protection policies encompassing agricultura l subsidies, its agricultural production consistently has maintained relatively stable development. By 1992, U.S. soybean output was 54.40 million tons, more than one-half the world total, putting it in first place. It ranked second worldwide for grain output of 320 million tons and cotton output of 3.90 million tons. Subsidies increase farmer incomes. Some agricultural subsidies are directly granted to farmers in the production process while others are granted indirectly in various fo rms. Farmers obtain material benefits in these ways. At the same time, because subsidies promote increased agricultural output, farmers therefore can obtain suitable incomes. For example, average net income per farm in the United States is $280,000 and income per agricultural laborer is $180,000. Subsidies promote agricultural exports. In developed countries with agricultural surplusses, agricultural product export trade is greatly promoted because the government subsidizes agricultural exports. Taking the United States as an example again, cereal export volume accounts for about 40 percent of total export volume and approximately one-half of cotton is exported. Agricultural product exports are at more than $40 billion. Under conditions of a more than $100 billion deficit in national foreign trade, there is a more than $17 billion surplus in agricultural product foreign trade. In sum, government subsidies for agriculture to a large degree have altered agriculture's disadvantageous position in market economies, reduced agricultural risk, enhanced farm product competitiveness on domestic and foreign markets and are commonly welcomed by farmers. At the same time, they also play an important role in ameliorating domes ic supply and demand contradictions for farm products and stabilizing domestic economic and social order. Disadvantages analyzed Subsidies place an enormous fiscal burden on governments. Agricultural subsidies are government acts and expenses for them mainly are paid from government coffers. It is a rather heavy burden, whether for developed or developing countries. For example, the United States requires several tens of billions of dollars annually for agricultural subsidies including farm product export subsidies. Japan needs several billions of U.S. dollars annually for rice subsidies alone. Therefore, many countries are reexamining and determining agricultural subsidy policies with the trend toward reduced numbers of subsidies. Agricultural product export subsidies often create trade friction between countries. The most prominent example is the stalemated negotiations between the EEC and the United States regarding reducing farm product export subsidies at the [GATT] Uraguay round which were stalled. No agreement could be reached because of high subsidies on agricultural product exports. This not only affected normal trade developments between Europe and the United States but also brought about disruption in some countries such as France. Regarding subsidizing farm product exports, although the starting point is protection of a country's agriculture and farmer interests, under certain circumstances the opposite may result. Subsidies have created definite unequal competition. Market economies talk about fair competition and oppose monopolies. Government agricultural subsidies actually grant agriculture rather superior competitive conditions although it originally is at a disadvantage. Therefore, in some countries there is controversy regarding government agicultural subsidies. For example, there has been opposition in the United States regarding excessive price supports for agriucltural products. Secure stones from other mountains to polish gems for China--suggestions for China's agricultural subsidies From the introduction above, under market economy conditions, almost all governments implement definite subsidy policies. Profit is the highest principle in market economics. Under market economy conditions, capital always flows towards industries which can obtain relatively high profits. Agriculture normally is a rather low profit industry. Because agricultural capital is organized below industry, farm product prices cannot rise as quickly as those of industrial products. It is difficult to realize parity prices between industrial and agricultural products; thus agriculture generally cannot obtain equal profits. For a country's economic development and the people's livelihood, agriculture is indispensible. Relying on the role of market mechanisms alone, it is difficult to resolve the contradiction between the importance of agriculture and relatively low profits. Subsidies themselves are not the outcome of market economics. However, as government actions, they are macroeconmic readjustment and control measures which supplement roles that the market cannot fulfill. Agriculture's relative disadvantageous position is very clear as China builds a socialist market economy. Therefore, for a relatively long time period, the government still must subsidize agriculture. Otherwise, agricultural production may slump and there will be no relief of the contradiction between farm product supply and demand. It will not only be impossible to solidify the position of agriculture, but may limit China's national economic devleopment for the long term. Subsidies must conform to a country's actual conditions, models cannot be copied indiscriminately Considering the agricultural subsidy policies of various nations of the world, they differ in terms of aim, form and specific scope. Some emphasize price subsidies for inputs, other stress price subsidies for farm product purchases and sales. Some are mainly credit subsidies, others are chiefly subsidies in kind. Some limit production, others promote production, and so on. In sum, the starting point must be a country's actual conditions to establish the most effective agricultural subsidy system. The Chinese Government's subsidies of agriculture naturally cannot be indiscriminate copies of those used abroad. Considering the aims of subsidies, the fundamental aim of China's agricultural subsidies should be promoting developments in agricultural production and continuously improving the quality and quantity of agricultural products. Because of fundamental conditions in China, namely, a large population which will continue to grow within the next few decades, a small arable land area which may shrink further in line with economic development, the supply and demand contrad iction for farm products, especially grains, will exist for a long time while grain imports will be restricted in various ways. So in the end, how should subsidies be implemented? In terms of the scope of subsidies, one, we must enhance subsidies for agricultural capital construction, including agriculture infrastructure and scientific and technical research promotion to improve basic agricultural production conditions and improve technical levels. Two, subsidize high yield, top quality highly efficient agriculture, in particular we must support development of large projects in this respect. Three, subsidize comparatively large-scale farm product commodity production bases. Four, implement insurance subsidies for major natural disasters, establish a disaster subsidy system relying on insurance companies with appropriate state fiscal subsidies, and lower the risk to agricultural producers. In terms of subsidy form, one, we must complete the price subsidy system. The actual effectiveness of China's current system is not ideal because of scattered subsidies and irrat ional pricing. We should set up a producers target price subsidy system that can really play a role and gradually establish a n agricultural product trade price subsidy system to encourage exports. Two, we must augment credit subsidies and it would be best to establish an agricultural policy bank as soon as possible. Agricultural subsidies must be in appropriate amounts Considered as a whole, the role of agricultural subsidies in various countries has been brought into rather full play. But there are two extremes: subsidies in developing countries are too low, which is disadvantageous for promoting agricu ltural development or protecting the interests of farmers and consumers. Some developed countries overly subsidize agricult ure, which creates rather enormous financial pressure for the government although it is good for agriculture and farmers. In particular, overly high subsidies on export farm products often leads to trade friction with other countries, affecting normal economic and trade relation devleopments between nations. In this way, the aim of subsidizing actually is not met. Therefore, government subsidies of agriculture must consider factors overall and determine appropriate amounts. China is a large agricultural country with limited fiscal power, relatively backward agriculture and comparatively low peasant incomes. If subsidies are too low, they will not play a role and if they are too high the government could not bear the burden. In the past, the Chinese government actually subsidized agriculture a lot; grain procurement price underpriced fiscal subsidies reached around 40 billion yuan annually. This is no small fiscal pressure! Therefore, it is extremely essential to determine appropriate subsidy amounts under the premise of fully considering the state's fiscal load capacity. Government subsidized agriculture will attain its aims if the state coffers can bear it, agricultural production is promoted and the peasants basically are satisfied. In sum, learning from foreign experience, we should strive to find an agricultural subsidy route suited to China's national conditions and actual situations.
