Reports say the main opposition party walked out of the emergency talks after being accused by Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle of complicity in the strike. About 2,500 policemen below the rank of captain in the country's 3,000-strong police force started striking last week demanding a 60 percent pay increase. They were joined by junior prison guards.
