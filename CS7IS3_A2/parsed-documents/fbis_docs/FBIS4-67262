FBIS4-67262 "jptdd022__l94026" JPRS-TDD-94-022-L JPRS Narcotics 19 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA MEXICO Correspondent Arrested Following Report on Drug Corruption Correspondent Arrested Following Report on Drug Corruption in Saltillo PA2005034894 Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 19 May 94 PA2005034894 Mexico City XEW Television Network Spanish BFN [From the "24 Hours" newscast] [Text] On the morning of 17 May, Televisa Coahuila correspondent Juan Andres Martinez reported on "The Awakening Program" hosted by Guillermo Ortega that judicial agents protect drug traffickers in the city of Saltillo. As a result of this report, Martinez was arrested. At the office of Judicial Police Commander Mario Espinoza Lobato, Martinez was accused of committing a serious offense by tarnishing the image of the Attorney General's Office, PGR, with his report. The Televisa correspondent was arrested without a warrant. He was held incommunicado for nearly nine hours and was transferred to the Saltillo Prison, where he remained until this afternoon. This occurred after he broadcast a report which the PGR station in Coahuila did not like. They are now saying that he committed other offenses. We find this very strange, however. We are asking that the abuses against correspondent Juan Andres Martinez be dealt with in accordance with the law.
