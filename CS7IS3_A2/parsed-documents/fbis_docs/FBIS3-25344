The "latest ploy" is Zwelithini's threat "to proclaim the restoration of the independent 19th century Zulu kingdom." THE STAR notes that secession has long been "a catalyst for war." "Buthelezi may be raising the secessionist option to persuade De Klerk to agree to greater power for the regions and to induce him to lean on the ANC [African National Congress] to concur. There is a real risk, however, that secession will acquire its own momentum and drag South Africa into the abyss." De Klerk's response has been to insist that Zulu demands for "`self- determination'" can be "fulfilled within the Interim Constitution." But there is dissatisfaction with the constitution which "extends beyond Buthelezi and the king. They would not have been able to muster thousands of Zulus to protest in Pretoria last month and Durban on Monday if there was not genuine unease. For that reason it is imperative to look again at the question of regional autonomy." BUSINESS DAY Call for Entrenching Regional Powers -- A page-16 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 February comments on the IFP dissatisfaction with the constitution, saying "the solution still lies in extending and entrenching regional powers -- especially to kwaZulu/Natal and rural subregions, where they may prove tempting to reasonable white rightwingers." BUSINESS DAY points out that a year earlier a University of the Western Cape academic had proposed "a Natal divided into three regions. Buthelezi could then at least hope to win a regional poll in northern Natal where he and the Zulu kingdom have traditionally been based (contrary to Zwelithini's claim to the whole of Natal)." This proposal is "worth exploring." The National Party is "sufficiently flexible," but the ANC "may see further concessions as distasteful. But the choice lies between this and accepting that a new government will be preoccupied for years with a major regional security problem, absorbing resources which should be directed at the main priority of reconstruction and development." SOWETAN Criticism of IFP Nonparticipation in Election -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 16 February in a page-8 editorial is "impressed" by the respect that Zulus or members of the IFP have for their king, Goodwill Zwelithini. However, having said that, SOWETAN finds it difficult to understand that the king and his people should be "so emotional about the coming elections." "We still think the IFP and those who support King Zwelithini should have taken part in the elections [as published]. They would have done their standing in the eyes of the world enormous good if they had. We have less sympathy with other members of the Freedom Alliance, who do not have half the type of support shown to the Zulu king in Pretoria and Durban." CITY PRESS Time To Stop Talks With Right Wing -- Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 13 February in a page-14 editorial warns that the coming election "bodes ill for us all," due to the Afrikaner National Front's (AVF) decision to boycott the election and their talk of a "`little bit of violence'" to stop the election. "Now that the rightwingers have made it plain to all of us that no matter what concessions they are given, they were merely using negotiations to dismember the country and are prepared to use force to achieve their goals, we must question the wisdom of continuing talks with them."
