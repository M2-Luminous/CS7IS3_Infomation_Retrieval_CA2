FR940426-2-00053 FR940426-2-00037 Promoting Non-use of Tobacco: Studies have clearly established that the use of tobacco products increases mortality and morbidity, not only for the primary users of these products but for those in close proximity to the user. Statistics published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease. Therefore, the PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. Part II_Programmatic Goals, Target Population, Project Requirements, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date Program Goals: The primary goal of this cooperative agreement is to support the individual CMHS Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance grantees in their efforts to develop and implement local systems of care that are consonant with the overall program goals. A secondary goal is to serve the entire field of children's mental health services by developing a variety of practical and needed materials (e.g., manuals, monographs) as well as efficient and effective methods for providing training and technical assistance. These goals are consistent with health care reform initiatives (e.g., providing quality mental health services and reducing unnecessary inpatient care) and support the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary's themes of fostering independence through empowering the people, preventing future problems, and improving services to our customers. Target Population: The TA Center must make its formal training and technical assistance activities available to CMHS Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance grantees and to any organization participating in activities funded by the grant. Materials developed by the TA Center will be distributed to a wider audience of child mental health service providers as resources permit. All materials developed must reflect cultural competencies and be gender appropriate. Project requirements: The proposals must address in detail the following required activities, including the resources to be expended in each area: •Create at least three organizations in separate regions of the country (hereafter referred to as Hubs) to provide training, consultation and on-going support (on-site as necessary) to CMHS Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance grantees and to any organization participating in activities funded by the grant to implement a full array of community-based mental health services within an organized system of care. Each Hub will act independently on operational issues while maintaining a close, interdependent relationship with the other Hubs on strategic and long-term issues. Each Hub will be responsible for training and technical assistance activities for a defined geographic region and will develop its own network of consultants (although some consultants may be ``shared'' among the Hubs). In addition, a ``focus area'' will be developed in each Hub that will define, at least in part, the specific types of expertise that the Hub concentrates on. CMHS strongly encourages applicants to consider one or more of the following as focus areas: mental health services in rural areas, cultural competence, systems integration, and clinical services issues. Hubs will be located in appropriate geographic settings that will permit them to serve as effective catalysts for system of care development. Each of the regional Hubs will be expected to develop formal collaborative relationships with appropriate regional representatives of the other child-serving agencies including child welfare, education, juvenile justice, and any mental health and public health knowledge synthesis and transfer initiatives in the region. Hubs must be capable of providing technical assistance, either directly or through consultants, on the entire range of service issues that grantees are required to address. In addition to the substantive content, the Hubs will also devote attention to developing community leaders. They will establish mentoring relationships between experts on a specific issue and their peers who are grappling with similar issues. They will establish on-going connections with clinical training institutions and will utilize the expertise of senior clinicians connected with such institutions and programs. As part of its training and technical assistance activities provided through the Hubs, the TA Center may also organize national and/or regional meetings of CMHS Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance grantees for training and technical assistance purposes. •Develop monographs and other materials related to children's and adolescents' mental health services where they do not currently exist, and as needed by grantees. The TA Center must develop substantive reference and resource materials (e.g., bibliographies, manuals) to facilitate the cross fertilization of innovative practices throughout the service sites as well as for broader use by the services community. Plans for reproduction and distribution of such materials should be indicated. •Establish a steering committee of external representatives to coordinate TA Center activities with existing Federal and non-Federal initiatives addressing the mental health needs of children and adolescents as well as any future private or public efforts in this area.
