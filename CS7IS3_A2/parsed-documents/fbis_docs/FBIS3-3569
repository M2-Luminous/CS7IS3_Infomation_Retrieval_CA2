The region has issued a total of 52 laws and regulations in line with local conditions since 1978, safeguarding its economic development, according to an official from the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress. Tibet, one of the five autonomous regions in China, has been given full minority nationality autonomy to make laws and carry out the country's laws and regulations in line with its own conditions. The 52 new laws and regulations cover politics, economy, culture, education, science and technology, and nationality and religious affairs. A law adopted in 1990 on mining has protected the region's mineral resources against being excessively mined by collective enterprises and private mining households. Regulations formulated in 1992 on environmental protection have put one-quarter of the region's areas under the region's protection. Meanwhile, the Tibetan Autonomous Region has also revised or terminated laws which no longer suit the region's opening-up and growing economy.
