Redman, it has been learned, has not brought with him any concrete proposals, and obviously means only to hear Belgrade's position on the U.S. initiative for the creation of a Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The question of the Bosnian Serb side has been left open in that context. An answer has, however, come from Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has said that "only political illiterates can expect the Serbs in Bosnia to accept a confederative model with the Muslims and Croats," and who has underscored that only two possibilities exist as far as the Bosnian Serbs are concerned -- "an independent Serb state in Bosnia or the unification of the Bosnian Serbs with the other Serbs into a single state." It is believed that Milosevic and Redman will exchange views on the enhancement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina negotiating process, which is to produce a comprehensive settlement acceptable to all three warring sides in the former Yugoslav republic. According to unconfirmed reports, Redman will meet in Belgrade also with Vice-President of the Bosnian Serb Republic Nikola Koljevic.
