FR940428-2-00005 FR940428-2-00003 4. The Department intended to treat all pre-sale freight expenses as indirect selling expenses and did so in the PP and ESP computer programs. However, in the CV calculation, we inadvertently omitted those pre-sale freight expenses. We have corrected the computer instructions to reflect that change. We do not agree with Daewoo's claim that the Department's treatment of all of its pre-sale movement expenses as indirect expenses constitutes a clerical error as described in section 353.28(d). We believe this to be a methodological issue and refer Daewoo to Ad Hoc Committee of AZ&hyph;NM&hyph;TX&hyph;FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement v. United States , Slip Op. 93&hyph;1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), which discusses the methodological treatment of these pre-sale expenses. Amended Final Results of Review As a result of our corrections of ministerial errors, we have determined that a weighted-average margin of 0.90 percent exists for Daewoo for the period April 1, 1991, through March 31, 1992. The Department will issue appraisement and revised cash deposit instructions with regard to Daewoo directly to the U.S. Customs Service. All other results of this administrative review remain the same as published in the Federal Register on March 23, 1994 (59 FR 13700). These amended final results of administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(f) of the Tariff Act and 19 CFR 353.28(c). Dated: April 21, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10165 Filed 4&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
