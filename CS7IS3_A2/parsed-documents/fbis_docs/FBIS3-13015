The ongoing 50th session at Geneva last night adopted a consensus resolution to this effect despite Islamabad's intense behind-the-scene lobby to thwart it. The resolution for the first time recognizes the effect of terrorism on human rights, a point which has been hammered at by India at all the international fora in the wake of transborder export of terrrorism into Jammu and Kashmir. According to observers, the decision will have serious implications for Pakistan-sponsored terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir. The resolution reiterates the United Nation's unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as acts of aggression aimed at the destruction of human integrity and security of states, destabilizing legitimately constituted governments, and having adverse consequences on the economic and social development of the states. It calls upon the states to take effective measures to prevent, combat, and eliminate terrorism. The resolution urges the international community to enhance cooperation to fight terrorism at various levels. India has urged the UN Human Rights Commission members to vote against the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir. Addressing the ongoing session of the commission at Geneva last night, veteran diplomat and former foreign secretary, Mr. T.N. Kaul, said that the resolution has serious and dangerous implications that could allow any country to infringe on the national independence and sovereignty of others. Mr. Kaul was exercising the second right of reply to Pakistan's allegations against india on the Kashmir situation.
