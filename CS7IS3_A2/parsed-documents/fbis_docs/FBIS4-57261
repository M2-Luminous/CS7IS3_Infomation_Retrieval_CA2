Oviedo said the military will perform social works in the interior "without their weapons" if these works are ordered by the commander in chief. He made it clear that he will retire from the military if he is ordered to use his weapons against peasants. Oviedo also denied charges made by opposition politicians who accused him of being one of the main elements destabilizing President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's government. The Army commander said that the defense of the democratic system installed in the country following the coup that deposed Stroessner was a matter of consistency. "At least those of us who left the barracks on the night of 2 and 3 February must be consistent. We are going to be consistent to the last days of our lives, whether from the inside or outside of the Armed Forces," Oviedo said, repeating Wasmosy's words that the military and the people will defend democracy in our country. Asked if he was aware of the existence of groups of people who are attempting to destabilize President Wasmosy's government, Oviedo answered: "The best informed person in the country is our commander in chief. He gives us the information we know. If he says so, it must be so," Oviedo said. The Army commander said the violence that affected our country lately "will end." He made clear, however, that the Armed Forces will always act according to the Constitution, our laws, and military regulations. "We will follow our commander in chief's orders. We will follow his instructions and what is established in the Constitution," Oviedo added. He also promised to defend this and other government in the future "with everything in his hands." He reiterated that at this time he does not have a possible presidential candidacy in mind. Oviedo also said if the commander in chief decides that the military must cooperate in social works in the interior of the country, the military will follow orders. "We will be very glad to work with our soldiers in the interior," Oviedo said. The commander warned, however, that he will not have "the courage" to use his weapons against peasants even if the commander in chief orders him to do so. "I would retire from the Army if this were the case," he said. Yesterday morning Wasmosy and Oviedo presided over the traditional military parade in front of government palace to commemorate the 183rd anniversary of our independence. Army, Navy, and Air Force units participated in the parade. Detachments of the National Police also paraded in front of the official stage. Brazilian and Argentine naval forces participated in the military parade, receiving long applause from the public watching the ceremony. Later the president received a delegation of indigenous people. Indian leaders complained about their urgent need for land, food, health, and education
