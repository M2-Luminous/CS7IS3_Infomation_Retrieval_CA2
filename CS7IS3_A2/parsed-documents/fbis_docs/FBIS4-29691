They will boost to nearly 14,000 the number of units produced at all three bases in a five-year plan in stages, an increase of about 50 percent over the present. Moreover, they will put effort into the export of high-speed elevators from Japan. They are covering sluggish domestic demand and spurring the elevator business by proceeding to open up Asian markets where the construction rush continues backed by rapid economic development. The bases decided for this increased production are "Mitsubishi Elevator Asia" (annual production of 2,000 units), a fully financed company in Thailand; "Shanghai Mitsubishi Elevator Ltd." (annual production of 4,000 units), a joint venture company in China; and a Taiwan joint venture company (annual production of 3,000 units). Production there totalled 9,000 units in 1993. Almost all of the products are for Asia, and the Mitsubishi Group is selling 10,000 units in the same region, including Japanese and South Korean production. According to the increased production plan, the program for the period of the next five years is to boost annual production respectively to 3,500 units in Thailand, 5,400-5,500 units in Shanghai, and 4,700-,800 units in Taiwan. It is estimated that the number of units produced when the plan is finished will be nearly 14,000, about a 50 percent increase compared to 1993. They plan that the number of units sold in the Asian region at that point in time, including exports from Japan and production in South Korea, will be over 18,000 units annually. A construction rush of high-rise buildings and homes is continuing along with economic development in Asia, and it is expected that the demand for elevators will greatly increase in the future. Particularly in China, it is anticipated that the annual market scale will reach 30,000 units in a few years and it will grow into the world's largest market. Starting with Japanese manufacturers such as Hitachi, major U.S. and European firms such as Otis Elevator of the United States and Schindler Lift of Switzerland are also embarking on business expansion.
