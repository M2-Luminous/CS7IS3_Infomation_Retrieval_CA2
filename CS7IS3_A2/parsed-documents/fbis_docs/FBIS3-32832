Several factors point to this. First, there is the testimony of Major Evaristo Castillo Aste that was published in CARETAS issue No. 1295 and then by other media. He gave a precise, detailed, and brave account of the military's relationship with drug trafficking. The fact is that Maj. Castillo's charges not only link subordinate officers to drug trafficking. He mentioned the names of generals who, through action or omission, may be linked: General Eduardo Bellido, head of the Huallaga front for two years; Interior Minister Juan Briones; and Army Commander General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza. There is also the version of another Army officer published in the same issue. This information confirms many other similar reports. Second, "Vaticano" was labeled as a narcoterrorist and was placed under the military court. Why should a military court judge a drug trafficker? Didn't [President Alberto] Fujimori reorganize the judicial branch and issue all the laws he wished? Why can't the new judicial branch judge "Vaticano"? This strange behavior leads to the belief that they do not want "Vaticano" to talk. If he is tried by a military court, the trial will be secret. Nobody will know what the drug trafficker said. There will be no point in him telling the military about his contact with other military from whom they receive orders. Moreover, by keeping him under military control they can negotiate with "Vaticano", without the people knowing about it as they have done -- and continue to do -- with Abimael Guzman and the terrorist leadership. Another query that arises immediately from labeling "Vaticano" as a narcoterrorist is that if he only dealt with other terrorists and not with the military, where is the fortune the terrorists amassed? This raises another theory mentioned a few weeks ago by this column: The money that the Shining Path leadership keeps abroad is probably part of the negotiation between Abimael Guzman, Fujimori, and Montesinos. When jounalists recently ago asked Fujimori about Guzman's money, he replied: "I don't know." Why? Didn't he have the world's best intelligence service? Doesn't he control 95 percent of the Shining Path leaders? Have the tens of millions of Shining Path dollars vanished? Third, Fujimori, General Hermoza, and Dinandro [expansion unknown] have refused to admit that there is one single authority, either civil or military, who is involved with "Vaticano." This refusal is totally unbelievable. If Fujimori, Hermoza, and Dinandro had admitted the links between "Vaticano" and some of the military, and if they had begun impartial investigations within the regular jurisdiction, they could have been given some credibility. Fourth, the distracting maneuver with the artists, which was so obvious and unintelligent, makes it clear that there is an attempt to conceal something. Otherwise, what is the explanation for this plot that was personally initiated by the president and that has led nowhere? The implications of the links between drug trafficking and the Armed Forces are dramatic. Corruption in other institutions can create many problems. If the police, customs offices, or the judicial branch are corroded by this disease, the problem is serious. But if the Armed Forces contract the disease, the situation is much worse, for several reasons. One is that the military play a decisive role in the government, especially since 5 April 1992. Another reason is that they enjoy a privileged status within society, like having their own jurisdiction for trials of military men, even in cases of common crimes. No institution can make a serious investigation into the military: neither congress, nor the police, nor the judicial branch. Still another reason is the power of arms, which can be illegally used with much impunity, as was disclosed by General Rodolfo Robles, who referred to the "gang of henchmen" made up of military men. If drug trafficking, or another form of corruption, reaches a deep level within the Armed Forces, affecting the command level, there could be political complications that could produce long authoritarian government terms and/or very costly damage to the country. This occurred in Bolivia with General Garcia Meza, in Paraguay with Stroessner, in Panama with Manuel Antonio Noriega, and it is currently happening in Haiti. Yet, unlike Panama, Peru does not have a strategically important canal, and no one will come here to take away a corrupt military man. We will have to solve the problem ourselves. Honest Armed Forces officers have a great responsibility in this task.
