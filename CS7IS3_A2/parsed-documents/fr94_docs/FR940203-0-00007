FR940203-0-00007 FR940203-0-00002 This AD allows operation with one-brake-deactivated performance decrements for cracked or broken bushings, for operators who comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD within the acceptable compliance timeframe. This AD allows operation with two-brake-deactivated performance decrements, for operators who have not accomplished the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b)(3) of this AD within the acceptable compliance timeframe. For those operators, this AD requires revising the Limitations and Flight Performance Sections of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include two-brake-deactivated performance decrements. Three options are provided: the first and second options are simple, conservative corrections; the third option, while more complicated, can provide a less penalizing correction, depending upon the conditions. The effect of this AD is to ensure that flight crews are advised of the potential hazard and of the procedures to address it. The applicability of this AD is limited to only Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption `` ADDRESSES .'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;209&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES .'' List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;03&hyph;07 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;8814. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;209&hyph;AD. Applicability : Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes, certificated in any category. Compliance : Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of two or more MLG brakes, which could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this AD, within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0116, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994: (1) Perform a surface temper etch inspection and a fluorescent magnetic particle inspection to detect cracks or thermal damage of the brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the main landing gear (MLG) wheels and brakes in accordance with the service bulletin. As a result of these inspections, accomplish either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) of this AD, as applicable: (i) If cracking or thermal damage is found on any bolt: Prior to further flight, replace the existing bolt with a new or serviceable bolt in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat the inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 800 flight cycles. (ii) If cracking or thermal damage is not found on any bolt: Apply finish and reinstall the bolt in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat the inspections thereafter at intervals not to exceed 800 flight cycles. (2) Perform a visual inspection to detect cracking of the inner cylinder fork lug bushings and the brake rod bushings at the inner cylinder fork lug end in accordance with the service bulletin. Repeat that inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 800 flight cycles. (b) For airplanes having line positions 132 through 518, inclusive: Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this AD, within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3), as follows: (1) Install the retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect; and adjust the torque of the ``B''-nut on the hydraulic line connection to the disconnect fitting; in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0125, dated November 11, 1993. (2) Remove the cross bolt from the brake housing and brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel; remove the brake rod pin assembly; perform a visual inspection of the brake rod pin assembly to detect cracks, bronze transfer, corrosion, chrome discoloration, and areas of missing chrome plate; prior to further flight, replace any damaged brake rod pin assembly with a new or serviceable assembly; modify the brake rod pin assembly; install the modified brake rod pin into the brake housing and brake rod; and install a new brake attach pin retainer configuration; in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767&hyph;32A0126, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994.
