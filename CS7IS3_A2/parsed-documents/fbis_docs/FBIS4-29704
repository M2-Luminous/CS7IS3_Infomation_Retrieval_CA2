Domestic savings are insignificant and foreign funds are not yet available. This limits spending to urgent and regular items and debt repayment only, while spending on capital construction has been low. By 10 April, the funds actually allocated for capital construction projects reached only 21.4 percent of the planned targets, with tardiness being the result of difficulties in with income sources. Many projects are also suffering from a cessation of funds as they cannot meet fund allocation requirements. Of the 5,460 investment projects this year, about three-quarters of them have not been able to fulfill requirements for capital allocation. Altogether, they represent six trillion dong in capitalization, and are mostly for projects initiated by the ministries of transportation, water conservancy, energy, culture and information, and banks.
