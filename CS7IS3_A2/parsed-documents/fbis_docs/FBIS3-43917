CD Chairman Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti is reported to have been accused by the secretary general, Chima Ubani, of fraternizing with the military government. A number of radical civilian activists have been persuaded to join the Abacha administration since it took power last November. Prominent among them is Dr. Olu Onagoruwa, who is now minister of justice and attorney general. On the line to Lagos, Akwe Amosu asked Dr. Ransome-Kuti if he was aware of Mr. Ubani's allegations: [Begin recording] [Ransome-Kuti] Well, not really but he has been.... [pauses] Maybe he has been behaving in a funny way for some time. But we have organizational ways of resolving things so I am quite comfortable. [Amosu] But he says that you have been having secret meetings with the military and that you have compromised the organization. I mean that's rather specific, isn't it? [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I don't know where he gets his evidence from or his advice, but we do talk to a lot of people and a lot of people do confront us and there is no way he can say we have compromised because we are still on the organizational stand. [Amosu] I mean one of his pieces of evidence says that your own lawyer who stood by you through thick and thin, Mr. Onagoruwa, is now the justice minister and that your relations are so close that he is the main channel of communication between you and the government. [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I don't know what he wants me to do about that. Maybe he wants me to exile myself or exile Mr. Onagoruwa. I don't know about that but Onagoruwa has many friends and he talks to a lot of people and sometimes he wants to know what CD thinks and he is told what CD thinks. I don't see what else one can do. One is not on an island and he can't isolate himself. [Amosu] So, you would say that fraternizing with the government is an accusation that just won't stick. [Ransome-Kuti] Well, it does not make sense. I mean everybody knows where we have stood for years and we still stand there. I mean he has just started so who is he to say somebody is compromising? What do we have to gain by compromising with a military government? Maybe he is showing youthful exuberance. Maybe he thinks things should go a different way than they are going but he does not know how organizations work. But on the other hand, we must say that CD has become quite a force in Nigeria and I won't be surprised if the government is trying to destabilize it internally because we are having a meeting now at this moment. If he had any problem, he should have raised it up at the meeting. We are having a convention in two weeks' time, so what is his problem? What can his problem be? [Amosu] You seem to be accusing Mr. Ubani himself of being manipulated by the government. [Ransome-Kuti] Not really. All I am saying is that if we have an internal fight and he feels so strongly, I am saying that we are having a meeting right now, which he knows about. Why does he not come and resolve it there? I mean when you have an internal fight in a organization, the secretary general goes out and makes a press release. [Amosu] What about the other allegations that Mr. Ubani has made that collective leadership has broken down and that some officials are being kept in the dark about the state of the CD's finances? [Ransome-Kuti] Well, he knows where to raise it. He knows where to raise it. The same point was raised by him a week ago and all the finances are audited and everything, so you know that is why I said it seems that he is trying to destabilize the organization because these are things which, if they were true, everybody would sympathize with him. [Amosu] Whether this is a deliberate attempt to destabilize the CD or not, it is going to do you damage, isn't it? [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I hope not because people know our reputation and we have been at it for some time and it is not at this stage that we are going to start collaborating with government. For what purpose? [end recording]
