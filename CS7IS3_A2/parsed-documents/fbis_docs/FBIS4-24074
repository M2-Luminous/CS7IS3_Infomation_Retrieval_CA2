FF financial spokesman Dr Willie Botha said most of the transition expenditures which the taxpayer had to foot had been been unnecessary. The failed National Peacekeeping Force had cost the taxpayer R395 million [rand] and the Independent Electoral Commission had overshot its budget by R700 million. Dr Botha added that the measures envisaged to stimulate growth would have a negligible impact on job creation. The danger existed that those who qualified for these benefits would benefit themselves, rather than create jobs. He said it was difficult to imagine how economic growth alone would meet the increasing demands of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. According to Dr Botha foreign investment would probably only be realised after the first real african national congress budget in 1995, provided the ANC indicated its support for a free market economy.
