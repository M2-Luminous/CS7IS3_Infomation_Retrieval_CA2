Gen. Oleksandr Kuzmuk was appointed commander of the 32d Army Corps -- senior military commander in the Republic of Crimea -- at the end of last year by order of the Ministry of Defense. Our special correspondent in Simferopol met with the commander. [Sadovskyy] Oleksandr Ivanovich, what is your kith and kin, as the saying goes? What road did you travel to reach your present post? [Kuzmuk] I come from a military family. I was born in 1954 in Baku. I am a Ukrainian. My biography is the usual biography of soldier. In 1975, I graduated from the Kharkiv Guards Higher Tank Command School [Kharkovskoye gvardeyskoye vyssheye tankovoye komandnoye uchilishche] and in 1983, from the Academy of Armored Troops [Akademiya bronetankovykh voysk]. I commanded a tank platoon, a company, a battalion, a separate tank regiment, a division. I served in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and in the Belarus, Moscow, Leningrad, Carpathian, and Odessa military districts. I am married and have two children. My son attends a medical institute, and my daughter is a schoolgirl. My wife is a homemaker. [Sadovskyy] At one time, service on the sunny peninsula was considered a choice posting, for young lieutenant and gray-haired general alike. Suffice it to say that at the beginning of the seventies, your post was held by Dmitriy Yazov, the next to last minister of defense of the USSR. Those days have sunk into oblivion. Can it be said that only the chosen get posted to Crimea today? [Kuzmuk] For many, Crimea is associated only with the Southern seashore. After coming here, I got to see the other side of Crimea. You see, the formations and units of the corps are stationed in difficult climatic and geographic conditions -- in alpine and steppe regions. From this standpoint, the sunny peninsula looks quite different. As far as the prestige of serving anywhere, including here, is concerned, my attitude is that a soldier's job is the same in any region -- wherever his Fatherland orders him to serve. [Sadovskyy] The alpha and omega of the functioning of any army is its combat training. How is this reflected today in the life of the units and subunits of the army corps? [Kuzmuk] I have been accustomed since my days as a lieutenant to resolve all matters connected with military discipline and everyday life through combat training. This is the foundation on which the military machine stands. If there is combat training, there will be enthusiasm among the officers and the opportunity to develop their abilities; personal interest in military service will also appear among the soldiers. Experience shows that when combat training is extensive and effective, all other problems such as infringements of regulations [neustavshchina] and desertion disappear. Speaking of the difficulties encountered today in organizing combat training, I would like to note that those commanders who regard combat training of paramount importance manage to find the necessary resources and time and utilize the optimum forms and methods. They conduct lessons and exercises and do so in a comprehensive and interesting manner. Such commanders include officers Botov and Makavchuk. This year the training process has been organized and is being conducted very intensively. We are devoting particular attention to coordination between subunits. [Sadovskyy] There is currently a great deal of talk at various levels concerning the presence of units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the peninsula. Some are not averse to making political capital on this. What can you tell us on this score? [Kuzmuk] Yes, there has been an onslaught from some parts of the mass media on our presence here, an onslaught that is purely opportunistic. Moreover, they make use of an expression that is new to us -- "demilitarization." Who has been militarizing the Crimea and when? Or the phrase "Ukrainian military formations." Matters concerning the performance of their duties by the formations and units of the Armed Forces in the Crimea lie within the jurisdiction of the commander-in-chief, the president of the country, and the minister of defense. And there are exactly as many troops here as are needed to defend Ukraine. [Sadovskyy] All the same, by its very nature, this talk of "reductions" offends the military... [Kuzmuk] The allegations of some politicians that the army is not combat ready, that the antiaircraft defense system is not in place, upset the officers who are laboring selflessly in this difficult field. I believe that this is simply a tactical move on the part of activists and politicians, who are trying to distract the Crimeans from solving urgent problems. And nothing more. You see, reasonable people are perfectly aware that the cause of Crimea's economic difficulties is by no means due to the presence of the troops. [Sadovskyy] As we know, today anyone who feels like it dons the mantle of champion of the rights and interests of the people who wear shoulder boards. I would like to hear your opinion... [Kuzmuk] Naturally, I am following the situation that is developing around us. It is characteristic that most candidates for the office of people's deputy broached military issues in their programs. These issues included the same notion of demilitarization I mentioned above (to be sure, now it has an ecological slant) and military service by Crimean youths to be performed only on the territory of the peninsula. Yet it is quite obvious that these points are purely populist in nature. The fact is that there are documents regarding how many people to recruit and which units -- of the Black Sea Fleet and of the land forces. Protocols have been signed on percentages. The majority of politicians are dilettantes in military matters. For example, what does it mean to insist that youths must serve in Crimea? Crimea has no training subunits and units. Consequently, the youths will learn neither a military nor a civilian specialization. They will not become signal men, nor radar specialists, nor operators. In short, they will work only at unskilled jobs in the army or be doomed to serving in minor posts. Neither their mothers, nor those who stand behind their backs, know this. And so, naturally, serving near your parents appears very appealing at first glance. Although, incidentally, statistics show that this kind of service -- and we have bitter experience -- has, as a rule, a negative effect. It means unauthorized leaving of units, absences without leave, and other violations. [Sadovskyy] Do the Crimeans lead in this? [Kuzmuk] Yes. [Sadovskyy] Traditionally, the military maintained close contacts with local authorities, enterprises, and institutions. Naturally, it is no easy thing to become settled in one's new position in a few months' time. Nevertheless, Oleksandr Ivanovich, have you found there to be mutual understanding? [Kuzmuk] It seems to me that the local authorities are more concerned with politics than with the practical things that need to be done. Many problems affecting everyday life have been set aside for the time being. As to establishing contacts, I have done so. For example, I have met privately with President Yuriy Meshkov of Crimea. I asked Yuriy Aleksandrovich to take a look with his own eyes at the situation and conditions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that are billeted in Crimea, with the eyes of a president. I also offered that we solve social problems jointly. [Sadovskyy] What was Yuriy Meshkov's reaction? [Kuzmuk] I believe that Yuriy Aleksandrovich met what I said with understanding. [Sadovskyy] And the last question: What worries you most as the senior military commander in the Republic of Crimea? [Kuzmuk] The situation that has arisen on the peninsula. Nonetheless, this situation cannot affect the combat readiness and normal activity of the troops to any degree. It is soldier's duty to perform his main task -- to study and perfect his professional skills so that he can defend his people in the event of danger. No one has the right to interfere in our performance of this task. It is also essential to give the officers and warrant officers the opportunity to devote themselves fully to their duties without having to glance over their shoulders. We also need normal living conditions, normal conditions for our families, a comfortable life. Everything else will fall into place. We are fully aware of the hardships that the people are suffering. But we are not asking anything extra for ourselves. I would also want the Crimeans to view us not as some sort of monster but as people who are honestly trying to do their duty to their Fatherland. [Sadovskyy] Thank you for this conversation.
