Anouar Haddam, Dihna Abderrahmane, and Ouli Abdesselam all belong to what might be called the foreign "brain trust" of the FIS. All three are nuclear physicists. Just coincidence, or convergence of interests? The answer lies in the motive behind the assassination of a senior officer in the ANP [People's National Army], Redouane Sari, a nuclear physicist himself and thus known to the above group. Did Mr. Sari rebuff Haddam and his associates when they ordered him to join their group?<sup> 1</sup> The sequel leaves no doubt: Atomic energy and their common profession was the tie that linked them. Haddam and his group would instigate a "Chernobyl" within the Algerian Islamist movement [MIA]. There is no room in their cold strategic calculus for the "Djamaat" and their irrationality. Haddam's calculus is that of opportunism and thirst for power. The Abassi-Benhadj antinomy has been superseded by a polarization that will surely lead to implosion of the destructive force that has been at work in Algeria over the last two years. The arrest by French police of Algerian-born Islamist leaders living in France shows that the Islamist movement there is far from being, or constituting, a solid organization. The mission of that command post, which looks for all the world like an army general staff headquarters, is to prepare and design targeted propaganda campaigns. The cell has a substantial budget, in the range of millions of U.S. dollars. The Chicago cell has been given the function and title of "parliament of the FIS." Algerian Islamists based in the United States have access to some of the most sophisticated communications equipment. Alicante Next in importance after Chicago comes the city of Alicante in Spain. There, Haddam has an installation called the "close proximity operational command post." The mission of this cell is to serve as a relay for communications with Islamist activists inside Algeria. Personal contacts take place on a regular basis in Mellilia, Nador, and Oujda. The Spanish cell serves as a transit base for "Afghans" returning to Algeria. The itinerary is as follows: Oujda-Berguemt (Morocco), then across the Algero-Moroccan frontier via Sidi Djillali, El Aricha, Sebdou, and Telagh. At Telagh, "Afghans" are taken under the wing of a Saida-based logistics network. Profiles of those arrested, the documents seized, and reactions of coreligionists in Germany, England, and the United States clearly betray a host of weak points in the overseas organization of the Algerian Islamists. These weak points are explained by the total absence of a base and the fact that the organization is locked tightly in the sterile and demagogic rhetoric of its origins. Our investigation has determined that the former FIS still has four operational command posts. In order of importance Chicago is first, followed by Madrid (Spain), Paris (France), and Berlin (Germany). Chicago A Black Muslim stronghold, Chicago today harbors more than 40 Algerian Islamists, in addition to a Middle East community affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood Islamist movement. The Chicago command post is run by Anouar Haddam, a nuclear physicist born in Tlemcen. A former Princeton University student, he stood as a FIS candidate in the 1991 legislative elections. The men responsible for logistical support are all veteran black-market traffickers. At every step along the way, Moroccan police and customs officials are "softened up" by baksheesh [bribes]. It may be that high-level Moroccan authorities have no idea what is happening in their country. The Spanish cell's membership includes procurers and a not insignificant number of drifters with criminal records (drugs) living on the Costa del Sol. Some are well known to Algerian police: Back when Ben Bella was in hiding, they had infiltrated his MDA [Movement for Democracy in Algeria] and served as informers. Berlin In Germany, where Rabah Kebir lives with some of Abassi Madani's close collaborators, Algerian Islamists are less active since they lack the necessary base of support. Kebir maintains close ties to members of the neo-Nazi NSDAP [Nationalist Socialist German Workers' Party], which helps provision it and facilitates acquisition of false identity documents. Rabah Kebir himself is a rather interesting personality. Passive, vacillating, and unstable, he is regularly denigrated and challenged by Haddam, who accuses him of being a compromiser and advocate of dialogue with the Algerian authorities. Kebir maintains close ties to Madani's sons, Salman in particular, as well as with Kamerdine Kharbane (expelled from France to Pakistan). Their faction, "the upholders of the oath," was born from a meeting of group leaders in a west Algerian town last spring. During that meeting, there was a stormy debate, with the Djamaat asserting the lives of too many of their activists had been lost and deploring the activities of the exiled brothers. Kebir's faction has been marginalized by Haddam, who accuses the Madanis of maintaining a hegemonic grip on the former FIS. Paris Dihna Abderrahmane, a physicist who is married with three children (his wife is an oral surgeon), had settled in the small French town of Ferney Voltaire located 2 km from Geneva (Switzerland). A friend of Haddam, Dihna was the FIS's official representative in France. On Tuesday 9 November at 0600, French police came to his domicile to arrest him, but he fled to Sudan, where he is currently staying. Dihna's strategy was based on vigilance. Domiciled in France, he worked at the Islamic Center in Eaux Vives, a densely populated quarter of Geneva. The center was controlled by a branch of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and run by the Ramadan family, whose matriarch is the granddaughter of the movement's founder, Hassen El Banna. Dihna received faxes in Switzerland at the above-mentioned Islamic center and at the mosque of Petit Saconnay, a gathering place for members of the former FIS in exile in Switzerland. He received instructions directly from Chicago, from Haddam, and relayed them to the French Algerian Fraternity (FAF), which in turn passed messages on to the various prayer halls. FIS in France Some 90 percent of Algeria's overseas cultural community resides in France. The former FIS has never succeeded in winning the loyalty of this community. However, it has succeeded--with the help of non-Algerian Islamists and French converts--in setting up networks. The Tunisian Nahdah provided safe houses and mail drops (bookstores, prayer halls, etc.). The Federation of French Muslims [FMF] headed by French convert Youssef Leclerc, a personal friend of Abassi, is financed by the World Islamic League (Saudi Arabia). The FMF supplied volunteers for the cause (preparation, printing, and distribution of tracts and magazines). To date the former FIS has failed to establish itself in France, although it does enjoy the support of a few reactionaries. Much has been said about the "harkis" [members of harkas or native auxiliary continents of the French Army during Algeria's war for independence], most of it untrue. Harkis still living are at least 55 years old. Despised in both France and Algeria, most are destitute. Their children, at least the great majority of them, have no connection at all with the Islamist movement. They consider themselves part of France's Maghrebian cultural community. That said, the confiscation of large sums of money at the domiciles of those arrested confirms suspicions that Islamists in France were well funded, enjoying affluent lifestyles that contrasted sharply with the standard of living of the average Maghrebian immigrant. The former FIS counts some 500 activists living overseas, most of them salaried cadres, plus 1,500 to 2,000 sympathizers. Their principal activity to date has been propaganda--fiery, violent, amateurish propaganda, notable for the absence of rational argument. Our inquiries with colleagues in the international press, whose response reflected solidarity with Algerian journalists, indicate that overseas the former FIS, lacking a popular base in the Algerian cultural community or a convincing propaganda line, is smoldering with violent discord between the MIA and the former FIS triggered by the abduction of the three Frenchmen in Algiers--discord that threatens to explode into the open. Iran allegedly proffered its good offices in an effort to avert this explosion. Added to strains within the Islamist movement are personal rivalries and a probable struggle for supremacy among the various terrorist groups. On the ground, rivalry between the MIA and the Djamaate (FIS groups aligned with Abassi) is quite open. Pasqua's Message Juridically, the French Republic is fully within its rights to take action to protect the security of persons and property. Politically, Charles Pasqua is sending a clear and multidirectional message not only to Islamists around the world but also to extremists of every kind, Europeans included. The message is a warning: The rules of hospitality in France and elsewhere require that guests of the host country respect certain obligations and responsibilities. Two imams--a Turk who officiated at services in Nantua and was behind the recent Islamic "scarf" [foulard] affair, and a Moroccan officiating at Carpentras--have been expelled from France to their country of origin. Again, the message was clear: French laws will be enforced; which is not in any sense inconsistent with freedom of religious practice in France. To avoid driving authentic Muslim believers into alliance with Islamists who use religion for political ends, Pasqua has reaffirmed his respect, and that of the French Government, for France's Muslim community. The government's actions were taken in response to the assassination of two Frenchmen and the abduction of three others. FAF's publications called for murder and violence. Banned, they will continue in other forms. Footnote 1. Mr. Sari's assassins were killed by security forces later in the year.
