What is the reason for that? [Pawlak] First of all, the reason is the kind of approach to the issue that you are demonstrating here. Almost any situation can be interpreted in a way that would confirm someone's preconceived notion. I think that, if one takes a look at the facts, one can see that there are no signs of the instability you mentioned. Sure, we have plenty of interesting situations and difficult dilemmas, but I do not think there is any big danger to the functioning of the state. Economic indicators confirm unequivocally that the economy is developing very smoothly. Take, for instance, the figures regarding price increases for the first quarter, which are the best in seven years, and we have also reported a major increase in output. We should conduct politics in a determined manner, and often times in a way that would be attractive and interesting to voters and journalists, provided economic stability is not interfered with. [WPROST] Given that the situation in parliament is optimal, why is that not reflected in a clarity of political arrangements? [Pawlak] Every country has its own interesting events that make it possible for journalists to discuss interesting topics and to predict various scenarios of how the situation may develop. But, if you take a look at specific problems, then, in my view, society does not feel any special kind of anxiety over the fact that some terribly unstable situation has just emerged, even though, indeed, there are a lot of issues stirring up emotions, such as the issue of appointing a deputy prime minister for economic affairs, or what has been happening on the stock market, even though, in the latter case, it does not affect a large part of society. In the case of the stock market, it turned out in practice that the "bag" out of which enterprises wanted to gain capital for their ventures is empty, and that all that happens at the stock market is that money is shuffled from one place to another: Some sell and others buy, but the actual amount of capital is seriously limited. [WPROST] You said the people have no reason to feel anxious. How do you manage without a finance minister and a deputy prime minister for economic affairs? [Pawlak] As I have said many times before, coalition rules are about teamwork, and the condition of the team as a whole counts. For the moment, we are lacking a "forward left" on the "field," but that does not change the fact that our team has scored some very good results. Among the practical successes, the following can be listed, which will remain so in the future: the restructuring of our debts incurred with the London Club, and a second stage of debt reduction with the Paris Club. These are not spectacular events, but they remain important to the economy and investors alike. I am talking about that here because what smacks of sensation from a journalist's viewpoint does not necessarily have to be reflected in the functioning of the economy right away. [WPROST] But sometimes such sensationalist issues are reflected in social life, such as through threatened strikes or disputes surrounding the so-called neopopiwek [salary-controlling] law. Your position on the latter issue is not clear to the public at large. So, does Poland need salary-control mechanisms? [Pawlak] What we need are mechanisms that would protect economic and social stability. A trilateral commission has been established that includes representatives of employers, trade unions, and the government. This creates a chance to define general parameters concerning salary increases in the economy. Following the acceptance of the president's veto, one should think about whether it pays to go back to the "shaky grounds" of a mechanism that has largely ceased to function anymore, or whether one should implement changes regarding the merits. After all, one could travel down a path that would require responsibility by the trade unions, the managing cadre, and the government. If it were not for salary-increase pressures, a possibility would occur for establishing general principles of shaping salary policies by the trilateral commission, followed by making them more specific through collective agreements. Commercialization of the economy is also an important issue, as well as moving away from a valorization of benefits vis-a-vis salary increases to a valorization vis-a-vis price increases. [WPROST] The problem of whether we are, first of all, supposed to invest or consume, has not been resolved in Poland yet. [Pawlak] We have been introducing mechanisms that are conducive to making investments. Income tax and dividends are supposed to play that function in enterprises. If some of that revenue is devoted to investments, another part may be devoted to salaries, and these regulations should be defined nationwide; there are enterprises with a structural position on the market that allows them to separate themselves from situations at the remaining enterprises. We cannot have a situation where an expert for maintenance of electronic equipment earns 20 million zlotys [Z] a month because he just happened to come across a company with a very good market position, whereas an employee working in a company manufacturing some extremely complicated computers, but with a low popiwek basis at the beginning would earn just Z3 million a month. [WPROST] You mentioned the responsibility of trade unions, among others. Do you know for a fact that they will actually be responsible, or do you just have faith in their reasonable attitude? [Pawlak] Fortunately, it is a trait that can be verified in practice. After a debate in the Council of Ministers, during which an overwhelming majority of ministers spoke in favor of introducing salary-controlling mechanisms, I spoke with the chairmen of more than 10 trade unions. I asked them whether, in a situation of lack of a statute, the trade unions are capable of resisting temptations to raise salaries under control. And I must say that the responses were positive in large majority. I think trade unions are interested in not destabilizing the situation in the process of abandoning salary controls. On the other hand, there have been attempts--for instance, in the Polish State Railroads--to use the current situation to satisfy pressures for salary increases. Such cases substantially weaken my arguments, and they may make it necessary to adopt a law that would control salaries. The government has spoken out in favor of the Sejm being able to "suspend" such a law, on a motion by the Council of Ministers. This would create an opportunity for trade unions, employers, and the government to act in concert. Various things may prove necessary in practice. [WPROST] Aside from conflicts with trade unions, there have been conflicts among the different power centers. The president has expressed criticism regarding your decision to conduct self-governmental elections by saying that you should not have done it before he vetoes the new electoral law. One may have a feeling that there is no one main decisionmaking center in Poland. [Pawlak] It is much easier to find solutions if we concentrate on practical problems and not on "positions." The case of the self-governmental elections shows that there is a time when one can debate various solutions, but then the time schedule forces us to make a decision. Postponing those decisions makes us enter a period where conducting elections becomes somewhat risky because elections make sense in June--that is, before vacation season. From that standpoint, it is important to search for practical solutions to problems instead of insisting on one's "position." [WPROST] The previous government was impotent because it did not have a majority in the Sejm, whereas your government's activities seem to be blocked by the Belweder. [Pawlak] Statistics defy such suppositions: A majority of laws were, in fact, signed by the president. But there are also cases of some interesting situations, such as the salary-control law. But I still think the president's veto forced everybody to think carefully about the new solutions. So it follows that, when one approaches problems practically, there is no situation where there would be no positive solution whatsoever. If one could carry out everything very easily, life would be very boring indeed. [WPROST] But can you see any solution with regard to the government-Belweder relationship? [Pawlak] So many problems arose that one just had to get rid of them--and that was what the meeting between the president and the Democratic Left Alliance Parliamentary Club was all about. [WPROST] You are talking about teamwork and about successes, but the opposition accuses you of not having a strategic concept of leading the country, citing the dispute surrounding the neopopiwek as an example. [Pawlak] In that particular case, the opposition fell into its own trap because it could have acted a little more responsibly during the vote, and it could not have provided such a categorical reply. After all, our offer was quite open. But, when it comes to this government's strategy, it is not one of imposing decisions on others but one of showing the direction. I have spoken out many times regarding the main priorities. I will repeat this once again: If we talk about heading in the direction of democracy and a social market economy, we are doing this to guarantee Poland a high-ranking place in the family of free nations. We are eager to see cultural, intellectual, and economic development of society and the state. Experience of recent years demonstrates that a few principles should be observed. First of all, changes must take place in an evolutionary manner and without sudden, radical moves. Second, it is necessary to widen support for the reforms by establishing mechanisms for active participation by large segments of society in the processes of change. The third principle is about a need to make our actions, structures, and procedures rational. Finally, what is also important is the development of human capital, broadly speaking. We must create practical possibilities of investing in technologies elaborated by our scientists, and a system of investment breaks could serve that goal. One must also secure economic and social stability. That makes up the general plan that must be the basis for detailed actions. We can really gain a strong position and be an important country in this part of the world. Some big challenges are ahead of us, but they are not insurmountable for a country located in the center of Europe, with big intellectual potential and inhabited by people with imagination.
