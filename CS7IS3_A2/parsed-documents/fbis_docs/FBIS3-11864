In the evening of 23 March 1994, we learned by way of a radio broadcast of the cowardly assassination of Mr. Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. 2. The EZLN again explicitly condemns the use of terrorism to achieve any end. 3. The EZLN deeply deplores the fact that the government cannot resolve its internal problems without bloodying the people. Federal government hardliners who prefer military options hatched and carried out this provocation to annul any peaceful attempt at democratizing the country's political life. 4. The EZLN notes that Mr. Colosio Murrieta always referred to its movement with prudence and respect. His last statements indicated he had a clear commitment to compete on equal terms with other political forces in the nation. He recognized the fact that great injustices exist in the nation, and he noted the great distance between the current regime's words and the implementation of its economic and social policies. Those people whose raunchy voices decry the hope of peace, justice, and dignity -- a hope born in the dialogue in San Cristobal de las Casas -- have now chosen to sacrifice Mr. Colosio Murrieta to signal the disruption of a peaceful transition to liberty, democracy, and justice. 5. The EZLN knows that this crime which has rocked the country is merely a prelude to a large-scale military offensive by the federal government against our positions and forces and that it marks the beginning of a dirty war against all of those honest people who, through different paths, struggle under our same banner of peace and dignity. By arguing that it is necessary to reinforce the regime to avert actions such as the assassination of Mr. Colosio, they attempt to give a political and ideological basis to their indiscriminate repression and to destroy the cease-fire and, consequently, the dialogue for peace. 6. There are clear warning signals that the government is preparing an attempt to impose a military solution in the Chiapas conflict. On 19 March 1994, the EZLN denounced that earlier in the day government aircraft bombed near Comitan and Altamirano on the Mendoza highway. Approximately four incendiary bombs were dropped by these aircraft, starting fires and releasing unusual gases, which makes one think that a dirty war has been initiated. 7. The EZLN has shown proof of its sincere inclination to achieve a just and dignified peace. The government, however, has responded with lies, kidnappings, disappearances, threats, and bombings. Now, with this barbarous slaying of a public figure, its troops are preparing to break the cease-fire. Our forces, which are now in the process of holding consultations within their communities, have decided on the following step in the dialogue for peace and reconciliation: We are now obliged to suspend these consultations [ahora nos vemos obligados a suspender las consultas] and to prepare ourselves to defend our cause and our banner -- the banner of democracy, liberty, and justice. 8. The EZLN is on red alert. Our troops -- up to our last man -- stand ready to defend Zapatist territory. The entry points have been mined and our combatants are girding for an attack by the government. The uncontrolled access to newsmen, which had been part of our policy not to hide anything from the eyes of our people, has been canceled. In view of the imminent government attack, only the access of war correspondents, duly accredited by the EZLN's General Command, will be permitted. Any person unknown to our forces who enters our territory will be apprehended and thoroughly interrogated. Warning banners are waving throughout our territory. The trenches of the Zapatists will now be open to all of those who want democracy, justice, and liberty. 9. Our just struggle is afoot. We are still prepared to follow the path of peace. Those who do not want peace are trying to return war to Mexican territory -- a war being promoted by bad government and its servants. 10. The EZLN reiterates to the entire world its commitment to respect the cease-fire, not to impede the peaceful development of the upcoming elections, and not to stage offensive military actions against government forces anywhere within national territory under the conditions established in our communique of 12 January 1994. If we are attacked, however, our forces will defend to the last man the justness of our aspirations as Mexicans. If our patriotic history demands more bloodshed or that more of our combatants die in the struggle for a true peace -- a peace with justice and dignity -- we will not hesitate to pay the price. With dignity and courage, the faceless will defend the ground in which our dead are buried. We will never again return to a land that shames us. We will never speak again without showing respect for our words. We will continue walking the path of the highest truth, even though this may mean death for many of those who defend Zapatism. [Signed] Subcommander Marcos
