FBIS3-46614 "dreas002_n_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-002 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Jan 1994 Vietnam Vo Van Kiet Addresses Assembly Opening 6 Dec BK0201074694 Hanoi NHAN DAN in Vietnamese 7 Dec 93 p 1-3 BK0201074694 Hanoi NHAN DAN Language: Vietnamese Article Type:BFN [Speech by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at the opening of the fourth session of the Ninth National Assembly in Hanoi on 6 December] [Text] Dear Presidium and delegates: You must have copies of those government reports on its plans and state budget to be presented before the National Assembly. These reports review the implementation of those tasks set forth by the National Assembly in its second session for 1993, evaluate the first three years of implementing the five-year 1991-95 plan, present the course of socioeconomic development for the two remaining years, especially for the year 1994. The National Assembly will hear supplementary reports on national defense and security, on foreign relations, on mountain area socioeconomic development, on the enforcement of the new wage system, and on the fight against corruption and smuggling. The report I am presenting before the National Assembly for consideration will further provide an analysis of a number of assessments and major policies. I. Urgent requirements and ability to enter a new stage of socioeconomic development: 1. In 1993, we have continued to further develop the achievements of 1992, and fulfilled and exceeded all major targets set by the second session of the Ninth National Assembly in its resolution on tasks for 1993. Generally speaking, in the three years from 1991-93, the average annual gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.2 percent, which was higher than planned in the five-year 1991-95 plan. In agricultural production, although there were a number of areas stricken by natural calamities each year, we were still able to achieve our development targets. In 1993 alone, extended drought, typhoons, and floods occured in many central region provinces, but the country was still* able to increase its agricultural production output to 24.5 million tons of food grain, thus attaining the target set forth for the year 1995 [year as published]. In those areas stricken by natural disasters, prices continued to be stable, and production and the people's normal life were promptly restored. The production of various industrial and service establishments belonging to different economic sectors have, in general, adjusted fairly well to the market system. The annual industrial production output increase was higher than planned. Export values and budget revenue rose at a rate higher than that of production growth. Economic relations with foreign countries expanded quickly. Balance of payment was improved, foreign currency inflow adequately met the import demands of those materials and goods needed for production and everyday life. Internal reserves have started to grow. Living standards of a bulk of the people have been improved. The constant growth achieved by many economic sectors in various domains over the past three years shows that our economy now has come out of recession. Along with the economic growth, inflation was dispelled as evidenced by the fact that the inflation rate for the first 11 months of 1993 was merely 4 percent. It is certain that inflation will be at the single-digit level for the whole year. Smuggled goods had some impact on efforts to reduce inflation because they made the price of certain home-made industrial goods less competitive. However, the main factors leading to price stability were the growth of commodity production and circulation, improvements in the regulation and circulation of currency, and the increase in material reserves. This enables us to make interventions whenever there is an unexpected market upheaval. Although there are still unstable factors such as great budget overdraft and small foreign currency reserves, our inflation control ability, in general, shows greater improvements than before. In the cultural and social field, although many important problems still remain to be solved, compared with preceding years, there were better improvements in the implementation of various programs -- such as the program to create employment, the program to popularize elementary education and to gradually improve educational qualities and the research and application of scientific and technological innovations, the program to expand radio and television broadcasting coverage, the epidemic control program, the program to develop physical education and sports, the program to do away with hunger and poverty, and the program to repay the kindness of those who sacrificed their lives for the country. Generally speaking, we were able to overcome by a very significant step the socioeconomic crisis. Most notably, we overcame the economic recession, dispelled inflation, firmly maintained political stability in a very tough and challenging situation where there was no foreign financial aid and where the U.S. embargo was still in place. All these achievements have testified to the vitality and shrewdness of our Vietnamese nation and people, and to the fact that the renovation policy of our party and state has suited the reality of our country. These acheivements have also demonstrated our people's strengths and capability to achieve self reliance. The success of the renovation process is inseparable from our multilateral and diverse external relations policy. This policy has won the sympathy and support from other countries and international organizations and has paved the way for the integration of our country into the world community. The image of a renovating Vietnam wishing to befriend all countries received worldwide welcome and high appraisal, thus creating favorable conditions for our international relations. The following factors have further enhanced our position and strength and created the necessary conditions for a new stage of development: A. A vast majority of our people trust and enthusiastically support the renovation undertaking, regarding this cause as their own because it works for the fulfillment of their goals. Because the economy is well-motivated, it has encouraged production and business activities across society. Socioeconomic activities have not been in completely good order or well organized. Nonetheless, we have succeeded in reviving the people's dynamism and creativity and eliminating the negative attitude created by the state subsidization system. This is a very important factor in development. B. The development environment has enjoyed the following basic factors, which are more favorable: -- First, we have maintained political stability; pursued a policy of peace, friendship, and cooperation; and broadened our relations with almost all the nations in the world. -- Our success in checking inflation has created the conditions for stabilizing microeconomic activities and reduced the risks for development and investment projects. -- Positive efforts have been made to amend and perfect our legal system. C. The material conditions for development -- though still limited by the shortage of capital, technology, marketing, and infrastructure -- still represent a great potential that awaits future exploitation. -- As far as our country is concerned, the economy has begun to show an increase in capital accruement. Between 1991 and 1993, the ratio of investment capital generated by the national economy was 4.8, 6.9, and 12.7 percent respectively compared with the gross domestic product. This shows that we have successfully put an end to the decrease in investment capital accruement which occurred over the past few consecutive years. The sources of capital among the people that can be tapped to serve investment and development remain substantial (it is estimated that in 1993 this capital amounts to 20 trillion dong, of which 8 trillion dong has been used, mostly to cover housing development projects). Our new policies and lines have created a new stimulus in many sectors and occupational areas, especially agriculture and the rural economy, where the people's manpower and material resources play a key role. Along with the state-provided investment capital generated by the national economy and international development aid, we are now retaining more and more material reserves from previous years. It is possible that we can increase them quickly in the future. Regarding the outside world, our ability to acquire capital and technology has grown quickly despite the impact of the U.S. trade embargo. The breakthrough in our credit ties with international financial institutions has strongly stimulated multilateral and bilateral international development aid. A total of 22 countries and 17 international organizations sent delegations to the recent Paris conference of Vietnam's aid donor countries. These countries and international organizations pledged to provide our country with 1.86 billion U.S. dollars in development aid in the 1993-94 fiscal year. Direct foreign investment has continued to increase. It is noteworthy that foreign investment capital for 1993 reached about 800-850 million U.S. dollars, twice the amount invested in 1992. The current pace of foreign investment capital inflow depends mainly on our ability to receive and make effective use of it. The above-mentioned factors present tremendous opportunities for development. Opportunity does not come spontaneously. It comes through the personal efforts of our entire party and people together with the trends of peace, stability, and cooperation in the region and other parts of the world. Opportunity would not have brought us success if we had not seized it and developed it in time. 2. The new stage of development requires an effort to grasp opportunities and the ability to understand clearly those weaknesses, difficulties, and obstacles that must be overcome. A. Our economy is still rife with many factors of instability; this could lead to upheavals. Slow efforts have been made to improve the quality of the socioeconomic infrastructure, which, in some cases, has deteriorated. The savings and investment rates are still low. A substantial part of the people's potential has not been tapped or developed into productive activities. Public assets and state investment funds are being embezzled or seriously wasted. The work force has not yet been brought into full play. Economic efficiency is still low, thus limiting the sources of investment capital and material reserves as well as our ability to improve the people's standard of living. Our market economy is still in the nascent stage. It has not developed fully and has not been managed in a satisfactory way. This is because our legal system is not yet unified, and our abilities and efficiency in macromanagement do not meet requirements. Moreover, weaknesses and negativism are still prevalent in our administration, financial, and banking systems as well as in the state-run business sector. Corruption and smuggling persist and inflation may return. B. Many social changes have been slow, and there are still many tough issues that remain a source of public concern, especially unemployment. Social vices and crime have been on the increase. A considerable number of people are accumulating wealth illegally, while many honest people and those with meritorious national deeds are facing difficulty in their livelihood. C. Now entering the in-depth phase, renovation is growing comprehensive and is experiencing more difficulties. Those with vested interests have been affected. At the same time, renovation requires higher revolutionary awareness and better leadership and management knowledge. Corruption, ineptitude, a poor sense of organization and discipline, and bureaucracy among a considerable number of cadres in many state agencies and organizations at various sectors and echelons -- in both the administrative and trading sectors -- are negating many policies. They are hampering and undermining renovation and reducing the people's confidence. They are a challenge to the party leadership and the state management. Meanwhile, external and internal hostile forces are seeking to sabotage us. They have not missed any opportunity to weaken our internal ranks further. To prevent internal disorder and external manipulation, it is inevitable that we must overcome our subjective shortcomings in leadership and management and the corruption and ineptitude of our contingent of cadres. 3. The greatest challenge to our nation and regime is slow economic development. Poor economic performance will leave our country further behind. We will remain weak and uncompetitive and lose out on international cooperation. In the current world, where the brutal economic race is emerging as the most important issue, further economic decline may lead to political and social instability and may constrain our efforts to consolidate our national defense and security and protect our independence and sovereignty. To meet this challenge, we must promptly seize and make full use of any opportunity to dispel danger. We must carry out socioeconomic development at a quick and steady pace to build a prosperous people, powerful country, and an equal and civilized society. We must strive to narrow the development gap with neighboring countries. These are the people's aspirations and pressing demands. These will also determine the durability of our regime, guarantee national development in accordance with socialist objectives and orientations, and foil enemy schemes and actions to undermine and violate our national sovereignty. The only way to achieve this is to continue to accelerate the renovation process, both in scope and intensity. We must further develop a sense of independence, mastery, and self-reliance; practice thrift for national construction and defense; and broaden international cooperation. Only by developing our internal strengths to the full can we attract and make satisfactory use of our external resources for quick development. Waiting for and relying on external assistance will lead us into a state of dependence and restrain national growth. This is not an understood principle, but reality has proven it to be true. What can we draw on from the above analysis? The conclusion is that in 1994, we can and must open a new era of socioeconomic development in our country. The future GNP growth rate must not be less than 8 percent a year. We must try to double our 1990 GNP by the year 2000, so that the conditions will be set and the momentum generated for more rapid national development as the country enters the 21st century. In previous years, we had to concentrate our efforts on overcoming economic recession and inflation and achieving social and political stability. From the beginning of 1994, although we will still be concerned about stability, we will also have the conditions to allow us to focus our efforts on accelerating economic development and producing more drastic social changes to improve the people's material and spiritual lives. There will be more opportunities for us to consolidate political stability and strengthen national defense and security. This is the way to bring our country through its socioeconomic crisis so that it can enter into stable and steady development. In leadership and management, we must not concentrate on resolving urgent and unexpected issues. Instead, we must resolve fundamental and strategic issues to spur the restructuring of the economy toward industrialization and modernization in order to attain rapid economic growth with higher results and achieve better social order, justice, and progress. Our socioeconomic development course for the next two years and our plan for 1994 are based on that spirit. Here, I would like to clarify further a number of major issues. I will also emphasize each issue that requires deep understanding or a new approach. II. What should be done to ensure quick and long-lasting economic growth? 1. Accelerate investment and development and gradually shift the economic structure toward industrialization and modernization. In the past three years, total investment in the entire society has reached 68.8 trillion dong. Investment is expected to be about 41 trillion dong in 1994, an increase of 32 percent over 1993. In 1995, it will reach about 52 trillion dong. Total investment in five years may equal or exceed the target outlined in the 1991-95 socioeconomic strategy plan extending to the year 2000. It will create a prerequisite for economic development and the improvement of employment in our society. A. What are the capital resources for investment? The most fundamental and important capital resource is domestic savings and reserves. All those who care for the country and uphold the national tradition are aggravated by violations of the public property and lavish expenditures by agencies and state-run enterprises as well as in society. These practices should be condemned, especially when our country is still poor, our people's standard of living is low, and our national reserves are minimal. The government is responsible for formulating and implementing laws and policies to promote thrift and investment and oppose corruption and waste. In leading our nation into a new stage of development, we must formulate measures, mobilize the work force, educate the people to make them realize our nation's important current position, and launch a mass movement to promote thrift and denounce embezzlement, waste, and prodigality. We must strive to create a psychological feeling in society that practices such as buying luxuries and spending lavishly on engagement and wedding parties, funeral services, and other feasts are acts that should be condemned rather than honored. The following are the government's lines and policies on exploiting and using capital investment resources in the years ahead: -- There is great latent potential in capital resources among the people and economic units. This is an effective source of investment that needs to be exploited with suitable policies to encourage savings for production investment. We should promulgate laws soon to encourage domestic investment with preferential conditions similar to those provided for foreign investment. We must implement various forms of shareholding; sell more promissory notes; enhance the capabilities of various enterprises in investment, including state-run enterprises; simplify regulations on business registration for all kinds of business establishments; and strengthen measures to promote investment and improve services. Efforts must be made to encourage domestic investment, especially in projects that do not need sophisticated equipment but can produce essential goods that meet market demands, thus making profit in a short period of time (these includes projects in food processing, hotels, tourism, and so forth). Efforts must also be made to increase the proportion of domestic capital in various projects and joint ventures signed with foreign countries. We must quickly develop the capital market; reform, and improve the activities of the banking and financial system to mobilize idle money for savings accounts, insurance funds, bonds, and shares. We must increase investment credit resources, including government credit. We must quickly expand medium and long-term credit resources to meet the demands for capital for investments in development. We must also satisfactorily prepare conditions that will enable us to experiment with the setting up of stock markets, firstly, in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi. -- Government investment sources include domestic reserves and bilateral and multilateral foreign aid for development (mostly consisting of concessional loans and some gratuitous aid). The foreign aid committed by the recent Paris conference is a benefit. However, we still have to settle old debts to clear the way for foreign credit. We should also realize all the difficulties and complications in using loans from this source. This is so that we can calculate loan effectiveness as well as our repayment capacity to avoid losses and inactivity. -- Government capital from national budget allocations is reserved only for infrastructure projects where the investments cannot be redeemed. Increasingly, mutual credit organizations, partnerships, and shares in enterprises in different economic sectors are a source of investment capital. This investment system will be applied to the 1994 state plan. To efficiently use government capital resources and to avoid loss and wastage, it is necessary to solve the following issues: -- Investment projects must be well-planned and closely connected with long-term regional economic development planning. On that basis, government capital can be reasonably coordinated in a concentrated form, and its dilution avoided. This is the main duty of the State Planning Commission which it must carry out together with its reforms in organization working methods. -- The management of investment capital must be strengthened. Construction prices must be adjusted to suit real conditions. Methods for bidding, planning, construction, and approval must be perfected. We should use foreign and domestic consultancy services in these areas. -- The management structure of state capital investment should be reformed in conformity with experiences learned from the management of foreign concessional loans to our country. -- Approved projects must be timely funded according to the progress in construction. Responsibility for material loss caused by the funding organ to construction projects must be clearly stated. Direct foreign investment is the most important source of foreign capital, which is mainly attracted by a favorable investment environment that contains little risk, disturbance, and trouble. It is important to improve the investment climate. At the same time, we should have policies to attract foreign countries to invest in our preferential sectors and regions. Investment commitment should be closely supervised, especially in the transfer of technology and environmental protection. It is about time that we pay attention not only to investment attractions but also to how registered capital is utilized and how enterprises already in operation are managed. From now on, the main index for foreign investment will be its capital and the effects on the economy. B. Investment orientations for improving the economic structure as an initial step toward national industrialization and modernization under the socioeconomic development strategy from now to the year 2000. In the next two years, we must concentrate our efforts on the following tasks: -- Strive to bring about prominent changes in the structure of agricultural production, and gradually industrialize agriculture and the rural economy in accordance with the party Central Committee's Fifth Plenum resolution. This should be carried out through the use of the people's capital and efforts under state guidance and support. Market demands at home and abroad and new and current production conditions have enabled us to become self-reliant while concentrating more efforts on improving agricultural production. All regions, especially mountainous and coastal areas, must strive to improve their production structure and develop their advantages to contribute to fighting poverty and hunger effectively. Effort must be made to provide more electricity to promote and accelerate agro-forestry-fishery processing industries at various levels. This will help improve the socioeconomic condition in rural areas, while building more agro-industrial economic models to strengthen the multisectoral economy. -- We must attract foreign investment and encourage domestic investment to exploit and process natural resources covering bare hills and mountains, and develop export production and services to create more jobs. These are the main sources of capital for forming a new industrialized and modernized structure. -- The state must concentrate its investment in infrastructure projects, especially in the electrical transmission system, land and railway routes, seaports and airports, water reservoirs, internal telecommunications; and scientific, industrial, cultural, and social research institutions as well as education and public health services. -- We must conduct research, anticipate, and correctly pick key development areas for the future, so that timely and essential preparations for further development can be made. -- We must manage, supervise, and strictly control the import of technical and technological equipment. The import of obsolete and expensive technical equipment for production especially those that pollute the environment must be strictly reviewed and controlled, especially when the state budget is used to buy such equipment. -- Accelerate the planning process for major economic areas in three regions and develop the locomotive effect that stimulates development in other areas. Plans for each area should accomodate its full potential and advantages in close association with the activities of major economic areas. The state shall support and take priority in giving foreign gratuity to areas with difficulties, especially border areas and offshore islands, areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, and sites of the former revolutionary bases. The state shall also focus assistance on the building of socioeconomic infrastructure projects, while formulating appropriate mechanism and plans to help regions and localities exploit their capabilities for further development. The government recently worked with localities that still have numerous difficulties in determining orientations for development, concentrating on a number of programs and objectives from now until the year 2000 aimed at overcoming poverty and underdevelopment, thereby creating a prerequisite for rapid development in the 21st century. While carrying out national projects to improve electric, transportation, and communications network, provinces in the central coastal region should concentrate efforts on the following key projects: First, the preservation and planting of forest trees in close association with the settlement of nomads and protection of the environment. Second, the improvement and adjustment of crop patterns to avoid natural disasters, the planting of appropriate industrial crops on denuded hills, and promotion of the processing industry and development of livestock breeding on a larger scale. Third, the exploitation, raising, and processing of aquatic products in close association with the efforts to protect coastal areas and offshore islands. And fourth, the provision of sufficient water for agriculture, forestry, industry, and domestic use in rural areas. Provinces in the Central Highlands should also concentrate their efforts on carrying out these projects (excluding the production of aquatic products). They should make more efforts to improve forestry, plant more industrial crops, strengthen livestock breeding, and promote processing industries. The northern highland provinces need to concentrate on building a socioeconomic infrastructure with the support of the central government. This includes a transportation, power, water supply, and communications network; education and training facilities, especially boarding schools for ethnic children; tertiary education and research establishments; a public health care network from the tribes, hamlets, and villages up to districts and provinces; the transmission of radio and television programs; and the development of cultural and information services aimed at restoring and developing the unique cultural characteristics of ethnic peoples. In economic development, we must improve the economic structure of planting, animal husbandry, industry, services, and skills according to the party Political Bureau resolutions, government decisions on socioeconomic development in mountainous areas, and Government Directive No. 525 on practical guidelines and policies. The highland provinces and districts must remain close to the grassroots level and review experiences in order to build their own economic development models that suit local conditions and ethnic characteristics. The government will choose the most difficult mountainous province and district to supervise directly and draw experiences. In early 1994, the government will work with localities in the Red River delta and the Mekong River delta to establish directions for their economic development. 2. Exploiting the potential and enhancing the work efficacy of economic sectors. Uniform implementation of the multisector economic policy is a significant factor that greatly contributes to the success of renovation. We have to continue renovating and implementing effective mechanisms and policies on different economic sectors in a satisfactory manner, however, in order to unleash the production force completely. A. As a poor and underdeveloped nation, and with the aim of building the national economy and ensuring the state's role in a macromanagement system, Vietnam must strive to guide and help the economic sectors develop further along a socialist orientation. Efforts must absolutely be made to develop state-run economic and business enterprises. It is necessary to say that state-run economic enterprises do not just include business establishments, but also financial and banking institutions as well as national reserves, land assets, and other state properties. We must have a panoramic view of the state-run economy in order to manage, preserve, and develop national assets effectively. Ownership of all national assets must be defined. We must urgently carry out the allocation of land and forests to peasant households, concretely resolve land problems in urban areas and zones used by enterprises, build houses for sale or rent, and sell or rent enterprises or other establishments that the state no longer wants to operate. These tasks must be performed in line with the government's uniform guidelines, and money derived from the sale or rental must be transferred to the state budget. Although state-run enterprises have been reorganized even further, their structures are not rational and key sectors have not been properly integrated. Many state-run enterprises are too small, are equipped with outdated machinery, and are operating at very low efficiency. Therefore, on the one hand, we must continue to arrange and correct those enterprises in a more urgent and resolute manner. We must differentiate public service enterprises -- which serve the common demand and benefit socioeconomic development, so the government needs to have appropriate structure and management systems -- from business enterprises whose existence and development depends completely on their business performance. On the other hand, we need to continue developing state enterprises in some necessary sectors and domains, such as grassroots establishments and some production enterprises that require a large capital and high technology, especially in heavy industry. The government will concentrate on changing some state enterprises in key areas into strong economic organizations that compete strongly in the international market and enjoy high efficiency. This will provide important financial contributions to the state budget. These enterprises must be reorganized and connected with commercial banks, import-export companies, and national and international transport services to form major economic organizations. The important thing is that the connection must be based on mutual economic benefit, ownership relations, and development strategies; not on administration arrangements. State enterprises compete and cooperate with enterprises from other economic sectors. In the process of forming big economic corporations, enterprises from other economic sectors can join in the form of collective ownership. For those enterprises no longer under state management, we should definitely settle them by transferring their ownership, lending out, merging with other establishments, or abolishing them. Realities at many agricultural units, forestry sites, trade and business establishments, and transport corporations show that the application of the contractual system and the transfer of some machinery and equipment to the workers at state-run enterprises have brought about remarkable economic results. One of the most effective measures to create enthusiasm among workers, to overcome the condition that no one is responsible for state properties, and to oppose negativism is to introduce a shareholding system at state enterprises. This will allow civil servants and workers to share ownership at these establishments. To carry out this task, efforts must made to clearly define the proportions of shares to be held by the state, those for the workers, and those for sale to private organizations and individuals and to foreign businessmen, and so forth. The government has been slow in drawing practical experiences, formulating legal documents, and providing training and guidance to introduce the shareholding system to state enterprises. By looking at actual situations, we now understand that the state management function over all enterprises, regardless of different forms of ownership, must be clearly detached from the ownership-related function over the state enterprises. All the ownership-related functions should be concentrated on a state organ responsible for the management of all public capital and property and representing the state ownership in public companies. This organ is also charged with the duty to select officials who will become government representatives in the management boards of public companies where the government has invested. Consequently, the structure allowing the management of government ministries and departments over economic enterprises and the confusion arising from state management function and ownership-related function and the discrimination between the central economy and the local economy will have no reason to exist. B. Efforts must be made to renovate cooperatives, develop the economic autonomy of cooperative members, and strengthen new economic cooperation in the rural areas in accordance with the party Central Committee's Fifth Plenum resolution. We must review experiences to provide guidance and assistance to build and develop various appropriate economic cooperation at various sectors and occupations. C. It is essential to abolish regulations banning or creating difficulties for individual and private trade. At the same time, we must strengthen law enforcement to oppose unregistered business, counterfeiting, tax evasion, or other illegal activities. The law clearly clarifies all banned trades and services and those that need to obtain a license before operating. Besides this limit, all business investments meeting all regulated conditions, irrespective of individual or private business, only need to register for their business, provided that they will conduct their business as registered. We must apply a credit policy that works on the socioeconomic result and repayment capacity and that does not discriminate against any economic sectors. Under that spirit, we will increase credit percentage to the collective economy, individuals, and private business, especially peasant households. D. We must create a clear framework for healthy business operation and competition and strictly deal with illegal business practices from any economic sectors. We must reexamine all cases of trade monopoly so that we can apply measures to limit the bureaucratic practice in the provision of goods and services. The government will provide favorable conditions and active support for the establishment of contingent of able businessmen of all levels, from the heads of a family business to managers of major corporations, considering this as a decisive factor to develop the economy in an active, efficient, and discipline manner. 3. Expanding Economic Relations with Foreign Countries. We are enjoying new favorable conditions in international relations at present. However, in expanding and enhancing the efficiency of foreign trade, we must rely on production development in accordance with the open door economic structure while strengthening exports and diversifying trade relations with the outside world. New prospects for attracting foreign capital and technology require intensive efforts to develop domestic potential and maintain close management if we are to welcome and use these sources of foreign capital satisfactorily. Meanwhile, we must increase our macromanagement abilities in an effort to avoid hasty investments, as this may lead to imbalances and renewed inflation. We must continue to ensure that exports develop at a faster pace than the economy (which is expected to increase 20 percent by 1994 and 25 percent by 1995) while making gradual efforts to improve the range of exports. The consumer market is emerging as a very important factor in production. Production in general -- and exports in particular -- must proceed from market demand. We must not turn out products before efforts are made to search for markets. The increase in certain processed goods -- such as knitwear items, garments, and aquatic products -- is currently quite large. Yet some export-oriented products -- including mineral ores and farm produce -- are mainly raw. They continue to account for a large proportion of exports and have been exported through middlemen. There is still a lack of stable markets for a wide range of export-oriented goods. Therefore, increasing processing capabilities -- particularly for farm produce -- must be given top priority in our investment promotion policies, including the policy to promote foreign investment. From 1994 on, we must map out and implement a plan to develop major export goods (with an annual export value exceeding $100 million). We must harmoniously tackle various issues, ranging from investment capital obtained from various sources to various state structural policies, and from production and exploitation to processing and consumption, in a gradual effort to create a steady source of customers in the world market. Economic sectors and establishments must renovate their technology so they can turn out high-quality products (of all categories, designs, and packaging styles) at an attractive price for local and foreign markets. We must be very strict on quality standards for exports and in the observance of contracts, in an effort to maintain our credibility. The government will introduce administrative regulations governing those goods bearing the "Made in Vietnam" trademark. Production establishments must improve their ability to approach markets in an effort to take the initiative in finding customers. We must develop the role of chambers of commerce and trade in support of various businesses. We must reorganize our work in statistical and economic information. Not only will this benefit leadership and management activities, but it will meet the needs of businessmen. We must broaden our activities in existing markets, restore our traditional markets (China, former Soviet republics, and East European countries), and explore new markets (such as the European, Middle East, African, and Latin American markets). We must prepare to enter the U.S. market when conditions permit. To promote vigorous exports further, we must continue to renovate our management mechanism, narrow the range of products under quota management; reduce red tape, particularly in the granting of licenses; and promptly deal with fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate. Imports must be placed under tight control through the tariff policy, foreign exchange rate, customs controls, and other necessary administrative measures. Efforts to limit imports to protect local products must be carried out resolutely and constantly, both at entry points and on the local market. Measures must be taken against the smuggling of cheap imports, as this may cause stagnation in the sale of local products. It is important that local products meet highly diversified demands, suit the tastes of various consumers, and become increasingly competitive with foreign goods. In the future, the number of foreign visitors entering Vietnam and overseas Vietnamese returning home to visit will grow rapidly. This requires the tourism-hotel sector to achieve extraordinary growth, both in terms of material conditions and service quality. In building new hotels, attention must be paid to mobilizing capital from domestic sources in various forms. Efforts must be made to shift hotels and guesthouses from various public organs and enterprises to the system of business accounting. We must renovate and upgrade a number of these facilities to travel lodges. 4. Renovating and improving the financial, monetary, and credit situation. A. The 1994 budget faces great financial needs for investment, development, and solutions to social problems. As the volume of foreign investment capital increases rapidly, we must ensure there is sufficient domestic capital to match it. Therefore, we must follow a new approach to ensure budget equilibrium. State revenues, which come from domestic collections and nonrefundable international aid, must be used to meet regular spending, pay debts, and cover investment and development costs (in 1994, we will have to allot about 15 percent of our state revenues for this purpose and probably more in subsequent years). Regarding the lack of additional state revenues to carry out investment and development plans, we must rely on capital borrowed from the people (let's increase the ratio of mid- and long-term loans step by step) and from foreign countries (from now on, let's apply only for long-term foreign loans at low interest rates to meet investment and development goals). Definite steps must be taken not to circulate new money to serve budgetary and credit purposes. Regarding those funds that the government has obtained from foreign countries at low interest rates to assist various projects -- including infrastructure projects -- which are likely to generate sufficient income to help pay back capital, they must be shifted to the form of state credit loans under which the beneficiaries are duty bound to make fair payments on both principal and interest. This is the only way to generate income to pay for foreign debts. By the way, it is worth saying something about the amount of foreign debt now due. These are relatively enormous figures. They include loans we had to borrow to make up for spending under the state subsidization mechanism, namely materials for production, grain, and certain kinds of consumer products. Regarding foreign loans to import equipment, a number of production installations have made good use of these loans. Generally speaking, however, some of those loans have generated insignificant results, while others have not been put to use yet. To pay for our debts, we do not have any alternatives other than making efforts to develop our economy and improve its performance. Therefore, it is necessary to make use of all kinds of new loans at low interest rates and work out tight management measures to guarantee effective use, thus helping make the economy stronger and capable of generating income to pay for both old and new debt, increase state revenue, and improve the standard of living. Immediate measures, however, must be taken to end the unhealthy situation in which we fail to exert close control and management over the application for foreign loans by the various sectors and localities, as well as to the bad practice of many foreign loan beneficiaries who, once they are unable to pay their debts, shift the entire burden to the state. Efforts must be made to improve the tax collection system, reduce tariffs for some goods that need promotion, apply a modestly higher tax rate to suit the conditions in our country, strive to collect all taxes levied on imported goods, and improve tax collection to help increase the proportion of procurement derived from the gross domestic product (GDP) (in 1994 it is estimated at 24 percent). The budget deficit in 1994 should be lower than that of 1993, and lower than 5 percent by 1995. The main source of capital to offset the budget deficit comes from investment and low-interest loans from other countries. While we are striving to increase our national budget, we must promote business activities, encourage people to practice thrift, and invest in and improve the production of goods so as to increase income. Efforts must be made to rationally settle capital depreciation at state-run establishments to ensure their continued operation, especially those at the grass-roots level. Efforts must also be made to improve the management of the state budget in conformity with the objectives and division of authority and responsibility defined for the various levels of the administration; grant more budget authority to ministers for specialized projects related to the work of their ministries; and accelerate the promulgation of the law on the state budget. I would like to stress here again that while implementing various financial measures, we must strive to overcome such negative practices as lavish spending, using state funds to buy gifts, and organizing feasts to celebrate founding or major anniversaries. The government will issue regulations on these expenditures. The regulations will clearly define prohibition on unessential expenditure and ask the people to monitor and expose violations. For the immediate future, during the forthcoming Vietnamese Lunar New Year, we must stop using state funds to buy gifts for officials of various state organizations, regardless of their positions. Banking service: The State Bank, with its increasing authority for regulating money circulation, must closely observe market indicators to control the amount of currency in circulation, ensure that inflation will be kept to the single digit-level, and stabilize the value of the dong. In 1994, the bank must concentrate its resources and apply many measures, including the computerization of its services, to ensure speedy and convenient services in all situations. It must designate appropriate interest rates to attract all enterprises and people to deposit their money and use the banking services. We must have measures to deal with high interest rates on credit, which are causing difficulties for business and obstructing development investment. We have to build and develop an inter-banking market for both Vietnamese and foreign currencies so that we can regulate capital resources and encourage the development of a capital market. The bank must quickly expand the non-cash transaction services by applying more advanced methods. It is necessary to forestall high inflation and great fluctuation in exchange rates when foreign currency resources are increased rapidly. The exchange rates between the dong and the U.S. dollar must be settled step by step to stabilize the true exchange rate (in consideration with the fluctuation of the dong and other foreign currencies) in order to encourage exports, limit the import of unnecessary goods, but not cause sudden price fluctuations. The application and repayment of foreign loans by enterprises, departments, and localities must be closely supervised. Regulations on loan guarantees and loan applications from business enterprises should be introduced quickly. Foreign currency management should continue to improve to create favorable conditions for the dong to be exchanged freely with foreign currencies, making it the only transaction medium in the country. Commercial banks which play a major role in the capital market must develop their loan activities in the direction mentioned previously. Public credit groups should be established after drawing experiences from experimental groups. Relations between the State Bank and the commercial banks and public credit groups must be reformed under the philosophy that the supervisory role of the State Bank must be maintained. The State Bank must not interfere with the credit and transaction activities of commercial banks. It must create a healthy competitive environment between commercial banks, including foreign banks. A banking association should be established. We must increase the training of bank officials and improve the management and quality of banking services. III. Resolve Various Socioeconomic Issues More Satisfactorily: Realizing that linking economic development with cultural and social development is the tradition of our people, the character of our regime, and the trend of our era, the government has given priority to preparing plans and funds to guide various cultural and social activities. In 1993, although many sectors concerned have not attained their desired results, they made some improvements through the use of government funds and contributions from the public. The country is embarking on a new era of development. This means that from now on, the relationship between economic growth and cultural and social development will have more favorable conditions. This relationship should be dealt with in a more balanced and harmonious manner. Economic development, as explained previously, includes the settlement of many very important and fundamental social issues such as the creation of jobs and increasing the people's income. Cultural and social development has other demands which require each person to contribute attention, effort, wisdom, money, lifestyle, psychology, and opinion. The government is responsible for policies, measures, and funds to create favorable conditions for this undertaking to enhance development, under the direction that the government and people should work together with possible contributions from local and foreign organizations. The 1994 draft plan outlines realistic measures and increases funding for educational and cultural activities; scientific research; and public health, physical education, sports, and family planning services. I would like to emphasize the following issues: A. First, we must improve the people's intellectual standard, provide additional training to the contingent of laborers and cadres, and train the succeeding generations. Given our current requirements, this is a very important task aimed at preparing for our country's long-term development, especially for embarking on the 21st century with more drastic development measures. We must not only improve the quality of teaching and studying in all educational institutions in conformity with the requirements for socioeconomic development, but also mobilize all forces in society, from families to mass organizations, including mass media agencies, to improve the educational level of the entire society and to create more potential for advancement among the youths, who will strive for their own personal achievement as well as for the national interest. The arrangement of employment for newly graduated students must be given attention through assistance measures taken by the state and by various mass organizations and families. This will contribute greatly to encouraging students to study harder. We must create conditions for the contingent of intellectuals to dedicate their intelligence and talents to the country and to earn a good living with their own careers. The government will welcome and create conditions for those Vietnamese intellectuals living abroad to participate in socioeconomic development in their country in various areas of work and under various suitable forms. B. Greater attention must be paid to improving the health of the people of various strata. Specifically, we must concern ourselves with improving the health of the entire people, ranging from children to mothers to the aged for the sake of our national construction now and for future generation. Along with government guidance and further budget assistance, we must step up physical education and sports activities, preliminary health care, disease prevention and treatment, family planning, and so forth. We must strive to launch a movement to carry out these tasks in a wide and far-reaching manner with the participation of all individuals, families, schools, mass organizations, and the rest of society. In 1994, the government will allocate more funds and provide better guidance for implementing various measures to provide health care for people in the mountain regions and for ethnic minority compatriots. We must dispel and then proceed toward eradicating all social diseases and resolve the issue of water supplies for our compatriots. C. Improving the intellectual standard and protecting public health are essential conditions for averting and dispelling social vices, especially prostitution, drug addiction, and the danger of being infected with HIV virus as this disease is spreading and causing indignation and concern among the people. As early as 1993, the government issued a directive with drastic measures aimed at preventing and dispelling these social vices, but implementation is, however, still slow. The administration at various levels must cooperate with mass and social organizations in reviewing and profoundly analyzing the movement to fight social vices in the past, draw on lessons of good works and failures, become familiar with the experiences of other countries in order to take practical and effective measures suitable to our country's situation. The government will create better conditions and provide more financial support for these tasks. Most importantly, various authorities in the local administration at the provincial, city, district, village, and ward levels must strive to seriously carry out their functions and duties and take responsibility in curbing social vices in their areas. IV. Develop Our New Advantages in Diplomatic Activities: On the basis of the successes of the renovation process and taking into account our correct foreign policy, our positive and dynamic diplomatic activities have helped create a favorable international environment for the cause of national construction and defense and for improving the position of Vietnam in the international arena as an active member of the trend toward peace, stability, and cooperation in this region and the world over. We have consistently restored and expanded the relations of friendship and cooperation with neighboring and other countries in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. We have agreed to settle conflicts through peaceful negotiations. The relations of cooperation between our country and many developed nations have expanded, while our relations with traditional friendly countries and nonaligned nations have been strengthened. In 1993 we also restored relations with international financial and monetary organizations while strengthening cooperation with the ASEAN and the EC. From this forum, on behalf of the government and people of Vietnam, allow me to once again express my gratitude for the goodwill, effective cooperation, and valuable assistance given by the many countries and international organizations to Vietnam's renovation and development process. This assistance was clearly reflected at the recent Paris donors conference. I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to reassert that Vietnam always wants to befriend all countries in the international community in the struggle for peace, independence, and development. As for the government and people of the United States, we advocate closing the past and look toward the future, ready to establish normal relations on the basis of equality, mutual respect, and without any preconditions. Not only will this conform to the aspirations and interests of the two peoples, but this will also be beneficial to peace, security, and stability in the region. From the vivid reality of implementing our foreign policy, we can confirm that in the international background of many complicated changes, although we have to deal with many challenges, we have opportunities to create and develop multifaceted relations with all nations and international organizations. This should be attributed to our effort in the struggle to defend our national independence and sovereignty, our determination to attain self-reliance, and our efforts to carry out national development while maintaining national characteristics under the banner of peace, cooperation, and development. This will continuously improve our country's prestige and position in the international community, thus positively serving the cause of national construction and defense. Achievements in the renovation and national development and the effective expansion of multifaceted cooperation with foreign countries have served as a base for strengthening our diplomatic activities. Our foreign policy for the days ahead will be carried out and developed in depth in accordance with this fundamental orientation. V. Enhancing the government's management efficiency: In 1993, the government concentrated efforts on directing the implementation of 10 major tasks and directly dealt with a number of urgent problems and worked with many local governments to define development orientations and work out problem-solving methods. Those efforts have, together with the very great endeavors of our entire party, people, and armed forces, led to our socioeconomic achievements in the past year. However, much remains to be done to enhance the government's management efficiency. The functions of state management in the market economy require that our state apparatus, first of all, our administrative apparatus, be fully competent and pure to perform their functions as stipulated by law. This is a very important part of our efforts to build a law-governed Vietnamese state which truly belongs to, comes from, and works for the people. As the renovation cause proceeds further, it will become more difficult and complicated and necessitate efforts to combine economic reform with administrative restructuring to ensure a rational course of action and coordination to implement the overall reform program. Measures must be taken to overcome the lack of uniformity, coordination, and even agreement when it comes to directing the implementation of the reform program as we have experienced in the past. The government's management efficiency is guaranteed and enhanced only when its management function is carried out in a concentrated and uniform manner and only efforts are exerted to overcome all indications of departmentalism and regionalism as well as to get rid of corruption and purify our state apparatus. In 1994, marked progress must be made to overcome the government's management drawbacks to create conditions for our renovation process and socioeconomic development program to advance a step further. As an immediate objective, concentrated and urgent efforts must be made to resolve a number of high-priority problems as follows: -- At present, there is an urgent need to create the legal framework for all economic activities under the market mechanism. First of all, we must accelerate the legislative work program by combining efforts to build or amend a number of laws still in effect with endeavors to formulate basic legal documents, especially the civil code and business law. This requires the formation of a contingent of experts to study and complete the legislative work program as scheduled. May I suggest that the National Assembly spend more time on its legislative work to meet the requirements of the economic reform program. The government will formulate regulations to ensure that law enforcement documents are promulgated in time. It will also work to enhance the efficiency of law enforcement agencies, regarding this move as an important part of the administrative reform program. Law enforcement instruments go hand in hand with financial, monetary, and planning apparatus. They must all be applied in a uniform manner to manage macro-economic activities under the market mechanism. -- It is necessary to define the power of administrative organs at all levels, first of all their power to formulate rules and regulations, bearing in mind the need to work toward the formulation of uniform policies to ensure strict implementation of government decisions. Efforts must be made to overcome departmentalism, arbitrariness, no discipline, and the situation in which ministries, sectors, or local people's committees issue legal documents at variance with government decisions. In 1994, we should work out plans to abolish administrative organs' control over business establishments. Then, on that basis, let's reduce the sizes of ministries, agencies under the management of the government, and local administrative organs at all levels. This is a very important move because it will not only make our mechanisms less bulky and bureaucratic, but also will help overcome regionalism which prevails in the management systems of different sectors and localities. Presently, the administration procedure is too superfluous and complicated. It is encouraging the practice of authoritarianism, extortion, and corruption by many cadres and officials when the people need to register something or apply for certain permission. It also creates obstacles and difficulties in work relations between different government offices. This situation causes difficulties and expenses for the public and arouses indignation in society. In 1994, the government will carry out reform of administrative procedures under the principle of both providing convenience to the public and safeguarding the state management of the government. The reform will, first, concentrate on areas that are experiencing negative phenomena, causing inconveniences to many people and obstructing business activities. This task must be carried out under deliberated plans with close supervision and control of the agencies concerned. Efforts must be made to motivate mass organizations and the people to participate in this task, especially the contribution of ideas to amend and apply various administrative procedures. We must strive to urgently promulgate administrative law to serve as a legal base for building administrative apparatus and formulating civil servant regulation as well as for setting up an administrative tribunal to settle the people's complaints against administrative agencies and officials. One of the most important tasks is to train and enhance the capability of our civil servants, step by step standardize administrative positions, and revise procedures on recruiting and assigning civil servants. We must formulate appropriate plans to carry out this task to produce a contingent of capable civil servants who can handle their duties effectively, especially those who hold key positions at administrative agencies at the central level or in provinces and municipalities. Dear National Assembly deputies: Our nation and people have a tradition of steadfastness. We have, on many occasions, proved our capabilities in overcoming acute ordeals to survive and develop further, thus creating various historical turning points. Presently, while we have great opportunities to develop our country we also face numerous difficulties and ordeals. The government, however, places its confidence in our nation and the people who always uphold the spirit of patriotism and self-reliance, develop their intelligence and creativity, and maintain their diligence for labor productivity. Together with the National Assembly and the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the government will do its best to strengthen the great national unity bloc comprising all nationalities, religions, and people's strata at home and abroad. We will create a favorable environment and conditions for all people to do their best to amass wealth for themselves and for the nation. We will create necessary conditions for our people to enter the 21st century with firm capabilities to help extricate our country from its situation as a poor and underdeveloped nation. With the wholeheartedness and strong determination of the entire people to advance along the path chosen by our party, we will definitely miss no opportunity in striving to fulfill all tasks set by the National Assembly for 1994, thereby ushering in a new stage for socioeconomic development in our country. Thank you very much for your attention.
