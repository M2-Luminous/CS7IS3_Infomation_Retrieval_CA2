Ilyukhin, Chairman of the State Duma Security Committee: "Half Their Ill-Gotten Gains as a Bribe: There Are Some People Who Do Not Like the Anticorruption Laws"] [Text] On 13 May 1994 the State Duma adopted on first reading the draft laws "On Combating Corruption" and "On Amendments and Additions to the RSFSR Criminal Code and the RSFSR Criminal Procedure Code." The drafts were submitted by deputies S. Boskholov, V. Kolmakov, and V. Kosykh, members of the State Duma Security Committee, and the author of these lines. Clearly not everyone knows that in 1993 the bullet-riddled Russian Federation Supreme Soviet adopted the law "On Combating Corruption" but President B. Yeltsin refused to sign it, even though such a law had long been needed. The changes that have taken place in the social and state system inevitably caused drastic changes in the character of crime and the forms in which it is manifested. Crime today is more organized and ruthless, better armed and larger in scale, more professional and transnational. We still have not fully realized or calculated the colossal harm that has been and is being caused to ordinary workers and the intelligentsia through the replacement of collective forms of labor and social ownership by predatory private ownership, egoism, and self-seeking. In Russia today at least 3 million citizens a year are victims of criminal acts. According to Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] statistics, there are more than 150 major criminal communities operating on the country's territory. There are over 35,000 economic sites within their sphere of influence. By virtue of its destructive consequences and the massive loss of human life incurred, crime has become a Russian national disaster. Crime has become politicized and seeks to seize the leading positions in the echelons of power. Criminal groupings now exert direct influence on the adoption of administrative decisions not only at rayon, city, and oblast level but at republic level, too. They try to influence the legislative process. And their ringleaders and ideological inspirers view the path to power as the path to self-preservation. All spheres of the shadow economy -- drug trafficking, smuggling, prostitution, and gambling dens -- are under the complete control of organized crime. It has managed to take control of industrial production, diamond and gold extraction, the oil industry, and the credit and finance system. According to Russian Academy of Sciences Analysis Center estimates, 55 percent of the capital and 80 percent of the voting shares in Russia are in the hands of criminal or foreign capital. This is happening not without the assistance of the Russian Federation State Committee for the Management of State Property, headed by Vice Premier A. Chubays. The increase in income from crime has spawned the large-scale expansion of corruption in the state apparatus from the bottom upward, and especially in the upper echelons of power. I would probably not be wrong if I said that Russia today has the most corrupt executive it has ever had in its entire history. And whereas in the eighties crooks spent up to 35 percent of their ill-gotten gains on bribing officials, now they spend 50 percent or more for the purpose. Corruption has affected the state structures, the credit and finance system, and business like a blight. It has become a dangerous brake on the transformations in the country, is nullifying the effectiveness and significance of all state programs, and it has jeopardized the country's national security, constitutional rights, and civil liberties. In 1993 more than 52,000 corruption-related crimes were exposed. Of those people prosecuted for such actions, 42.7 percent were ministry, committee, or local power structure personnel, 25.8 percent were law enforcement agency employees, 11.3 percent were employed in the credit and finance system, 2.2 percent were deputies, and 3.8 percent were monitoring agency staff. In the banking system 4,300 crimes were exposed -- mainly instances of theft, bribery, and abuse of position. The area which suffered most from lawbreaking was the privatization process, implemented under the control of and with the participation of the State Committee for the Management of State Property. Last year alone the Prosecutor's Office challenged over 2,200 unlawful privatization documents, registered more than 2,500 complaints about violations that had been exposed, and filed 677 law suits. Around 1,000 officials had disciplinary, administrative, and material proceedings instituted against them. So there is no point in Mr Chubays' railing against just criticism of his activity. He is personally to blame for the destructive character of privatization, which is disastrous for Russia. Much is being written and said about the pernicious effects of corruption today, first and foremost by B. Yeltsin and the Russian Government. However, no radical measures have yet been taken to nip it in the bud. The presidential structures include an enormous legal administration. You might think that this administration ought to prepare draft legislative acts aimed at preventing corruption. But no. The drafts were prepared by deputies and a group of academics and law enforcement agency practical personnel who are fanatically devoted to their cause and who feel deeply for Russia's destiny. The funding of the state's anticrime program for 1994-1995 is now being cut to the bone by that same government. Thus it is saying one thing but doing something completely different. That is why, despite the massive scale of the bribery of officials, the number of people convicted of bribe-taking last year was around 700, as against 1986 when 3,450 people were convicted of these offenses. As you can see, there is an enormous discrepancy here. But that is not the only point. Even the draft laws that we do propose are torpedoed. Most often they are rejected within the presidential and government structures as well as by deputies from or connected with ministries. During the vote on first reading the anticorruption laws were opposed by the Russia's Choice faction and, specifically, by its leaders Ye. Gaydar, G. Burbulis, M. Mityukov, G. Yakunin, and E. Panfilova. Clearly this is no coincidence either. For many people corruption has become a major source of personal wealth and an effective means of bringing down the country. As for the official arguments cited by the opponents of the draft laws that were presented, they essentially constitute a long list of unsubstantiated accusations. I shall dwell on just a few of them. Our opponents claim that the drafts are imperfect. Of course they have shortcomings. But the draft laws were only given a first reading. That should be followed by the second and third readings, which enable the imperfections to be remedied. It was suggested to us that amendments be made to the existing Criminal Code. But it is out of date, and work is now underway on a new code of criminal legislation. A large group of deputies and eminent academic lawyers well known both at home and abroad spent a long time working on the draft laws. They have been compiled on the basis of an in-depth study of Russian life and legal practice. When they were being elaborated account was taken of foreign experience in combating corruption, of the law in the United States, the FRG, Italy, and other countries, and the opinion of foreign experts. Particular attention was paid to the materials of the Eighth UN Crime Prevention Congress held in Havana in August-September 1990. The congress firmly advised all countries of the world community to prepare a strategy for fighting corruption as a priority area in the economic and social development of society. In our opinion, if the drafts that we proposed to the State Duma are adopted as laws they will constitute a major barrier and effective antidote to the pernicious influence of corruption. They apply not only to state employees but also to employees of the local organs of self-government and the armed forces, judges, deputies and their aides, people's assessors, and jurors, as well as to employees of banks and other credit and finance institutions and transport and communications establishments and their enterprises, regardless of the form of ownership. It is proposed that once the drafts are legally enacted they will apply throughout Russian territory. According to these drafts persons seeking to perform state functions freely undertake an obligation not to allow their status to be used for unofficial personal or group purposes. Control measures of a disciplinary, financial, and criminal law nature are envisaged. State employees and their equivalent will be required to submit an annual declaration of their income and declare all bank accounts, including those held abroad, as well as property outside Russia together with the full address. State employees are forbidden to hold more than one post or to take part in the activity of commercial joint-stock companies. The draft laws offer a reliable protection against extortion, cash handouts, and dubious gifts concealing graft. It should be noted that under the draft law on combating corruption not only by physical persons but also by legal persons, organizations, and commercial structures can be penalized for trying to bribe officials or furnish them with other material advantages.
