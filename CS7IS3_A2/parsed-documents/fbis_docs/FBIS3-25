Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-10MAR94-ISRAEL Rabin, Peres Hint At Dismantling Settlements In the wake of the Hebron massacre, both Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have hinted that the Israeli Government is laying the groundwork for dismantling a few controversial Jewish settlements. Both leaders appear concerned to present any such action as a unilateral Israeli decision to head off criticism that they are bowing to Palestinian demands on the settlements, an issue which was to have been deferred to final status negotiations under the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP). Rabin seemed deliberately vague in a recent interview when asked if he favored moving settlers from the town of Hebron, where several small settler enclaves have become a focus of attention following the massacre. He first said "I will not answer" the question, then went on to point out that the DOP did not call for moving settlements during the current phase of negotiations. Therefore, he continued, there is no requirement to move any settlers "on the basis of the negotiations with the PLO" and the matter is "currently not on the agenda" of the negotiations, a position that seemed to leave open the possibility of action taken outside the framework of Israel- Palestinian talks. Rabin also hinted that he is willing to negotiate with Yasir 'Arafat over the PLO leader's demand for an armed international observer force in the occupied territories, twice telling his interviewer "I do not conduct negotiations with ['Arafat] through you" when pressed on the matter (IDF radio, 8 March). Peres, who prior to the massacre had openly questioned the justification for preserving a small settlement in the Gaza Strip, (Qol Yisra'el radio, 12 February) reportedly echoed Rabin's remarks on settlements in speaking with journalists on 8 March. As reported by The Jerusalem Post the next day, he said that "public opinion must be prepared for the possible dismantling of some settlements," but that the question of settlements "is an internal Israeli affair" and "completely divorced from the current negotiations with the PLO." He explained that the Israeli Government had insisted on deferring the settlement issue to final status negotiations while negotiating the DOP in order to minimize public opposition to the DOP. The government, he said, would "seek to convince the public" that evacuating some settlements "needs to be done," but "it cannot come as a result of PLO demands." (AUTHOR: MORTON.
