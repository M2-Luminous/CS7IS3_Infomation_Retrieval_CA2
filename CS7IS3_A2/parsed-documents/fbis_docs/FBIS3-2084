Second, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee held late last year formulated the general framework of China's market economy. The two points on both ends of the year formed the main course of China's reform. That is, the ship of China's economy eventually sailed into the main course of the market economy after passing the stages of a planned economy, an economy with planning as the mainstay and market as the complement, and a planned commodity economy. On the whole, the current Chinese economic structure remains in the transitional stage from a planned to a market economy. In addition, five major reform measures in the taxation and financial, banking, investment, foreign trade, and modern enterprise management systems adopted this year will cover and effect a wide scope of activities to an intensive degreea and more problems and contradictions in the reforms will arise. Therefore, some experts expected that the forthcoming second session of the Eighth NPC would mainly discuss the operation of the market economy and realistically analyze and settle various problems in the market economy. This may be different from last year's NPC session, which just called for "grasping the opportunity for development" and establisheg the objective of a market economy. The deputies to the NPC, who come from the forefront of the economic work, will pay more attention to the following questions: How to handle the relationship between the rate of growth and economic efficiency in the course of development; how to optimize the environment for fair competition, overcome the unevenness in regional development, and break local economic blockades and monopolies in some trades; how to quicken the process of building up an integrated legal system; how to deal with the obvious backwardness of the markets for production factors; how to transform government functions and turn the participants in market competition into creators of an environment for fair competition; how to solve such problems as why large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises lack dynamism in operation and entering the market; how to strengthen overall price control and establish various types of risk funds and reserve systems; and how to maintain the stability of the farm produce market. In retrospect, the year since the first session of the Eighth NPC was a year recording the enhancement of the overall marketization degree of the Chinese economy. The market system has been further maturing. There are now more than 1,600 wholesale markets for farm produce, more than 1,000 wholesale markets for industrial consumer goods, and some 1,800 wholesale markets for producer goods in the whole country. Markets for production factors have also emerged. On the financial market, there are now 85 securities companies and more than 500 intermediate securities institutions in the whole country. On the technological market, there are some 2,800 institutions of all types engaged in technology trade, and over 10,000 information institutions of all types. On the labor force market, there are some 13,000 job placement institutions, which help some 8 million people find jobs each year. On the real estate market, there have emerged some 12,000 development companies. The market pricing mechanism is also forming, and the proportion of prices fixed according to state plan has substantially decreased. Among farm produce and industrial consumer goods and capital goods, the proportions of prices being basically formed by market forces separately reached 90 percent and 85 percent. The proportion of products controlled by the state's mandatory industrial production plans in the gross industrial output value of the whole country fell to only 4 percent. The Eighth NPC Standing Committee also created a remarkable record in the past year as it passed 20 laws, made 13 law-related decisions, and basically scrutinized eight draft laws. This was the most laws the NPC Standing Committee has ever deliberated and enacted in a year. The "company law" has played a role in regulating and standardizing the operation of 1.03 million business companies of all types in the market economy. The "anti-improper competition law" provides the legal standards for market behavior. It is expected that some other subjects will also be discussed by the deputies at the forthcoming NPC session, but the experts held that all of them were just problems in the course of advances and development of the Chinese economy and were just interludes of the main melody. Sensibly raising, analyzing, and resolving these problems at the "two sessions" will enalbe the ship of the Chinese economic reform to move ahead along the course of the market economy by braving winds and waves.
