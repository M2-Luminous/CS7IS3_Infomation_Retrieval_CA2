They occurred at 288 enterprises, whereas in all of 1993, 264 concerns were affected. This was announced by Tatyana Frolova, secretary of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR], who spoke at a session of the FITUR Solidarity Action Coordinating Committee. Among the main reasons for the strikes, Frolova cited the federal budget's indebtedness, chronic delays in wage payments, the absence of a mechanism for mutual settlements, a growth in unemployment, and continuous increases in prices for foodstuffs and basic goods. Workers' action has been highest in the Komi Republic (Vorkuta), western Siberia, and Kemerovo, Tula, and Rostov Oblasts.
