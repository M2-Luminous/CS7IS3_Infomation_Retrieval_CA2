Russia's Path to GATT Does Not Promise To Be Brief"] [Text] Thursday evening after another round of GATT negotiations, the delegation from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations returned from Brussels. They had managed to coordinate the model for integration into this system, that is, clarify the details of the complex procedure that Russia will have to go through. One might say that Moscow stands on the threshold of the GATT. The head of the delegation, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov, reflects on the subject of whether or not Russia will manage to cross this threshold. In Mr. Davydov's opinion, in order to gain equal opportunities and rights in the markets of the world, Russia must conclude two agreements in the near future--with GATT and the EC. Membership in GATT will make it possible to avoid sanctions (which today are applied against Moscow without any discussion) in a civilized way, that is, at the level of the GATT Council. Without even having joined GATT yet, Russia is already making plans for membership in another organization--the World Trade Association (WTA). This product of the Uruguay round of GATT, in addition to purely trade issues, will concentrate on problems of investment policy, intellectual property, and services. The WTA charter has not been written yet. But, in Mr. Davydov's words, it is already clear that if Russia enters GATT, it will be easier for her to join the WTA as well. After all participants in the agreement familiarize themselves with the statement of Russia's intention to join their ranks, Moscow must within six weeks provide responses to all questions they have (which should be addressed to Russia within a month) and then, in the event that disputes or trade conflicts arise, all problems are to be regulated on a bilateral basis. Only after this, and if she is supported by two-thirds of the votes of the Council, will Russia be considered to be accepted into GATT. Incidentally, in Mr. Davydov's words, it took the well-suited Switzerland six years to do this, while the less stable Mexico and Venezuela required only a year. And China entered GATT in 1983. Additionally, the fact that Russia's trade legislation does not correspond to international trade legislation is an obstacle to her joining the agreement. Russian import tariffs are a "bone of contention." In the words of the chief of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, the ministry has particularly spoken out against raising tariffs for foodstuffs. And the West is dissatisfied with the fact that the current import tariff in Russia is three to four times higher than the European one. In order to coordinate all the issues related to this, a tariff-customs council has been formed in Russia. Although, as the minister especially emphasized, nobody except the consumers and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, "which completely understands the need for free competition within Russia and advises in favor of entering GATT," is interested in reducing the import tariffs. [Begin boxed item] COMMENTARY A red carpet is not likely to be spread out on Russia's path to GATT. All one need do is look at the course of the negotiations with this organization's leaders--from promises to complete this procedure by the end of 1993 to the postponement of the deadlines until the end of this year. Incidentally, this date too will probably be moved into the unforeseeable future: The regulation of disputes with the EC Commission (for example, regarding uranium and aluminum) is proceeding with a fair amount of difficulty. And one can hardly count on Russia's getting around these tough spots during the course of the GATT procedures, for example, the bilateral talks with France and the United States--the main ones wrangling over these questions. A great deal will depend on whether the Commission of European Communities abandons its positions, which have already been coordinated with Russia, relative to the need for mutual observance of GATT principles, which they think nothing of violating even in the EC.
