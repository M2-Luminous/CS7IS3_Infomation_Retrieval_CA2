Varig President Rubel Thomas made the announcement in Rio de Janeiro. Varig has grounded 80 of its planes, including Boeing and Mcdonnell-Douglas planes -- 50 of which are under "leasing" contracts. Thomas said the suspension of payments while contract periods and values are being renegotiated (which will be conducted by the Bankers Trust) is within the company's reorganization plan. The company has been accumulating losses since 1990. Last year it lost $380 million. Varig pays $500 million for its planes annually. The two-month postponement will save $83 million. Thomas did not say exactly who the creditors are -- mentioning only that they are Japanese, Americans, and Europeans -- or how much it is owed to each. He said the payment due in March, which should have been deposited today, will not be made. Thomas said the company has two types of "leasing" contracts: Operational contracts (with the manufacturer or its representative and includes a cash deposit), and financial contracts (the guarantee is the plane itself). Seventy percent of Varig's contracts are financial and 30 percent are operational (with deposits totaling $100 million). Rubel Thomas said there are two reasons for "calling creditors for talks." He said the first is that currently "there is a large international offer of `leasing' contracts, and prices have dropped significantly. We are paying prices that were agreed when rates were much higher, and we need to renegotiate." Second reason: In 1993 Varig had revenues of almost $2.5 billion, of which only 19 percent, or $460 million, was available to cover investment costs. This is "insufficient to cover our investments," which total $500 million, Thomas said. The Varig president said the company will delay payments for only two months. "Our domestic commitments will not be affected at all," Thomas said, adding that the 60 day period might even be reduced. "We want to conclude the negotiations as quickly as possible." This type of maneuver is not common in Brazil, but Thomas stressed that difficulties have forced various foreign companies to renegotiate. He mentioned, among others, United Airlines, Continental, and SAS [Scandinavian Airlines System]. "Evergreen, for instance, is doing what we are doing now," he said. "We will pay everything we owe and maintain all our commitments," Thomas stressed, recalling that during the 67 years of Varig's existence the company "always honored its commitments." Thomas said: "Negotiations will be tough but necessary. I am convinced we are doing something serious and looking after the interests of shareholders and customers."
