Goldenberg made this comment to EFE in Tokyo, where he is attending a two-day seminar on investments in Latin America that opened today. It is sponsored by the Nikko brokers firm. Goldenberg spoke before 300 Japanese businessmen. He recalled the "constricting squint" of previous governments which ruined the country through bad administration and violence until, late in the 1980's, the country became an "outcast" from the international financial community. Goldenberg predicted that the starting point for the return of Japanese businessmen will be the meeting of the Peruvian-Japanese Business Committee to be held next September in Lima. This meeting will also be attended by a Japanese business delegation headed by Kazuo Haruna, president of Marubeni Trading Company. Japanese sources showed interest in a greater presence in Peru in face of the improved economic situation and social stability, although they are still cautious. Goldenberg admitted: "It is difficult to erase all traces of terrorism" but assured that the government of President Fujimori will do away with guerrilla groups in 1995. Regarding his lecture on economic reforms, Goldenberg highlighted the efforts of the Peruvian Government to conclude the privatization of state companies with the sale of the mining and oil companies next November. Asked about the little interest shown by Japan to invest in the privatization process, Goldenberg said "the doors are open to all," and did not discard the idea that he may receive some offers. Goldenberg added: "We built the legal framework for reforms, the pacification of the country continues, and we will continue to work on the privatization process and on ways to achieve the investments needed for our development." He also thanked the Japanese for the formation of the support group which provided the bridge credits that allowed Peru to negotiate with its creditors in the Paris Club. He added that Peru will soon negotiate its debt with the private banks. Goldenberg also thanked the Japanese for their "support and understanding" over the political reforms introduced by President Fujimori. Japan was one of the few countries that did not threaten to withdraw its economic aid following the "self-coup" by Fujimori in April 1992. The seminar was attended by political leaders and bankers of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay as well as by Inter- American Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias who was present at the formation of the first support group for Peru in Nagoya (Japan) in April 1991.
