It was his first visit to Bophuthatswana since the violent clashes and looting there last week, as well as his first ever visit to the capital Mmabatho. Caro Kriel reports that if the ANC leader had any doubts about his popularity in Bophuthatswana they would have been dispelled by the huge and enthusiastic turnout of his supporters. [Begin recording] [Kriel] Mr. Mandela chose the Independence Stadium in Mmabatho for his historic first rally in Bophuthatswana, a stadium built for the now ousted Bop [Bophuthatswana] leader, Mr. Lucas Mangope. Today it belonged to Mr. Mandela. [Mandela] My mere presence here is proof that in Bophuthatswana there is now free political activity in this area. [Kriel] Mr. Mandela praised the people (?who ousted) Mr. Mangope, but condemned those who took part in looting sprees last week. [Mandela] That is not how decent people behave. That is the behavior of animals. [Kriel] But he also slammed the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]. [Mandela] It is a lesson they will never forget. They were chased out and humiliated. That is what is going to happen in future. [Kriel] Earlier, Mr. Mandela visited the family of a woman who was allegedly killed by the AWB. He also spent time at the home of a woman whose husband died in the violence. Mr. Mandela said he wanted to come to Bophuthatswana to speak to the people and find out for himself what had happened. Mr. Mandela was well received wherever he went, telling this crowd of civil servants what they wanted to hear. [Mandela] You are all going to get your pensions. All of you are going to get your jobs without exception. [Kriel] Pensions, jobs, and similar problems are now in the hands of Bop's two coadministrators. Mr. Mandela met interim administrator, Mr. Tjaart van der Walt, and with him Mr. Job Mokgoro. At parliament today where a defiant Mr. Mangope said he was going to have a cabinet meeting, the only sign of him was a statue. The doors of parliament were locked and guarded by SADF [South African Defense Force] troops. [end recording]
