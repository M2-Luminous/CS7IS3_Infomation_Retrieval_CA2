In a 15-minute telephone conversation with Hosokawa, Clinton said the premier pushed through his reform legislation with courage and determination, the top government spokesman told a news conference. The government's political reform package cleared the Diet on Saturday after Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party, reached a compromise on revising it in the regular Diet session, which opened Monday. The reform package is intended to root out graft in Japanese politics through a new system for House of Representatives elections and stricter controls on campaign funds. Clinton also told Hosokawa that they should both do their utmost to make a success of their summit in Washington on February 11, Takemura said. The U.S. President reportedly voiced hope that Japan make efforts for progress in the bilateral framework trade talks and for additional pump-priming measures. The premier, who has twice met Clinton, replied he wants to demonstrate his leadership in tackling the issues, Takemura said.
