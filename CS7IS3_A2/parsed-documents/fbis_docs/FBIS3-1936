They are two important administrative regulations of the Chinese Government for the management of religious affairs. The promulgation of these two regulations is an important measure for China to comprehensively and correctly implement the policy of freedom of religious belief, strengthen the management of religious affairs according to law, and keep religion in line with socialist society. It is also an important step taken in the building of the legal system concerning religious affairs in China. The Chinese Government has always pursued a policy of freedom of religious belief. As early as in the period of the democratic revolution, the CPC, in accordance with the principle of freedom of religious belief, formed an extensive anti-imperialist patriotic united front with the religious masses of people of various nationalities which became an important guarantee for uniting people throughout the country to score victory in the democratic revolution. Since the founding of the republic, the situation of religion in China, following a thorough transformation of the socialist system and important reform of the religious system, has undergone a historic and fundamental change, and the party's policy of freedom of religious belief has been implemented further. Practice has proved that the policy of freedom of religious belief conforms with the national conditions of China and is supported by the broad religious masses and the people of various nationalities. These two regulations on religion have been formulated precisely in accordance with the Constitution of China and the consistent policy of freedom of religious belief. The "Provisions" have given full expression to the fixed principles of the Chinese Government's respect for foreigners' freedom of religious belief within the boundaries of China, protection for their normal religious activities, and protection for their friendly exchanges and cultural and academic exchange activities with religious circles of China. At the same time, the "Provisions" also have given expression to the principle that "religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination," which is set out in the Constitution of China, and have explicitly stated that foreigners should observe the laws of China, should not damage the public interests of Chinese society, and should not in any way interfere in the internal affairs of religion in China. In this way, foreigners are provided with legal protection for exercising their right to freedom of religious belief within the boundaries of China, for taking part in normal religious activities, and for carrying out friendly exchanges and cultural and academic exchange activities with the religious circles of China. The "Regulations" have fully stipulated the legitimate rights and interests of places for religious activities and how to safeguard these rights and interests. The "Regulations" also have stipulated the legal responsibility for acts of encroachment on the legitimate rights and interests of places for religious activities. At the same time, the "Regulations" have stipulated the duties and obligations of places of religious activities to the state and society. These are mainly: "Religious activities conducted in places of religious activities are to abide by laws and regulations. No individual is permitted to make use of places of religious activities to carry out activities that undermine national unity, nationality solidarity, and social stability; that harm the health of citizens; or that hinder the country's education system." The "Regulations" also have stipulated that places of religious activities are to be registered and registered places of religious activities are to be protected by law. The promulgation and implementation of the two religious regulations meet the needs in managing religious affairs according to law and in comprehensively and correctly implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief. Managing religious affairs according to law means that the government will carry out administrative management and supervision of the implementation of relevant religions laws, decrees, and policies. Managing religious affairs according to law does not contradict the policy of freedom of religious belief, and the purpose of such management is to better implement the policy. Managing according to law includes two aspects: One is to protect citizens' right to freedom of religious belief, normal religious activities, and the legitimate rights and interests of religious circles. The other aspect is to restrict and crack down on criminal activities that make use of religion. They are two aspects of one issue and are dialectically unified. They can neither be set against one another, nor be separated. This kind of management is to include religious activities and religious affairs into the Constitution and laws. It is not meant to interfere with the normal religious activities or the internal affairs of religious bodies and places of religious activities, nor is it meant to interfere with citizens' freedom of religious belief. Government functionaries, various units, and individuals should seriously abide by the "Regulations" and should not willfully infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of religious circles. The promulgation of these two regulations is a good beginning for legislation concerning religious affairs in China. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "To protect the people's democracy, we must strengthen the legal system. We must set up systems and formulate laws on democracy, and must ensure that these systems and laws will not change with the change of leaders and will not change with changes in the leaders' views and attention." With the implementation of these two regulations, the building of the legal system concerning religious affairs will be constantly improved and strengthened, the legal system concerning religious affairs gradually will be set up in China, and the Chinese Government's management of religious affairs will be placed truly within the orbit of the legal system. At present, we should lay stress on properly implementing the two administrative regulations on religion, and should make sure they are observed and strictly enforced, and that violations of the regulations are punished so that these two regulations are really implemented. We believe that the implementation of these two regulations will have an important impact on comprehensively and correctly implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief in our country, strengthening the management of religious affairs, enhancing unity between religious and non-religious citizens, maintaining social stability, conducting international friendly religious exchanges, promoting the Chinese people's understanding and friendship with the people of all countries in the world, and speeding up the building of socialist modernization.
