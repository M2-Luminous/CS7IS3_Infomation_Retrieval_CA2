FBIS4-22729 "jpusr044___94056" FBIS-USR-94-044 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 8 April 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Results of Kozyrev-Af Ugglas Meeting in Pskov Detailed Results of Kozyrev-Af Ugglas Meeting in Pskov Detailed 944Q0300A Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 8 Apr 94 p 1 944Q0300A Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Russian CSO [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Andrey Kozyrev and Margaretha af Uglass Meet in Pskov; Negotiations Conducted in the Context of Russia's Regional Policy"] [Text] Diplomacy The "private setting" of the visit to Pskov of Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas, where Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs [MFA] Andrey Kozyrev conducted negotiations yesterday within the framework of an official trip, was disturbed by a "newspaper phantom" that appeared the day before in the Russian media. A Xerox copy of a "directive of the president of the Russian Federation," which was provided by an official of the MFA and which came to Smolensk Square from Latvia and became a startling incident (including if not most of all for the Russian MFA), directed, "for the purposes of guaranteeing the security of the Russian Federation and the states of the Commonwealth" (the Latvian Republic also was on the list of well-wishers), the dispositioning of military bases on the territory of the CIS states and Latvia. This directive from the office of the president became the subject of Andrey Kozyrev's morning meeting with Russian Minister of Defense Pavel Grachev, the result of which, it must be assumed, enabled the diplomat to make the comment: "The appearance of this directive is very reminiscent of version number 1..." After evaluating the "newspaper phantom" as an attempt to verify the degree of mutual understanding between the president and the government, and between the Russian Ministry of Defense and the MFA, Kozyrev expressed the view that similar startling events are not able to influence the style of work of the Russian Foreign Policy Department. The negotiations with Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas, he said, are occurring within the context of the regional policy of Russia, just like the creation, with Russia's well-known efforts, of the Baltic Sea States Council and the "Barents-Council." Given the participation in the negotiations of Vladislav Tumanov, the head of administration of Pskov Oblast, the Russian side proposes as a subject of negotiations the construction of housing and the creation of new jobs for settlers from the Baltic region and other regions of the former USSR, and also housing of the contingent of troops that is being pulled out. According to the ecology program, it is proposed to build a series of purification facilities and extensive processing of silt residue within the scope of the ecological program for the protection of the Baltic Sea basin. Projects in the sphere of the development of the foreign economic potential of the Russian province pertain to the participation of Swedish entrepreneurs in the establishment of a joint-stock company, Pskov International Trade Center. The development of transport communications within the scope of the program Via Baltika with respect to Pskov Oblast supposes the establishment of regular cargo, passenger, and tourist runs, with the joint use of the Pskov international airport and international highways that are being planned on the territory of the oblast. Considering the data of the export fund, according to which about 10 percent of Russian exports transited through bordering Pskov Oblast, it is proposed to establish a network of freight terminals on the border with Belarus, Latvia, and Estonia. The program also proposes to expand and intensify contacts in the spheres of health services, culture, and tourism. The investments of the Swedish business world in the economy of the oblast should involve extensive processing of timber and peat beds, the processing of agricultural products, the establishment of enterprises and highly technological products in the area of machine building, electronics, and light industry. Individual paragraphs discuss close regional cooperation in the sphere of joint operations in the processing of flax. At the conclusion of the negotiations, in a news conference arranged for domestic and foreign journalists, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev said that the meeting of old friends (that is the way he introduced his relations with the Swedish colleague) was taking place within the context of Russia's regional policy. The idea was expressed in the reply of Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas that Sweden, expecting to become a member of the European Union on 1 January of next year, hopes that it will be able through its authority to make a contribution to the cause of strengthening stability in the Baltic region. "It is necessary to build a new Europe together with Russia," the head of the foreign policy department of Sweden is convinced. Concerning the territorial claims of Estonia and the hypothetically possible role in them of Sweden, Ugglas said that Sweden recognized Estonia within the framework of the existing borders. But border questions, in her opinion, can be resolved within the framework of practical contacts.
