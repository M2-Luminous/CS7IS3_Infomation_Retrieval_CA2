According to the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, Churkin said after a meeting with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his Pale headquarters that the "accord should help lead to a general ceasefire between Moslems and Serbs." "I received assurances from the Serb and Moslem parties that they did not intend to engage in offensive acts in the Gorazde region, where the situation seems to be calm at the moment," he said. "I think what we have achieved in Sarajevo and what we hope to achieve in Gorazde must be applied across the whole of Bosnia," he said, declining to say whether an actual ceasefire document had been signed. Churkin, the personal envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, has been mediating between the Bosnian Serb and Moslem factions and the UN Protection Force since Tuesday [12 April]. He had earlier met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. The latest crisis in Bosnia, sparked by a Bosnian Serb offensive on Gorazde, was heightened at the weekend when North Atlantic Treaty Organization aircraft launched two air strikes against the besieging forces. Churkin added: "All the parties to the conflict must understand that political accords about Gorazde cannot be implemented without their cooperation with the international community and among themselves."
