The utilization of $58.8 billion in foreign capital was agreed upon, and the amount of foreign capital actually utilized was $9.4 billion, up 300 percent and 180 percent, respectively, over the same period in 1992, roughly equal to the total for the entire year last year and about half of all foreign-funded investments for the previous 13 years. As of late June 1993, the grand total of foreign-funded investment projects nationwide stood at 134,423, actually utilizing $43.75 billion in foreign capital. Over 50,000 foreign-funded enterprises have gone into production, most of them doing well. Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, the United States, Taiwan, Italy, Germany, and South Korea continued to be the leading investors in China, primarily its coastal provinces and municipalities. Nevertheless, China's inland areas have been catching up fast. Among the various sectors, industry continued to attract the most capital, especially electronics communication equipment, machinery, chemical, and electrical appliance industries. Meanwhile, however, investment in the tertiary sector posted faster growth, with the scale of foreign investment increasing steadily. Agreed-upon foreign investment averaged $1.35 million per project in the first half of this year, a gain of 22 percent over the corresponding period a year ago. Exports and imports by foreign-funded enterprises in China continued to grow steadily in the first half of 1993, with a total value of $24.63 billion, 49.7 percent higher than the same period a year ago and 31.7 percent of the nation's overall imports and exports. Of the $24.63 billion, exports accounted for $9.32 billion, up 36.9 percent over the corresponding period last year, and 21.5 percent of the nation's total exports. Most leading exports were found in light industry, textile industry, and electrical machinery industry. Imports were worth $15.31 billion, an increase of 58.7 percent over last year and 37.7 percent of the nation's total imports. Leaving aside investment-related imports, there was a rough balance between exports and imports made necessary by their operations. Foreign-funded investment enterprises nationwide remitted overseas $3.39 billion in foreign exchange in the first half of this year, at the same time moving $1.676 billion in foreign exchange to China, for a net outflow of $1.714 billion. Overall foreign-funded investment enterprises had a foreign exchange surplus. That foreign investment in China maintained such a strong momentum when the rest of the world was in the grip of an economic recession fully testifies to China's political and social stability and the soundness of its investment climate. On the other hand, China is a latecomer to attracting foreign capital, so foreign investment still accounts for a significantly smaller share of China's total fixed assets and gross domestic product than in other fast-growing developing nations. Since most foreign capital is concentrated in processing industries, the overall quality of our drive to attract foreign capital has yet to be improved. Focuses of Drive To Attract Foreign Capital In the wake of the deepening of economic structural reform and changes in the global economic environment, China will adjust its policies after reviewing its experience for the past 14 years so as to achieve new breakthroughs in the attraction of foreign capital. Judging from the string of policies the country has adopted recently, we see that China will concentrate on the following at least in its drive to attract foreign capital: 1. Continue to work hard to improve the investment climate, particularly the intangible investment climate. By and large China has created the framework of a body of laws on foreign capital utilization; it has signed an investment protection agreement with more than 55 nations and other agreements to avoid double taxation with over 20 nations. All that provides basic legal safeguards for the foreign investor. Still there is much room for improvement on the legal front. To better the legal environment, China will continue to improve its laws and regulations, making them more coordinated, more open, and more workable; tighten law enforcement; and render its laws and regulations uniform nationwide, all of which is most critical to improving the investment climate. It is also essential that government departments improve their management methods. The procedures for reviewing and approving a project are currently being simplified. Some localities have set up a single body to review and approve project applications from foreign investors. In other localities, all the departments involved have decided to work together, for instance, by setting up joint offices and holding joint meetings, to examine and approve projects, thus streamlining the examination-and-approval process and enhancing work efficiency. Vigorous steps are being taken by the government to encourage the establishment of a host of service-providing organizations, such as consulting, legal, accounting, and property assessment services, to make available a complete lineup of social services. 2. China's open policy began in its coastal region, which had a stronger economic foundation and a long history of overseas trade, and gradually spread to the rest of the country, from south to north, from east to west. Practice proves that this progression is sound and inevitable and has played a significant historical role. Be that as it may, with years of development behind it, the open policy today should be applied across the board. The coast and the interior must develop in a balanced manner. Last year China opened up cities along the Chang Jiang, provincial capitals in the interior, and a number of border cities, and took some steps to encourage the interior to utilize foreign capital. Indeed, the interior has made rapid progress in utilizing foreign capital since last year, chalking up an increase rate higher than that of the coast. With its weak foundation and late start, however, the interior still trails the coast; the role played by foreign investment in its economic development remains minuscule. In the future China will gradually replace its policy of favoring some regions with one favoring some industries, which means that even as it continues to promote the utilization of foreign capital in the coast, it will work diligently to create the conditions that would steer foreign investors into the interior by playing up the interior's resource advantage and strong industries. In particular, it would encourage foreign companies to invest in agricultural development, resource development, technology development, raw material industries, and the technological transformation of old-line enterprises in the interior. It would also support foreign firms which want to invest in remote border areas, impoverished areas, and areas inhabited by minority nationalities. 3. Further optimize the industrial structure and widen the range of industries open to foreign investment. After 14 years of development, the industrial pattern of foreign investment has become more and more rational. In the last couple of years, in particular, a host of projects in the energy, transportation, and high-tech industries went under way across the nation that involved a large amount of capital, utilized advanced technology, and had substantial impact on the national economy. Substantial headway was also made in the tertiary industry. As we pursue foreign capital in the future, we must continue to abide by the principle of balancing development among the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries, with equal emphasis on large, medium, and small enterprises. Special pains must be taken to encourage agricultural technology development projects, infrastructural projects, capital- and technology-intensive projects, export-oriented projects, and projects in basic industries that would turn out more Chinese-made raw materials and parts and components. Export-oriented enterprises along the coast should be encouraged to upgrade themselves by graduating from labor-intensive products to high-tech products with a high added value. China has eased restrictions on foreign investment in the tertiary industry since last year. Now foreign investment is finding its way into finance, insurance, retail commerce, foreign trade, tourism, consulting, information, accounting, advertising, and shipping. China must continue to broaden the reach of foreign capital in the tertiary sector in the days ahead both to meet the needs of economic structural reform and the operation of the market economy at home and to satisfy the objective requirements of rejoining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and acceding to other related international organizations. In industries mentioned above that are already opened to foreign investment, the scope of the pilot projects will be broadened after reviewing the experience, while new experiments will also be launched in areas untouched by foreign investment so far. 4. Diversify the methods of foreign investment. In traditional methods of foreign investment, the investor invests directly by setting up a Sino-foreign joint venture, a Sino-foreign contractual joint venture, or a wholly foreign-funded enterprise. Or he may invest in compensation trade or a processing or assembling project. In recent years, especially since 1992, Sino-foreign shareholding companies have mushroomed, with dozens of them already in operation so far. More than 30 companies are trading special B shares denominated in renminbi on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges. The shareholding system has become the way to go for enterprises interested in restructuring in a market economy. Investing in shareholding companies is now a new option for the foreign investor in China and promises to become increasingly important in the long haul compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, as China's financial climate further stabilizes and the Chinese stock market matures, a growing number of companies will issue shares for trading on the market. Foreigners will then be able to invest in China through the stock market, a method of investment that is simple, quick, and convenient in that it allows the investor to move his investment dollars around freely. The foreign investor no doubt will become increasingly interested in the stock market. To promote the development of Sino-foreign joint venture shareholding companies vigorously but cautiously, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation and Trade is in the process of drawing up the "Management Regulations for Sino-Foreign Shareholding Companies Ltd." To encourage large foreign companies that have ample capital resources and advanced technology to carry out their multi-industry interregional investment plans in China, the country has in recent years approved the establishment of a number of investment companies (controlling companies). On behalf of their parent companies, these investment companies carry out their investment plans and manage the enterprises that have been set up. Judging from practical results, the investment company does a better job in helping the investor grasp any favorable opportunity to increase his investment in China. The Chinese government looks upon with special favor multinational companies setting up this kind of outfit in China. Recently an investment seminar for multinationals was jointly organized in Beijing by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation and Trade, the University of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, and the United Nations Center for Multinationals. Representatives from the various multinationals who attended the seminar expressed the utmost interest in this form of investment. Those representing some of the most famous companies also asked to set up regional headquarters in China, a request taken very seriously by the government agencies and figures involved. 5. Intensify the management of foreign-funded enterprises already in existence. As foreign-funded enterprises proliferated, it is increasingly essential that China step up their management. The management of foreign-funded enterprises entails, on the one hand, creating a favorable operating environment for such enterprises, especially by nurturing and perfecting the financial, foreign exchange, materials, and labor markets; helping them solve any problem relating to the supply of energy, raw materials, parts and components, and transportation; curbing the arbitrary collection of fees and apportionment of expenses, irresponsible fund-raising, and unjustifiable administrative intervention; and establishing a sound social service system. On the other hand, it means tightening the supervision of foreign-funded enterprises in accordance with the law. Currently the majority of foreign-funded enterprises are established and operate in accordance with the law. Nevertheless, there are some highly problematic enterprises. For instance, a number of them fail to deliver the capital or technology specified in the contract, import inferior technology at high costs, operate beyond the authorized limits, evade paying taxes, infringe upon their workers' legitimate rights and interests, and set up bogus joint ventures. The departments responsible take these problems most seriously and will work out the necessary measures to tighten supervision and management, urge enterprises to operate in accordance with the law, and crack down on illegal operations. In short, China will be even more diligent in the future in improving the industrial and regional distribution of foreign investment even as it continues to work to attract more foreign capital. It will work harder to improve the quality of foreign investment as well as the economic returns and social benefits of foreign-funded enterprises. This is where the utilization of foreign capital is headed in China.
