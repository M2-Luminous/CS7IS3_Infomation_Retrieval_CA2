The drawing of the standby credit should be followed by the drawing of the second installment of the STF [strategic transformation facility] loan of approximately $90 million that Slovakia obtained last year. The second installment of the standby credit would then represent the sum of $60-$70 million. This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova in connection with the current 10-day visit by an IMF mission. According to Schmognerova, her talks with the mission's representatives did not concern the creation of the social fund or the introduction of wage regulation. Wage regulation should be introduced only in the event of a marked widening of the gap between the growth of wages and the decline in labor productivity. As for the social fund, she said that it will be created; the only question is how. "It will most probably be created only at the beginning of 1995." The government is also considering increasing the number of products that will be subject to the higher value-added tax rate. Brigita Schmognerova voiced the assurance, however, that the increase would not concern products of everyday use. Measures to retain budget balance should not affect the level of transfer payments, according to her words. "Our endeavor is to distribute social burdens evenly so that the weakest social groups are not affected," the deputy prime minister added. As she went on to say, the development of the economy this year is worse than originally expected. The government therefore has some crisis measures in reserve. "We would like society to realize that we need support and that the implementation of the set targets will establish better prerequisites for the future. We have opted for measures that will not concern the budget alone and that will lay the foundations for positive developments and will have the least social impact," Schmognerova stressed. According to her, the IMF mission appreciated the fact that a new government was formed in a very short time and that this government was able to prepare its economic program quickly. The mission also appreciated the government's endeavor to accelerate privatization and make it more transparent and the [planned] launching of the second wave of coupon privatization. Referring to the suspension of talks between the former government and the IMF, the deputy prime minister said that the former government had implemented virtually nothing of its commitments toward the IMF, though these have been known since December 1993, which makes the starting position of the present government all the more complicated. [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 6 April on pages 1 and 2 carries a 600-word Igor Zvach article on Deputy Prime Minister Schmognerova's comments on her talks with the IMF mission. The report includes the following passage: "Asked whether the talks concerned devaluation or the measures adopted by the previous government to limit some imports, Schmognerova said that they did not. The Slovak Republic's foreign exchange reserves are developing so that devaluation is not necessary. The import surcharge had been introduced temporarily and following consultations with GATT, and it is therefore pointless to talk about it. Asked by NARODNA OBRODA whether some tough IMF demands were discussed, such as measures in the sphere of taxation and prices or cuts in the social sphere, the deputy prime minister admitted that some IMF recommendations are heading in this direction. The issue will be how to minimize their impact on the population. No general tax or price increases or drastic cuts in the social sphere are in the offing. It is possible, however, that it will be necessary to reconsider the tax burden with respect to certain groups of merchandise. However, this will not concern articles of everyday use."]
