"We sincerely believe that Turkey will help us," Andonov said. Veysel Atasoy, energy and natural resources minister, said before meeting with Andonov that Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] independence. Andonov said Macedonia's northern borders and its southern Greek border have been besieged and the north-south route was the only way for the procurement of raw materials and for exportation. Turkey earlier said the Balkan republic could use Turkish ports to circumvent a trade blockade imposed by Greece. [passage omitted]
