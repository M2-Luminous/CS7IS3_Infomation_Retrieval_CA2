At your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondewnt's request he gave his version of the political amnesty declared by the State Duma. Who gained from it? I believe, Shakhray said, that the prime benefactor of this amnesty is Russian society. But, he stressed, both the president and the prime minister gained, too. What form does this take? When the passions and emotions subside it will perhaps transpire that the interests of the president and the Duma coincided, albeit tactically. Some Duma deputies have achieved their aim in entering the Duma -- to secure the release of the participants in the October events. Subsequently the Duma's interests will diverge from those of the ex-prisoners because the Duma has leaders of its own who do not want the reinforcement of Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and the rest. They have no interest in that. In addition, they are not averse to preserving their image as initiators of civil reconciliation. After all, that is also politically very advantageous. The president and the government, in turn, benefit more from having Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at liberty than in Lefortovo prison. Why is that? So long as they remain in jail they create the impression of an imprisoned vice president and an imprisoned Supreme Soviet chairman. But once they have accepted the amnesty from the Duma's hands then, no matter what reservations they may have, they will have admitted a degree of political guilt. Now each of them can return to power only after elections have been held. In addition, the amnesty act averted the acute political crisis that was expected in April-May. Society has been given a respite of several months. That respite must be used by all political forces to prevent clashes. I believe, Sergey Shakhray said, that the political amnesty saved Chernomyrdin's job as premier and strengthened the president's position because it muddled the political alignment of forces which were prepared for a crisis this spring.
