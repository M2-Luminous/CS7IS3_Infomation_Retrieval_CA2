Politburo member Maria de los Angeles Garcia stressed that, in addition to their continuous efforts to find solutions to the nation's other problems, ANIR members should look upon preserving equipment, machinery, tools, and other resources -- many of which are not being used because of the lack of spare parts -- as a challenge. As regards ANIR's participation in the sugar harvest, the plenum agreed on the need to expedite the recyling and production of spare parts needed to operate combines, compressors, and boilers at the sugar mills, as well as to use animal-powered equipment more efficiently.
