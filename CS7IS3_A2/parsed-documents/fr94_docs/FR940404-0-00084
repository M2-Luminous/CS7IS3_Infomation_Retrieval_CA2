ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this document, the Bureau of Prisons (``Bureau'') is amending its rule on Telephone Regulations in order to provide for the operation of the Inmate Telephone System (``ITS'') and to clarify references to loss of telephone privileges under institutional disciplinary sanctions. This document also amends the Bureau's rule on the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program as it relates to telephone privileges. These amendments are intended to further the Bureau's core value of sound correctional management both by recognizing the role of inmate financial responsibility and by further minimizing the security problems and criminal activity associated with inmate telephone use, thereby improving the safe and secure operation of Bureau institutions. Consistent with correctional management objectives, these amendments are also intended to reduce generally the costs of telephone calls by providing for a direct-dial, debit-billing system now available through technological developments in the telephone and computer industries. This system allows the Bureau to more effectively carry out its long-standing rule that an inmate is responsible for the expenses of inmate telephone use. These amendments also give the Bureau more flexibility to efficiently manage inmate telephone use, thus enhancing the Bureau's ability to provide telephone access to inmates in a manner that facilitates other correctional management goals, such as encouraging inmates to be financially responsible. Finally, these amendments enable the Bureau to restrict and more effectively monitor inmate telephone use that may pose a threat to the security of the institution or the public. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 4, 1994, except for §§540.105(c) and 545.11(d)(10) which become effective January 3, 1995.
