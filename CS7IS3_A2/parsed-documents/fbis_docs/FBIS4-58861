These marches are supported by many political parties, in the forefront of which are the National Liberation Front [FLN], the Rally for Culture and Democracy, the Islamic Ennahda Movement, and the Islamic Society Movement, HAMAS. Amidst tight security measures, the march began after a delay of about one hour. The radio team is with us live: [Unidentified correspondent] Yes, Djamila, the march dispersed a short time ago--about 15 minutes ago--after having lasted for about two hours to cross the distance between 1 May Square and Martyrs Square. The start of the march at the scheduled time, at 1000, was delayed in order to allow participants to leave their offices. The early time and the tight security requirements were the reasons for the delay. [passage omitted] This was evident from the fact that after the reading out of the statement that crowned the march--15 minutes ago--participants kept flowing into Martyrs Square. The march passed calmly and quietly, broken only by the occasional trilling cries of joy from the women. Alongside the members of the march preparatory committee and representatives of 20 associations, two political figures were present. They were Abdelhamid Mehri, secretary general of the FLN, and Mahfouz Nahnah, leader of the HAMAS Movement. The banners that were raised were agreed upon, among them: "No to Violence, Yes to Dialogue"; "No to Extremism"; "No to Exclusion, Yes to Meeting". A large banner carrying the slogan of the national reconciliation was at the front of the march. The number of participants in the march is not known precisely. The observations were conflicting. Some of the organizers expressed satisfaction, claiming that the number of the participants was 100,000 persons. Some observers, among them journalists, noted that the number did not exceed 30,000 or 40,000 persons. The official estimates might resolve this issue. A statement, which was a message addressed to the president of the state, was read out at the end of the march. The statement stressed that the initiative was an expression of civilized behavior to open a new chapter in which all the sons of the homeland meet. The initiative is also an expression to reject violence, reject one-upmanship--regardless of the slogans--and reject the solutions that contradict national constant and firm principles. The statement also expressed support for the president of the state in his endeavors for national reconciliation through comprehensive and deep dialogue. This was a general report about the march. From the street where the march took place, here is a report from colleague Ahmad Khaida: [Khaida] Mohamed, this march--which some participants considered to be a march of hope and others a march of a new era for Algeria--has stirred various reactions. Some of those interviewed said that, from a historical point of view, the march is a symbol and an example. One of them said that the 1 May Square is a symbol of work, and the Martyr Square is a symbol of martyrdom. [passage omitted] We also remind you that some of the parties rejected participating in the march. Among these was the Socialist Forces Front, which said the march was not in harmony with the democratic principles of the party. The Party of Algerian Renewal said such initiatives would only intensify the tension. The Ettahadi Movement said that those for reconciliation and dialogue, as they called them, pave the way in front of what the Movement called fundamentalists, and would constitute a mount from which they could pounce on the government. The Algerian General Workers Union barred its unionists from participating in the march. [passage omitted]
