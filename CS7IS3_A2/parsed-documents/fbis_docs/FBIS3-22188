C. Mehta, general secretary of the Indian council of enviro-legal action, New Delhi. This was stated by Mr. Mehta in a paper on the ``Role of judiciary in environmental protection'' presented at the Indo-British workshop on ``Environmental impact and risk assessment of petrochemical industry and environmental audit'' currently being held at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) campus here. Mr. Mehta was not present at the workshop, but his paper has been included for consideration by the workshop participants. Mr. Mehta noted that there are about 200 legislations in India, which directly or indirectly relate to environment protection. The earliest one, the Shore Nuisance (Bombay and Colaba) Act was passed way back as 1853 and the latest one was the Environment Protection Act of 1986. But these legislations did not have the desired effect, he regretted. However, a significant development in the past decade has been the increasing number of public interest litigations initiated by people belonging to all walks of life and the role played by the supreme court and some of the high courts in the protection of the environment. The courts have taken upon themselves to expand the ambit of article 21 of the constitution by interpreting that the right to life included the right to live in a healthy environment. Mr. Mehta alleged that because of the close nexus between the industry and the authorities, effective implementation of environment laws have been blocked. Also, there was not enough public consciousness about environmental issues. Mr. Mehta has made a fervent plea for implementing the supreme court's suggestion, made in 1956 while hearing the Delhi gas leak case, for the setting up of environmental courts. He noted that at present more than 4,500 population-related cases were pending before various courts in the country with no sign of them being disposed of early. He cited serious environmental problems like pollution of rivers by industries, loss of millions of acres of fertile soil and crops due to ground water contamination by discharge of toxic industrial effluents and alarming rate of deforestation.
