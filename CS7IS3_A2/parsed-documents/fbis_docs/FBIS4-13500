The UN Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] deployed in al-Ghanduriyah prevented citizens from entering Frun because the town was still being shelled. The Israeli forces also pounded the villages of Qa'qa'iyat al- Jisr, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, and Zawtar al-Sharqiyah and the al-Litani River basin. The shelling was accompanied by Israeli helicopter flights over the al-Litani River basin.
