The gradual forming of a fixed ruble rate (instead of the current floating one) could, to Sergey Vasilyev's mind, become one of the mechanisms to fight, among other things, the "dollarization" of the economy. It is this, Mr. Vasilyev stated, that makes it possible to strengthen Russia's national currency. Remarkably, the deputy minister of the economy pointed out, the formation of positive bank rates provides for the growth of ruble accumulations in the country right now. In the meantime, Russian Central Bank Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Khandruyev stated yesterday that Russia could give foreign banks, as early as the beginning of this summer, a broader access to the country. Mr. Khandruyev thinks the country's banks are already strong enough to offer serious competition to Western banks. At the same time Mr. Khandruyev ventured a guess that foreign banks would respond "without any particular enthusiasm" to the decision to give them broader access to Russia. It is also worthwhile mentioning in this connection that Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin signed an edict back on 13 November 1993 that limited "temporarily, for the period till 1 January 1996," activities of foreign banks on the territory of Russia to servicing non-residents alone. However, even before the signing of this presidential edict, Russian Federation Central Bank licenses for banking operations were received, among others, by the Credit Lyonnais, the Bank of Australia, the Societe Generale-Vostok, the Bank of China, the BNP-Dresdner Bank, the Credit Suisse, CitiBank, and the Chase Manhattan Bank, which have in the meantime familiarized themselves sufficiently with the none-too-simple realities of a peculiar Russian market.
