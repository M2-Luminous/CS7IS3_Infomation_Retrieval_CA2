The regulations stress that the overall restructuring of state-owned enterprises into shareholding companies had first to be subject to evaluation of their assets and prior approval was a must. The regulations state that before the issuing of new shares, the adjusted net assets book value of a particular enterprise had first of all to be converted into the stake held by shareholders. Should part of the assets not be turned into shares, it would be listed in a capital accumulation fund and the capital would in no way be changed into liabilities. The matter of whether the ratio which the conversion of assets into shares will employ is suitable has to be considered together with the proposal for the issuing of shares and the issuing price. The premium price for the issuing of new shares should not be kept too low, otherwise the net assets book value will not be fully shown. The regulations also stress that the premium price should be made higher in order to fully reflect the actual value of the stake resulting from the conversion of state-owned assets into shares.
