At a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry, Grachev stressed that Russia should put forth its own idea of partnership. A special team of Russian experts is to draw up proposals on this score before May 15, the minister said, adding that the proposals will be discussed by the Russian Security Council. If approved, the new idea will be read out by Grachev before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defense ministers at the NATO headquarters in Brussels. The minister told reporters that he had discussed the new Russian proposals concerning the "partnership for peace" program with President Boris Yeltsin. He stressed that some provisions of the NATO's program do not suit Russia. "The role of NATO and the West European Union is growing in Europe, but they have no right to...overlook the interests of Russia," the minister pointed out. At the news conference, Grachev also noted that the planned joint Russian-U.S. peace-making exercises on the Totsk testing ground near Orenburg should take place. He disagrees with the Russian state Duma's view that they should be cancelled. Touching upon Russia's armed forces, the minister said they are confronted with three main problems which must be solved. The problems include the financing of the military establishment, the army's manning status and the accommodation of troops withdrawn from abroad.
