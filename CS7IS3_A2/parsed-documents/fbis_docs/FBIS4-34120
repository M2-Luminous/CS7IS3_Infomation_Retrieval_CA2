FBIS4-34120 "drlat116__a94023" FBIS-LAT-94-116-A Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 ANNEX Cuba German Ambassador Reports Entry of Group German Ambassador Reports Entry of Group PA1306185494 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 1752 GMT 13 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PA1306185494 Havana PRENSA LATINA Spanish BFN [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- Cuba has called the forceful entry by a group of 20 people into the German Embassy in this capital early this morning as an obvious provocation. Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso has confirmed to PRENSA LATINA the illegal entry of 17 men and 3 women into the German Embassy by crashing a truck with Camaguey Province license plates into the iron gate of the embassy's garage. Shortly after this incident, German Ambassador Georg Trefftz reported the incident to Cuban authorities and requested the presence of Cuban Foreign Ministry officials. Luis Garcia Peraza, deputy director of the Europe Department of the Foreign Ministry, went to the embassy in representation of his ministry. The ambassador told him the occupants refuse to leave the site despite the fact he personally has urged them to leave immediately. The German mission has its own security. PRENSA LATINA has learned that four guards are in charge of this embassy's protection. Trefftz said he would keep the Cuban Foreign Ministry informed about the situation, although he has not given the names of the people inside the building. Alfonso explained that the Cuban Foreign Ministry has reiterated the well-known Cuban position that this type of violation of diplomatic missions accredited in the country is unacceptable as an alternative to the legal procedures that must be followed to travel outside national territory. Cuba considers this a provocation and also a carefully planned illegal action executed at the moment the president of Mexico was arriving in Cuba and on the eve of the 4th Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias. The spokesman noted that the origin of this incident is the growing sense of frustration among people who form what he described as the anti-fatherland sector abroad, because of Cuba's victories in the international arena. This also constitutes, according to Alfonso, additional evidence of the negative results of the United States policy of denying visas to people wanting to travel to that country.
