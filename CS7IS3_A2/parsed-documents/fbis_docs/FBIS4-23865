"A statutory body has been constitutionally created by law to reconcile the Afrikaner's quest for freedom and self-determination with the realities of the social, economical and political environment of southern Africa," he said in his inauguration speech. He told the 20-member council that the constitutional development and democratisation of the sub-continent would not be complete until the self-determination aspirations of the Afrikaner people had been resolved in an acceptable manner. "The council is not a divisive organisation aimed at upsetting the relative peace and harmony that currently exists in the country. On the contrary, its key function will be to remove the uncertainties that exist with Afrikaners, political parties, the state and...the local and international community," he said. He said the council had no alternative but to fulfil its task in delivering meaningful recommendations for new legislation, "so that internal peace would exist and the Afrikaner could reach its full potential in Africa in the fields of defence, agriculture, medical services, mining, engineering, law, finance, education, and science. Mr Wingard said the whole community would benefit by an "acceptable political solution for the problem of the Afrikaner's claim to self-determination". The council -- which would be independent of party political organisations -- requested all parties, societies, bodies and individuals to make written or oral submissions to it. "The process will be open and transparent," Mr Wingard said.
