He put forward a clear demand on continuing to do a good job in the general inspection of commodity prices. Zou Jiahua pointed out: Through concerted efforts by various departments, the general inspection of commodity prices in the earlier period was carried out in a smooth manner. A number of cases concerning commodity prices which violated the related law were investigated and due punishment was meted out, and some erroneous practices of wanton raising of commodity prices and wanton collection of fees were rectified. Those efforts have made producers and operators strengthen their internal management concerning prices and improved the order of commodity prices and the market. They have played an active role in ensuring market stability, reducing prices of commodities, and easing the people's minds, and have also created a favorable economic and social environment for the smooth implementation of various major reform measures. Zou Jiahua said: Despite the fact that recently the trend of inflation has been alleviated, the tasks of controlling inflation, stabilizing the market, and reducing commodity prices are still crucial links in correctly handling relations between reform, development, and stability. To continue doing a good job in the general inspection of commodity prices, we must further unify our thinking and understanding and enhance our consciousness of doing a good job in the general inspection. The most important thing is that we must correctly understand and handle relations in the following three aspects: 1. We should correctly understand and handle relations between the deepening of price reform and the strengthening of control over commodity prices. To establish a socialist market economy, we must carry out reform of the price system. To put it briefly, we should change the mechanism in the formation of prices and establish a mechanism of deciding prices primarily through market regulation, we should straighten up the price system and establish a system of comparable prices which can reasonably allocate resources, and we should reform the traditional price management system and establish a price adjustment system controlled indirectly by the government. To realize those goals in reforming the price system, we must adhere to the policy of integrating "adjustment, relaxation, and control" of prices. We should have control over the adjustment and relaxing of prices to ensure that there will not be a disorderly situation while having flexibility in the price system. Even when the task of reform of the price system is completed, the state must still have control over the prices of certain commodities and services with a monopolized or welfare nature. We must not let the prices of those commodities and services go astray. 2. We should correctly understand and handle the relations between supervision and inspection of commodity prices and the reform and administration of prices. When the prices of most commodities are decontrolled, the task of price reform is still not completed. We must continue to change the price mechanism and raise the prices of basic products [ji chu chan pin 1015 4342 3934 0756] and facilities in a planned and systematic manner, and further straighten up the price system. Meanwhile, we should establish and perfect a new price adjustment and control system and management methods to suit the new situation of decontrol of prices. This is an urgent task in price reform today. At present, the problems of manufacturing and selling fake and shoddy commodities to earn big profits, wantonly raising prices, and monopolizing the market are still quite conspicuous. Those problems have aggravated inflation. We must, through the general inspection of commodity prices, guide the behavior of setting prices. Reaping staggering profits and cheating are not in accord with the requirement of the law of a market economy and must not be allowed. We must take a clear-cut stand to oppose and stop such behavior in setting prices. 3. We should correctly understand and handle relations between the adjustment in the management of the price system and economic growth. The purpose of conducting general inspection of commodity prices and implementing the adjustment and regulation of commodity prices is to improve the order of commodity prices in the market, control the excessive rise of commodity prices, and promote economic development in a fast and sound manner. This is favorable to the overall economic situation and economic development in various locales. All locales and departments must subordinate their interests to the interests of the whole, unify their thinking, and take coordinated actions. Zou Jiahua emphatically pointed out: In conducting the general inspection of commodity prices, we must have a clear goal and pay attention to key problems. The principal leading comrades of governments at various levels must personally pay attention to the work, and leading cadres in charge of the work must be responsible for the work, make proper arrangements for the general inspection of commodity prices, create favorable conditions for the execution of duties by price inspection personnel, and help inspectors solve difficulties and problems in their work. Various departments under the State Council should seriously implement the guidelines of the "State Council Circular on Carrying Out the General Inspection of Commodity Prices Throughout the Country," adopt concrete measures to coordinate with commodity price departments, give full play to the advantage of joint efforts of all departments, and ensure the smooth implementation of the general inspection of commodity prices. In conclusion, Zou Jiahua asked various locales to attach great importance to the passing of related laws on price and manage the price system in accordance with the law as quickly as possible. In particular, it is necessary to step up efforts to draft a "law on commodity prices," enacting laws and regulations on opposing fraud, opposing staggering profits and monopolized operation, and formulating rules for supervising and inspecting commodity prices. We should gradually standardize and institutionalize the management, supervision, and inspection of prices. Price inspection personnel must exercise laws in a strict manner, be honest, have self-discipline, actively explore news ways and methods in inspecting commodity prices according to the law of the market economy, and make still greater contributions to stabilizing the overall situation, deepening reform, and promoting development. To further promote the deep-going development of the general inspection of commodity prices, the State Council's working group on the general inspection of commodity prices will go to various provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in mid-June to supervise and guide the work and implement various arrangements made by the current conference.
