Making his remarks at the opening of the industry's national conference, He Guangyuan said the industry will keep growing at a rate of 13 to 14 percent annually through the end of the century. By 2010, he said, the machinery industry will account for a third of the nation's industrial output value . Basic machinery and their components, power generators and automobiles will be the industry's priorities, he added. According to the latest statistics, the machinery industry's output value was 364.5 billion yuan ($41.9 billion) last year, a 24.6 percent increase over the previous year. Profits and taxes jumped 30 percent to reach 32.5 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) and exports of machinery products exceeded $14 billion last year. The industry produced 1.28 million automobiles last year, including 234,000 sedans, representing an increase of 20 percent and 44 percent respectively over 1992. The minister said this year's investment, financial and tax reforms will present the industry with new opportunities and challenges. The establishment of the national import and export bank, he said, will increase machinery exports, particularly complete equipment. However, the money shortage will continue to be tight as more enterprises resort to commercial loans for technical renovations. The new taxation system will make enterprises compete on an equal footing. The unification of the dual-track foreign exchange system will help expand exports but make imports more expensive, he said. And the country's auto assembling factories that depend on imported parts will face higher costs because of the devaluation of renmenbi. Economists predict that the machinery industry will grow 12 to 15 percent this year. The planned auto output is 1.4 million this year, including 340,000 sedans. Continued rapid growth in fixed assets investment this year will be the driving force of the industry. But inadequate transport and the shortage of capital, energy and raw materials will still pose problems. He said the ministry will adopt bolder corporate reforms this year to push enterprises to the market. More companies will be restructured into shareholding ones and be listed at domestic and overseas securities exchanges.
