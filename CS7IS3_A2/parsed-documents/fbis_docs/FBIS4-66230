Everyone like a swarm of bees says the same things and does the same things. Chien Ming-ching [4675 2494 2529], speaker of the Taiwan provincial parliament describes this phenomenon as "dog culture [gou de wenhua]." One dog barks and the pack of dogs follows. When it barks, it is very lively, but when it finishes barking, it is as if nothing had happened and nothing has changed. Dog Culture Can Be Seen Everywhere This "dog culture" is expressed especially clearly in politics. A year ago, on the issue of participation in the United Nations they barked throughout Taiwan to form a group. From Taipei they barked all the way to the front door of the United Nations. It was as if there were no other issue but this on earth. But who knows when, the "United Nations fever" suddenly dropped from the boiling point to the freezing point. Now one no longer hears anyone talking feverishly about the United Nations issue. Recently the popular "southern orientation" topic was exactly the same. Since President Lee Teng-hui vacationed in three ASEAN countries, throughout the country with neat and uniform actions they have concentrated on "looking south." Government units have worked overtime to study and evaluate; the enterprise sector has gone south to investigate nonstop; and the news sector every day has reports of "southern orientation" news. It appears that the future of Taiwan's economy, trade, and foreign affairs can only begin to be ensured by "southern orientation." Another complication of "southern orientation fever" is "presidential foreign visit fever." Lee Teng-hui had just returned from Bangkok when the topics of whether or not in the near future he could visit the United States, visit Japan, visit France, visit Germany, visit Fiji, visit Central and South America were brought out one after the other for great and special speculation. Taiwan's officials every day were chased by reporters and asked these questions that still did not have a trace of evidence. They could only grin and bear it. But foreign government officials, legislators, and scholars also were tediously harangued with, "Would your country agree to a visit from President Lee Teng-hui?" a question "of no interest." It appears a little ridiculous and comical. Another example is such "major national issues" as the vice president serving concurrently as president of the Judicial Yuan and the speaker of the assembly, whether or not the Taipei municipal Number Seven Park Kuan-yin [Goddess of Mercy] statue should be removed, and in the Legislative Yuan generally how many questions and how many answers the form of interpellation should take. These fully manifest "dog culture" characteristics. No one asks if the matter is true or false and no one cares if it is important or not. Someone need only start to ramble on a topic and the other people follow with all their might, rambling until they are talked out and tried of talking, and everything calms down again. But everything remains as before. The boat goes through the water without a trace. In all the world probably only Taiwan can arrive at this state of mind! Concentrated Fever, Concentrated Incapacity From the perspective of social psychology, "concentrating on following the wind" is the phenomenon of a sick society. Whether we should participate in the United Nations, whether we should plan a southern-oriented policy, and whether the president should leave the country on visits are all matters that we can talk about and should talk about and can do and should do. But once the whole nation "dog fashion" is engaged on a grand scale, it becomes "United Nations fever," "southern orientation fever," and "foreign visit fever." Any issue ultimately should have only three minutes of fever. In a society that often has "concentrated fever" and "concentrated stupor" in dealing with national affairs will have difficulty avoiding the resulting "concentrated incapacity." With the Year of the Dog beginning, the dog people precisely can greatly practice their belief in the year that is named for them. The "doggy culture" is bound to shine even more. In the next year, we will amend the constitution and we will select the governor and mayors, and we can expect that in the political arena the excited noise of barking will be heard from all sides. The "dog" people are lucky. The people who do not belong to the dogs can only seek their own greater luck in the midst of the barking!
