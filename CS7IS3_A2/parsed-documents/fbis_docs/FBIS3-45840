Such cooperation ties have been established between nine counties and cities, each with annual revenue of over 100 million yuan, and their counterparts with annual revenues below 20 million yuan. With the progress in the reform and economy, this coastal province has become one of the most developed areas in China. But the gap between its coastal and inland areas has enlarged because of historical and natural reasons. The provincial government decided to forge cooperation between the above mentioned nine counties and cities and nine poor counties in the fields of the development of natural resources, and exchange of technologies, cadres, technicians, laborers and information. The main methods include the rich counties providing funds for the poor based on a share-holding system. The funds have been mainly used in service sector such as real estate, commerce and tourism. Some joint-venture factories have been founded to exploit local natural resources. Meanwhile, the provincial government has formulated preferential policies to help the development of such cooperation. For example, Fuzhou, capital of the province, has helped shouning county to sell and export tea, stone slabs, and stone and wood carvings. And Shishi City has agreed to find work for 5,000 laborers from the poor county of Zhenghe.
