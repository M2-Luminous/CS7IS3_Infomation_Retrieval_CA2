In particular, he described the increase of the military expenses by 3.5 trillion rubles rather than by 18 trillion as proposed by the Federation Council as insufficient. This decision, he said, will bring the manufacturing industries of Russia's 33 regions to their knees. Gonchar was critical of the Duma decision to set up an extra-budgetary army support fund where finances obtained from privatization would be channeled. He said that if cash were available, it had to be included in the budget. He also thought that the financing of regions was insufficient. Gonchar thought that the upper house could not confine its functions to approval or disapproval of what the Duma decided about the budget. He did not rule out the possibility that conciliation procedures could be used to have the budget endorsed by the upper house.
