Sokolova, identified by caption] [Text] [Sokolova over video of truck-mounted missile travelling down a forest track] The Plesetsk test range is 30 years old. Since the disintegration of the Union it is the only Russian test range from which satellites as well as missiles can be launched. Incidentally, last year the world's first communications satellite was launched into orbit from here aboard an ICBM. The latest missile systems have been tested here. Four of them now form the main component of the Russian missile forces and are used for alert duty. Under START II, the Plesetsk computer and information center is processing and analyzing telemetric information on both its own and the U.S. launches. The United States, in turn, receives all the requisite information about our missile systems. According to specialists, Plesetsk is the most hardworking test range in the world. Up to 70 percent of the launches of various satellites and rockets [raketa] carried out in the world take place here. True, as from this year the number of launches has sharply decreased. The reasons for this are many, but the main one is the shortage of funds. This is why commercial satellites will also be launched from Plesetsk in the future. Fortunately, applications from Russian and Western companies have already been received.
