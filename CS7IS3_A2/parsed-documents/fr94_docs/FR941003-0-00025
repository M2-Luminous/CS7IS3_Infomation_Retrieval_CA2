FR941003-0-00025 FR941003-0-00005 (2) In addition, the $10 of returned credit component was returned before October 1, 1994. Example 1 _(i) Additional facts . By the close of 1994, Agency A had allocated $80 of the State M housing credit ceiling. Of the $80 allocated, $16 was allocated to projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations. (ii) Application of stacking rules . The first credit allocated is treated as allocated from the population and returned credit components of the State housing credit ceiling, to the extent of those components. In this case, the $80 of credit allocated is less than the sum of the population and returned credit components. The excess of the sum of the population and returned credit components over the total amount allocated for the calendar year ($110^80=$30) becomes the unused carryforward component of State M's 1995 State housing credit ceiling. Because Agency A did not allocate credit in excess of the sum of the population and returned credit components, no credit is treated as allocated from State M's $50 unused carryforward component in 1994. Because none of this component may be carried forward, all $50 is assigned to the Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool. Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify for credit from the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. (iii) Nonprofit set-aside . Agency A allocated exactly the amount of credit to projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations as necessary to meet the nonprofit set-aside requirement ($16, 10% of the $160 ceiling). Example 2 _(i) Additional facts . By the close of 1994, Agency A had allocated $130 of the State M housing credit ceiling. Of the $130 allocated, $20 was allocated to projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations. (ii) Application of stacking rules . The first $110 of credit allocated is treated as allocated from the population and returned credit components. In this case, because all of the population and returned credit components are allocated, no amount is included in State M's 1995 State housing credit ceiling as an unused carryforward component. The next $20 of credit allocated is treated as allocated from the $50 unused carryforward component. The $30 remaining in the unused carryforward component is assigned to the Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify for credit from the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. (iii) Nonprofit set-aside . Agency A allocated $4 more credit to projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations than necessary to meet the nonprofit set-aside requirement. This does not reduce the application of the 10% nonprofit set-aside requirement to the State M housing credit ceiling for the succeeding year. Example 3 _(i) Additional fact . None of the applications for credit that Agency A received for 1994 are for projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations. (ii) Nonprofit set-aside . Because at least 10% of the State housing credit ceiling must be set aside for projects involving a qualified nonprofit organization, Agency A can allocate only $144 of the $160 State housing credit ceiling for calendar year 1994 ($160^16=$144). If Agency A allocates $144 of credit, the credit is treated as allocated $110 from the population and returned credit components and $34 from the unused carryforward component. The $16 of unallocated credit that is set aside for projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations is treated as the balance of the unused carryforward component, and is assigned to the Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool. Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify for credit from the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. Example 4 _(i) Additional facts . The $10 of returned credit component was returned prior to October 1, 1994. However, a $40 credit that had been allocated in calendar year 1993 to a project involving a qualified nonprofit organization was returned to the Agency by a mutual consent agreement dated November 15, 1994. By the close of 1994, Agency A had allocated $160 of the State M housing credit ceiling, including $16 of credit to projects involving qualified nonprofit organizations. (ii) Effect of three-month rule . Under the three-month rule of paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, Agency A may treat all or part of the $40 of previously allocated credit as returned on January 1, 1995. If Agency A treats all of the $40 amount as having been returned in calendar year 1995, the State M housing credit ceiling for 1994 is $160. This entire amount, including the $16 nonprofit set-aside, has been allocated in 1994. Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M qualifies for the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. (iii) If three-month rule not used . If Agency A treats all of the $40 of previously allocated credit as returned in calendar year 1994, the State housing credit ceiling for the 1994 calendar year will be $200 of which $50 will be attributable to the returned credit component ($10+$40=$50). Because credit amounts allocated in a prior calendar year that are returned in a subsequent calendar year do not retain their nonprofit character, the nonprofit set-aside for calendar year 1994 is $20 (10% of $200). The $160 that Agency A allocated during 1994 is first treated as from the population and returned credit components, which total $150. The next $10 of credit allocated is treated as from the unused carryforward component. The $40 of unallocated credit from the unused carryforward component includes the $4 of unallocated nonprofit set-aside. The entire $40 of credit from the carryforward component is assigned to the Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. State M does not qualify for credit from the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. Example 5 _(i) (A) Additional facts . For calendar year 1994, Agency A has a State housing credit ceiling that consists of the following housing credit dollar amounts: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ A. Population component $100 B. Unused carryforward component 0 C. Returned credit component 20 D. National pool component 10 n,s Total 130 Minimum nonprofit set-aside 13 Ceiling amount not set-aside 117 In addition, the $20 of returned credit component was returned before October 1, 1994. By the close of 1994, Agency A had allocated $100 of the State housing credit ceiling. (ii) Application of stacking rules. The $20 excess of the sum of the population component and the returned credit component over the total amount allocated for the calendar year ($120^100=$20) becomes the unused carryforward component of the State housing credit ceiling for the 1995 calendar year. The $10 of unallocated credit from the national pool component expires and cannot be reallocated. This amount is neither carried over to 1995 by State M nor assigned to the Secretary for inclusion in the National Pool. Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, State M does not qualify for credit from the National Pool for the 1995 calendar year. (l) Effective date . The rules set forth in §1.42&hyph;14 are effective January 1, 1994. PART 602_OMB CONTROL NUMBERS UNDER THE PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT Par. 4.
