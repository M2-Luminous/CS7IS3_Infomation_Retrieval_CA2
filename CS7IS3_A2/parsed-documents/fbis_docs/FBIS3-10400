Senator Fuad Char Abdala had just left the scene when the bomb exploded. According to the polls, Fuad Char Abdala is the Liberal Party candidate who will receive the most votes in the 13 March legislative elections. Char Abdala had presided over the closing ceremony for his political campaign at the aforementioned location. The "Rancho Tropical" in southern Barranquilla was destroyed by the fire sparked by the bomb. Owner Guillermo Min told the police that he had no enemies, thus he believes that the attack was aimed at Char Abdala. The senator was the development minister between 1988 and 1990 and now hopes to be reelected to the Senate. Fortunately the bomb was thrown 30 minutes after the political event had ended, and the liberal leader's followers had already left the scene. The five people who were injured sustained minor cuts when several windows were broken. The individuals were taken to a medical center, where it was determined that none had suffered serious injuries.
