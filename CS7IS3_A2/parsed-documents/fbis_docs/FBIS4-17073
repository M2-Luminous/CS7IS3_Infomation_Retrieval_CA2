According to statistics, the average wage in February was 115,300 rubles [R] with an average per capita income of R79,200; its correlation to the minimum living (physiological) standard was 158 percent. The same January index stood at 175 percent, which means that a decrease in people's earnings followed. In March, the minimum living (physiological) standard was R58,000, which exceeds the February rate by R7,800, or 15.5 percent. The minimum living (physiological) standard for specific groups of people stood at R51,900 for families with children under six years of age; at R69,400 for families with children between seven and 15 years of age; with men between 16 and 59 -- at R68,300; for women aged 16 to 59 years of age -- at R58,900; and with pensioners -- at R40,100. The increase in the minimum living (physiological) standard was primarily caused by a rise in prices for bread and flour products (42 percent), dairy products (20 percent), potatoes (19 percent), and meat (10 percent). Members of the aforementioned committee conclude that the financial security of college students, people receiving minimum pensions, and families with many children has considerably worsened due to the increased prices. Scholarships and special state allowances, which are issued to college students, compensate for 38.3 percent of their minimum living requirements; scholarships issued to students of vocational schools -- 27.4 percent; and allowances issued to mothers -- only 16.4 percent. A minimum pension along with compensation payments stood at R34,300 (which is 85.5 percent of the minimum living standard). It should be noted that in the majority of colleges and vocational schools, scholarships and compensations are usually delayed from one to two months. Over the first three months, allowances to mothers were delayed at many enterprises. Managers of enterprises attribute this to a lack of finances, even for issuing payments to employees, and the delayed transfer of assets designated for paying allowances to mothers. According to members of this committee, delays in paying scholarships, allowances, and wages trigger social tension. The committee predicts that in April a 10-percent increase in prices will follow. Per capita income will remain at R87,000 and its correlation to the minimum living (physiological) standard will stay at 136 percent. The standard of living will gradually decrease and will correspond to the level of the first six months of 1993. In April, some 22 percent of Kaliningrad Oblast residents will live at or near the poverty line (in January -- 7 percent). These people will require social assistance from the state. In the meantime, some rayons of the oblast are experiencing exceptionally dire problems in providing social assistance to families which are poorly off. In Zelenogradskiy Rayon, for example, school meals were suspended and there is money to provide financial assistance to those who need it.
