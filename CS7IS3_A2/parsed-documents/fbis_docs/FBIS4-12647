Writer Affirms Muslim Brothers Will Survive CHIEF EDITOR LASHES OUT AT SECURITY GUARDS' CONDUCT In a 1,200-word editorial entitled "The Sultan's Guards" on pages 1 and 2, Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn lashes out at the chief of the State Security Detectives Department, guards from which prevent cars from using the roads surrounding his home, arrest children for using fireworks, harass the inhabitants, and grant themselves the right to take goods from any shop without paying for them. He adds that three of these guards entered a refreshment shop for a "free" soft drink a few days ago. When the salesman asked them to pay, he was not only insulted, but one fired a bullet at his head and killed him instantly to punish him for his insolence, Husayn writes. Husayn asks: If the chief of the State Security Detectives does not know how to select his guards--who should be the elite of the police--how can we be reassured about security in the country? Claiming that the police are no longer bound by the law, Husayn says that this horrific incident should be punished on the political level and then on the legal level. He explains that police involvement in a battle against armed terrorism does not mean the police can turn into an armed division that acts without any controls. Husayn maintains that the "arbitrary security approach" pursued against violent groups in Upper Egypt enhances public hostility toward the security forces. This provides fertile soil for more counter violence, he says. He criticizes officials for failing to realize that armed terrorism is a result of the crisis in the regime, which, failing to develop the democratic practice, tries to stifle that small amount of democracy achieved in the press and refuses to listen to the Islamic pulse of the nation. He notes that television shows the American soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, yet someone like Shaykh al-Ghazali and cleric 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahim are banned from appearing on television screens. "This nation has returned to Islam. If the authorities do not let it express itself peacefully within the limits of the law and the Constitution, how can it expect stability to prevail?," he asks. He maintains that the authorities rig elections to prevent Islamists from ruling because they know that "the ruling party will not survive semiclean elections." He stresses that the battle to secure clean elections must start now because "rectifying the electoral process is crucial for rescuing the nation from its crisis." LABOR PARTY LEADER, JOURNALISTS' TRIAL BEGINS An 800-word report on page 1 by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Munim and Khalid Yunis says that the first hearing in the trial of the leaderships of the Labor Party and AL-SHA'B newspaper opened on Saturday "amid a crowd of Egyptian patriotic forces" and "strict security measures." The report gives an account of the hearing, at which the trial was postponed until 8 May. CLERIC ASSAILS ARTISTS' ANTITERRORISM ROLE In his 500-word column "This Is Our Religion" on page 12, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali finds it ridiculous that actors and actresses who have no knowledge of Islam should be recruited in a campaign to fight terrorism and teach Islam to the public. RULER'S GLORIFICATION CRITICIZED A 500-word column by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus called "The Natives" on page 12 criticizes the underdeveloped world that is ruled by "tyrant regimes" for shouting the slogan: "We sacrifice blood and soul for you, Mr. President." He says the slogan is welcome when the sacrifice is made for martyrs who fall as they sincerely fight the Israeli occupier but it is a "living example of backwardness" if it is shouted in a country full of "political scandals." Citing examples of these "scandals," 'Abd-al-Quddus suggests that the ruler in a backward country achieves an overwhelming victory by rigging elections, restricting opposition, exercising absolute authority, and controlling the press, which always glorifies him. He concludes: "My country cannot take one step forward under such conditions." CLERIC ON "THE END OF ISRAEL" In a 500-word article entitled "The End of Israel" on page 11, al-Azhar cleric and Consultative Council member Ibrahim Ahmad al-Waqfi cites verses 4-5 of Sura 17 of the Koran, al-Isra', in which God judged that the sons of Israel would do mischief twice on earth and be defeated twice. The writer suggests the first time might have been when Babylonian Nebuchadnezzar's army fought the Jews, killed thousands of them, and drove them out of Palestine or when the Muslims conquered Jerusalem during the time of Caliph 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab. He contends that we are now going through the second episode. "The Jews set up a state in Palestine and expelled its people with the help of the enemies of Islam," he says, adding that their major ally, America, supplied them with weapons and funds and made them stronger than the collective Arab nation, just like the sixth verse of the Sura promised. Citing the same Koranic Sura, verse 7, the writer contends: The second time, the Jews would be fought and defeated by people who undo all the mischief that the Jews did in the holy lands and enter the mosque just as they did the first time. He concludes by citing Prophet Muhammad's assertion to Muslims that they would fight Jews and triumph over them and that a rock would tell a Muslim if a Jew hid behind it and the Muslim would say: Kill him. WRITER AFFIRMS MUSLIM BROTHERS WILL SURVIVE Ahmad al-Malat's 2,500-word article "What are you planning? You are playing with fire" on page 5 discusses the "oppression the current regime in Egypt plots by night against the Islamic current." He writes: The poor Egyptian people have been afflicted for 40 years with the military coup that "begot rulers who imposed themselves on the people." He criticizes those who repeat that there is nothing called the Muslim Brothers and who deny the Muslim Brotherhood the right to take part in national dialogue. Referring to a statement published in the 24 March edition of AL-WAFD, al-Malat criticizes former Interior Minister Hasan Abu-Basha for warning against the Muslim Brothers' pursuit of power under the pretext of upholding religious principles and for accusing them of holding an unholy alliance with terrorism. Giving an account of what he calls the oppressive measures the authorities adopt against Muslim Brothers countrywide, he advises the authorities not to exhaust themselves by chasing the Muslim Brothers, because "they are the rock on which the heads of those before you were crushed." He assails those who claim to adopt Islam in spite of the hatred he sees them harboring for it. He also suggests that there is restriction of al-Azhar's role and that preaching has been made exclusive to their "hired hands." He notes the triumph of the Islamic Welfare Party in municipal elections in Turkey and accuses the media of playing down that triumph. He also praises the Islamic current in Algeria and Sudan and wishes Sudan's al-Bashir success in pursuing the Islamic course. He notes the "good steps toward enforcing God's law in Yemen" and wishes the Yemenis success. He concludes: Attempts to "cut the wings of the Islamic call will not succeed, because our feathers grow rapidly."
