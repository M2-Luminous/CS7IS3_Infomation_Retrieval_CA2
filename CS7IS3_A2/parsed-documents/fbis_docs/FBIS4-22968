Nilsson's theory is described, and its limitations discussed. The main role in this model is played by the concept of possibility distribution and a method of determining the distribution from a single knowledge base. This enables one to include a consideration of subjective and inexact expert information. The general properties of this model are studied. The complexity of calculating the possibility distribution increases exponentially with the size of the knowledge base . Moreover, one may only use a small part of the knowledge base or only some of the deductions from a portion of the knowledge base. This method is therefore inefficient for large knowledge bases. Semantic aspects of the logic are studied and form the basis for efficient approximate methods of calculating possibility distributions. The model of fuzzy probabilistic logic is actually a family of different logics; aspects common to the entire family are studied. References 3 (Western).
