President Husni Mubarak is scheduled to receive the UN envoy to discuss the latest developments of the Yemeni crisis and the tense situation there. Brahimi will also meet Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to follow up his consultations on the crisis. In an arrival statement, Brahimi voiced his profound regret at the continuation of fighting in Yemen and at not consolidating Security Council Resolution 924 with a cease-fire between the rival parties. He confirmed that his efforts are continuing to achieve this goal. He said that he submitted a proposal to the brothers in north and south Yemen yesterday and today that each side appoint its representatives to discuss setting up a mechanism to consolidate and supervise a cease-fire accord and that a meeting be held between these parties in Cairo if they agree. He explained that the proposal was the result of various talks and counterproposals from the two sides during which they accepted the idea of setting up this mechanism and agreed that the meeting be held in one of the Arab capitals, including Cairo. The mechanism, he added, should begin with a joint military committee made up of representatives from Arab and other countries. He noted that the two parties' stances are still far apart and that we are trying to establish an efficient groundwork to start direct talks. He said his mission took 15 days because the two sides engaged in proposals and counterproposals. He added: We must sit and explore the possibility of reconciling the two sides and reaching an agreement that might not be implemented. The UN envoy expressed his hope that firing will stop immediately if the brothers in Yemen agree on this idea. He said that if an agreement is not reached or if the brothers in Yemen feel that such a meeting is not suitable at present, he will move on to New York after completing his consultations in Cairo. Brahimi concluded his statement by saying that the brothers in south Yemen informed him of their consent to the proposal and that he is awaiting a response from the brothers in north Yemen, which he expects to receive tonight or tomorrow morning, Saturday.
