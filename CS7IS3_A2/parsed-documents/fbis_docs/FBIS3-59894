The consequences of the step taken by Ukraine have not been recognized with us as yet, unfortunately. The point being that we are present not simply during Ukraine's revision of its former position in respect to nonnuclear status. A new nuclear power, a nuclear superpower, even, is being created before our eyes. After all, in terms of the quantity of strategic nuclear arms deployed on the territory of Ukraine and declared by the Supreme Council to be its property, it is today entirely comparable with what the Soviet Union had 25 years ago, in the period when the Soviet-American negotiations that led in 1972 to the signing of the SALT 1 treaty began. Even following the reductions to which the Ukrainian leadership has consented, Ukraine will have more nuclear arms than Britain, France, and China put together. Why has this happened? Why has Ukraine renounced its former positions? Such an outcome of events was, I believe, to have been expected. The commitment to the adoption of nuclear-free status was made by Ukraine in the period when the struggle for sovereignty was under way. Ukraine was not an independent state at that time. The situation changed drastically following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when the formation of new independent national states began, and Ukraine, like any other state, is taking the path of recognition of power factors, primarily military-power factors, as the basis of its position in the international arena and status in the system of international relations. And if Russia, the United States, and other nuclear states are not about to give up their nuclear arms--it is only a question of a reduction thereof--why should we expect any different a position of Ukraine? The formation of a new independent state, when its position is still quite fragile, is evoking in Ukrainian political circles--and not only among nationalists--an aspiration to rely on some power levers. Nuclear weapons under these conditions are coming to be perceived as a guarantor of Ukraine's independence and as a means of deterrence against interference in its internal affairs. From Russia's viewpoint, such a development of events is, naturally, extremely undesirable. After all, this means that Soviet nuclear weapons have not one successor--Russia--but two and, possibly, three, considering that Kazakhstan also is refusing to recognize the nuclear weapons on its territory as Russian property and is essentially, albeit with a certain lag, taking the route carved out by Ukraine. Thus, Russia will become the sole state in the world that will have on its borders three nuclear neighbors, counting China. This geostrategic situation could have extremely negative consequences if account is taken of that entire complex of territorial national border contradictions that exist even now and that could emerge for Russia with its neighbors in the future. Ukraine's step will have negative consequences also for the system of international relations as a whole. After all, the appearance of a new nuclear power or superpower, even, is a most severe blow to the status of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which is already experiencing the strongest pressure as a result of the actions of North Korea, Iran, Iraq, India, and Pakistan as it is. How might the world community impede the nuclear ambitions of some states and agree to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and nuclear status by others? The logic of the Nonproliferation Treaty is confounded, and it may be expected that at the conference reviewing this treaty, which is scheduled for 1995, Ukraine's actions will be used by many opponents of a continuation of the nonproliferation regime to undermine it and to deny an extension thereof. In addition, in the new multipolar world that has come to replace the bipolar system of the cold war period, the prospect of the proliferation of nuclear weapons would bring about an abrupt destabilization of the situation. Use of the nuclear factor to become a power center could make the process of the preservation of stability in the multipolar world practically unmanageable. It has to be said that the Ukrainian leadership's decision represents a most important miscalculation of Russia. Two years ago at Belovezhskaya Pushcha, and in subsequent agreements of the CIS, the question of ownership of the nuclear weapons was avoided. Nebulous, essentially meaningless wording of the "unified control over nuclear weapons" type was employed instead. Under conditions where each republic had become a full successor of all Soviet property on its territory, such wording could not have prevented a division of the military inheritance among the republics, and now, it is becoming clear, the nuclear inheritance also. For a long time, unfortunately, the Russian leadership ignored the problem, putting its faith in the United States and the West forcing Ukraine to abandon its claims. But this did not happen. And Russia itself contributed to the increased suspicions in respect to itself in Ukraine, making territorial demands, inflating the conflict over the Black Sea Fleet, and using economic levers as a stick in relations with Ukraine. All this played into the hands of the circles in Ukraine that are doing everything possible to rid themselves of the Chernobyl syndrome and build Ukrainian sovereignty on the classical factors of power politics.
