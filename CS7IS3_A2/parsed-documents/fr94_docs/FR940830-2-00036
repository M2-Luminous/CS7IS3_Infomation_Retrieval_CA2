FR940830-2-00036 FR940830-2-00015 II. Jurisdiction and Authority The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan for the distribution of funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. §§4501 et seq., Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE ¶ 82,508 (1981); Office of Enforcement , 8 DOE ¶ 82,597 (1981) ( Vickers ). We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund. We intend to publicize our proposal and solicit comments from interested parties before taking the actions proposed in this Decision. Comments regarding the tentative distribution process set forth in this Proposed Decision and Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publication in the Federal Register . III. Proposed Refund Procedures We propose to implement a two-stage refund procedure for distribution of the Beacon Bay Remedial Order fund. In the first stage, purchasers of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order may submit Applications for Refund. From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants generally will fall into the following categories: (i) end-users; (ii) regulated entities, such as cooperatives; and (iii) resellers and retailers. A. Claims Based Upon Overcharges. In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submit a schedule of its monthly purchases of gasoline from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order_August 1979 through March 1980. If the gasoline was not purchased directly from Beacon Bay, the claimant must establish that the gasoline originated with Beacon Bay. Additionally, a reseller or retailer claimant, except one who chooses to utilize the injury presumptions set forth below, will be required to make a detailed showing that it was injured by Beacon Bay's overcharges. This showing will generally consist of two distinct elements. First, a reseller or retailer claimant will be required to show that it had ``banks'' of unrecouped increased product costs in excess of the refund claimed. 1 Second, because a showing of banked costs alone is not sufficient to establish injury, a claimant must additionally provide evidence that market conditions precluded it from increasing its prices to pass through the additional costs associated with the overcharges. See Vaqueros Energy Corp./Hutches Oil Co. Inc., 11 DOE ¶ 85,070 at 88,105 (1983). Such a showing could consist of a demonstration that a firm suffered a competitive disadvantage as a result of its purchases from Beacon Bay. See National Helium Co./Atlantic Richfield Corp., 11 DOE ¶ 85,257 (1984), aff'd sub nom. Atlantic Richfield Co. v. DOE, 618 F. Supp. 1199 (D. Del. 1985). 1 Claimants who have previously relied upon their banked costs in order to obtain refunds in other special refund proceedings should subtract those refunds from any cost banks submitted in this refund proceeding. See Husky Oil Co./Metro Oil Products, Inc., 16 DOE ¶ 85,090, at 88,179 (1987). Additionally, a claimant attempting to show injury may not receive a refund for any month in which it has a negative accumulated cost bank(for gasoline) or for any prior month. See Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)/Suburban Propane Gas Corp., 13 DOE ¶ 85,030, at 88,082 (1985). If a claimant no longer has records showing its banked costs, the OHA may use its discretion to permit the claimant to approximate those cost banks. See, e.g., Gulf Oil Corp./Sturdy Oil Co., 15 DOE ¶ 85,187 (1986). Our experience also indicates that the use of certain presumptions permits claimants to participate in the refund process without incurring inordinate expense and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficient manner possible. See, e.g., Marathon Petroleum Co., 14 DOE ¶ 85,269 (1986) ( Marathon ). Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorized by the applicable Subpart V regulations at 10 C.F.R. 205.282(e). Accordingly, we propose to adopt the presumptions set forth below. 1. Calculation of Refunds. First, we will adopt a presumption that the overcharges were dispersed equally in all of Beacon Bay's sales of gasoline during the period covered by the Remedial Order. In accordance with this presumption, refunds are made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis. 2 In the absence of better information, a volumetric refund is appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices. 2 If an individual claimant believes that it was injured by more than its volumetric share, it may elect to forego this presumption and file a refund application based upon a claim that it suffered a disproportionate share of Beacon Bay's overcharges. See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp./Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co., 20 DOE ¶ 85,788 (1990); Mobil Oil Corp./Marine Corps Exchange Service, 17 DOE ¶ 85,714 (1988). Such a claim will be granted if the claimant makes a persuasive showing that it was ``overcharged'' by a specific amount, and that it absorbed those overcharges. See Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co./Western Petroleum Co., 19 DOE ¶ 85,705 (1989). To the degree that a claimant makes this showing, it will receive an above-volumetric refund. Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of the Remedial Order fund is equal to the number of gallons purchased from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order times the per gallon refund amount. In the present case, the per gallon refund amount is $0.0690. We derived this figure by dividing the amount of the Remedial Order fund, $100,697.87, by 1,460,321 gallons, the volume of gasoline which Beacon Bay sold from August 1, 1979, through March 31, 1980. A claimant that establishes its eligibility for a refund will receive all or a portion of its allocable share plus a pro-rata share of the accrued interest. 3 3 As in previous cases, we propose to establish a minimum refund amount of $15. In this proceeding, any potential claimant purchasing less than 211 gallons of gasoline from Beacon Bay would have an allocable share of less than $15. We have found through our experience that the cost of processing claims in which refunds for amounts less than $15 are sought outweighs the benefits of restitution in those instances. See Exxon Corp., 17 DOE ¶ 85,590, at 89,150 (1988) ( Exxon ). In addition to the volumetric presumption, we also propose to adopt a number of presumptions regarding injury for claimants in each category listed below. 2. End-Users. In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we propose to adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumer of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the overcharges resolved by the Remedial Order. See, e.g., Texas Oil and Gas Corp., 12 DOE ¶ 85,069 at 88,209 (1984) ( TOGCO ). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, members of this group generally were not subject to price controls during the period covered by the Remedial Order, and were not required to keep records which justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysis of the impact of the overcharges on the final prices of goods and services produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. Id. We therefore propose that the end-users of gasoline purchased from Beacon Bay need only document their purchase volumes from Beacon Bay during the period covered by the Remedial Order to make a sufficient showing that they were injured by the overcharges.
