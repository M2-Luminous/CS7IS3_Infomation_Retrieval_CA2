I have something to tell you." At the beginning of April, a senior Foreign Ministry official dropped in on Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], at his office, which is located in the members' office building. The Foreign Ministry official left shortly after briefing Chairman Murayama on the growing crisis over the DPRK's alleged nuclear weapons development program. The Bitter Experience of the Gulf War Is Ever-Present in the Minds of the Bureaucrats Two weeks later, during the process of hammering out a policy platform for the new coalition government, the SDPJ and the Shinseito-Komeito [Japan Renewal Party-Clean Government Party] bloc were strongly divided over the question of how far Japan would be able to cooperate should the United States decide to impose sanctions on North Korea ahead of a UN resolution. Takeo Nishioka, who was waiting for the outcome of the negotiations inside the Diet building, explained the sentiments of Shinseito coleader Ichiro Ozawa and of his allies as follows: "The fact that Japan was unable to take prompt action during the Gulf war remains in everyone's heart. If possible, crisis-management legislation should be drafted," he said. (At that time, Nishioka was the leader of Kaikaku No Kai, a group of former members of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] who are closely aligned with Shinseito.) "Although we made every effort to explain the situation, the SDPJ did not understand at all," the senior Foreign Ministry official said disappointedly. "There is a great possibility that Japan might be forced to take some action against North Korea in the near future. When the time comes, we do not want to see politicians disputing basic points," he added. In May 1991, shortly after the end of the Gulf war, a U.S. delegation led by Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz came to Japan to hold discussions with senior Japanese Defense Agency officials and with LDP members. When [Foreign Minister] Koji Kakizawa, who at that time was chief of the LDP's National Defense Division, explained to the U.S. side that "Japan will continue to contribute to activities based on UN resolutions," a senior U.S defense official said with a glum look, "Does this mean that Japan will only be able to repeat what it did during the Gulf war should hostilities break out on the Korean peninsula?" Senior Defense Agency officials, who attended the meeting, took these words seriously. Since the end of March 1994, each political party has been holding a series of informal meetings to study the DPRK issue. Foreign Ministry and Defense Agency officials, who are unable to forget the bitter experience of the Gulf war, volunteered to join these meetings as lecturers. Bureaucrats Are Making Steady Progress in Their "Study of the North Korean Issue" On March 30, the day before the UN Security Council issued a statement urging North Korea to accept full-scale international inspections of its nuclear sites, the LDP held a joint meeting on issues related to Northeast Asia. At the meeting, Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's General Foreign Policy Bureau, stressed that the government's basic stand is "to seek a resolution of the crisis concerning the DPRK's suspected nuclear program through dialogue." However, at the same time he added, "By employing different scenarios, the ministries and agencies concerned are checking on what Japan can or cannot do within the existing legal framework." According to high-ranking government officials, the ministries and agencies concerned are not examining possible measures with the object of "preparing for an emergency arising from trouble on the Korean peninsula" but rather they are just doing this as part of their "study of the North Korean issue." They have been making steady progress in compiling possible measures that might be taken against the DPRK -- restrictions on bilateral trade through a government ordinance on trade controls, and a regulation from the Finance Ministry restricting the flow of funds from Korean residents in Japan to North Korea. The possibility of assisting a U.S. naval blockade is also being examined. Some documents compiled by the Defense Agency even refer to Japan's participation in the U.S. Theater Missile Defense plan as "an option having a psychological effect on North Korea," although there is controversy over this subject, which includes the problem of collective self-defense. Meanwhile, shortly after assuming his post in the Hata administration, Foreign Minister Kakizawa said that Japan needs a public debate on reinterpreting the Constitution regarding the notion of collective self-defense. Although the DPRK's intentions are still unclear and although the UN Security Council has not yet decided on a response, the belief that Japan will take action against North Korea is growing because of the support for this by both bureaucrats and politicians. Officials at the prime minister's official residence in charge of the DPRK issue feel apprehensive about such a situation. "Seen from a diplomatic viewpoint, it is undesirable to hold such discussions in this way, because our neighboring countries may make various conjectures about this. The study of possible actions should be pursued quietly," they said. "Japan's cooperation on sanctions is very important. However, if Japan reinterprets the Constitution for that purpose, the new interpretation will remain valid even after the North Korean issue is settled. So, we have mixed feelings," the first secretary at the South Korea Embassy said when he was asked about the fact that there is a belief within the Japanese Government that Japan should participate in an economic blockade, even by reinterpreting the Constitution. "All the words that Japan has been using to apologize for its actions during the war were a mere pretense. Japan is expressing regret just because it wants to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. I was swayed by such misgivings when I heard the remarks of ex-Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano regarding the 1937 Rape of Nanjing," the secretary added. Bureaucrats Have the Question of Permanent Membership on the UN Security Council on their Minds Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata clearly expressed his intention to seek a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. "If you want to push for a permanent seat, this is the time to start lobbying," Yoshio Hata, Japan's former ambassador to the United Nations, stressed when he called on Prime Minister Hata at the beginning of May. Meanwhile, Sakigake [Harbinger], which strongly favors minimal involvement by Japan in global affairs, opted out of the ruling coalition. As a result, bureaucrats have become more aggressive over diplomatic and security issues.
