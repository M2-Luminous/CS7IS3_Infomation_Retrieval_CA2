The idea of the congress is supported by the Central Bank of Russia, a number of ministries and agencies, and the Central Bank's main administration for the Far East. So what do the bankers intend to discuss at their congress? First and foremost, the task is to give Asia-Pacific region financiers a real understanding of the state of the Russian Far East economy. There will also be a discussion of the state of the banking business in Russia and its special features in the Far Eastern region. The bankers will exchange experiences of business development in the course of reforming a national economy. The International Banking Congress promises to be quite representative. About 300 foreign and Russian commercial banks, exchanges, joint-stock companies, joint enterprises, enterprises, and organizations in the Far East have been invited to participate. The names of just a few of them will suffice to get an idea of how impressive this undertaking is. For instance, among those who have already accepted an invitation to participate are the Central Bank of Russia, the Bank of Tokyo, the Deutschebank, Credit Suisse, the Manhattan Bank, the Russian-American Foundation, Far Eastern commercial banks, and others. The congress will feature an exhibition of investment and innovation projects. The organizational committee is ready to accept such projects for review and assist in their placement. It is assumed that the congress will adopt a declaration on the basic directions of interaction between Asia-Pacific region banks and will work out recommendations for Far Eastern commercial banks on development strategy and prospects. The congress organizational committee addressed future participants: "We will be grateful to those bankers and joint venture entrepreneurs who are able to send to the congress organizational committee comments and proposals for improving foreign economic activities, foreign currency regulation, investment policy, and financial and organizational conditions.
