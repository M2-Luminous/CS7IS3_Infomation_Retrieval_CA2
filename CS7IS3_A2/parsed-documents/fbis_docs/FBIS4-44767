An extremely fast transistor which becomes the building block of tomorrow's wireless communications system. It opens the door to an infinity of unutilized frequency bands, band which all lie above 20 gigaherz, where one will be forced to communicate in the future. A transistor which works at a frequency of 380 gigaherz. That is the result of eight years of research at Chalmers Institute of Technology in Goteborg. Here is one of the world's best research groups on high-speed electronics. A group which during the last six years has created 10 generations of the fastest transistor type HFET (Heterostructure Field Effect Transistor). HFETs which through new material combinations and refined lithography methods (methods of writing the pattern lines from which circuits are made, have become increasingly faster with each generation. 380 Gigaherz "A few months ago we arrived at limiting frequencies of 380 gigahertz," says Herbert Zirath, a researcher at the department for microwave technology. "I did not think that was possible a few years ago." These rapid transistors can now become the solution to a problem that is difficult to solve in today's communications society--the lack of frequencies. Because regardless of how blue the sky looks, it is jampacked with carrying frequencies. Frequencies which bring television images, radio, mobile telephones and a great deal more. Up to 1 gigahertz it is really crowded, then it thins out a little, after which an ocean of free frequencies spreads out above 20 gigahertz. This is where international standards organizations now want to place the links to the mobile communications networks of the future, wireless local data networks and new services such as video on demand. But that is easier said than done. Completely new high-frequency components that can be mass produced and new monolithic circuits are needed in order to develop circuits which work in the millimeter wavelength range. This is where the transistor at Chalmers enters the picture. With the transistor as a building block new circuits for communication in the gigahertz range have already seen the light of day. Among them are, for example, a hybrid circuit in which the researchers have used an HFET as a resistive frequency mixer up to 120 gigahertz. This is something they alone in the world have achieved. Other research groups have only achieved 35 gigahertz. The mixer is part of a whole family of circuits which the researchers are now working with, a family which together will create a combined sender/receiver for the 55-gigahertz frequency. It would, for example be possible to use it as a digital radio link connecting base stations in a future telephone net. Here the researchers are working with Ericsson Radar and with financial support from Nutek. Even Higher The Chalmers researchers are also moving even higher up in the frequency range. On behalf of the Swedish Space Corporation they are developing an HFET-based receiver for radioastronomy. It is to work in the 119 gigahertz frequency and be installed in the Swedish satellite Odin, a satellite which according to plans is to be launched in the year 1997. Compact Design But if equipment for satellites can be permitted to be expensive, the same does not apply for equipment to be used publicly. Instead, it involves compact design in combination with large volumes, which in turn result in low prices. The Chalmers researchers, together with researchers at the University of Michigan, have found a solution to that problem. As the first research group in the world they have integrated a slot aerial with an HFET mixer and a lens. Monolithic Integration The group is now working intensely on integrating transistors and circuits on one and the same semiconductor chip, so-called monolithic integration. Through the integration it will now be possible to generate and amplify signals on the same circuit, something which in turn makes it possible to build a monolithic amplifier on a single chip. Yes, perhaps even with a combined sender/receiver on one chip. This in turn yields compact equipment and the possibility of mass production, with lower prices as a result. "While manufacturing the HFETs we have today arrived at more than 90 percent flawless circuits. And that is what is needed in order to manufacture integrated circuits," says Herbert Zirath. A High-Frequency World The fast transistors which have been developed at Chalmers Institute of Technology can be used for the following, among others: - Radio links which can be used for telecommunication in cities where fiberoptics are difficult to install (60 GHz), communication systems for cars and trains and wireless data networks in offices. - Radar applications as intelligent speed controls in cars (77 GHz), three-dimensional images of radar targets, landing systems for aircraft during poor visibility (94 Ghz) and phase-controlled antennas. - Instruments such as receivers with low intrinsic noise for radioastronomy (119 Ghz). - Fiberoptic communication with a speed of 40 gigabits per second. The transistor can then be used to build laser modulators, optical receivers and circuits which pick out the clock concealed in the bit stream.
