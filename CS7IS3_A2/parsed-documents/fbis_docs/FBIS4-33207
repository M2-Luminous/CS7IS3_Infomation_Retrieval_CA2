With an expansive smile and this remark, which may be an indication, President Carlos Menem on 1 June received the photographers and cameramen that recorded the meeting he had with Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde at Government House. Flanked by [Presidency] Secretary General Eduardo Bauza and Buenos Aires Province Deputy Governor Rafael "Balito" Roma, Menem and Duhalde waited standing up in the presidential office for the cameras and television crews to enter. As though he wanted to demonstrate that his spats with Duhalde are pure fantasy, Menem was openly at ease and was even heard to talk with the governor about Argentina's win over Israel [in a 31 May soccer match]. With a conspirator's smile, Menem then faced photographers and cameramen, to whom he said: "Boys, the formula once again," referring to the possibility of repeating the two-man [ticket] that led the Justicialist Party to victory on 14 May 1989. Duhalde could do no less than smile at the quip made by Menem, who, behind the scenes, once again began to pull the governor's leg regarding the size of his head: "He always overshadows me."
