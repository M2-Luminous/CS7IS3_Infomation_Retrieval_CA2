The message said: The nightmarish opening of the rice market in South Korea is a never-to-be-condoned crime which results from the flunkeyist treachery of Kim Yong-sam who flatteringly yielded to the brigandish pressure from U.S. imperialism. It is intolerable that he claims "there will be more things gained than lost" in rice market opening. Due to the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group, the six million farmers of South Korea are deprived of fields and means of livelihood. The only way for us to get rid of the miserable lot today is to cut the colonial noose of the United States through the anti-U.S. struggle for independence and decisively overthrow Kim Yong-sam, a pro-U.S. flunkeyist and rare traitor. The message called on the South Korean farmers to rise up in struggle and resolutely check the rice market opening ruinous to the nation, overthrow the Kim Yong-sam "government" and drive out the United States.
