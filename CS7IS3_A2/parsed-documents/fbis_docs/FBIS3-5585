The visit came as part of a nationwide tour to introduce the party's new leader not only to the public, but also to the military commanders who hold such sway in Indonesia's underdeveloped eastern regions. It may also have given the East Timorese people hope that their problems with the Indonesian Government will be better understood. But if Ms. Sukarno's tour does not produce results, East Timor can also look for help from another female source -- Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, daughter of Indonesia's current president. [passage omitted] The first sign that some thing new was in prospect came late last year when Ms. Sukarno took afternoon tea at Mrs. Rukmana's home. The two ladies, while not estranged, had never before been particularly friendly. But a few days before the meeting, Mrs. Rukmana had paid a personal visit to the grave of Ms Sukarno's father, former president Sukarno, in Blitar, East Java. That visit made it perfectly clear to the political pundits that Mrs. Rukmana's father, President Suharto, who took over from the late Mr. Sukarno, had no objection to the newly announced political plans of his predecessor's daughter. A few days later, Ms. Sukarno was installed as elected leader of the Indonesia Democratic Party (PDI), the small opposition party which had been riven by factionalism, rivalry, and government interference for over a year. Ms. Sukarno's rise to the chairmanship signals a potential shift in Indonesian politics where power has been concentrated in the hands of the Army-backed ruling group Golkar [Functional Group], which is also supported by the bureaucracy. It followed the establishment for the first time of a civilian leadership in Golkar. At its party conference in October, Minister of Information Harmoko took over what had previously been a military post. Ms. Sukarno and Mr. Harmoko have already clashed, with a preliminary skirmish over Golkar's "single majority," under which the ruling group dominates all decisionmaking and excludes others from power in the country. Ms. Sukarno called for policies which took all public views into account, while Mr. Harmoko declared that Golkar's large election victories gave it the right to exercise power as the people's choice. Meanwhile, the other presidential daughter was displaying her own intentions to become a political player. Mrs. Rukmana had already joined the leadership of Golkar last October when she was chosen as a vice chairman of the executive board. Her involvement in East Timor diplomacy started late last year when she took part in a secret meeting in London to discuss ways to seek recognition and reconciliation with Portugal, the former colonial power. Mrs. Rukmana has now been installed as chairman of the Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Society following the visit to Indonesia of retired Portuguese General Carlos Galvao de Melo, who will be her cochairman in Portugal. She will return the visit shortly. Nor has Mrs. Rukmana restricted her activities to trying to help resolve the East Timor problem. Best known as a businesswoman in the past, her highway construction company is involved in major projects in Indonesia and Malaysia. A subsidiary has been set up to manage trade and manufacturing of Malaysian cars and Indonesian aircraft. [passage omitted] Political analysts believe it is too early to say precisely what Mrs. Rukmana's long-range plans may be. They are also unsure of the effect of the rise to prominence of two women in a country which has little history of women in public office. But they believe that it is hardly surprising given the numerous examples of female leaders in other Asian and Muslim countries. Especially where a woman politician has a political family background, sex need be no bar to successful leadership they say. Ms. Sukarno's popularity in her own party and with the general public is not in doubt although she is politically untested. [passage omitted]
