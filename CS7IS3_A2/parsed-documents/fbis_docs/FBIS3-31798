During that time the new stabilization program has been implemented. How would you comment on the fact that Mr. Mirko Marjanovic will take up your job? [Sainovic] Briefly, I can express great satisfaction that a man with such experience and such results in the economy -- which Mr. Marjanovic has behind him -- will be in a position to form a government of national unity in the Republic of Serbia. I am convinced that the program will be in safe hands -- to put it that way -- in the Republic of Serbia and that it will certainly produce results. [Jevtic] You are going from the Serbian Government to the Federal Government as deputy prime minister with a very concrete and special task. You will be the coordinator of the entire program for the reconstruction of the monetary system and the recovery of our economy. What are your exact tasks? [Sainovic] I am deeply aware of the significant responsibility for the realization of the program and the coordination of all the subjects that participate in its realization. The program is not only of the Federal Government, because the National Bank and the Payment Operations Services also participate in it. Both republics, the economy, and the association of all these subjects for a synchronized operation is a very important task, and that will be the essence of my everyday work. I am convinced that all the subjects involved in this will simply justify the huge confidence that the people already have in the new dinar and this program, and that this confidence is in effect the measure of my responsibility.
