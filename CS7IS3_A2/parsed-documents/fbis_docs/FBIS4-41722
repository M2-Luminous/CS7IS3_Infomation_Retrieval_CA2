Kolosova, and others] [Text] Tajik opposition does not have a hand in terrorist activities against Russian servicemen, Akbar Turajonzoda, a co-chairman of the Islamic Renaissance Movement, told Interfax . He emphasized that Russia was the main guarantor of Tajikistan's security and the country's ally. He thought that the acts of terror against Russian servicemen in Tajikistan had been engineered by those who wanted to drag Russia into the mire of civil war in Tajikistan and opposed a political settlement there. He said that Russian servicemen were being dragged deep into fighting the opposition and defending the Dushanbe regime. Asked about the government-opposition talks that are scheduled to end in Tehran Monday, 27 June, he said that the two sides had failed to produce a single joint document thus far. Talks on a ceasefire are still underway while the agenda has not been discussed, he emphasized. Turajonzoda made it clear, however, that if an agreement were signed, the opposition would observe a ceasefire inside the republic as well as on the border. He thought that the official Dushanbe had also to abide by the agreement and compliance with it had to be supervised by observers from the UN and other international organizations. Meanwhile, Moscow has a different view of what is going on in Tajikistan. First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin told INTERFAX recently that he did not rule out complicity of the Tajik opposition in terrorist activities against the Russian servicemen and ethnic Russians in Tajikistan. He admitted, however, that there was no direct evidence that the acts of terror were the work of the opposition. For his part Lieutenant General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy commander of Russian border guards, told Interfax that the acts of terror against his men had been committed on direct orders from the Tajik government-in-exile. He believed that the Tajik opposition leaders intended to start a new round of hostilities and that opposition fighters were concentrating on the Afghan side of the Tajik-Afghan border for that purpose.
