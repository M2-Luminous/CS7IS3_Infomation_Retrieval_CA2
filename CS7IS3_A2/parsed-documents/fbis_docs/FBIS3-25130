COSYGA and the affiliated trade unions may embark on a strike action next week "if the government does not find solutions to the social crisis arising from the 50 percent CFA franc devaluation," the same source stated. The strike notice sent to the head of government yesterday reproached him for refusing to have dialogue with the unions and for showing no interest in negotiations on crucial and disturbing issues." Finding solutions to the crisis cannot be a monopoly of the government alone," they stressed, affirming that Gabon is a country where the rule of law prevails and as a result consultations must be the rule where actions involving the very existence of the nation are concerned." In a platform, COSYGA and the affiliated unions are demanding above all the abolition of the National Solidarity Tax, the complementary tax on salaries lower than 500,000 CFA francs. The Central Gabonese Union is also demanding 50 percent reduction in the price of revenue bands and in the rate of indemnity on the income of natural persons and a fall in customs duties for essential commodities. Their claims relate also to the reorganization of trade, the reorientation of the National Housing Fund, the restructuring of parastatal companies, and the need to find a solution to the health workers strike. It was also learned that in their strike notice, the Gabonese unionists finally expressed astonishment at the proposed establishment of a senate. In the communique issued after the cabinet meeting held on 4 February, the government had announced its decision to give parliament maximum flexibility and efficiency through the creation of a senate, they recalled. The unionists are against the establishment of a second chamber of parliament, they remarked. Last week, COSYGA sent a list of complaints to the prime minister's office containing various claims, including an 80 percent salary hike. The unionists consider that "the combined effects of the deterioration of the people's purchasing power and of the devaluation of the CFA franc authorize them to demand an increase.
