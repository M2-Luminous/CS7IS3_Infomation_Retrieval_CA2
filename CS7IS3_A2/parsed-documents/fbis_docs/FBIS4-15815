The reporters asked many questions in both the political and economic domains, and in a future issue of our paper we will carry an extended report on the meeting. The media representatives could not, of course, refrain from asking questions about the situation in the Crimea. In answering them, the Ukrainian president stated that from the very beginning he was in favor of granting the Crimean Republic most extensive economic powers (incidentally, like the Ukrainian oblasts), but not a single edict dealing with the economy has been adopted in the Crimea. He said the power structures there are engaged in political bustle, adopting decisions on various referendums, the dismissal of the head of Crimean television and radio, and moving the clocks forward. However, the Ukrainian president emphasized, the present budget of the Crimean Republic has been approved completely in accordance with Crimea's wishes. Therefore, the Crimean authorities themselves will have to be answerable for their mistakes before the people. I can move the clock even now, Kravchuk concluded. However, this will not improve the economic situation.
