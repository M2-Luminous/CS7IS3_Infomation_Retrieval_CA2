Deputy Procurator General Vladimir Kravtsev said this in an exclusive interview with an ITAR-TASS observer. In this context, he denied allegations that he had acted with undue haste with respect to the inmates at the remand center at Lefortovo prison and described such statements as "attempts of the president's entourage to shift all the blame for the implementation of the amnesty resolution, which had come into force, onto the bodies of the procuracy." Incidentally, Procurator General Aleksey Kazannik explained his decision to resign by the fact that "a prosecutor in Russia does not have the authority to suspend an act of amnesty. Neither does he have the right of legislative initiative, so he could not request the State Duma to reconsider its own resolution." According to Vladimir Kravtsov, at 1100 on 26 February "Procurator General Kazannik signed an official request to the State Duma to clarify a number of questions which were unclear to us as executors of this law. That evening we received an official response signed by two chairmen of Duma committees, Vladimir Isakov and Ilyukhin," to the effect that there was no need whatsoever "to make special additional clarifications of the procedure of the execution of the State Duma resolution on the political and the economic amnesty." Vladimir Kravtsev also described some details of the release of the inmates from the remand center at Lefortovo prison. On that day, he asserts, "the prosecutor's office, with no rush at all, acquainted all eligible inmates with the full text of the resolution and learned their opinion, as required by Article 5 Point 4 and by the note at the end of this article, whether they agree that this act of amnesty be applied to them personally." "They all agreed, though not unequivocally," Vladimir Kravtsev said. Thus, Ruslan Khasbulatov wrote that "I have not and am not pleading guilty" but, in view of the direction and the essence of the State Duma resolution, "I agree that this act of amnesty should be applied to me." Other expressed similar views. Altogether, throughout the day on 26 February the General Procurator's office sanctioned the release of 16 of those accused in organizing the tragic October events in Moscow, Kravtsev said. He also acknowledged that he had personally signed all the instructions of the prosecutor's office on the release. "I would like say on my own behalf" that now "the president's team is simply looking for someone to blame," Vladimir Kravtsev stressed. He went on to say that the resignation statement of Aleksey Kazannik, made on Saturday, is "his personal decision. He did not urge us (deputies-Eds) to join him and so on." However, "should such methods of putting pressure on the prosecutor's office, among others, continue, it is our duty and responsibility to resign," Kravtsev said. He also stated, on the instruction of his colleagues, that deputies of Procurator General Aleksey Kazannik would not resign before the Federation Council had made a decision over the dismissal of Aleskey Kazannik. They had jointly made this decision after internal consultations on 27 February. Vladimir Kravtsev did not preclude the possibility of "the Federation Council not accepting the resignation of Aleksey Kazannik" but added to this: "I am almost convinced that it will be accepted and immediately effective."
