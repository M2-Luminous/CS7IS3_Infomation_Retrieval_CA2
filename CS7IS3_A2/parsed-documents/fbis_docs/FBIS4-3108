The Changsha City party committee office complex is situated in one of the busiest sections of May 1 Road, with superior geographical position and convenient transport facilities. The complex was built in the early 1960's, accommodating all the more than 10 departments of the Changsha city party committee. In view of the fact that the city party committee office complex had limited floor space and deficient facilities, the Changsha city authorities, based on a thorough feasibility study, decided to sell the property to the Changsha city branch of the Bank of Industry and Commerce of China, at the price of 100 million yuan. In this connection, a new site will be sought to relocate city party committee offices. It is believed that this transaction will help promote the reform and opening up process and economic development of the city.
