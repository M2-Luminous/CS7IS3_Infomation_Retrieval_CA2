He said that 18 out of 21 republics incorporated in Russia were much weaker economically than nearly every region. Shakhray thought that inter-regional association such as the Siberian Accord had become a way to achieve horizontal integration of territories and regions and a new Russian regional policy. Shakhray said that an agreement between the central government and eight inter-regional associations that had been drafted more than six weeks ago could be signed very shortly.
