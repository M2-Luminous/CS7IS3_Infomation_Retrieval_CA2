FR940606-1-00065 FR940606-1-00009 40 CFR Part 372 [OPPTS&hyph;400085; FRL&hyph;4765&hyph;8] Copper Monochlorophthalocyanine Pigment; Toxic Chemical Release Reporting; Community Right-To-Know AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to grant a petition to delete Color Index (C.I.) Pigment Blue 15:1 from the ``copper compounds'' category of the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA). C.I. Pigment Blue 15:1 is a mixture of C.I. Pigment Blue 15 (copper phthalocyanine) and copper monochlorophthalocyanine. C.I. Pigment Blue 15 has already been deleted from the chemical category ``copper compounds''; therefore, the Agency is treating this petition as a request to remove copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the chemical category ``copper compounds.'' This proposed rule is based on EPA's belief that the copper ion from copper monochlorophthalocyanine will not become available. In addition, EPA requests comment on the alternative of exempting all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine from the reporting requirements under the ``copper compounds'' category in EPCRA section 313. DATES: Written comments on this proposed rule should be received by EPA on or before August 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be submitted in triplicate to: OPPT Docket Clerk, TSCA Document Receipt Office (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Comments should include the document control number for this proposal, OPPTS&hyph;400085. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Maria J. Doa, Petitions Coordinator, 202&hyph;260&hyph;9592, for specific information on this proposed rule, or for more information on EPCRA section 313, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Hotline, Environmental Protection Agency, Mail Code 5101, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Toll free: 1&hyph;800&hyph;535&hyph;0202, in Virginia and Alaska: 703&hyph;412&hyph;9877 or Toll free TDD: 1&hyph;800&hyph;553&hyph;7672. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction A. Statutory Authority This proposed rule is issued under section 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499). B. Background Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such facilities must also report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13106). When enacted, section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e)(1), any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added and deleted chemicals from the original statutory list. EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the Federal Register of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for petitions. On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued a statement of policy and guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to delete individual members of the section 313 metal compound categories. Pursuant to EPCRA section 313(e)(1), EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation of why the petition has been denied. II. Description of Petition On March 5, 1993, the Agency received a petition from the Color Pigments Manufacturers Association (CPMA) to delete Color Index (C.I.) Pigment Blue 15:1 from the chemical category ``copper compounds'' subject to EPCRA reporting requirements. C.I. Pigment Blue 15:1 is a mixture of C.I. Pigment Blue 15 (copper phthalocyanine) and copper monochlorophthalocyanine. C.I. Pigment Blue 15 has already been deleted from the chemical category ``copper compounds'' (56 FR 23650); therefore, the Agency is treating this petition as a request to remove copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the chemical category ``copper compounds.'' The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment, which is the subject of this petition, exists as two isomers. One isomer is substituted with a single chlorine atom at the 1-position. The second isomer is substituted with a single chlorine atom at the 2-position. The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment is described by three CAS numbers. CAS number 15975&hyph;60&hyph;7 describes the copper 1-chlorophthalocyanine pigment. CAS number 147&hyph;13&hyph;7 describes the copper 2-chlorophthalocyanine pigment. CAS number 12239&hyph;87&hyph;1 describes the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment with the position of a single chlorine atom unspecified. EPA is proposing to delete both isomers and hence all three CAS numbers from the copper compounds category. In the statement of policy and guidance on the metal compound categories of section 313 of EPCRA (56 FR 23703, May 23, 1991), EPA articulated the view that the toxicity of a metal-containing compound that dissociates or reacts to generate the metal ion can be expressed as a function of the toxicity induced by the intact species and the availability of the metal ion. Therefore, the degree of dissociation, bioaccumulation, and the level at which toxicity is induced by the metal ion will be considered in making any delisting decision under EPCRA section 313. Thus, for petitions to exempt individual metal-containing compounds from the reporting requirements under EPCRA section 313, EPA has decided to base its decisions on the evaluation of all chemical and biological processes that may lead to metal ion availability as well as on the toxicity of the intact species. These decisions will continue to be based on information provided by the petitioner, Agency documents, and available literature. EPCRA section 313(d)(3) requires EPA to determine that none of the criteria in EPCRA section 313(d)(2) are met before a chemical may be deleted from the EPCRA section 313 list. Under the policy for metal compound categories, this means that the effects induced by both a metal ion and the intact species described by the metal compound category must be considered in light of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria. The effects induced by each metal ion described by the metal compound categories meet the criteria under EPCRA section 313(d)(2). To delete a metal compound from the EPCRA section 313 list, EPA must conclude that the metal ion will not become available at a level that can be expected to induce toxicity of a type described in EPCRA section 313(d)(2), and that the intact species does not meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2). Accordingly, EPA will generally deny petitions to delete chemicals if: (1) The intact species meets the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria, (2) the chemical will dissociate or react to generate the metal ion at levels which can reasonably be anticipated to cause adverse effects as described in EPCRA section 313(d)(2), or (3) EPA does not possess and the petitioners failed to provide information to properly characterize the metal ion availability. III. Technical Review The Agency has previously addressed the transformation processes that may generate copper ion from copper phthalocyanine compounds in its review of a petition to delete three copper phthalocyanine pigments (Pigment Blue 15, copper phthalocyanine; Pigment Green 7, copper poly(14)chlorophthalocyanine; and Pigment Green 36, copper hexabromodecachlorophthalocyanine) from EPCRA section 313 reporting requirements. These three copper phthalocyanine pigments were deleted from EPCRA section 313 on May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23650), because copper ion could not reasonably be expected to become available from these pigments and because there was no indication from the available data that the intact pigments could reasonably be anticipated to cause acute, chronic, or environmental toxicity. No data on the specific copper monochlorophthalocyanine compounds which are the subject of this petition were found. However, in its analysis of the three previously deleted compounds, the Agency used data on both brominated/chlorinated copper phthalocyanine and copper phthalocyanine. This information was selected because Pigment Blue 15, Pigment Green 7, and Pigment Green 36 ranged in degree of bromination/chlorination from zero (Pigment Blue 15) to 100 percent (Pigment Green 36). The transformation potential of many organic compounds is dependent, in part, on the number of bromine or chlorine atoms present in the molecule. Although there are exceptions, generally, the more highly brominated or chlorinated an organic compound is, the less likely it is to undergo biotic or abiotic transformations. Once the transformation potential for copper phthalocyanine pigments at the extremes of the range of possible bromination/chlorination had been assessed, the transformation potential for those copper phthalocyanine pigments with bromination/chlorination greater than zero and less than 100 percent, including copper monochlorophthalocyanine, could be inferred. The transformation processes reviewed included, hydrolysis, photolysis, abiotic and biotic aerobic degradation, abiotic and biotic anaerobic degradation, bioavailability of the ion when the compounds are ingested or inhaled, and bioaccumulation. The following discussion summarizes the information reviewed. 1. Copper ion (Refs. 2 and 7). Copper is recognized as an essential element. It is essential to a number of normal physiological processes including erythropoiesis, connective tissue metabolism, bone development, and nervous system function. The National Academy of Sciences' recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is 2.0 to 3.0 milligrams (mg) copper/day. Copper is also used as a hematinic (to stimulate red blood cell production) in adults at a dose of 3.8 to 7.6 mg/day. a. Human health effects . Copper poisoning has been demonstrated in animals and identified in humans. The liver is the main storage depot for copper, and hepatic damage is associated with the accumulation of high levels of copper. Hepatic toxicity is characterized by hepatocellular necrosis, regenerative activity, and cirrhosis. Kidney necrosis and elevated levels of serum copper occur only after the liver begins to accumulate high levels of copper. These elevated serum copper levels can progress to sudden hemolytic anemia and jaundice. The types of neurological effects associated with copper poisoning can include demyelination and cerebral degeneration. These effects are thought to be related to defects in catecholamine metabolism. Alterations in brain neurotransmitter systems have been observed in rats following intraperitoneal injections of 2 milligrams/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) for 21 days. There are two groups that are at a particularly increased risk from copper exposure. These include individuals with Wilson's disease, which is an inborn error in copper metabolism. The metabolic error in Wilson's disease allows copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea, causing hemolytic anemia, neurological abnormalities, and corneal opacity. In addition, individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies may also be at greater risk of experiencing toxic effects from copper exposure. Copper is classified in EPA's Group D (insufficient data) for carcinogenic potential. Copper is generally negative in mutagenicity bioassays. Oral bioassays using copper were negative; subcutaneous injection of copper compounds has been reported to induce tumor formation in one sex and strain of mice. The maximum contaminant level (MCL) established for copper under the Safe Drinking Water Act is 1.3 milligrams/liter (mg/L) (3.6 mg/day). b. Ecological effects . Copper is very toxic to aquatic life. It is sometimes used as a biocide to control undesirable aquatic plants. EPA has issued Water Quality Criteria for copper to protect aquatic life. The acute criterion in fresh water at a hardness of 50 mg/L is 9.2 micrograms/liter (ug/L). The chronic criterion in fresh water is 6.5 ug/L at a hardness of 50 mg/L. In salt water at a hardness of 50 mg/L, the acute criterion is 2.9 ug/L. At a hardness of 100 mg/L, the freshwater acute criterion is 18 ug/L, the freshwater chronic criterion is 12 ug/L, and the salt water acute criterion is 2.9 ug/L. 2. Availability of copper ion . The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments are expected to be extremely stable to chemically and biologically induced transformations. a. Thermal stability . Based on their structural analogy to other copper phthalocyanine pigments, copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments are expected to be extremely stable thermally. Copper phthalocyanine pigments only begin to show signs of decomposition at temperatures above 500 ○C (Ref. 6). b. Hydrolysis . Copper phthalocyanine pigments have very low solubilities in water and are not expected to dissociate or hydrolyze in water under environmental conditions. Hydrolysis of copper phthalocyanine pigments does not occur in basic and nonoxidizing acidic media (Ref. 3). By structural analogy to copper phthalocyanine pigments for which data are available, hydrolysis of the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments is not expected to be a significant environmental transformation process. c. Photolysis . Based on studies carried out to determine the light fastness of structurally similar copper phthalocyanine pigments, it appears that photolysis of copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments with resultant release of copper ion will not occur (Ref. 4). d. Abiotic oxidation . Data indicate that under ambient environmental conditions, abiotic oxidation of copper phthalocyanine pigments does not occur. More rigorous conditions are required to effect the oxidation of copper phthalocyanine pigments and subsequent release of copper ion. These pigments can be chemically oxidized to yield phthalimides and copper nitrate by boiling in dilute nitric acid (Ref. 3). Oxidation of the pigments can also occur by treatment with ceric sulfate in dilute sulfuric acid at 25 ○C, or by reaction with potassium permanganate (Ref. 1). Because rigorous conditions are required to oxidize copper phthalocyanine pigments, abiotic oxidation of copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments under ambient environmental conditions is not likely to occur. e. Microbial transformations . No data on the anaerobic or aerobic biodegradability of the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments were found. However, based on their extremely low solubility in water, their large cross-sectional diameter, and, with the exception of the chlorine, the lack of substituent groups associated with facile primary degradation, copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments are expected to be very resistant to degradation processes (Ref. 5). f. Bioavailability . On the basis of molecular weight, extremely low solubility in water, and data from subchronic toxicity tests on other copper phthalocyanine pigments (Ref. 7), copper monochlorophthalocyanine is not expected to be appreciably absorbed by any route of exposure or metabolized to yield copper ion. g. Bioaccumulation . Because copper ion does not appear to be available from the copper phthalocyanine pigments, bioaccumulation of copper ion is not a concern for copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments. h. Summary. By virtue of their structural analogy to other copper phthalocyanine pigments, EPA believes that the availability of copper ion from the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments by hydrolysis, photolysis, and aerobic and anaerobic transformations is negligible. Copper ion is not expected to be bioavailable from the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments. The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments are not expected to be appreciably absorbed by any route of exposure or metabolized to yield the copper ion. 3. Manufacturing, use, and release . Phthalocyanine blue pigments, such as copper monochlorophthalocyanine, are generally manufactured using one of two methods. Copper monochlorophthalocyanine is manufactured by a phthalonitrile baking process or a solvent process. The phthalonitrile baking process yields a range of 70 to 85 percent of product. The solvent process is more popular and yields a purer form with a yield of 85 to 95 percent of product. Following the synthesis the crude product is isolated. Finishing of the crude pigment can involve any of a number of processes such as dissolution in acid followed by controlled precipitation, intensive milling with urea and sulfuric acid, milling with sodium chloride, or milling with sodium chloride and solvent. Copper monochlorophthlocyanine is often used in combination with other colorants. The primary uses of copper monochlorophthalocyanine mixtures are as colorants for coatings, paints, printing inks, and plastics. The EPCRA section 313 reported releases of copper from three facilities which were identified as manufacturers of copper monochlorophthalocyanine were 2,354 pounds in 1990 and 491 pounds for 1991. Facilities that process or use copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment could not be identified and therefore releases from these facilities could not be estimated. IV. Explanation for Proposed Action To Delete Copper Monochlorophthalocyanine EPA is granting the petition and proposing to delete copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the copper compounds category of the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. As stated in Unit II. of this preamble, petitions for delisting a member of a metal compound category will be denied unless EPA can conclude that the intact species does not meet the criteria of section 313(d)(2) and the metal ion will not be available at a level that can reasonably be anticipated to induce toxicity. This decision to propose to delist copper monochlorophthalocyanine is based on EPA's belief that: (1) The intact species does not meet the EPCRA section 313(d) criteria and (2) the copper ion from copper monochlorophthalocyanine will not become available. After reviewing the petition and available information, EPA has concluded that copper monochlorophthalocyanine is not known to cause or cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause acute or chronic toxicity in humans or adverse effects in the environment, and thus does not meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2). V. Request for Public Comment EPA requests public comment on this proposed rule to delete copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the category ``copper compounds'' on the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. In addition, EPA requests comment on the alternative of exempting all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine from the reporting requirements under the ``copper compounds'' category on the EPCRA section 313 list. As stated in Unit III. of this preamble, EPA has previously reviewed brominated/chlorinated copper phthalocyanine compounds as well as the parent compound, copper phthalocyanine, and believes that its conclusions regarding the availability of soluble copper from these compounds apply to all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine. Comments should be submitted to the address listed under the ADDRESSES unit. All comments must be received by EPA on or before August 5, 1994. VI. Rulemaking Record The record supporting this proposed rule is contained in docket number OPPTS&hyph;400085. All documents, including an index of the docket, are available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), also known as, TSCA Public Docket Office from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays.

Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Section 3(f) of the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant'' and therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct a small business analysis to determine whether a substantial number of small entities would be significantly affected by the proposed rule. Because the proposed rule eliminates an existing requirement, it would result in cost savings to facilities, including small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not have any information collection requirements subject to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .
