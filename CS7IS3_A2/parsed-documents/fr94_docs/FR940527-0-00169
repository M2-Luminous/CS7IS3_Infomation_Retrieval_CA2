FR940527-0-00169 FR940527-0-00029 This rulemaking deletes section 30 CFR 779.25(a)(11) (Cross sections, maps, and plans) requiring slope measurements. OSM recognizes that premining slope measurements are needed to ensure that restored contours meet approximate original contour (AOC) conditions. The former rule was, however, redundant as it provided no additional information beyond that already available to the regulatory authority under 30 CFR 777.14(a) and OSM's technical information processing system (TIPS). In the 1979 preamble to §779.25, OSM acknowledged that the required slope measurements could be derived from existing topographic maps or from measurements taken in the field (44 FR 15045, March 13, 1979). Since that time, OSM has found that most permit applicants derive the required measurements from a topographic map rather than from field measurements. Section 777.14(a) requires a permit applicant to submit a topographic map of the permit area which includes U.S. Geological Survey topographic features. Therefore, it makes no difference whether the applicant measures the slope from a topographic map, in fulfillment of the requirements under §779.25(a)(11), or the regulatory authority measures the slope from the same or similar topographic map submitted under §777.14(a) so long as the regulatory authority has adequate information on the slope of the proposed permit area to assure that approximate original contour will be achieved. Subsequent to the 1979 promulgation and issuance of §779.25(a)(11), OSM has also made available to regulatory authorities the TIPS software and data analysis capabilities which allows both premining slopes and cross sections to be computed. Several commenters agreed with the proposal to delete §779.25(a)(11) as they felt that the information is already available to the regulatory authority independent of any submission by the applicant. One commenter opposed the proposal on the basis that it is the operator's responsibility to supply the baseline slope measurement data. However, as discussed above, the operator is already required by §777.14(a) to supply the appropriate topographic maps of the permit area which represent the baseline information for slope measurement calculations. All regulatory authorities also have access to TIPS systems and have the capability to calculate premining slopes and cross sections from the topographic maps provided. This same commenter alleged that the operator may not be able to demonstrate AOC if the regulatory authority is the only party with the slope data. OSM does not agree. Irrespective of the deletion of §779.25(a)(11), the permit applicant must demonstrate in the plan, under the requirement of §816.102, the ability to meet the performance standards for AOC. Thus, the deletion of this section does not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to demonstrate how AOC is achieved in the reclamation plan. IV. Procedural Matters Federal Paperwork Reduction Act The collections of information contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance numbers 1029&hyph;0035 and 1029&hyph;0038. Executive Order 12866 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department of Interior has determined, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ., that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule consolidates requirements for premining and postmining land use and thereby eliminates redundancies in the regulations with a resulting reduction in the reporting burden on the public. This should result in a cost savings to the public. National Environmental Policy Act OSM has prepared an environmental assessment (EA), and has made a finding that this rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). The EA and finding of no significant impact are on file in the OSM Administrative Record, room 660, 800 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC. Executive Order 12778 on Civil Justice Reform This rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the preamble discussion of this rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order: A. What is the preemptive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? To the extent that the rule would relieve, rather than impose, regulatory requirements, the rule would have no preemptive effect. B. What is the effect on existing Federal law or regulation, if any, including all provisions repealed or modified? This rule modifies the implementation of SMCRA as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions that are affected by this rule. C. Does the rule provide a clear and certain legal standard for affected conduct rather than a general standard, while promoting simplification and burden reduction? The standards established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of the topics covered and the mandates of SMCRA. D. What is the retroactive effect, if any, to be given to the regulation? This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. E. Are administrative proceedings required before parties may file suit in court? Which proceedings apply? Is the exhaustion of administrative remedies required? No administrative proceedings are required before parties may file suit in court challenging the provisions of this rule under section 526(a) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1276(a).
