As a result of one of the recent raids, they were able to prevent more than 20 poaching attempts in Russian waters. The borderguards confiscated hundreds of meters of small-mesh fishing nets and found many wooden and pneumatic boats, hidden on uninhabited Russian islands. Their crews had to be "fished out" of riverside brush. All the violators were deported from Russian territory. ITAR-TASS was told at the headquarters of the Biribidjan borderguard detachment that such actions by borderguards and inspection teams would be carried out regularly this season. It was decided to put an end to the massive violations of the Russian border by Chinese poachers. The results of the first raid have shown that the situation can be kept under control.
