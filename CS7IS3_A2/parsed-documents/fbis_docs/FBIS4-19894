Asked how he evaluated the U.S. President Bill Clinton's words saying there will be important developments within two days on Cyprus issue, Demirel said he did not know Clinton's statement in detail but "I met TRNC's parliament speaker Halit Acarkan and learned that they were discussing the issue of confidence-building measures [CBM's]." Acarkan earlier said the UN proposed CBM's for Cyprus have been twisted to the advantage of the Greek Cypriot side. He said his state was under great pressure to accept the modified version of the CBM's. The points included to the original package of July 1, 1993 are, giving the roads leading to the uninhabited Maras [Varosha] section to the UN control; limitations to be imposed on all planes registered in Turkey in the Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport which will be opened to international traffic; customs procedures to be conducted by an official to be appointed by the United Nations to Lefkose Airport and Maras; and the violation of the principle that both sides will enjoy equal advantages. Demirel said everyone should accept the two separate communities and that these two are the extensions of two different nations, should have everything separated, and it is not possible to reach a solution by being forced to live together. The president said he will visit Egypt in May and he may also visit Bosnia-Herzegovina to contribute to the peace efforts there. Demirel also said he will meet political party leaders on May 4 and discuss the problems of Turkey.
