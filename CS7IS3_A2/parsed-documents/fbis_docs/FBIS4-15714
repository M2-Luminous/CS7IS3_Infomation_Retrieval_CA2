This is said in a statement, released in Tallinn by the President Lennart Meri's Chancellory, and signed by him as well as by the Premier Mart Laar and the State Assembly's Chairman Yulo Nugis. Moscow declared at the last round of bilateral talks that it would keep the date for the pullout of troops from Estonia blank until Tallinn ensured residence and other social guarantees for the retired Russian army officers and other ethnic Russians in Estonia. Nonetheless, as the statement says, Estonia "is ready to continue negotiations in good faith to surmount all difficulties." "At the same time, Estonia regards the Russian president's instruction of April 5 on the creation of military bases in CIS and Latvia as going back on earlier pledges, international accords and principles," says the statement. Estonia's representatives abroad "have been instructed to remind Russia at every opportunity of its international pledge to move its troops out of Estonia and Latvia by August 31 quickly and orderly, as has been repeatedly stressed in international accords," the document notes.
