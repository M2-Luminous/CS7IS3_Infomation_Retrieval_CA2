FR941121-0-00035 FR941121-0-00001 i. Credit unions may use a code to identify a particular fee if the code is explained on the periodic statement or in documents accompanying the statement. ii. Credit unions using debit slips may disclose the date the fee was debited on the periodic statement and show the amount and type of fee on the dated debit slip. 4. Relation to Regulation E. Disclosure of fees in compliance with Regulation E complies with this section for fees related to electronic fund transfers (for example, totaling all electronic funds transfer fees in a single figure). (b)(4) Length of Period 1. General. Credit unions providing the beginning and ending dates of the period must make clear whether both dates are included in the period. For example, stating ``April 1 through April 30'' would clearly indicate that both April 1 and April 30 are included in the period. 2. Opening or closing an account mid-cycle. If an account is opened or closed during the period for which a statement is sent, credit unions must calculate the annual percentage yield earned based on account balances for each day the account was open. Section 707.7_Payment of Dividends (a) Permissible Methods 1. Prohibited calculation methods. Calculation methods that do not comply with the requirement to pay dividends on the full amount of principal in the account each day include: i. The ``rollback'' method, also known as the ``grace period'' or ``in by the 10th'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for the period. ii. The ``increments of par value'' method, where credit unions only pay dividends on full shares in an account, e.g., a credit union with $5 par value shares pays dividends on $20 of a $24 account balance. iii. The ``ending balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the balance in the account at the end of the period. iv. The ``investable balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on a percentage of the balance, excluding an amount credit unions set aside for reserve requirements. v. The ``low balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for any day in that period. 2. Use of 365-day basis. Credit unions may apply a daily periodic rate that is greater than 1/365 of the dividend rate_such as 1/360 of the dividend rate_as long as it is applied 365 days a year. 3. Periodic dividend payments. A credit union can pay dividends each day on the account and still make uniform dividend payments. For example, for a one-year term share account, a credit union could make monthly dividend payments that are equal to 1/12 of the amount of dividends that will be earned for a 365-day period (or 11 uniform monthly payments_each equal to roughly 1/12 of the total amount of dividends_and one payment that accounts to the remainder of the total amount of dividends earned for the period). 4. Leap year. Credit unions may apply a daily rate of 1/366 or 1/365 of the dividend rate for 366 days in a leap year, if the account will earn dividends for February 29. 5. Maturity of term share accounts. Credit unions are not required to pay dividends after term share accounts mature. Examples include: i. During any grace period offered by a credit union for an automatically renewable term share account, if the member decides during that period not to renew the account. ii. Following the maturity of nonrollover term share accounts. iii. When the maturity date falls on a holiday, and the member must wait until the next business day to obtain the funds.
