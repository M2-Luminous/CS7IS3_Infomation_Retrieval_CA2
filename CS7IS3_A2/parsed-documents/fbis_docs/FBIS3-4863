Hosokawa expressed his intention to reporters following a series of separate meetings with coalition party leaders to seek agreement on his plan to shake up the cabinet. However, an increasing number of the coalition parties believe that Hosokawa may have to give up the plan because of a tight Diet business schedule and strong opposition from the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), coalition members said. During a series of separate talks, the prime minister said he wants to tackle economic reform issues, including trade friction between the U.S. and Japan and deregulation, with a second Hosokawa Cabinet, political sources said. But the SDP, the DSP and Sakigake, which is headed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, are opposed to an early cabinet reshuffle, while Shinseito and Komeito are endorsing the premier's plan. The primary purpose of the cabinet reorganization is widely believed to be the replacement of Takemura, top government spokesman and chief of staff, who has been at odds with Hosokawa over several of the government's important policy themes. Takemura told Hosokawa in a meeting that a cabinet reshuffle could lead to the collapse of the coalition government, the sources said. Takemura maintains he will not take another cabinet post if Hosokawa changes his cabinet, they said. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama asked Hosokawa to drop his intention for an early shake-up, stressing the need for the cabinet to be united to tackle economic issues, they said. Murayama and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi told Hosokawa that they oppose the replacement of Takemura, warning such action will damage the coalition foundation, the sources said. Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata, meanwhile, told Hosokawa that the party will support the scheme to reshape the cabinet. Hata, who serves as foreign minister and deputy prime minister, said he notified Hosokawa of his backing in a meeting at the premier's official residence, they said. A top government official, who did not want to be identified, said Hosokawa still plans to reshuffle the cabinet Wednesday. He said Hosokawa is ready to accept some negative impact following the planned cabinet reshuffle.
