He believes that after President Clinton's visit European countries -- Germany, Britain, France -- will have a more sympathetic attitude to the problem of global security. Belarus, Tsepkalo said, was the only one among the former Soviet republics to sign with the United States a package of agreements concerning such issues, as the conversion of defence plants, the forming of an exports control system, and recultivation of territories where strategic and chemical warfare troops were deployed. "Each of these agreements requires substantial currency infusions from the United States, and they have already begun to arrive," he said. Several important agreements, particularly on lifting trade barriers and on giving Belarus technical aid in building free-market infrastructure and promoting privatization, are expected to be signed in Minsk, said INTERFAX's interviewee. However, even when these documents are signed, Belarus can hardly hope to get a vigorous flow of American investment, Tsepkalo noted. "What Belarus is likely to get is a tangible incentive for creating a more favorable climate for investment," he said.
