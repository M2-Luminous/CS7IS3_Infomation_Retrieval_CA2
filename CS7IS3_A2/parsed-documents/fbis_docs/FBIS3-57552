[Kardava] The keys to the resolution of problems in western Georgia, in particular in Mingrelia, lie in Tbilisi. All events that are taking place and being provoked in Mingrelia are being directed from the capital Tbilisi. Various politicians have always used Mingrelia and the problem of Zviadism as a card in their dirty game. Now, prominent people from the Cabinet of Ministers headed by the prime minister are standing behind those people who are preparing a coup directed against the rational policy being implemented by the current leadership of the rayon. Wasn't he [Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia] Zugdidi Gamgebeli [head of the local governing body] when, last winter, a relatively small group of Zviadists miraculously seized a large amount of military equipment that was being dispatched for the purposes of military combat in Abkhazia? In this case, it is not important whether Tengiz Kitovani, the defense minister at the time, knew about this or not. What has been done cannot be undone. Today, in Zugdidi, former Zviadists, having united into a group and having received the status of military police, present a danger. After all, these are the same people who, in their time, having been in a position to help Sukhumi, did not cross the Kodorskiy range. I am in possession of precise information according to which they are being backed by important political figures. I spoke about this at a closed session of the NDP congress and at the conference of the Mingrelian branch of the NDP. I am certain that this is clear sabotage against the head of state, and people are taking part in this whom one would not accuse at first sight. However, the culprits will, nevertheless, be made to answer. Their hidden game is becoming too obvious.
