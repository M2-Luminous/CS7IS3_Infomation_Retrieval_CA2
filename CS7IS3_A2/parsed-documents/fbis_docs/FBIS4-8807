A big part of it concerns economic issues. What are the specific steps the government is to take in this sphere in the near future? What problems do you perceive as priorities? Is it at all possible to tackle Slovakia's current very complicated economic situation without breaking a very fragile social peace? [Moravcik] Our cabinet has already taken certain steps. It is very important that all the measures taken by the cabinet are taken in the interest of strengthening fiscal discipline and stabilizing our budget. [passage omitted] Other steps are aimed at those abroad; we hold talks with our foreign partners to create better conditions for foreign investors to come here. The other sphere where we want to make the cabinet's activities more dynamic is the sphere of privatization. [passage omitted] Another aspect concerns social peace -- we hold very intensive talks with our partners on a new general agreement. I can say that our partners have shown a very positive, constructive attitude. I am convinced that we will succeed in securing and preserving social peace. [Reznic] The Matica Slovenska leadership held a session in Cadca and adopted a statement calling on political entities represented in the government of the Slovak Republic to explain the participation in the coalition talks of ethnic Hungarian parties and movements -- despite the fact that they are not represented in the coalition government. What is your view on this problem? [Moravcik] I have had an opportunity to discuss this problem with the Matica Slovenska officials. It is included in our coalition agreement -- Hungarian political parties support the government's policy statement and they have expressed their support by their vote, too. [passage omitted] There is nothing else, no other document the content of which would be different from the government's policy statement. According to our coalition agreement, the representatives of the ethnic Hungarian political parties are being invited to our talks -- that is, they have an opportunity to express their view. I think that, given the fact that they support the government's policy statement, there is justification to inviting them to participate in talks. [passage omitted] [Reznic] Another fundamental sphere is the sphere of foreign relations. [passage omitted] [Moravcik] One of the conditions for our integration into the European Union, and possibly into other political and security systems in the Euro-Atlantic sphere, is stability in Central Europe. We must secure stability in Central Europe and we have certain outstanding issues in this sphere, above all as regards our relations with the Hungarian Republic. The problem is similarly perceived in Hungary, and thus we would like to use this period to progress a little with the tackling of this problem. [passage omitted]
