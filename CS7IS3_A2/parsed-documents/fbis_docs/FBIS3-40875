They complained about the application of minimum wage standards and about the payment of vacation and overtime pay, which have not complied with regulations. According to I Made Surata, a representative of the workers, who was received by the East Kalimantan DPRD, they were forced to come to Samarinda after their efforts to solve the problem at the district level were not successful. As former employees of PBI Inc., they met with the company and the Department of Manpower as well as with the SPSI [All-Indonesia Workers Association] in Bontang on 30 November; however, as of the third week of December they had not arrived at any solution. The construction and engineering workers who worked on Badak Inc.'s Train F of the liquid natural gas plant in Bontang arrived in Samarinda (120 km away) in 13 buses. H. Syarifuddin Gairach, deputy chairman of the East Kalimantan DPRD I, and leaders of the parliamentary factions met with seven representatives of the workers. Made Surata said that according to the minimum wage standards set by the government the workers should receive 108,000 rupiahs per month. In fact, 750 workers at PBI Inc. Bontang were being paid only between 65,000 and 103,000 rupiahs per month. Besides that, according to the work agreement which they and the company had signed, they were required to work seven hours a day. But in fact they were made to work for eight hours without being paid overtime. The workers also brought up some rights which the company had violated, including making them work on Sunday and not contributing to their health and annual leave funds. Flare-Ups President Suharto is due to dedicate official operations of the Bontang Train F liquid natural gas plant about the beginning of February. Representatives of the former workers who went to see the East Kalimantan DPRD I leaders asked them to intervene and find a solution to their problems. If not, they intend to bring the problems up when the plant is dedicated. Syarifuddin Gairach, deputy chairman of the East Kalimantan DPRD I, said that they would listen to the problems presented by the workers and convey them to the agencies concerned. Furthermore, the DPRD would look into the efforts to resolve the violations of workers' rights. The East Kalimantan provincial office of the Department of Labor hopes that the workers will be patient until a meeting planned for Thursday (23 December) is held. In Samarinda itself there are frequent labor flare-ups because there are many companies which are thought to be violating workers' rights. A demonstration demanding payment of wages was held by 1,600 workers of HJP (Hartaty Jaya Plywood) Inc., which is located in the Loabakung industrial area, Samarinda Ulu. They made this demand because the company had not paid them for three months. Even the governor of East Kalimantan got involved in this problem because while HJP Inc. has been facing a financial crisis in Samarinda, Hartono T. Sentoso, the managing director, has been in Los Angeles since the beginning of the year. The company was finally able to pay the 1,600 workers their wages on 1 December after the BDN [Bank Dagang Negara] injected some funds into the company. No SPSI Unit Yet After the HJP case was settled, another wage demand was made by about 370 workers from JPP (Jati Prima Pratama) Inc. in Loajanan and Nikita Inc. in Palaran, both involved in the wood industry. The workers complained to the East Kalimantan DPRD I on 15 December. Workers from the two companies, which are in the same group, demanded the wages which had not been paid for three months. Workers from the two companies said that management always promises to pay what they owe them whenever they demand it. The most recent promise was for 15 December. When the promise was not kept, they were forced to complain to the East Kalimantan DPRD I in Loabahu. Leaders of the East Kalimantan DPRD I asked the workers to be patient while the agencies concerned were asked to contact the companies in order solve the problem right away. According to the explanation given to KOMPAS, the two companies are in fact having financial problems. Nanang Ismail, chairman of the Samarinda SPSI, said that it was hard to look into the problems faced by workers from those two companies because no SPSI unit existed there yet.
