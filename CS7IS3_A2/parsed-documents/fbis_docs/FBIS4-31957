We spoke with Dr. Vlado Pandzic, the chairman of the caucus of Croat deputies, right before he left Sarajevo, where he had participated in the session of the Constitutional Assembly of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and then in the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly that followed as a continuation. The reason for our interview was in fact these two meetings, and Dr. Pandzic had this to say in evaluating the results achieved: [Pandzic] Everything that was anticipated was also done, so that I can say that a big step was taken in realizing the Federation Constitution. The federation got a president and vice president, and certain decisions, drafts, and proposals for laws were adopted, which are a precondition for carrying out the further work of setting up the federation. [Sabic] Were there any changes in mutual relations between the first and second sessions of the Constitutional Assembly, was there any discernible change in the prevailing atmosphere in the Assembly meeting rooms? [Pandzic] One could say that the atmosphere was better at the second session, that work proceeded somewhat faster.... As with any beginning, at the first session there was a certain amount of disorientation, but nevertheless we overcame that successfully. It is important that at both the first and the second session a high level of preparedness on the part of the deputies was discernible, there were no "derailments" from the agenda, the deputies demonstrated the will to achieve what had been planned, while at the second session one could discern a little more certainty that everything on the agenda would be completed at that session. Perhaps it can be said that some individuals stood out in terms of their disorientation, but that does not essentially alter the overall impression. [Sabic] No less than two months passed between the enactment of the federation and the election of the federation's leaders, but the Constitution states that they be chosen as soon as the Constitution is adopted. Do you think that the next steps will not fall that far behind schedule? [Pandzic] I call those two months lost time, which does not mean that that should be understand literally, because during that time some doubts and disagreements were resolved, everything that had generated a certain level of tension. Perhaps we could have taken several more steps during those two months, but I think that we will pick up the pace a little. This is reflected by the fact that in two weeks there will be another session where the government will be elected. [Sabic] The last session of the Constitutional Assembly was interrupted by unexpected breaks, the session began late.... It is surmised that there were disagreements that had to be ironed out behind closed doors. [Pandzic] A certain number of deputies arrived in Sarajevo late, and because of that the session was late in starting, so that on the first day of the session only a small part of the planned business was covered. The next day, in fact after meetings between the chairmen of the caucuses and the Assembly presidency, full agreement was reached. And right before the election of the federation president and vice president, there was a brief interruption in the session. The chairman of the Assembly wanted to fully clarify the issue so that unnecessary questions would not be raised later on, and for that purpose he organized a short meeting. It must be kept in mind that the Assembly is meeting in Sarajevo, a city that is completely encircled, in a hall that cannot be called adequate, while the Serb forces are positioned all of several hundred meters away. [Sabic] It can often be heard in Sarajevo that there are plenty of Croat deputies who are opposed to the implementation of the Federation Constitution. Is that perhaps one of the reasons for the delays in the session? [Pandzic] It cannot be said that there are no differences in views of the federation agreement. However, that is not discernible in the Assembly itself. The differences are more evident at meetings of the caucus of Croat deputies, there one might get certain impressions that could not exactly be called the best, but that must not be the real conclusion. The most essential thing is that all Croat deputies raised their hands for the Federation Constitution. [Sabic] Both from the Assembly podium and on other occasions, you often emphasize the unanimity of the Croat deputies in expressing their views on any issue. Why do you think that such unanimity is essential? [Pandzic] It would be enough to determine that there is a majority. Still, I think that it is not unimportant to mention that there is unanimity, because that, among other things, refutes the allegations of a supposed division among the Croat deputies. Through unanimity, we demonstrate our political will to work on making the federation a reality. [Sabic] For deputies who live outside Sarajevo, the fact that they receive meeting materials immediately before the session begins is a big problem. Will there be changes in that in the future? [Pandzic] That is indeed a rather big problem that also made the deputies' work more difficult. Very few people managed to read through everything that they were supposed to. I must say that this time these materials were very well prepared, very precise, that they did not raise issues that slow down the work, and some of them, the Federation Constitution for example, we received printed in both the Croatian and the Bosniak language. It was agreed that in the future materials will be provided in a timely fashion, so that this problem too will be removed from the agenda.
