FBIS4-27551 "dreas106_a_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Nuclear Waste Plant Project With Russia Noted Nuclear Waste Plant Project With Russia Noted OW0206113994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1113 GMT 2 Jun 94 OW0206113994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan and Russia will soon announce plans to build a disposal plant for liquid nuclear waste near Vladivostok in the Russian Far East, Foreign Ministry sources said Thursday [2 June]. The plant, to be funded from a Japanese 70 million dollar grant for denuclearization, is expected to be completed within this year, the sources said. The Japanese Government has agreed in principle to construct the facility, which would filter radioactive substances from the liquid waste, on an offshore dock as requested by Moscow. For lack of storage and treatment facilities the former Soviet Union and Russia have been dumping hundreds of tons of nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan and other waters off its coasts. The disclosure of the decades-long nuclear dumping has sparked international protests and strained relations between Tokyo and Moscow. Japan last autumn offered to lend Russia a tanker to provide urgently needed storage capacity, but Moscow later retreated from the plan and proposed to build the waste disposal plant instead. Moscow repeatedly told Japan it would have to resume nuclear dumping at sea if the plant was not built quickly. The sources said final approval for the project might still be held up by apparent differences between Moscow and Vladivostok authorities about the nature of the plant.
