Jaffer Sharief, against the backdrop of a shortfall in receipts from freight and passenger traffic and the consequent reduction in internally generated resources. The need to revise downward the target for originating freight traffic and the deceleration in growth in passenger traffic are due to the slow rise in industrial production and resistance from passengers to rising fares. From the first time in recent years the budget estimates of gross traffic receipts have not been realised and it has been necessary to reduce the Plan outlay in 1993-94 by Rs. 300 [rupees] crores even with the success in raising larger resources through tax-free bonds. Since the law of diminishing returns would seem to be operating with successive increases in freight rates and passenger fares and the gross domestic product has not been rising as expected, Mr. Jaffer Sharief had to take note of the warning signals and adopt a cautious approach when finalising proposals for upward adjustments in freight rates and passenger fares. Even otherwise it was generally expected that there would have to be increases under these heads as diesel oil has become costlier and other inputs have become dearer for various reasons. In spite of the escalation in cost, it is claimed that economies in working expenses to the extent of Rs.200 crores have been achieved and with reduction in appropriation to depreciation fund and other adjustments, the revised estimates disclose a surplus of 973 crores against Rs. 2,195 crores (budget). The target for originating freight traffic however has been raised for 1994-95 though the growth in passenger traffic has been estimated at only two per cent. [Passage illegible] the increase in freight traffic can materialise only it there is no repetition of the experience of 1993-94. Much depends of course on the developments in the economy in 1994-95. On the basis of the estimates, it is expected that there will be a shortfall in resources of Rs. 997 crores for financing even a modest Plan outlay of Rs. 6,515 crores. This is only marginally higher than the budget estimates for 1993-94. A larger portion will be found through borrowing and a higher level of budgetary support because of inadequate generation of internal resources. The Plan outlay should be much higher than it is now though paucity of resources is a limiting factor. It is also intended to streamline operations with a restructuring of zonal systems and a better use of the capacity of Railway enterprises. Even though a valiant attempt has been made to limit escalation in costs and use available resources optimally, it has been necessary again to raise freight rates and passenger fares. A new procedure has been adopted for pushing up freight rates with changes in classification. It would appear that the incidence of upward adjustments will be more severe in respect of commodities whose handling has not been remunerative enough for the Railways. The increase in the cost of moving bulk commodities over longer distances may thus be more pronounced than in the case of high rated traffic. While passenger fares have been raised by six per cent, an effort has been made to reduce cosmetically fares for short distances. In the event, the hike in freight rates will fetch additionally Rs. 800 crores and passenger fares Rs. 197 crores. The total amount sought to be raised was as much as Rs. 1,848 crores last year. Railway users may thus feel that they have been let off relatively lightly though the cumulative effect of the changes in recent years is proving to be regressive. In the changing situation a strengthening of the Railway finances can be ensured only with a growth in all types of traffic.
