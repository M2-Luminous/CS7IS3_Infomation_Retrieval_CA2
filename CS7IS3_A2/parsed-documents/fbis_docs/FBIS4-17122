Any positive motion aimed at an inter-Rwandan settlement will be met by Russian support and understanding, Demurin noted. "We welcome Organization of African Unity (OAU) actions aimed at stopping the bloodshed, and hope that joint efforts made by the U.N. and the OAU will lead to a turning-point in the present dramatic situation in Rwanda. In this connection Moscow supports the initiative proposed by the Tanzanian president to hold a peace conference on Rwanda in Arusha on April 23," the Russian Foreign Ministry official emphasised.
