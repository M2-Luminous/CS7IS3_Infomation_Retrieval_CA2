The chief of the General Staff was accompanied by comrade Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Holguin, as well as other members of the Central Committee of the PCC. The microjet banana plantations at Limoncito in Baguano Municipality, were the first stop. Here 33 caballerias are being planted. Of these, from August to date, almost seven have been planted. There are plans to plant 11 by the end of February and all 33 by 26 July. Once the planting is completed, harvesting will begin in the areas planted first. The yield is estimated at 350,000 quintals of bananas over the next 12 months. This yield is expected given the quality of the soil, irrigation, fertilization, and careful tending efforts. The work force consists of a contingent of youths mobilized by the Union of Young Communists [UJC] in the municipalities of Baguano and Holguin. An interesting detail is that irrigation is done entirely by gravity. The water comes from the Limoncito Dam -- five kilometers away -- which yields 6 million cubic meters a year and was built in record time. The dam, which covers 60 hectares according to the visual estimate made by Fishing Vice Minister Oltuski, allows for fish farming at diverse rates according to the level of feed provided. Ulises praised this provincial effort to significantly increase in the near future the supply of vegetables to the population of the provincial capital and other towns. The general stressed the need to stabilize the labor force because the outstanding physical conditions observed will yield the most only if the workers, through work and technological discipline, high morale, and willingness to win, guarantee the results by doing every day what is required. The next stop was the joint Sugar Industry Ministry [Minaz]-FAR experimental plant to produce bagasse briquettes, which are then turned into charcoal briquettes and other liquid or gas charcoal by-products. The plant is located in the processing center of the Fernando de Dios Mill. This guarantees a supply of 50 tons of bagasse a day for 100 days during this abnormally short harvest. The plant can produce briquettes at a rate of 1 ton an hour. Likewise, the charcoal producing area is able to produce 3 tons a day by consuming approximately 10 tons of bagasse briquettes. The importance of the experiment is clear to everyone because sugarcane bagasse is a renewable energy resource which yields hundreds of thousands of tons a year. The trick lies in how to turn its immense energy potential into an alternative practical and economic energy source. Rosales del Toro praised the stage of assembly of the experimental plant and added that similar ones are being installed at the Luis Arcos Bergnes Mill, in central Cuba, and the Pablo Noriega Mill in western Cuba. All this is part of an investigation carried out by the FAR, in cooperation with Minaz, as part of the scientific and technical tasks programmed by the national forums. Rosales went on to say that an extraordinary military council would be held in April during which the first secretaries of the provincial committees will participate to analyze, among other issues, this experiment of the Eastern Army. Here, Garcia Ferrer [not further identified] mentioned that the Minister of the FAR had recently pointed out that the most advanced experiment was that of the Eastern Army. The tour through several organic plots in Holguin City was praised by the visiting delegation, which pointed out that this idea has been stressed by Raul Castro, who is also in that province, but busy with other tasks together with Ramon Espinosa, head of the Eastern Army. The first secretary in the Municipality, Jorge Luis Sierra, informed them that the city has 13 organic plots, which have either been completed or are now under construction, in 11 urban councils. These small agricultural production centers have a total of 1900 seed beds [calderos] and 54,000 square meters of cultivatable soil. So far, nine varieties of vegetables are being cultivated, most of which is lettuce because it is in high demand. The products harvested are sold everyday. The population can purchase the lettuce directly from the organic plot for 1 peso a head. Different methods have been established to pay the wages of the workers at the plots, paying each worker according to his effort and productivity. The water used for irrigation at the organic plots is generally extracted from wells built for that purpose. In some cases, the water is pumped with the use of windmills in other cases the old fashioned method is used: rope and buckets. Only two organic plots use water from the aqueducts because water has not been found in the subsoil. Brief conversations were held with the administrators of the two organic plots visited. These administrators do manual labor when necessary. Their salaries are also linked to the productivity of their organic plots. Teresa Saldivar, an agronomy technician, manages one of those plots. The volume of sales in January was of 13,000 pesos. The cost per peso is less than 50 cents. Felix Perez is another one of the administrators with whom they spoke. He is not a professional but is in fact a technician that studied in life's university; from being a leader of the Federation of Secondary School Students, to his internationalist mission in Angola, and his peasant origin. Francisco Ferrer, the first secretary of the party in Holguin, stated that their accomplishments were small when compared to their goal: 300,000 square meters of plots in the provincial capital. By when? As soon as possible.
