EPP), in a report on the 7 March elections in Kazakhstan, said that they had been "relatively free and balanced." According to the report, "despite the limited plurality of the candidates, and a number of technical irregularities," there had not been, in these elections, "large-scale fraud." This assessment is different to that of other observers, and in particular that of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
