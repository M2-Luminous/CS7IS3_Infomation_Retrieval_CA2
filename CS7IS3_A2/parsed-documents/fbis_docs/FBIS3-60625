North Korea's expression of its willingness to accept international inspection on some nuclear facilities showed it was turning to a positive position in light of the opinion of the international community, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Gregory Karasin told reporters. The proposal does not, however, lead to a fundamental solution of the problem, which calls for full implementation of its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and a guarantee of uninterrupted nuclear inspection, Karasin said. The Russian Government hopes the problem of banning nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula will be resolved through constructive dialogue and mutual cooperation between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency at an early date, he said.
