The ministry confirmed demands amounting to 570 million German marks [DM] for the development of the Eurofighter (Fighter 90). However, State Secretary Joerg Schoenbohm told the Defense Committee of the Bundestag that the government will not accept such high demands. According to the Defense Ministry, costs involving approximately DM160 million are realistic. They resulted from the fact that the industry had to develop a cheaper version after the decision by Defense Minister Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union). The most recent demands by the consortium that is involved in the construction of the fighter were received by the Defense Ministry in March. At the same time, the Eurofighter prototype performed its maiden flight, but with engines of the Tornado aircraft and an incompletely developed electronic system. The Defense Ministry estimated the costs for the modification of the fighter plane to an improved model at DM300 million. However, the industry agreed to assume a little less than half the costs. The government is willing to provide DM160 million for the new control system. All other costs are not acceptable or have been caused by the industry because of delays in the development. Negotiations on the additional costs are to be concluded by the summer. New demands were also addressed to Great Britain, Spain, and Italy, which are all participating in the development of the fighter plane. The Eurofighter Consortium continues to offer the complete aircraft, including the required equipment (system price), at DM102.5 million. Ruehe stated in December 1992 that he is not willing to pay more than $60 million for an aircraft, which corresponded to approximately DM90 million at the time. The Defense Ministry now expects a system price for the complete fighter of below DM100 million, which is the price level of December 1992. If one takes into consideration the inflation rate, the offer would be acceptable for the industry. Ruehe has not commented on the system price recently. The newly elected Bundestag will make a decision on the acquisition of the aircraft in one year when the fighter will be fully developed.
