He stated: "If the United Nations makes the decision, Japan for its part intends to provide as much as cooperation as possible. If it is necessary for Japan to join in logistical support activities, Japan has no choice but to do so." Ichikawa made the remarks in a TV Asahi program. His remarks are believed to have virtually approved Japan's logistical support for U.S. forces. Discussing the connection between the exercise of the right of collective self-defense, which the Constitution bans, and logistical support, Ichikawa said: "For example, oil supplies to U.S. forces has been banned because it is believed to be included in collective self-defense under the conventional interpretation of the Constitution by the Cabinet Legislation Bureau. However, because (the North Korea issue) is an important issue concerning Japan's security, oil supplies to U.S. forces are also deemed to come within the category of individual self-defense." He added: "If it is necessary to take legislative measures, we have to do that."
