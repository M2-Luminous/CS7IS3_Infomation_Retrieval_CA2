Meeting with his German counterpart Guenter Rexrodt, Hata said the expert from the semigovernmental Japan External Trade Organization will look into possible export products in the region for a year, a Japanese official said. Rexrodt told Hata that the former East Germany needs foreign assistance and he expects the Japanese trade expert to bring good results, the official said. Touching on stalled Japan-U.S. talks on a new trade framework, Hata reiterated Japan's opposition to U.S. demands that Tokyo set numerical targets to measure progress in reducing Japan's trade surplus with the United States. Rexrodt said there must be progress in opening Japan's markets, but noted that he opposes setting numerical targets as sought by the U.S. as Japan does. Hata and Rexrodt are in the Polish capital to attend the third meeting of economic officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations and from officials from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union on East-West trade issues.
