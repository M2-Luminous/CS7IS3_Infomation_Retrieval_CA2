FR940825-2-00144 FR940825-2-00095 The Exchange proposed two sets of changes to the ELDS listing standards. The first proposed change, which the Commission has already approved, 11 provides alternative market capitalization and trading volume criteria for the underlying security. Specifically, an underlying security may now have either; (1) A minimum market capitalization of at least $3.0 billion and a trading volume of at least 2.5 million shares in the one-year period prior to the listing of the ELDS; or (2) a minimum market capitalization of $1.5 billion and a trading volume of at least 20 million shares in the one-year period prior to the listing. 11 See Exchanges Act Release No. 22841, supra note 3. The second set of proposed changes would amend Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual to allow the issuer of the underlying security to be a non-U.S. company, 12 if certain criteria are met. Under the proposal, the issuer of the underlying security could be a non-U.S. company subject to reporting requirements under the Act, and whose securities are traded in the United States either as ordinary shares or as sponsored 13 ADRs if ne of the following conditions are met: 12 The Exchange defines a non-U.S. company as any company formed or incorporated outside of the United States. Telephone conversation between Vincent Patten, Assistant Vice President of New Products, NYSE, and Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, on July 19, 1994. See also, 17 CFR 240.3b&hyph;4(b) (1985) (definition of foreign issuer under the Act). 13 As opposed to an unsponsored ADR, a sponsored ADR is established jointly by the issuer of the underlying security and depository. With a sponsored ADR, the depositary is generally required to distribute notices of shareholder meetings and voting instructions to ADR holders, thereby ensuring the ADR holders will be able to exercise voting rights through the depositary with respect to the underlying securities. 1. The Exchange has in place an effective surveillance sharing agreement 14 with the primary market for the underlying security (in the case of an ADR, with the primary market in the country where the security underlying the ADR primarily trades) and at least 30% of the world-wide trading volume for the security and all related securities (as defined herein) occurs in the U.S. market; 15 14 An effective ( i.e., comprehensive) surveillance sharing agreement would provide for the exchange of market trading activity, clearing activity, and the identity of the ultimate purchaser or seller of the securities traded. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33552 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5626 (February 7, 1994) (``ADR Approval Order''). 15 See Amendment No. 1, supra note 4. 2. The United States is the primary market for the underlying security (determined in the manner discussed below). In determining whether the U.S. is the primary market for the underlying security, the combined trading volume of the security (and in the case of ADRs, other classes of stock and ADRs related to the underlying security (``related securities'')) in the United States for the six-month period preceding the date of listing 16 must account for at least 50% of the combined worldwide trading in such securities. The U.S. trading in the security underlying the ELDS would include only those U.S. self-regulatory organizations included in the Intermarket Surveillance Group 17 and linked through the Intermarket Trading System. 18 Trading in the United States in other market would be included in the world-wide trading volume for the security, but not the U.S. trading volume. 16 Id. 17 ISG was formed on July 14, 1983 to, among other things, coordinate more effectively surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets. See Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the ISG Agreement, which incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members on January 29, 1990. See Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, January 29, 1990. The members of the ISG, (and accordingly, of the U.S. market) are: the American Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc.; the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; the NYSE; the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Because of potential opportunities for trading abuses involving stock index futures, stock options and the underlying stock and the need for greater sharing of surveillance information for these potential intermarket trading abuses, the major stock index futures exchanges (e.g., the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade) joined the ISG as affiliate members in 1990. 18 ITS is a communications system designed to facilitate trading among competing markets by providing each market with order routing capabilities based on current quotation information. The system links the participant markets and provides facilities and procedures for: (1) The display of composite quotation information at each participate market, so that brokers are able to determine readily the best bid and offer available from any participate for multiply trading securities; (2) efficient routing of orders and sending administrative messages (on the functioning of the system) to all participating markets; (3) participation, under certain conditions, by members of all participating market in opening transactions in those markets; and (4) routing orders from a participating market to a participating market with a better price.
