He pointed out that investigations were continuing to find out more about this mystery, particularly as one of the criminals was still being treated and could not be questioned because of the current state of his health. In a statement he delivered today at the Transitional National Assembly, the minister reviewed the incident at al-Thawrah mosque and the criminal acts carried out by an armed group of foreigners. He said that their moves began with an attack on a police station at Umm Baddah north where they claimed that they wanted to make a report but then seized weapons [passage omitted] In response to questions and requests for clarifications, the minister said that notwithstanding the basic principles of general policy there must be measures for control and regulation of the procedures relating to arrivals in the country. He expressed the hope that further investigations would provide more information about this mysterious incident. He ruled out that the criminals were targeting Usamah Bin Ladin, proprietor of the Hijrah company working on the al-Tahaddi road.
