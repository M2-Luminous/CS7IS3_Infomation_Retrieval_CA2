FR940907-0-00013 FR940907-0-00004 Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace areas at Harrisburg, Capital City Airport, PA, Harrisburg International Airport, PA, Erie, PA, North Philadelphia, PA, and Williamsport, PA, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas when the associated control tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone (CZ) existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ's were continuous, while the former ATA's were contingent upon the operation of the associated air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. Additionally, this action establishes Class E airspace areas at Lancaster, PA, and Reading, PA. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Lancaster, PA, and Reading, PA, when the control towers are closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these air traffic control towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the Federal Register on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645). Furthermore, the Class E airspace areas at Bradford, PA, and Du Bois, PA, are being revised to reflect the hours of the associated Flight Service Station. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 5000, 6002, and 6004, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 8, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class D and E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D and establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
