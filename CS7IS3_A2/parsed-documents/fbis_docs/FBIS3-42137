North Korea never had a military nuclear programme. The research in atomic energy was of an exclusively peaceful character, he noted. The ambassador said the former Soviet Union rendered assistance to North Korea in various spheres. In those years, Soviet specialists, including nuclear energy experts, worked in the republic. However, now there are no Russian atomic experts in North Korea. According to Son Sung-pil, Japanese mass media are initiators of various fabrications on the topic. It is not by accident, because "Japan has all the necessary components for creating nuclear weapons," he said. "It is quite possible that certain circles of that country are interested that the world community's attention is attracted by the fuss about the alleged threat from North Korea, using it as a ground and excuse to create their own atomic bomb," the ambassador stressed.
