Also additional rebates for service and conservancy and rental charges. For businesses, it is a mixed budget. The property tax will be reduced, but there will be an increase in employers' CPF rates and in the salary ceilings for the skill development fund levy. Presenting his budget statement in Parliament, Dr. Hu said the better-than-expected growth last year yielded a healthy budget surplus. This strong fiscal position gives the government scope to pass part of the surplus back to the economy and to enhance the assets of citizens. For individuals, [words indistinct] one of rebates of 5 percent on income tax for year of assessment 1994 and on top of the GST [Goods and Services Tax] rebates announced last year, there will be additional rebates on HDB [Housing and Development Board] service and conservancy charges and rentals. This will raise from [Singapore dollars] $40.50 to $76.50. The rebates will take effect from 1 April. The government will also be paying a higher interest rate for savings in the CPF retirement and the special accounts. From 1 July next year, the rates will be one and one-quarter point above the normal CPF interest rates. Details will be announced by the labor minister later. There also will be another share ownership corporate scheme to help Singaporeans build up CPF savings to buy shares in the next major privatization exercise two years from now. Every CPF member above 21 years will get $300 from the government. But the employer must contribute at least $750 during an 18-month qualifying period starting from the first of next month. There will be a prorated contribution for those who put in less than $750 and to help some taxpayers to enjoy (?proration) incentives and extension of the claim period. The claim period for the special and further tax rebates will be extended by two years to nine years. This will take effect from year of assessment 1994. For companies, the property tax rates for industrial and commercial properties will be cut by 1 percent each point to 15 percent from 1 July. The intention is to allow the rates in stages to 12 percent over the next 45 years. The cut also applies to residential property rented out. The concessionary tax rates for owned and occupied residential property will remain unchanged, and also there will be tax incentives to promote the growth of international derivative trading and arbitrage activities and trading of regional securities. From assessment year 1995, the Asian Currency Unit -- the ACU -- and approved securities companies -- ASC scheme -- will be expanded to include foreign securities lending and borrowing. They will enjoy concessionary tax rates of 10 percent on income derived from lending and borrowing foreign securities with another ACU, ASC, or non-resident persons. The concession will also apply to income derived by approved fund managers who are arranging such transactions on behalf of foreign investors. There will be no tax on securities lending fees, (?manifested) dividend, and interest paid by the ACU or ASC to a nonresident person who doesn't have a permanent establishment here. Also, no stamp duties on documents executed under sale and agreement in respect to such securities lending and the borrowing activities. Dr. Hu also announced the 10-percent concessionary tax rates on income derived from stock and physical trading in silver and platinum with approved parties. And to promote Singapore as a regional securities trading and fund management center, transactions of ACU and ASC and non-Singapore dollar securities with approved fund managers will also get a 10-percent tax concession. But only transactions involving funds managed for foreign investors by such fund managers will qualify. These transactions will also be exempted from contract note stamp duties. Also to be exempted from tax, income derived by ASC from approved syndicated offshore credit and underwriting facilities. The aim is to further enhance Singapore's position as a leading syndication center in Asia. Dr. Hu also announced enhancement to foreign centers introduced to promote the development of the manufacturing and services sectors. It is to make it more attractive for companies to expand after the initial incentive period. The initial tax relief period for the expansion of established enterprises, expanding service companies and centers, export of services and warehousing, and servicing incentives is now five years or shorter. This will be extended to not more than 10 years. But, further extension would be allowed [words indistinct] not more than five years. This will be subject to a maximum relief of 20 years for incentives. The minister also disclosed that to nullify the effects of GST, import duty on cars will be 41 percent from 1 April; duty on taxis 17 percent and on motorcycles 12 percent. Also to offset GST, excise duties on leaded and unleaded petrol will be cut. (?And) duties on kerosene, lubricating oil, liquified petroleum gas, and aviation (?fuel) will be suspended. To meet GATT requirements, import duties on cigarettes, tobacco, liquor, and motor vehicles will be converted to excise duties from 1 July, but the tax burden remains unchanged. Dr. Hu also announced changes to the CPF contribution rates for employers and employees as well as on the salary ceilings for skill development levy. From 1 July, employers' CPF contribution will go up by 1.5 percentage point to 20 percent. That for employees will be reduced by the same amount to 20 percent. Dr. Hu said the government is making a final 1.5 percent point adjustment to the CPF contribution rates in view of the continued growth of the economy. He said employers and employees should take this adjustment into account in the wage negotiations. On worker training, Dr. Hu told Parliament that skill development fund [SDF] in financial year 92 disbursed more than $50 million for training programs. This is much more than the $50 million collected through the skill development levy that year. Dr. Hu said at the present SDF disbursement level, the fund will eventually be depleted. The government has, therefore, decided to revise the salary ceilings for skill development levy collection from $750 to $1,000 from financial year 95. But the levy rate will remain at 1 percent. He also announced more for edusave [education savings] and medifund [medical fund]. Dr. Hu said in good years it is essential we accumulate surpluses to save in time of crises and to secure investor confidence in our future. (?This) will also allow us to build up the assets of Singaporeans. In this regard, he said the financial year 93 edusave contribution will be increased to $1 billion. For financial year 94, another $500 million will be put into edusave and $100 million into medifund. Dr. Hu also announced the setting up of the pension fund for public officers. He said it is a good health-keeping practice for the government to recognize pensions as a future liability and to provide for it. He said civil servants should not spend their retirement in fear that the government can't pay their pensions when times are bad. The government's total expenditure in financial year 94 is expected to reach $16.7 billion, up 19 percent from financial year 93. As in previous years, social and community services will take the largest share at nearly 40 percent with more than half of it for education. The second largest share at 32 percent will be taken by national security, including defense and home affairs. Dr. Hu said Singapore today is at a turning point. We have become a newly industrialized economy and are on the threshold of the first league of nations. But Singaporeans must not relax and take progress and prosperity for granted. The challenge is how to collectively manage to leap into the ranks of the first league. The finance minister notes Singaporeans have achieved much in the last 20 years due to sound economic management by the government and the hard work of the people. These things must continue as we strive to gain promotion into the first league. Concluding, Dr. Hu said the world economy is expected to perform better in 1994. The signs are optimistic. The U.S. economic expansion will remain strong. After last year's dismal performance, this year's outlook in Western Europe is comparatively brighter and Japan's is also expected to improve this year. Dr. Hu noted that the expanding economies of Asia will lead the pack. Singapore can prosper and grow together with our neighbors anf trading partners if we remain competitive and productive. He is confident we can achieve if we continue to price diligence, assets, and enterprise above luck and quick gains.
