Speaking during debate on the president's state of the nation address, he said the victory achieved had not just been that of any one party, "but a victory we can all share -- of freedom, democracy and justice". South Africans should not under-estimate the enormous challenges facing the country. Dr de Villiers warned of a "very difficult future" if "we fail to make peace with our past". He pledged the new National Party's [NP] commitment to the new dispensation and said the party would make its contribution to the writing of South Africa's final constitution which should not have the deficiencies of the interim one. He drew further applause from ANC benches when he said although the NP and ANC had differed on a number of issues, if the two parties had not driven the negotiation process together South Africa would not have reached the stage it had. Other parties, such as the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Freedom Front and the Democratic Party, had also made important contributions. Many Afrikaners had sought escape in the dream of a white homeland, but many conservatives now realised they had to come to terms with reality. Three particularly important areas to which President Nelson Mandela had committed his government were financial discipline, confidence in markets, and the role of the private sector in securing a sustainable economy and the opening of the economy to global competition. These commitments would inspire confidence in the business community locally and internationally. Although difficult times lay ahead, and painful decisions needed to be taken, the NP would co-operate fully to make the government of national unity work.
