He has done this by vetoing a paragraph of a law providing that the same index be applied to adjust agricultural loans and agricultural minimum prices. The presidential veto, which has upset the ruralist leaders in Congress, affects Paragraph Two of Article 16 of the Real Value Unit [URV] Conversion Law. Deputy Nelson Marquezelli (PTB-SP) [Brazilian Labor Party-Sao Paulo], chairman of the Agriculture Committee at the Chamber of Deputies, said: "We found out that Bacha is the one giving orders within the government." Marquezelli was thus referring to Finance Ministry special adviser Edmar Bacha, who had negotiated with the ruralist bloc members and who had resisted until the last minute the changes proposed by the lawmakers. The ruralist bloc consists of nearly 130 congressmen of various parties who normally vote as a bloc on matters of interest to their sector. The ruralists demanded that the same index be applied to adjust both agricultural minimum prices and loans in order to stop them from blocking the approval of the government's economic plan. Marquezelli said the rural bloc will mobilize to override the presidential veto. Marquezelli added: "The government is represented by its leader, but it does not honor the commitments he makes." Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Sao Paulo], the government's leader in the Chamber of Deputies, was responsible for striking a deal with the ruralists. FOLHA yesterday unsuccessfully tried to find Santos to hear his comments. Marquezelli wants to have the veto overridden already in June. He said he will seek to mobilize congressional leaders beginning next week. In light of the president's decision, the law goes into effect but the vetoed articles are returned to Congress to be discussed by the legislature. They will be included in the "list of vetoes." An absolute majority of the Chamber of Deputies (252 votes) and of the Senate (41 votes) -- in a joint session -- is required to override a presidential veto. Based on a justification of the veto drafted by the Finance Ministry, the government contends that the wording of the law violates "a precedent set by the Federal Supreme Court that rejects any breach of contract."
