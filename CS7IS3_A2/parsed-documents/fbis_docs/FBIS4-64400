This year will see a rise in the amounts ploughed back into medium-sized companies for investment purposes but small and large industry will continue to languish, pushing the overall figure down by about 1.9 percent, said ISCO in its six-month report. This figure is fairly healthy when compared with the 13.5 percent drop chalked up in 1993, said ISCO, adding that the average fall in investments last year across the European Union stood at around 12 percent. An ISCO poll showed that two-thirds of companies questioned said that they planned to step up investments next year, with large-sized firms leading the field.
