A U.S. diplomat was summoned to the Department of North America of the Russian Foreign Ministry earlier today to receive the following statement: "The Russian Foreign Ministry is lodging a protest against illegal activities of the American side with regard to an official representative of the Russian foreign intelligence service who has been working in Washington since the summer of 1993 by mutual consent" of Russia and the United States, Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said. "In this situation, we have to declare, on the basis of reciprocity, a CIA officer in Moscow persona non grata and demand that he leave the Russian Federation," the statement said. "The Russian Foreign Ministry proceeds from the fact that there are special channels for settling issues arising on both sides in connection with intelligence or counterintelligence activity. These channels can and should be engaged. This will allow (us) to find a mutually acceptable way out from the current situation and avoid its politicisation," the statement said. The U.S. Embassy has been also presented with a diplomatic note. ITAR-TASS has learnt that Morris will leave Russia within seven days.
