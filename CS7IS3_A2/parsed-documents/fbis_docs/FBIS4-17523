An appeal of the Moldovan parliament adopted here today reminded that Moldova is an independent state recognized by over 100 nations, primarily Romania. At the same time, efforts to consolidate Moldovan statehood, accord and good-neighbourly atmosphere in the European region encounter "fierce resistance of some nationalist-extremist politicians, who do not even want to hear about sovereign and independent Moldova," says the document. The appeal stressed that the majority of Moldovan citizens supported building of independent Moldovan state at the recent parliamentary elections.
