Truly historic changes have occurred since that time both in our lives and in the biographies of the politicians introduced in that publication: The Soviet Union has disappeared, its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, has departed politics, and new independent states, which have formed the CIS, have appeared. But many of the leaders of that time have held on to power, albeit in a new capacity. And whereas previously we asked whether the familiar "face of power" in the Soviet Union would not become the power of individuals, now this question itself is different: Can the power of individuals in the post-Soviet space be composed of a "face of power" not united under a communal roof but capable of consulting, reaching agreement, and seeking and finding real compromises in the tangled relations between the new independent states? Yeltsin The election of Boris Yeltsin as the first chairman of the CIS may, of course, be considered up to a certain point a purely symbolic gesture and a display of support on the part of his colleagues. His function can in no way be compared with the chairmanship of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Federation Council or even in the far more independent USSR State Council. But in a whole number of instances--we recall the economic situation in Ukraine, the war in Georgia, the Dniester conflict in Moldova, the Karabakh confrontation of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the collapse of the "new-type ruble zone" for Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan--the influence of the Russian leadership on the affairs of countries of the Commonwealth has all but exceeded the influence of the former Soviet leadership on the possibilities of the Union republics. For this reason Yeltsin's chairmanship does not today appear purely incidental. But Russia's policy in relation to the former Soviet republics remains sufficiently unpredictable. Russian leaders--primarily the president--are constantly torn between political necessity and economic expediency. On the one hand there is evidence of a desire to preserve the entire former Soviet space as a "zone of influence," on the other, the measures of economic stimulation, necessary in these cases, of countries in no hurry over their reforms are beginning to objectively contradict the interests of the Russian economic reform. The most striking example here was Russia's refusal to remit to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan cash in new-denomination rubles after the accords on the creation of a new-type ruble zone had been signed. The situation in which Russia had found itself was precisely described at that time by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev: "As an economist, I can understand the ministers of economics or finance of Russia. But they should confer with the people responsible for Russia's geopolitical interests." Boris Yeltsin is one such person. But he has to take account not only of the logic constructs of the economic structures but also the desires of the power structures, which submit to no political logic--the president is too dependent on them in domestic policy to go against them in foreign policy, in the "near abroad" particularly. I would recall if only the assault on Sukhumi, which impressed the world, by Abkhaz formations, which not only were not stopped by the military of Russia--the guarantor of the fulfillment of the well-known Georgian-Abkhaz agreements which disarmed the Georgian Army--but were in fact supported by the former. Even, possibly, contrary to the wishes of a president of Russia unduly preoccupied at this time with his confrontation with the Supreme Soviet. Now Boris Yeltsin has once again found himself faced with the need to make a choice in his "Commonwealth" policy. The success of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party at the parliamentary elections demonstrated pretty well the kind of success revanchist sentiments are enjoying in Russian society. And the president also is facing the obvious temptation not so much to follow in the wake of Zhirinovskiy's views as to justify all of Russia's stern actions in relation to countries of the CIS by the existence of the chauvinist phenomenon. Some recent statements of the president's closest advisers, including Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, show that this could be a perfectly acceptable direction in foreign policy. And then the sole "lever" of influencing Russian policy left to Boris Yeltsin's colleagues would be the telephone. Or, at best, personal contacts. After all, thus far all problems between Russia and the CIS countries have been resolved only at presidential level--a pretty good illustration of the abnormality of these relations, frozen, as it were, at the level of the old fissures in Gorbachev's Federation Council and incapable yet of switching to the level of normal interstate relations. Nazarbayev The president of Kazakhstan, whose nonparticipation in the celebrated Belovezha meeting is still explained variously by the leaders of the former Soviet republics, has become the main spokesman, virtually, for integration ideas in the CIS. It was Nazarbayev who proposed and decisively supported the creation of coordinating bodies of the Commonwealth and the economic union of its members. But the president of Kazakhstan has simultaneously endeavored insistently to build a truly sovereign and real state in a republic with a more than complex ethnic makeup (the most complex in the former Union, probably, not counting tiny Latvia, which is protected as yet against possible demographic problems by the rules of international law). The building of Kazakhstani statehood has required as an essential condition the tolerant attitude of the Russian leadership toward this complex historical experiment against the former's own will: after all, Kazakhstan was the last of the former Soviet republics to proclaim independence, and its president consistently supported, as long as this was possible, the preservation and reform of the Union. But when Kazakhstani statehood came to be suffused with real political and economic content and the country began to take the first independent steps in foreign policy, a cooling suddenly ensued in Kazakhstani-Russian relations--and hardly through the fault of Almaty. The refusal to transfer rubles in cash, charges of an attempt to create an alternative economic union of Turkic-speaking countries, the endeavor of certain Russian politicians--from both government circles and the opposition--to act the part of defenders of the Russian-speaking population--all this also influenced, of course, Nursultan Nazarbayev's positions in respect to the CIS. In any event, reports of Kazakhstan's promotion of initiatives at the Ashgabat meeting have remained unconfirmed, but the president of this republic engaged in heavy diplomatic activity, taking advantage of the last "summit" for productive bilateral contacts, with his recent "antipode" in the Commonwealth--Leonid Kravchuk--included. A charming and strong politician, Nazarbayev can today, without putting his popularity in the republic particularly at risk, distance himself from Russia somewhat, offering society certain alternative paths of development and alternative partners even. But these steps of Kazakhstan could be more a reaction to Moscow's misunderstanding of Almaty's aspiration to build equal relations protected against speculation on the most painful topic for Kazakhstan--the possibility of interethnic misunderstanding. It should be mentioned also that the Kazakhstan president's distancing of himself somewhat from Russia could help him in the struggle for influence in the Central Asia region, where Almaty's positions have been weakened somewhat--compared with those of Tashkent--in connection with the Tajik events. In addition, on the eve of parliamentary elections such a policy could reduce the chances of Nazarbayev's opponents from Kazakh national parties, who are accusing him of failing to understand Kazakhstan's true interests. Kravchuk Whereas until recently the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan were considered the main proponents of the integration line in the CIS, the president of Ukraine was described, as a rule, as a supporter of a different approach to the Commonwealth, as the most felicitous instrument for the "divorce" of the former Soviet republics. But time has adjusted both the position of Yeltsin and Nazarbayev and the position of Kravchuk: The CIS could not either be a practicable instrument for the integration of its members or secure for them a normal divorce. The distance at which this country or the other stands from the Commonwealth was more a political section than a measure of true integration or disintegration desires. And it is striking here that the strong political position of the president of Ukraine has not been founded on real economic possibilities, which has led in Russian-Ukrainian relations, for example, to humiliating concessions, which President Kravchuk himself has called "kneeling." The attitude of the president of Ukraine toward the CIS is conditioned primarily by the state of the relations of Ukraine and Russia, and these relations depend directly on the ailing, unreformed Ukrainian economy. On the eve of early parliamentary and presidential elections in the country it is the economic crisis which has propelled to the forefront the question of stable Ukrainian statehood. For President Kravchuk himself--as for Ukraine also, for that matter--the best option at the present time would appear to be the abandonment of presidential elections after the parliamentary elections with a strengthening of the vertical line of the executive. But Leonid Kravchuk could achieve this cancellation only with the start of a real, even if not all that significant, change in the economy or, on the other hand, with an extraordinary exacerbation of the situation. Both versions are hardly realistic, and it may be assumed, therefore, that the Ukrainian president will simply attempt to find a common language with the new parliament, and the composition of this parliament will determine his tactics in relations with Russia and the CIS as a whole. The only thing that should not be expected from Kravchuk is the fulfillment of the cherished dream of certain radical Russian politicians from the "revanche party"--a change of the blue and yellow flag for a white one. Leonid Kravchuk has invested too much in his image as the architect of new Ukrainian independence to retreat from it. The combination of the success of this political image and the economic apathy is altogether, most likely, the determining phenomenon of the "sovereign-communist" success, which is not typical of just Kravchuk alone. Shushkevich An architect of the CIS and until the day before yesterday chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich had since the first months of the Commonwealth's existence, virtually, been in a dual position. On the one hand, against the background of the other leaders of the former Soviet republics Shushkevich appeared to be the politician who most aspired to preserve Union integration and even some special relationship with Russia. But at the same time Shushkevich aspired also to "preserve character," ensuring for the proclaimed Belorussian sovereignty if only an attributive existence. And it was here that Shushkevich encountered in his own republic the opposition of the "economic party" headed by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, and it is Kebich's policy, not that of Shushkevich, which has of late gained the support of the majority of members of parliament, what is more. And Shushkevich--not president but chairman of the Supreme Soviet--had to come to terms with this trend, which has already led to his dismissal from office. Meanwhile, the struggle for power in Minsk and the hope of the executive that closer cooperation with Russia will make it possible not to reform the republic's economy have led to Belarus' loss of its advantageous mediating role in the CIS. Karimov During the events in Tajikistan Islam Karimov, who intervened in the conflict decisively and facilitated the accession to power of the present Tajik leadership headed by Emomali Rakhmanov, succeeded in showing that his claims to leadership in the region may not be simply declarative. But it is indicative that Karimov has subsequently tried to distance himself from the Tajik conflict, demonstrating hereby that his decisive steps may alternate with quite cautious tactics. This is connected to some extent with the fact that the Uzbek economy, which is living merely with the expectation of possible energy dividends, cannot allow itself a free sail and to some extent with the president's concerns for a strengthening of his own power, which does not contemplate lengthy involvement in so dangerous a conflict as the Tajik conflict. In addition, left by Russia without cash in rubles, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, traditional rivals, have simply been forced to draw closer to one another, and Karimov has inquired in earnest about the prospects of regional integration: Tajikistan and Turkmenistan will hardly be active participants, but a commonwealth of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan could produce tangible geopolitical results. At the same time it has to be recalled that observers were expecting of the experienced and cautious Karimov greater flexibility in domestic policy, considering that there was little that in fact threatened the power of the president of Uzbekistan. But Islam Karimov has preferred to rule his country quite strictly, obviously believing that the stability that has been achieved is the best proof of the soundness of the tactics for which he has opted. But it is hard to judge as yet how durable stability in any republic of Central Asia will be and to what extent presidential power can hold back uncontrollable social processes, especially if they have support from abroad. Shevardnadze One of the best known and most consummate politicians on the territory of the former Union, Eduard Shevardnadze has found himself the head of a country paralyzed by sporadic civil war, interethnic conflicts, and the amateurish leadership of Georgia by the predecessors and associates of Gorbachev's foreign minister. Of course, the situation in which Georgia finds itself has been the main obstacle to the application of Shevardnadze's diplomatic capabilities, especially since--on account of the relative independence of many of the players in the Russian political arena--the policy of the Georgian leader oriented toward a search for honest and mutually acceptable accords with Russia has as yet proven bankrupt. A politician of any other rank could hardly have retained power after the loss of Sukhumi, but Shevardnadze succeeded under these conditions in offering stereotypes of political consciousness and leading Georgia into the CIS. The Ashgabat meeting was essentially the Georgian leader's debut in the Commonwealth, but Eduard Shevardnadze succeeded at this "summit" even in demonstrating that he will hardly be a passive observer here: Shevardnadze's interlocutors in the Turkmen capital, who subsequently met among themselves, included Leonid Kravchuk and Nursultan Nazarbayev, Geydar Aliyev, Islam Karimov.... Despite his country's calamitous situation, Shevardnadze is prepared, it would seem, to employ if only his personal possibilities for a change in the apportionment of forces in the Commonwealth which could help Georgia consolidate its positions in the post-Soviet space. Aliyev The return to power in Azerbaijan of Geydar Aliyev is a no less fascinating story than the political biography of Eduard Shevardnadze. And one further example of the fact that representatives of the old Soviet school who went through the "fire and water" of the Brezhnev Politburo even can give the representatives of the national movements who campaigned for the independence of the former Soviet republics far more actively than the party secretaries a 100-point lead. Eduard Shevardnadze, of course, showed his capabilities as a politician not so much as head of the Communist Party of Georgia Central Committee but as... foreign minister of the USSR and in the exercise of foreign policy perestroyka. But Geydar Aliyev also, after his departure from the office of first vice premier of the Soviet Union, demonstrated his political capabilities, heading the Supreme Assembly of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. As the head of Nakhichevan, an enclave situated between Turkey and an Armenia essentially at war with Azerbaijan, Aliyev was able to prevent hostilities on his territory, find a common language with Ankara, which sympathized with his political antagonist President Elchibey, and even to establish contacts with Yerevan. But once in Baku, Aliyev, like Shevardnadze in Tbilisi, came in for a difficult inheritance: A country with pretty good political possibilities had found itself threatened with military defeat, and it was simply essential that the new president show himself to be a far more moderate and peace-loving politician than his predecessor. Aliyev is endeavoring--and he will continue this policy--to wrest the foreign policy initiative from Yerevan, drawing closer to Russia--and Azerbaijan's return to the CIS was a feature of this rapprochement. But the Azerbaijan leader's Russian partners asked, it would seem, too high a price for assistance to Baku, and for this reason Aliyev has had to make use of his long-standing contacts and the disagreements in the Russian leadership. It is possible that the fate of the Azerbaijan leader will depend, for all that, not on success at the negotiating table but on military victories, and the forces outside of Azerbaijan that would like to preserve Geydar Aliyev must make efforts for the appearance of such victories. Ter-Petrosyan The Armenian president remains today the sole leader throughout the post-Soviet space (not counting Estonia and, to some extent, Latvia) who was able to come to power from an informal democratic structure and, in addition, to keep his office and remain quite an authoritative leader, albeit one who has been experiencing certain difficulties as of late. This may to some extent be explained by the dire situation in which warring Armenia has found itself (but this is at the same time fertile ground for a frequent change of leaders as well) and also, to some extent, by the economically powerful "power party" which has formed around the president, but mainly by the outstanding diplomatic talent of Ter-Petrosyan, who has been able to so correct the initially anti-Moscow course of Armenian geopolitical strategy that he has easily and imperceptibly made Armenia the main base of Russia's interests in the Transcaucasus region--a role that has subsequently and with less success been sought by the Shevardnadze-headed Georgia and the Aliyev-led Azerbaijan. It was this policy that enabled Yerevan to change the correlation of forces in the Karabakh conflict (and there was simultaneously a change of power in Baku also, which reduced somewhat Turkey's influence on the situation in the region) and which at the same time has not in the least prevented constitutional development in Armenia--a country divided by borders. Of course, this successful conduct of foreign policy matters is smoothing over somewhat in the eyes of the public the economic disarray--it is usually ascribed to circumstances, not the president. But Levon Ter-Petrosyan will soon once again be encountering a situation where Russia is attempting to help both Armenia and Azerbaijan. And all too much here will depend on Yerevan itself, its economic and military potential, and the level of its influence on the leadership of Russia. Snegur Like many other former Soviet republics, Moldova was faced with the threat of a paralysis of power, which led to the announcement of early parliamentary elections. Under these conditions President Mircea Snegur, whose positions had been somewhat shaken, once again becomes the sole realistic guarantor not only of the continuity of power but also of the state integrity of Moldova: In any event, the presidential elections were held on a larger territory than that on which the parliamentary elections will be held. In addition, for the first time the president of Moldova, Mircea Snegur, was elected by a parliament representing the entire population of the republic, which is today in fact divided into three parts. The president's position is being improved also by the radicals from the Christian Democratic People's Front of Moldova demanding the republic's immediate affiliation to Romania. Thus Snegur occupies a certain intermediate, even center, position between the radicals in Chisinau and the separatist leaders in Tiraspol justifying the preservation of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldavian Republic on territory controlled by Russian troops by the possibility of affiliation to Romania. But after the parliamentary elections, the president's positions could once again be in jeopardy: The new corps of deputies could perfectly well nominate from their ranks politicians who cleave to views similar to his, but who are not burdened by the legacy of confrontation with the rebellious regions of the republic. The return to Moldova's political life of its former leader Petru Lucinschi, who was elected chairman of the republic's parliament, is the best example of this. The president of Moldova's chance of retaining his authority will depend directly on a settlement of the Dniester conflict, which, in turn, will depend on relations with Russia and Moldova's role in the CIS (although the republic's parliament has yet to ratify the agreement on the formation of the Commonwealth, and this will have to be done by the new corps of deputies: Chisinau is meanwhile occupying a cautious-neutral position in relation to the CIS structures). It should be recalled also that the situation in Moldova and the possibilities of President Snegur have been influenced as of late by a new, "extra-Commonwealth" factor too: Moscow's search for "new old" spheres of influence in East Europe could force the Russian leaders to decide on certain concessions to Romania--and one such concession could be a Dniester settlement. Niyazov Undisputed diplomatic talent and an ability to sensitively catch current political winds helped the president of Turkmenistan not only establish full and uncontested control over the republic--none of his CIS colleagues can rival the extent of his powers, and even the highest representative body is essentially appointed by Niyazov--but also to mothball social and political processes in Turkmenistan, preventing not Kyrgyz pluralism but even the Uzbek "representative" opposition. Turkmenistan has remained the sole former Soviet republic that has no opposition (except, perhaps, at the "dissident" level of the 1970's) and where the population might think that the president has succeeded by way of the abandonment of "democratic experiments" in securing for Turkmenistan political and economic stability expressed in control over social life and the preservation of the ration-card distribution of basic necessities. The niche of communist ideology was rapidly occupied by the "ideology of presidential authority": Niyazov is called Turkmenbashi, "Father of the Turkmen," and monuments to and large-scale portraits of the president, after whom the city formerly called Krasnovodsk, streets, schools, agricultural enterprises, and plants have been named, have appeared throughout the republic. The president's contributions and the nationwide love for him are reported daily by the Turkmen press and Turkmenistan radio and television. Saparmurad Niyazov is, meanwhile, making skillful use of the attraction not only of his own population but of the leadership of Russia also to stability: While remaining at a distance from the CIS and not participating in the work of a number of structures of the Commonwealth, Turkmenistan nonetheless maintains a special relationship with Russia and was even the first former Soviet republic to which President Yeltsin paid an official visit. Strict control over the republic is permitting President Niyazov to easily consent to Russian initiatives which could prove dangerous and even insulting to his president colleagues who do not have such command over the wishes of each citizen of theirs: Thus Turkmenistan is as yet the sole republic of the former Union to have signed a dual-citizenship agreement with Russia. At the same time Niyazov is actively seeking alternative paths for economic development outside of the CIS, endeavoring to develop contacts with Turkmenistan's neighbors in the East. But the absence of serious economic reforms preventing real use being made of the profits from the sale of natural gas could make the Turkmen leadership more dependent on Russia than President Niyazov would like. Akayev Of all the presidents of countries of the Central Asia region, Askar Akayev is as yet in the most difficult and vulnerable position. A former president of the republic's Academy of Sciences, who became head of Kyrgyzstan in defiance, seemingly, of the logic of the development of the region (and, possibly, thanks also to the weakness of the then leadership headed by Absamat Masaliyev), Akayev simply had to come across as a supporter of an approach--pluralist--to the relations of power and society which was entirely different from that of neighboring countries. At the same time a hierarchy of regional elites traditional for Central Asia has been preserved in Kyrgyzstan, the Communist Party, which was banned earlier, has been revived, and a profound crisis has been observed within the power party itself, which has been expressed, in particular, in a change of prime minister of the republic and the resignation of Vice President Feliks Kulov, one of the country's most popular politicians. Askar Akayev's decision to hold a referendum on confidence in the president testifies to a desire for a radical solution of this crisis. But even should Akayev succeed, it will hardly be possible to get through the period of economic difficulties without recourse, if not to authoritarian methods of government, then at least to elements of an authoritarian approach. Specially since the cooling in relations between Moscow and Almaty is creating additional difficulties for Bishkek, which has traditionally been oriented toward these two capitals, and making Akayev even more dependent on the development trends of the countries of Central Asia. Rakhmonov Emomali Rakhmonov, chairman of the Supreme Council of Tajikistan, can hardly look forward to a lengthy political biography. And it is not only a question here of the traditions of the new Tajikistan, which has already replaced several leaders, as of the nonindependence of the accession to power of Emomali Rakhmonov, which was a consequence of the bloody civil war and the manifest interest of a whole number of outside forces in such an outcome. But Rakhmonov is opposed not only by members of the opposition whom he vanquished but has not subjugated and who are being held in check thus far by the presence in Tajikistan and on its borders of the Russian Army. Profound contradictions are lacerating also the "party of victors" itself, which has proven to be extremely heterogeneous. Initially the nomenklatura from Leninabad and Kulyab, which had returned to power, tried to get rid of the field commanders who aspired to command it: The culmination of this termination of combatants who had played their part was the surprise death of Sangak Safarov, leader of the People's Front and former criminal. The new round of contradictions--between representatives of Leninabad, who had traditionally governed in Soviet Tajikistan, and the new leaders from Kulyab, whose protege Rakhmonov is--ended in the dismissal of the experienced Leninabader premier Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov. But a further strengthening of the Kulyabis is fraught with the danger of a new blowup of the situation in the republic, a change in the correlation of political forces, and even the loss of some of the outside support essential to the present bosses of Dushanbe. Because there has once again come to be a Leninabader in the premier's chair, and for this reason Emomali Rakhmonov, the leader of a country with a paralyzed economy, finances controlled by the central component of Russia, and an army subordinate to Moscow, can hardly feel confident. Such, in brief, might be notes in the margins of the political biographies of the people today determining the development of the situation in the former Soviet republics. Of course, it is impossible to encompass the entire post-Union space, it has both "external" and "internal" dimensions incorporating, in addition, a whole number of leaders also. The "external" dimension means the leaders of the Baltic countries, which have already distanced themselves from their Union neighbors: Algirdas Brazauskas, Guntis Ulmanis and Valdis Birkavs, and Lennart Meri and Mart Laar. It means the leaders of self-proclaimed formations, by no means neophytes on the post-Soviet political stage, such as the leaders of Karabakh, Igor Smirnov, president of the Dniester region, or Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the parliament of Abkhazia, and Torez Kulumbegov, head of South Ossetia. We could also recall here Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, but we would hereby be moving not only toward the borders of Russia but also toward the boundaries of the "internal" dimension: the leaders of the Russian republics that participated in the work of Gorbachev's Federation Council have been eliminated from activity in the CIS. But the role of these leaders in the political life of Russia has by no means diminished but has, rather, increased since that time. Today their activity--that of the presidents of Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev, Bashkortostan, Murtaza Rakhimov, Yakutia, Mikhail Nikolayev, Chuvashia, Nikolay Fedorov, Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, Kabardino-Balkaria, Valeriy Kokov, and Mari El, Valeriy Zotin, the chairmen of the parliaments of Karelia, Viktor Stepanov, and Mordvinia, Nikolay Biryukov, the president of North Ossetia, Anarbek Galazov, and others--requires a separate publication. And this is characteristic not only of Russia, incidentally. It is sufficient to recall, for example, Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of the Crimean Parliament, or Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the parliament of Ajaria, and the role performed in the life of Azerbaijan by its present president Geydar Aliyev in the office of chairman of the parliament of Nakhichevan in order to see how multidimensional is the process of disintegration of the Soviet Union and to see for oneself the incompleteness of this process. But we will meanwhile plot the present situation recorded recently by the 12 portraits hung outside the residence of the president of Turkmenistan.
