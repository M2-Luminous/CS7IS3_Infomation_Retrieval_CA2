Speaking at the 50th session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, Choegyal, who himself is a Tibetan, said a delegate of the non-governmental organization, using rumours which he himself admitted were unconfirmed, launched an unbridled attack against China over its human rights records in the region of Tibet. "In fact, he is not concerned about human rights, his real motive is to use the human rights issue for dividing China," Choegyal said. "As a Tibetan, I have experienced decades of historic changes since the liberation of Tibet. We are best qualified to comment on the situation of human rights in Tibet," Choegyal added. He said that since the peaceful liberation, particularly after the democratic reform in 1959, the situation of human rights of the Tibetan people has changed radically. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region, there have been great economic and social progress and visible improvement of people's living standards, with traditional customs being respected and religious freedom being protected, Cheogyal said. He said the Tibetan people are wholeheartedly supporting all policies of the central government for Tibet, especially those designed specially for the region in the past decade. They feel from their own experiences that the past few decades have been the best period in terms of the situation of their human rights, Cheogyal said. He noted that the speech delivered by the non-governmental organization delegate "is full of distortion and fabrication." Choegyal said, "the situation in Tibet today is known to everybody, and one can see the overall and real situation there as long as he holds a just position." He said that in 1993 alone, government officials, parliamentarians, diplomats and journalists from 24 countries visited Tibet, in addition to about 10,000 tourists from around the world.
