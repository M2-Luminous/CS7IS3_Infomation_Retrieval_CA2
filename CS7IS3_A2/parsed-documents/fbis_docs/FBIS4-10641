At the same time he took advantage of the occasion to warn that a similar fate could affect the autonomy of universities and state governments. The president, who was an honored guest at the anniversary ceremony held on 5 March at the offices of the National Agrarian Institute, stated that so noble an institution as the agrarian reform, which was promulgated on 5 March 1960, should be preserved and its name should cease being something which is "taboo." He said that, in his view agrarian reform is now, according to a substantial number of Venezuelans, the origin of a process of "parceling out production funds to the political leaders of groups of farmers who exploited their lands and then left them in an abandoned and depressed state. They let them go, so that, finally, they fell into the hands of those who were prepared to work them and make them fruitful. They were therefore violating the provisions, limits, and principles set down in the law itself." In the president's view that irreversible process can happen to university autonomy in Venezuela which, "in the view of large numbers of people, is nothing more than a symbol for disorder, conflict, class suspensions, and a low return in educational activity." He extended his warning to "such an important institution as the autonomy of state governments (which) runs the risk of becoming a roadway for regional dictators and for the degeneration of the fundamental, necessary, and creative sense of our Venezuelan fatherland." He observed that in view of the low opinion which agrarian reform has he has decided to suggest to Minister of Agriculture Ciro Anez Fonseca an addition to or even a change in that name, using such terms as "rural, democratic solidarity," "democratic solidarity in the countryside," "agricultural solidarity," "productive solidarity," etc. However, he emphasized that the most important aspect is that the institution of agrarian reform should move forward, "With the conviction that the fight to rescue agriculture in Venezuela is an essential element, without which we could not offer to new generations of our people the security of a firm and solid economy and a country which enjoys its human rights and social peace in security. This is essential to conquer the future." Also participating in the day's program, in addition to the chief of state and the minister of agriculture and animal husbandry, were Isabel Urbano, president of the IAN [National Agrarian Institute], and delegates from farmers' and production associations. On the same occasion the president pointed out that democracy must confront in real terms the subject of land ownership and access to it by peasant farmers. He referred to the problem of communities of indigenous people, stating that these groups should be provided with help to guarantee their natural habitat. At the same time they should be given suitable assistance to ensure their progress as citizens of the fatherland. The president said: "I am committed to achieving an environment of peace, justice, equity, understanding, and harmony in the countryside, between capitalist enterprise which is beginning to emerge in many areas and the people who have a right to the land which they work." He said that he was convinced that, "The bad name of the agrarian reform" has distorted the views of many people. He invited his listeners to read Chapter 7 of the book, El Caso Venezuela, una Ilusion de Armonia [The Case of Venezuela, an Illusion of Harmony], published by the IESA [Institute of Higher Education for Administration]. In this book, he said, the view that the agrarian reform law has been the factor responsible for the crisis in the agricultural sector is proved to be false. Meanwhile Ciro Anez Fonseca, the minister of agriculture and animal husbandry, stated that the problem of refinancing the private agricultural debt, estimated at 40 billion bolivares, has been definitively resolved. He said: "Now there is no need for concern about that problem. The banks are accepting a new way of treating customers who are behind in their payments, and there is no reason for anything but the optimism of 1994." He explained that, in the first place, financial institutions have committed themselves to giving special treatment to customers in the agricultural sector who are behind in the repayment of their loans. He indicated that in addition to this there is a formula which the government is developing which has the objective of providing the banking sector with the necessary resources to compensate for these delays in the repayment of loans. He referred to the recently established commission for the evaluation of agrarian reform, which Victor Gimenez Landinez will head, as the instrument for providing a new start to the Law on Agrarian Reform, making use of the economic and social development of the country.
