The attacks and crimes of the Serbian forces were condemned and it was announced that the UN Security Council and countries that had given the aggressors a free hand by their indifference shared the blame for this immense human tragedy. It was stressed in the meeting that, in view of the lack of seriousness shown by the United Nations and NATO regarding the defense of regions which had been declared as safe havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina, our country's Foreign Ministry should act with even greater resolve towards strengthening the effective cooperation between Islamic countries with a view to lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia. It was also decided that the government would set about gathering extensive relief aid to help the defenseless people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In view of the guidance issued by the eminent leader [Khamene'i], the constructive role that could be played by peacekeeping forces from Islamic countries in Bosnia-Herzegovina was also underlined.
