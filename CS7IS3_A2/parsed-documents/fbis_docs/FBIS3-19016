In political terms, the traffic lights on the road to a common Europe have been showing "green" for Austria since 1 March. "I am going on the assumption," Mock said, "that in the next few days it will be possible to formalize the membership negotiations." In their statements Vranitzky and Mock briefed the Bundesrat about the conclusion of the negotiations about Austria's EU membership. For Vranitzky the result of the negotiations is "certainly something that can be shown proudly" at home and abroad. He stressed that during the intensive discussions over the next weeks and months until the referendum, it will also be pointed out "that in some small, definable fields it will be necessary to make adjustments." Some people see this as a disadvantage. However, with a view to safeguarding the future, this is not a disadvantage. Vranitzky also pointed out that our eastern neighboring countries are already "knocking" on the EU's door. This refutes the argument that Austria wants to join a European "fortress." The EU is not a "fortress" but the "core" of the process of European unification. The foreign minister, too, stressed that "we have achieved an overall result that we can present to the Austrian people for the referendum with a clear conscience." The result of the negotiations shows "that we are moving along the path toward a common Europe with self-confidence." Austria now has the opportunity to join an EU in which peace and security are not empty utopias and which offers the concrete hope that national wars between its members will become impossible. "We simply must not miss the historic opportunity to belong to such a union," Mock stressed. At a press conference on Thursday Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer cited three constitutional requirements for joining the EU, which is to form the basis for the EU referendum. The law is to contain a "clear constitutional authorization" for the state organs to ratify the EU accession. Furthermore, it is to facilitate a clear yes or no in the referendum and to define the contents of the EU treaty exactly. As a date for the referendum, 12 June has "great appeal" for Fischer, because that is the day on which the elections to the European Parliament will be held. However, the deadlines for 12 June are very tight and thus 19 June is more likely. According to Fischer the Federal Constitutional Law on joining the EU is to be brief and precise. A clear definition of the contents of the treaty will render it legally impossible for any kind of changes are made in the text of the treaty after the referendum. Fischer called the accusation by Freedom Party of Austria Chairman Joerg Haider that the government might present a "fraudulent package" as a "politically unfair insinuation." [passage omitted] Heinz Fischer also commented on the internal EU discussion about the question of the blocking minority for votes in the Nationalrat of the expanded EU. Since it is, in particular, Spain that is blocking a decision on this issue, Fischer appealed to those responsible in Madrid not to turn this problem into a stumbling block for the accession of strong new members, which is also very important for the EU. Fischer expressed optimism that this conflict will be solved in time so that the EU schedule will not be endangered. [passage omitted]
