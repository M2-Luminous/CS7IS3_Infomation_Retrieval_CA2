He told a press conference in Minsk that this could be seen from the wide gap between the 45.1 percent he had scored and the 17.4 percent of the votes scored by Prime Minister Kebich. He announced, however, that he would not remove all of the current Cabinet members from their posts, if he won. According to unofficial sources, Lukashenko is planning to offer the post of prime minister to the current Economics Minister Sergey Ling. Lukashenko's proxy, Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission for Legislation Dmitriy Bulakhov, refused to comment on the rumors about ballot rigging (according to which Lukashenko scored 56 percent, not 45.1 percent of the votes, which would have meant his complete victory - Interfax). He also said that it was senseless to cast doubts on the Central Electoral Commission's official reports, because he was confident in Lukashenko's victory during the second round. According to Interfax sources, Lukashenko's and Kebich's teams are holding consultations with Zenon Poznyak, Stanislav Shushkevich, Aleksandr Dubko and Vassiliy Novikov, who lost the first round. Viktor Ivashkevich, the proxy of leader of the People's Front, said that Poznyak would not to go to the polling station on the day of the second round. He also quoted Poznyak as saying that the people had voted against the old system, but failed to voice their support for the creation of a new one. He announced that the leaders of the Belarusian People's Front would meet on Saturday to decide which candidate to support during the second round and whether to support anyone at all. Sushkevich refused to comment on the current political situation. Asked which candidate he would support, he said that none of the first round wwinners had any scientifically substantiated economic program. (Shortly, Shushkevich is planning to set out for a tour of European countries, where he will give a series of lectures at local universities - Interfax). Vassily Novikov and Aleksandr Dubko have not yet decided whom to support during the second round. At the end of the week, the Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party is to hold a plenary meeting to determine the party's position on the elections. A spokesman for the Council of Collective Farms told Interfax that Aleksandr Dubko was abroad and that in his absence the agrarians could not decide whom to support during the second round.
