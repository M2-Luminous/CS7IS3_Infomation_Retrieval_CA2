The SVT, headed by Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, wanted to nominate another candidate followed the death of Home Affairs Minister Ratu William Toganivalu during the period allowed for objections. However, Tuivaga rejected the application for an injunction on the grounds that Toganivalu had died during this period and his nomination papers had become irrelevant in the election for Tailevu. Toganivalu had been replaced by a close associate who had entered the election as an independent. Meantime, election officials said they were concerned by what is considered here to be a low voter turnout at the start of Fiji's week-long general election, particularly in Suva. They reported that in some areas turnout was down to between 60 and 70 percent. "We have given the snap general election a lot of publicity but people have not been turning up to vote since we began last Friday," an election official said. "It's now up to election candidates to provide transport for their supporters and take them to their respective polling stations," he said. Polling has been quiet and incident-free.
