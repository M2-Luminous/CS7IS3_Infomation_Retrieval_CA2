Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports that the prime minister has not yet officially ordered Rothschild to travel to Washington next week because he does not see a need to resume the talks on the Palestinian track in Washington while no progress is being made in Taba. Rothschild was appointed after the Americans yesterday made clear to Rabin that they will send invitations to the Palestinians as well, and suggested that Nabil Sha'th and Amnon Shahaq also come to Washington. Jerusalem, however, does not wish to harm the Taba talks, which are not linked with the Washington talks. Rothschild was appointed acting head because the decision on who is to head the delegation to Washington has not been made yet.
