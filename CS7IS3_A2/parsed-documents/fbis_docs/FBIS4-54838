I wish to say that Kosovo is part of Serbia and we do not believe that the borders should be changed. We also think that there is no need for an independent state on the territory of Kosovo, Douglas Hogg told journalists, following his talks with Milos Savovic, governor [nacelnik] of the Kosovo district. The main tasks are to find ways of implementing the political, cultural, and civil rights of the Albanian community in Kosovo and to allow the Albanians to play a full role in political and administrative life, Hogg said. The British minister of state continued his visit by talking to ethnic Albanian representatives in Pristina.
