FR941212-0-00050 FR941212-0-00015 73. Ordinarily carriers decide, in the first instance, whether to include in their direct cost studies any categories of costs (investment and expenses) in addition to primary plant. For video dialtone, however, we direct carriers to treat costs in other accounts as direct costs if those costs are reasonably identifiable as incremental costs of video dialtone service. Examples of accounts that might include reasonably identifiable incremental costs of video dialtone are those to which carriers book costs associated with land, buildings, network administration, testing, engineering, plant operations administration, product management, sales, advertising, customer services, and legal. 74. For purposes of the new services test, all costs not treated as direct costs are classified as overheads. Carriers bear the burden of justifying why their overhead loadings do not produce a final rate that is unreasonably high. As with shared plant, we will also require a strong justification for allocation of extremely low overheads to video dialtone service, and would not anticipate accepting a 0% allocation of overhead as reasonable. At the same time, we emphasize that we are not seeking to saddle video dialtone with an unreasonable proportion of overheads and other common costs. We hope and expect that video dialtone will be a successful service in the marketplace, and therefore contribute to the recovery of common costs. We recognize that imposing excessive cost burdens on video dialtone could diminish demand and possibly overall revenues and thereby thwart these objectives. Accordingly, the effects of price changes on video dialtone demand should be given due consideration in determining what constitutes a reasonable allocation of common costs and overheads. In this regard, we will scrutinize the basis for claims and projections of demand elasticities submitted in support of proposed video dialtone rates. And, of course, our rules will provide interested parties ample opportunity to comment on these claims and projections. 75. In implementing this specific guidance, we direct the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to ensure that video dialtone carriers file all the information necessary for purposes of evaluating the costs of providing video dialtone service and the reasonableness of the proposed cost allocations and overhead loadings. We further direct the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to consider whether the Bureau should adopt specific minimum requirements, including the possible use of standardized formats, for the supporting documentation that video dialtone providers must furnish with their proposed tariffs. We note that the Bureau previously has adopted such requirements in connection with the LECs' annual access tariff filings, as well as tariffs filed to provide specific services, such as Open Network Architecture (ONA) and Expanded Interconnection services. The goal of any such requirements would be to make the review of video dialtone tariffs by the Bureau and interested members of the public more expeditious and less costly. In addition to making the tariff review process more accessible to interested parties, the establishment of minimum standard format and information requirements would facilitate their ability to participate in a meaningful way. 76. We tentatively conclude that a separate price cap basket for video dialtone would help prevent improper cross-subsidization by preventing local telephone companies from offsetting a price reduction for video dialtone service with an increase in rates for other regulated interstate services. However, it is not necessary to establish this basket now, on an interim basis. Because no tariffs for permanent video dialtone service have yet been filed, it is unlikely that any such tariff will go into effect prior to January 1, 1995. July 1, 1996 is thus the earliest date on which a video dialtone service could be included in a price cap index. We therefore will seek comment on establishing a separate price cap basket for video dialtone service in a supplemental notice in the LEC Price Cap Performance Review. 77. At this time we will not address the merits of whether basket-by-basket earnings calculation should be required. We recognize that investment in video dialtone facilities may generate costs that will have an impact on sharing. Issues regarding sharing, however, are being examined in the LEC Price Cap Performance Review. In the near term, we will continue to determine sharing and lower end adjustments on an overall interstate basis. I. Two-level Regulatory Framework and Application of Other Enhanced Service Safeguards 78. We now affirm our decision in the Second Report and Order, to adopt a two-level regulatory framework for video dialtone services and to require the BOCs and GTE to comply with our existing enhanced services safeguards. In adopting a two-level regulatory framework, we noted that this dichotomy tracks our existing regulatory framework for LEC basic and enhanced services. We do not think the public interest would be well-served by adopting a different set of rules for video dialtone services, particularly given that LECs will provide both video and non-video offerings through these systems. Moreover, the two-level framework should promote competition and broaden consumer choice. The level-one common carrier platform will enable multiple video service providers, for the first time, to obtain access on a nondiscriminatory basis to the basic network functions that will allow such service providers to distribute their services to consumers. Requiring LECs to offer nonregulated services subject to existing safeguards for the provision of such services will help ensure that LECs are not able to compete unfairly with other enhanced service providers and that LECs cannot bundle enhanced and nonregulated services with basic services in order to impede competition.
