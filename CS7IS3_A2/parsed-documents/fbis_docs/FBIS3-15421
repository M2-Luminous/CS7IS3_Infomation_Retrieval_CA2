The Government expresses regret over the Estonian-Russian talks breaking off due to the Russian side's unconstructive behavior. The Russian side's attempt to back down on the agreed deadline for the troop withdrawal does not allow for the initialling of an already drafted troop withdrawal agreement. Russian insistence on additional conditions, including one on the Estonian Government having to pay the Russian Government $23 million, is in conflict with the international obligation which Russia has taken upon itself, which is to withdraw the troops from Estonia quickly, in an orderly manner, completely and unconditionally. The Government statement says that in this situation the Government of the Republic of Estonia protests against Russian attempts to destabilize the situation in the Baltic Sea region. The Government states once again that the Russian troops must be completely withdrawn from the territory of the Republic of Estonia by 31 August 1994 at the latest. The Government appeals to Russia to abandon its unconstructive attitude and continue talks; it proposes to Russia to hold consultations at a high political level. The Government of the Republic of Estonia reaffirms the existence of Estonian goodwill to continue talks in this situation.
