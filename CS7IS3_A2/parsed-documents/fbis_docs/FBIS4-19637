A 3-percent economic growth might be achieved in the United States this year, "relatively free of inflation," he said. But the U.S. Federal Reserve is worried about the stability of the dollar in 1995. Lambsdorff expects an increase in medium-term U.S. interest rates to prevent inflation. While satisfied with U.S. industrial policy, the FDP politician sharply criticized Washington's trade and foreign policy. The U.S. trend toward bilateral trade agreements is bad news not only for Japan, Europe, and the developing countries, but also for entire world trade, said Lambsdorff. He said he hoped Washington would adhere to the GATT rules agreed upon in Marrakesh last week. In U.S. foreign policy, Lambsdorff fails to see not only a clear line, but also persons who could develop such a line. In this connection, he described the challenge posed by North Korea as the greatest problem. "North Korea is not of sound mind," he said. Lambsdorff returned from Tokyo with the realization that Japan is strengthening its investment efforts in Asia. Because Japanese exports are no longer so dependent on the U.S. market as they used to be, Japan is no longer so submissive in the trade dispute with Washington. Although German industry has "missed" the economic growth in Asia, Lambsdorff says "there is a chance for us if we involve ourselves there seriously." This chance is mainly the result of the fact that not all Asian countries are happy about the economic expansion of the Japanese there.
