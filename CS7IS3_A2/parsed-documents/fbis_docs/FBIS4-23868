FBIS4-23868 "drafr117_c_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-117 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 17 Jun South African Press Review for 17 Jun MB1706142094 MB1706142094 BFN [Editorial Report] WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Defense Minister's Actions -- The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English uses its editorial on page 30 of its 17-23 June issue to draw conclusions from Defense Minister Joe Modise's recent attempts to interdict a WEEKLY MAIL report. The first conclusion is that military intelligence "is riddled with some of the country's most unsavoury characters" and that change in the military must start with "the exposure of their past so that these operations can be cleaned up and put on a new footing." A second conclusion is that Modise "is going to have to assert his civilian authority and end his reliance on advice and information from the defence force chiefs." The editorial also notes that the episode shows the danger that some politicians and members of the new government may be subject to pressure from the military, which has been collecting "dirt" on them for many years. "This provides a strong argument for a Truth Commission that forces into the open any information which may compromise individuals and institutions." The editorial concludes with the argument that "these events should make us less complacent about allowing old censorship laws to remain on the statute books.... Reform of these laws is a matter of urgency." NEW NATION Steyn Report on Intelligence Activities -- "An intriguing and worrying web of secrecy is being spun around the investigation conducted by General Pierre Steyn into the activities of the SADF's [South African Defense Force] military intelligence arm, the Directorate of Covert Collection." So begins an editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 17 June. The editorial says it does not understand why the whereabouts of the report should be kept secret. "This week it was almost impossible to establish for sure whether in fact a written report exists at all. Former president FW de Klerk's office tells us it certainly does not exist. It was an internal investigation that did not warrant a written report, he said." The editorial goes on to note that "it is almost 18 months since General Steyn completed his investigations. And there has yet been no finding one way or another on the contents of the report. Neither the police nor the Attorney-General has commented on its contents -- whether it contained baseless allegations or whether it added weight to suspicions about third force violence....It is about time we are told where investigations are -- whether they have ceased or whether they are still continuing. Without openness and transparency in matters such as these, there can be no basis for reconciliation." BUSINESS DAY New Homeland Council -- An editorial in the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 17 May considers the establishment of a homeland council: "The establishment of a Volksstaatraad [homeland council] and the presence of First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki as a speaker at its inauguration in Pretoria's Ou Radsaal yesterday were an encouraging sign that South Africans are beginning to come to terms with their diversity....The ANC, in going along with the Volkstaat council idea, might be stalling for time in the hope that fears and prejudices will abate as the country prospers. Mbeki played his part yesterday in a generous acknowledgement of Afrikaners' patriotism. Such conciliatory gestures could bear fruit while the council searches for a formula to provide some sort of Afrikaner autonomy that would not compromise the integrity of the South African state." SOWETAN 16 June Holiday -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English in an editorial on page 10 on 17 June argues that "June 16, 1976, taking everything into account, should be a public holiday....The sad truth is that whether you were the oppressor or the oppressed, this day affected all of us in the same drama-filled fashion. Its effects will also not disappear because they are part of South Africa's history." The editorial concludes by saying that although the current period of transition may not be the right one in which to declare the day a holiday, "any incumbent regime must be convinced that June 16, 1976, was a turning point in the history of South Africa" Fuel Price Increase -- "The remarkable thing about this week's petrol price increase is the equanimity with which it has been accepted by all," begins another editorial on the same page of the SOWETAN. "The question remains: Who is taking up the cudgels on behalf of the working people and consumers who will bear the brunt of the increase?" BEELD Mandela's OAU Speech Praised -- A "new voice...on behalf of Africa" is how the editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 15 June sums up President Mandela's recent speech at the Organization of African Unity summit in Tunis. "It is a voice that puts forward Africa's case to the world, but also one that castigates and speaks candidly about the continent's glaring offenses and shortcomings." It is a long time, says BEELD, since someone directed such a frank address to the continent as when Mandela said there is nothing wrong with the people of Africa, but with its their leaders. "In Mr. Mandela, Africa has a leader with stature, one who is governing the country with a potential for success. This new situation could indeed become the catalyst to reverse Africa's image as a marginalized continent which risks being written off." South Africa, therefore, will have to prove that it will not end up the same way as so many African countries have. "To set that example to Africa presents an exceptional opportunity to every South African." Right-Wing Politics -- Another editorial on the same page of the paper notes: "The latest dispute between the Freedom Front and the Conservative Party [CP] over the manner of negotiations for an Afrikaner homeland [volkstaat] comes as no surprise. The agreement before the election on establishing a volkstaat council -- entrenched in the Constitution -- has been one of the most significant breakthroughs which made the participation of the Freedom Front in the election and in the constituent assembly possible. On that basis the majority of right wingers rejected the CP and voted for the Freedom Front, giving General Constand Viljoen a mandate to bargain for a volkstaat through a volkstaat council. Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and the non-democratic diehards again want to hijack the negotiation process -- spurred on by the unfortunate kiss of life given to them by President Nelson Mandela....The rejected CP leaders should not be allowed to hijack the negotiation process for their own racist, political gain." PWV Premier Praised -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans publishes an editorial on page on 14 June that says: "Since becoming premier of the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging [PWV] province six weeks ago, Mr. Tokyo Sexwale has not made one wrong step. He has not been put off by the fact that his government has no budget and fundamental executive powers. Especially impressive was his action last week at Modderbee Prison when he went in alone to negotiate with the rioting prisoners.... During the past weekend Mr. Sexwale, in shirt sleeves and no tie, paid a second visit to the violence ravaged East Rand residential area. He is on the right track; he must keep it up."
