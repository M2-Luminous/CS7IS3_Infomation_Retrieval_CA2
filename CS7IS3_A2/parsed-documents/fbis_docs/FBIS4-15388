Marat Guriyev was appointed the head of the new information-technical centre. The decision came one day after a scandal caused by a resolution of the president which mentioned Latvia among possible countries where Russia intends to have its military bases. Presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov explained on Thursday that Latvia was mentioned in the document because of a "technical mistake". However, a source in the presidential administration told TASS the restructuring was not linked with the "technical mistake" and was a planned reorganisation. The source added that Guriyev's appointment was a promotion. Yeltsin also dissolved his analytical centre for general policy and the analytical centre for social-economic policy.
