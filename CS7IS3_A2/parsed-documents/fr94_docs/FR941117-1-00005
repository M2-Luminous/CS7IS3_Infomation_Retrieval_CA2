FR941117-1-00005 FR941117-1-00002 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 2 [ET Docket No. 94&hyph;32; FCC No. 94&hyph;272] Spectrum Below 5 GHz Transferred From Federal Government Use AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rule Making. SUMMARY: This Notice proposes allocations for 50 megahertz of spectrum that is being transferred from Federal Government use to private sector use. This action is necessary to comply with provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Reconciliation Act) that require the Commission to allocate, and propose regulations to assign, this spectrum within 18 months of adoption of the Reconciliation Act. Our goal in this proceeding is to ensure that spectrum reallocated for private sector is put to its highest and most valued use and that the greatest benefit to the public is attained. DATES: Comments must be filed on or before December 19, 1994, and reply comments must be filed on or before January 3, 1995. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M St., NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Sharkey, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;8151. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making, PR Docket No. 94&hyph;32, FCC No. 94&hyph;272, Adopted October 20, 1994, and released November 8, 1994.

Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM). 1. The purpose of this NPRM is to propose allocations for 50 megahertz of spectrum that is being transferred from Federal Government to private sector use as required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;66, Title VI, Section 6001(a)(3), 107 Stat. 312 (approved August 10, 1993) (Reconciliation Act). 2. In compliance with the provision of the Reconciliation Act, the Department of Commerce released a report on February 10, 1994, which made a preliminary identification of 200 megahertz of spectrum for reallocation from Federal Government to private sector use, including 50 megahertz at 2390&hyph;2400 MHz, 2402&hyph;2417 MHz, and 4660&hyph;4685 MHz identified for immediate availability. The Reconciliation Act requires that, by February 10, 1995, the Commission allocate, and propose regulations to assign, the 50 megahertz of spectrum that is immediately available. On May 4, 1994 we released a Notice of Inquiry, 59 FR 25589 (5/17/94), in this proceeding to seek information on potential uses for the spectrum that is immediately available. 3. The instant NPRM proposes that all 50 megahertz of immediately available spectrum be allocated generally for Fixed and Mobile services. Such a broad and general allocation will allow for flexible use of the spectrum and should ensure that the spectrum is put to its best and most valued use. We also believe that most of the services that will be provided in this spectrum will likely meet the statutory criteria for auction and therefore propose that licenses for this spectrum be made available through competitive bidding. 4. We wish to create a competitive market structure that will provide incentives to develop and introduce innovative service features and technologies. Comments are requested on a licensing structure that will achieve such a result, including channel block size and geographic licensing areas. We also propose that technical flexibility in the provision of services be permitted and request comment on specific technical requirements necessary to maximize flexibility while ensuring against interference. 5. As an alternative to allocating this spectrum generally for Fixed and Mobile service, we request comment on the possible allocation of these bands for specific communications services. A number of suggestions were put forth by various commenters responding to the Notice of Inquiry in this proceeding. These include an aeronautical audio/visual service to provide real time information and entertainment aboard aircraft, wireless local loop service, broadcast auxiliary services to support advanced television, low-power communications, either on a licensed or unlicensed basis, and continued use of some of this spectrum by the amateur community.
