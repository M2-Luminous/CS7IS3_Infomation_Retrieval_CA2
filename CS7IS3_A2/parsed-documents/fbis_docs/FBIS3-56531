Landsbergis urged the Lithuanian officials to show solidarity with Latvia by making public statements, because of late Latvia has become an object of repeated attacks by the Russian imperial forces. Because of the circumstances which had developed, Latvia is now the weakest link among the Baltic states. Having failed to subordinate the entire region, Russia is making efforts to split it by first of all becoming firmly established in Latvia and later perhaps even to annex it, Landsbergis said at his press conference. Such a split in the strategic unity of the Baltic states would also weaken Lithuania's security, he stressed. According to Landsbergis, Lithuania should draw the attention of international organizations, states, and heads of state to the dangerous tendencies in Russia's policy towards Latvia. Several points in this policy were singled out by the leader of the opposition. First of all, this is most vividly manifested by the delay and by the ever increasing conditions for the withdrawal of the occupational troops from Latvia. Efforts are made in order that some units of these troops would remain deployed there. Another vivid feature of the aforementioned policy is the allegedly existing problem to protect the Russian-speaking population. Even the President of the United States, who agreed to see that they were not discriminated against, has been drawn into this propaganda network. The situation is being depicted in such a way as though the Russians in Latvia were a historically established minority the discrimination against whom had currently begun, Landsbergis said, at the same time drawing the attention to the fact that this type of propoganda was also a warning to Lithuania. According to Landsbergis, the Russian foreign minister accuses Latvia and Estonia of being aggressive towards Russia which is exactly what Russia itself is doing. In this way attempts are made to establish firmly the right of force which Russia was ready to use during the incident with its generals. According to Landsbergis, the incident itself was inspired in an attempt to compromise the volunteer force. It seems that a the Russian military intelligence has been entrusted with a task to destroy the volunteer force in the Baltic states, he stressed. In turn, Landsbergis said, the Latvian Government is also making concessions to the imperial designs of Russia. According to him, the former stance adopted by the government was more resolute. Probably Latvia has realized that it cannot expect support from the West. Unfortunately, in this case we are becoming very much like the West, Landsbergis, leader of the Motherland's Union - Lithuanian Conservatives, stressed in today's a press conference.
