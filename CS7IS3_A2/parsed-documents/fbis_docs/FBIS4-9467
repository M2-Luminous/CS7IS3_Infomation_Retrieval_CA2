The National Power Distribution Centre limited power supplies to industrial enterpises. Power is being imported from the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary as of Monday. The chairman of the Solidarity national commission of hard coal mining said in Katowice on Monday that "a rotation protest action will start in hard coal mines on Monday night and will be staged until further notice." Andrzej Dobroczek of the National Power Distribution Centre said Monday that the strike by hard coal miners would not disturb the production of electric power, at least for some time, as power plants had stocked enough coal. In a letter sent Monday to Waldemar Pawlak, the national protest committee of lignite mines charged the prime minister with responsibility for Poland's security in the field of power reserves. The committee expects the prime minister to immediately revoke a decision of Industry Minister Marek Pol on transformations in lignite mines. The unionists also recognized that further correspondence with Industry Minister Marek Pol is useless. "Even if the government withdraws or annuls the decision concerning transformations in lignite mining, the Solidarity protest committee of lignite mines will not end the strike but only suspend it," Jozef Polkowski, a member of the strike committee, told a press conference at the Belchatow mine on Monday. This would mean an increase of coal supplies to power plants which now receive only strategic amounts of fuel necessary to keep them going, he said and added that after the decision has been either suspended or annuled, the strike committee might start negotiations concerning nation-wide demands of the union. At a press conference on Monday afternoon, Minister Marek Pol said that he has been inviting the protesting unionists for talks with representatives of the government and employers for three days and that he has been waiting for a signal from them. He added that the ministry defined no pre-conditions and repeated that the validity of his decision concerning transformations in lignite industry expired at the moment he said it was suspended. The Solidarity Mazowsze region announced on Monday it would stage a strike in all enterprises of the region except for public sector and, perhaps, municipal enterprises on Thursday, Deputy Chairman of the Mazowsze Region Ewa Lewicka said Monday. Also "Sendzimir" steel works in Krakow announced a strike alert. Apart from the demand to halt transformations in the lignite industry the miners request that the government stop work on the new wage control law and immediately implement the "pact on state enterprise" and related laws.
