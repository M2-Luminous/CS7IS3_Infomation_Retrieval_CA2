The gist of it is that the entire geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union falls within Russia's sphere of vital interests. So that no one would have any doubt as to what was meant by vital interests, I drew a parallel with the Monroe Doctrine. To a certain extent an effort was made by me to formulate a Russian 'Monroe Doctrine' that would be applicable to the situation that has existed since the collapse of the Soviet Union." As you are aware, the Monroe Doctrine, which proclaimed the principle of "America for Americans," has often been used to justify flagrant U.S. intervention in the affairs of the other countries in the Americas and the imposition of dictates from Washington. Figuratively speaking, the doctrine could be termed an American version of the "Brezhnev Doctrine." A. Migranyan is incorrect in his presumption that he was the first to put forward the idea of applying the Monroe Doctrine to other circumstances, in this case Russia's. This was done by fascist Germany to justify its struggle for dominance over Europe. On 1 March 1940 Ribbentrop, speaking with Welles, the American president's personal representative, said: "Germany does not wish to have anything more in Europe than the United States has achieved in the Western Hemisphere with the aid of the Monroe Doctrine" (see: S. Welles, "A Time for Decision," New York, 1944, p 95). Hitler made a similar statement on 9 June 1940 in an interview intended for the American press. ("Monatshefte fuer auswaertige Politik," Berlin, 1944, p. 533). Thus a German "Monroe Doctrine" emerged at the height of Nazi Germany's struggle for the European continent. Now a Russian "Monroe Doctrine" is being imposed on us, but with the slight difference that its "applicability" is restricted to the scale of the former Soviet Union's geopolitical space. Of course, writers of newspaper articles and even presidential advisors are not making policy yet. It is a long way from an idea to its realization. But neither President B. Yeltsin nor minister of foreign affairs A. Kozyrev have distanced themselves from the aforementioned statement by A. Migranyan. Moreover, the Russian minister of foreign affairs himself supports the creation of a sphere of Russian vital interests in the geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union and maintenance of a Russian military presence there. Naturally that prompts some suspicion about whether today's Russia might not be heir to great power expansionism. It seems that first we created difficulties for ourselves by "destroying" the Soviet Union "to its very foundations" without any need to do so, and now we are beginning to overcome those difficulties, which have become a disaster, by reestablishing at the very least a "sphere of special interests" including Russia and the former Soviet -- and now sovereign --republics. Now it has become clear even to the uninformed how much more painless, simpler and more reasonable it would be to continue the gradual process of turning the country into a modern democratic community of states that was begun at Novo-Ogarevo. But thirst for power has dimmed the reason of politicians, and the worst has happened: a catastrophic collapse of the country, with the most severe consequences for its citizens. Now Zhirinovskiy and his ilk, demagogically playing on Russians' wounded sense of national pride, are threatening to restore the Soviet empire by force of arms. Attempts are even being made to provide a theoretical justification for the manifest destiny of Russian imperial policy. In the article "Imperial Russia Will Live Yet," Viktor Gushchin put it approximately like this: "Those who favored the dismantling of the Union, since they could not comprehend it before, are now compelled to admit that following the collapse of the USSR they will inevitably have in Russia an imperial "sovereign" in place of the "elder brother," with all the consequences that involves. Because Russia simply has no other means of self-determination in the current world structure. Its great power interests already extend too far (by virtue of objective reasons), and too many of its sources of life support (by virtue of the same reasons) now lie beyond Russia's national borders. In short, either imperial Russia or Russia's self-destruction" (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA , 17 September 1993). We should recall that Hitler convinced the Germans that a "people without space" and without possession of external sources of life support was doomed to perish. Under the slogan of winning that space for a "Greater Germany" he unleashed a world war and plunged the Germans into a national catastrophe. What actually happened was that the FRG, with only about one-half of Nazi Germany's territory and lacking its own natural resources to support it, became the leading industrial power in the world and gain a very high standard of living within four decades after the end of the war, thanks to an efficient economic system and a rational economic policy. Russia has incomparably greater opportunities to do so than Germany does. So why is it once again being prodded onto the fateful path of empire? It seems to me that the reason behind the resurrection of great power ways of a dubious nature lies not only with Russians' fractured national pride. A major role in this regard has been played by the collapse of Russia's economy and state structure, the corrupted morals of the political elite and society as a whole, the upsurge in crime and mafia penetration of every nook and cranny of the social organism, mafia plundering of the people's property, the transfusion of Russia's national wealth abroad and -- most important -- the impoverishment and profound disillusionment of the broad masses of the public with post-August reforms by the Yeltsin-Gaydar government. The country's difficult situation and misery are increasingly, and rightly so, associated in Russians' minds with that course and with the American advisors that are behind it. This has resulted in an increase in anti-Western, particularly anti-American, sentiments. The seeds of suspicion have been sown in people's minds: have American advisors intentionally been so persistent in imposing monetarist theory on the Russian Government as a basis for reform of the Russian economy, a theory which the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank officially rejected over a year ago as unfounded? Is this not a secret plot by the United States to destroy Russia's economic and scientific-technical potential, reduce it to the rank of a third-rate power and turn it into a vassal of American policy? The way post-August economic reforms have been carried out looks very irrational and not at all in line with Russian conditions. Of course, one could debate the motives behind official and unofficial Russia policy in the United States. This issue requires a very thorough treatment so that we will not, God forbid, go to extremes and subordinate our foreign policy to the wrong guidelines, as was the case in the past. Be that as it may, the fact remains: a new social and psychological atmosphere has emerged in this country as a result of the failures of the post-August course. Nationalistic great-power extremism from the left and the right has begun to feed parasitically -- and successfully -- on this new political and psychological situation. This turnabout in the country's political sentiments gave birth to the monstrous Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. Under pressure from the "great power" crowd, who have been making political hay off of anti-government discontent, Yeltsin's inner circle has been forced to restructure its policy, sharply increasing the nationalistic emphases therein and demonstrating with great diligence, appropriately and inappropriately, its enthusiasm for the traditional "special" national interests of Russia as a great power in the Eurasian space. Another important task facing the president's council is to dispel the impression of it, widely held by the Russian public, as blindly obedient to Western foreign policy, particularly American foreign policy, on many international issues. It is clear that even Washington has realized that the White House's focus exclusively on ordering Yeltsin around could turn against it if opinions such as these continue to win proponents in Russia and cause a further decline in the Russian president's approval rating and threaten his hold on power. In this regard money will not help. Intentional creation of friction in Russian-American relations and a slight reduction in their level would seem to be a more effective approach. Both sides' interests coincide on this point, and some reciprocal efforts have been observed. The NATO decision on the shelling of Sarajevo, which in and of itself looked like political and military insanity, since it would drag the West into a pointless war in Yugoslavia, was countered by Yeltsin's categorical: "We will not permit it!" Then came the sensational Ames case (involving the arrest of Russian spies in the United States), the arrest of an American spy in Russia, mutual expulsions of intelligence officers from Moscow and Washington, and finally Yeltsin's rude refusal to meet with ex-U.S. President Nixon. It remains a mystery what is the correlation in this shift by the president's inner circle toward great power politics between domestic power struggle considerations, on the one hand, and inherited great power aspirations, on the other. In any event, continuation and intensification of this practice will inevitably result in the vector of Russian foreign policy deviating substantially from the normal course that would be in keeping with its national interests, and the country will once again be held hostage by the destructive dynamics of imperial policy. That historical lesson is an especially timely one for us at this juncture, considering the situation that now exists in Russia favorable to such a return to the past, as well as the confrontational nature of our president's personality and the clumsiness with which he and the new nomenklatura are striding across the slippery parquet floor of politics. The time of empires, creation of spheres of influence and filling of political and military vacuums has disappeared irretrievably into the past. They have been replaced by regionally integrating communities of sovereign states. Those communities are not bound together either by the dominance and the authority of a strong individual or by bureaucratic centralism, but rather by processes of economic convergence and mutual penetration. That is the trend around the world. And it is one that cannot be avoided. The Soviet Union achieved a high level of internal integration, and not just in the economy, though that integration did rest on state-sponsored monopolistic measures by the center, was artificial in nature and therefore folded up like a house of cards in December 1991 as a result of an arbitrary decision by the "troika" to dissolve the USSR. But Russia still has vital interests in the former Soviet republics, just as those republics still have vital interests in Russia. Therefore unilateral proclamation of the near abroad as a sphere of special Russian interests is fundamentally wrong and could have great destructive potential. The only way the issue should be framed is as a concept of interdependence as a basis for development of the CIS. Russia's national interest lies in helping establish an integrating community within the CIS space that will be founded on a socially-oriented market economy and democratic values and will be similar in type to the European Community. This alone can make the CIS viable. A "Monroe Doctrine" will doom it. No one will tolerate Russian dominance and dictates. The joint statement by Kravchuk and Nazarbayev sharply condemning Kozyrev's proclamation of the near abroad as a sphere of Russian vital interests clearly demonstrates that. The initiative by Kazakhstan's president to create a Eurasian Union fits in very well with the concept of interdependence. The Russian "Monroe Doctrine" is nothing more nor less than a resurrection of the "policy of making enemies" not only in the near abroad but also in the countries of Eastern and Western Europe. The current "Drang nach Westen" by the Eastern European countries and their efforts to be admitted to NATO can be attributed to their fear of a revival of traditional Soviet and Russian hegemonism and expansionism. That is a fairly typical perception of Russian policy among countries in the region. So what is our policy doing? Instead of dispelling these fears, the president's inner circle is constantly heightening them. How can those countries have confidence in the policy of the Yeltsin administration when, in addition to the Monroe Doctrine, it has also armed itself with a Russian version of Dulles' "massive retaliation doctrine," which envisions Russian first use of nuclear weapons in the event of an attack on its territory or that of its allies, i.e. the states within the Russian sphere of interests, as follows from an assertion by the president in "Fundamental Principles of Russian Federation Military Doctrine"? When declaring Russia the successor state to the USSR, Russia's leaders did not even deem it necessary to state that there would be no succession with regard to the Soviet regime's expansionist policy, or to express their sincere apologies to the peoples of Eastern Europe who were the victims of that policy. It is clear that in more than two years' time Russian policy has not succeeded in establishing relations of confidence with the countries of the near abroad and Eastern Europe. Those relations are greatly burdened by the old perceptions of political circles in those countries regarding Russia's imperial aspirations. Those perceptions have been reinforced by the use of outdated means of economic and military pressure against those countries and by a lack of tact and political finesse in relations with them. According to the laws of action and reaction, the response to growing Russian neo-imperialist tendencies has been symptoms of a Western return to the old "containment policy." The difference from the past is that this containment does not begin along the perimeter of the former USSR's sphere of influence, but rather along the current borders between Russia and the CIS countries, and under circumstances of economic ruin and political instability in Russia, i.e on very unfavorable terms for Russia. Have the proponents of a Russian "Monroe Doctrine" stopped to consider this? The current situation with regard to the shaping of Russian foreign policy is in some ways reminiscent of early 1946, at which time the overall orientation of the Soviet Union's postwar foreign policy strategy was determined. It was then that at Stalin's request the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of World Economics and World Policy developed a concept which suggested that all efforts be focused on reinforcing the country domestically and that the country refrain from expanding the Soviet sphere of influence in Europe and also avoid a confrontation with the West, which the Soviet Union could not sustain. When Stalin read this concept he ordered the institute dissolved and its director, Academician Varga, arrested, along with a number of his colleagues who helped develop the ideas. But in the end it was Varga who was proved correct, not Stalin. Today it would be a disaster for Russia to slip once again into a state of "cold war" or even lower-level confrontation with the West as a result of returning to an imperialist policy. In that case the United States and its allies would attempt to create a cordon sanitaire against Russia in the near abroad. There have been plenty of calls for that already. Russia's national interests do not require that it pit itself against the West, particularly with an imperialist policy, a Russian "Monroe Doctrine," appeals to countries to remain outside the "Partnership for Peace" or other such twists and turns of Russian foreign policy thinking. What they do require is the country's further progress along the path of political, economic and cultural integration in the family of civilized states from which it was isolated by more the more than 70 years of totalitarian communist domination. Only on that path can Russia achieve true greatness and prosperity.
