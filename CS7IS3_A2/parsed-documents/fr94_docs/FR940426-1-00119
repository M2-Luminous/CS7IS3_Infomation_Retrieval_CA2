FR940426-1-00119 FR940426-1-00014 B. Changes of Reporting Currency The proposed revisions to Rule 3&hyph;20 also codify staff practice regarding changes in reporting currency. The staff has addressed situations in which an issuer proposes to change its reporting currency because of a change of its place of incorporation or of its primary economic environment, as well as when characteristics of its shareholder base have changed. The proposed revisions specify that the financial statements for all periods presented should be stated in the same reporting currency. In the event that an issuer elects to change its reporting currency, the proposed revisions require that the financial statements of periods prior to the change be comprehensively recast as if the new reporting currency had been used since at least the earliest period presented in the filing. 13 Under this method, the income statement and statement of cash flows would be translated into the new reporting currency using an appropriately weighted average exchange rate for the applicable period, and the balance sheet would be translated using the exchange rate at the end of the applicable period. Comprehensive translation into a single reporting currency for all periods presented appears necessary to depict trends consistently and maintain other relationships within the financial statements. 14 13 A change in the reporting currency may or may not be coincident with a change in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the operations exist. The U.S. accounting guidance applicable to a change in an entity's functional currency appears in paragraph 9 of SFAS 52. The effects of differences between the method of accounting in the primary financial statements for a change in functional currency and the method of accounting prescribed by U.S. GAAP should be explained and quantified where reconciliation is required pursuant to Item 17 or Item 18 of Form 20&hyph;F. 14 At least one other jurisdiction permits issuers to recalculate the prior years' data by means of a ``convenience translation'' of the former reporting currency to the new currency using the exchange rate prevailing when the change of reporting currency is implemented. See Emerging Issues Committee of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, Issue No. 11 (December 15, 1989), ``Changes in Reporting Currency''. Comment is requested as to whether the financial statements should be recast for all periods, rather than only for all periods presented, in order to allocate more exactly the effect of the change in reporting currency between retained earnings and the cumulative translation adjustment. Comment is also requested as to whether other methods of adjusting prior periods should be acceptable alternatives when a change in reporting currency is adopted. Commenters are asked to address whether the selection of either Approach A or Approach B described above with respect to measurement of the issuer's underlying transactions should affect the presentation of periods prior to a change in reporting currency. Comment is also requested if the proposed rule should require disclosure of the reason why the issuer changed its reporting currency. III. Foreign Issuer Operations in a Hyperinflationary Economy A foreign issuer that has material operations in a currency of a country with a hyperinflationary economy must, for purposes of reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, measure those operations in the issuer's reporting currency. 15 However, the accounting principles of most other countries require or permit the foreign issuer to measure operations in hyperinflationary environments in the local currency, restated for the effects of changing prices, and then translated to the reporting currency. 15 SFAS 52 governs the accounting for operations in hyperinflationary environments. Paragraph 11 of that standard defines a hyperinflationary environment as ``one that has cumulative inflation of approximately 100 percent or more over a 3-year period.'' Because devaluation of a currency is usually not equivalent to the effect of inflation on that currency's purchasing power, the remeasurement process required by U.S. GAAP will not produce the same results as the restate-translate method often followed by foreign issuers. The staff has addressed a number of requests by foreign issuers for accommodation with respect to the requirement to quantify effects of differences between the methods of accounting for hyperinflationary operations. Foreign issuers cite the cost and complexity involved in such a reconciliation, as it effectively may require duplicate recordkeeping in both the reporting currency and the local currency of the operation. Foreign issuers have observed that amounts which would be produced by application of SFAS 52 will, nevertheless, not be comparable to an identically situated U.S. company if the reporting currency of the foreign issuer is not U.S. dollars. 16 16 SFAS 52 would require measurement of the operation's transactions in the foreign issuer's reporting currency, while the U.S. company would measure the operation's transactions in U.S dollars. To address these concerns, the Commission is proposing to eliminate the requirement of Items 17 and 18 of Form 20&hyph;F that an issuer quantify the effects on financial statements of its use of a translation methodology for operations in a hyperinflationary environment which differs from SFAS 52 so long as it conforms with IAS 21, provided that the method used is consistently applied in all periods. IAS 21, as amended in 1993, requires that amounts in the financial statements of the hyperinflationary operation be restated for the effects of changing prices in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 29, ``Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies'' (``IAS 29''), and then translated to the reporting currency. 17 17 Issuers may elect either of two methods described by IAS 29: (a) Restatement of historical cost amounts into units of currency that have the same general purchasing power (historical cost/constant currency method), or (b) measurement at current cost, with amounts for prior periods restated for changes in the general level of prices (current cost method). Comment is requested on the need for accommodation with respect to the accounting for hyperinflationary operations, and whether the proposed revisions adequately address those needs. Comment is also requested as to whether financial statements and accompanying reconciliation produced on the basis permitted by the proposal would provide investors with adequate and meaningful information. Comment is requested regarding whether IAS 29 provides sufficient guidance to ensure appropriate application of both the current cost method and the historical cost/constant currency method, or whether only one or the other of the two methods should be permitted without reconciliation. IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis To evaluate fully the costs and benefits associated with the proposed amendment to Rule 3&hyph;20 of Regulation S-X and Form 20&hyph;F under the Exchange Act, the Commission requests commenters to provide views and empirical data as to the costs and benefits associated with such proposals. V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 605(b)], the Chairman of the Commission has certified that the proposed revisions to rules and forms will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Members of the public who wish to obtain a copy of the Regulatory Flexibility Certification should contact Wayne E. Carnall, (202) 272&hyph;2553, Office of Chief Accountant, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549.
