Al Gore's praises of the Argentine economic policy before his arrival -- reiterated upon his departure -- coincide with a growing degree of understanding in other areas, like cooperation between the United States and Argentina in operations undertaken by the international community. These bonds between the two countries enable them to openly discuss matters of common interest. Gore raised two issues that the Reagan and Bush Republican administrations already had deemed a priority, namely the law on patents -- strictly speaking, on intellectual property -- and the fight against drugs. With regard to patents, Gore reiterated what U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor stated not long ago -- that Washington gives top priority to the passing of a law that guarantees foreign pharmaceutical companies' rights to the patents they have obtained for their medicines. As for drug enforcement -- which will be one of the main agenda items at the summit of the Americas' heads of state in Miami this year -- the United States continues to uphold the advisability of Latin American armed forces playing some role in this area. President Carlos Menem conceded that a delay in the enactment of the patents law may be a stumbling block in bilateral relations. He commented on the possibility -- previously mentioned by Kantor -- of Argentina being included on a list of countries liable for economic sanctions. This could happen if considerable progress has not been made in this respect by 30 April. Menem also referred to another possible negative consequence in the future, namely, the indefinite postponement of Argentina's joining NAFTA, whose only current signatories are the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It would be totally erroneous to interpret the tone of these warnings as proof of a misunderstanding between both countries. The Patents Bill already has been submitted to Congress and even though some of its points -- which to some extent affect local vested interests -- have been met with opposition, there is no reason to doubt it will be approved. Argentina's stance -- like other countries in the hemisphere -- on the struggle against drug trafficking is different from that of the United States as far as the Armed Forces' possible role in this area, but both countries are totally of one mind with regard to the final objectives and the coordination of efforts. The U.S. vice president's visit enabled the Argentine Government to once again protest -- and quite understandably so -- U.S. subsidies for their agricultural exports. Once again, the answer was that Washington has no intention whatsoever of damaging "legitimate" exporters like Argentina and that subsidies are a response to EC practices. Obviously, this position does not satisfy Argentina at all, but it spells out the policy furthered by the United States, which also contends that the issue of subsidies to farmers must be discussed within the framework of GATT negotiations and cannot be settled bilaterally. The wide coverage given to the differences over these questions clouded what -- at least in speeches -- constituted the reason for the vice president's visit: the arrangement of the December presidential summit in Miami and his presentation at the World Conference on Telecommunications Development. Gore's presentation on a future "information superhighway," which will link data banks in the entire hemisphere, conjured up visions of a not far-off future on which they are working unstintingly. It would be wise to pay attention to this project and get ready for what will seemingly mark the beginning of a new era, in which communications developments will impose a new rhythm to relations between nations in the Americas.
