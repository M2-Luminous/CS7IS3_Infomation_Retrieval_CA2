(c) Public participation in strategic plan development. Before submitting a plan to the OCC for approval, the bank shall: (1) Informally seek suggestions from the public in its service area(s) while developing the plan; (2) Once the bank has developed a plan, formally solicit public comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each of its service areas; and (3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the plan available for review at all offices of the bank in any service area covered by the plan. (d) Submission of plan. The bank shall submit its plan to the OCC at least three months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. The bank shall also submit with its plan any public comments received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the comments received, the initial plan as released for public comment. (e) Plan content _(1) Measurable goals. (i) A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the credit needs of each of its service area(s) covered by the plan, particularly the needs of low- and moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-income individuals, through lending, investment, and the provision of services, as appropriate. (ii) A bank shall address all three performance categories and, unless the bank has been designated as a wholesale or limited purpose bank, shall emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and credit needs of its service area, considering public comment and the bank's capacity and constraints, product offerings, and business strategy. (2) Confidential information. The bank may submit additional information to the OCC on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan shall be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the OCC to judge fairly the merits of the plan. (3) Satisfactory and outstanding goals. A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' performance. A plan may specify measurable goals that constitute ``outstanding'' performance. In order to be considered for an ``outstanding'' performance rating, the bank shall submit both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance goals. (f) Plan approval _(1) Timing. The OCC shall act upon a plan within 60 days after the complete plan and required accompanying material are submitted. If the OCC fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be deemed approved unless the OCC extends the review period for good cause. (2) Public participation. In evaluating the plan's goals, the OCC shall consider the public's involvement in formulating the plan, public comment on the plan, and any response by the bank to public comment on the plan. (3) Criteria for evaluating plan. The OCC shall evaluate a plan's measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate: (i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative or flexible lending practices to address credit needs; (ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the bank's qualified investments, as defined in ยง25.23 of this part; and
