FR941202-2-00069 FR941202-2-00049 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,773] James River Corp.; Old Town, ME; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On October 7, 1994, after being granted a filing extension, the company requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was published in the Federal Register on August 8, 1993 (59 FR 40370). The company, stated among other things, that it is losing its market share of wood pulp to imported wood pulp. The company also submitted information showing decreased sales, in value, during the relevant period. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 16th day of November 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29718 Filed 12&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
