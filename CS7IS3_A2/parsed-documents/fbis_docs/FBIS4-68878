[Berzins] Following the official initialing of the agreement, there has been a great deal of discussion about the demobilized Russian army personnel remaining in Latvia. Who are the people in this group, who will have the opportunity to remain here after the army leaves? [Upmalis] One military unit was withdrawn from Latvia with the accompaniment of music. The very first one. For the rest, there has been no music, and no other military unit has been withdrawn. Property has been taken out, and the military units have disappeared. There are three options for an officer, after the military unit is disbanded. First -- there are those who sign a contract with Russia to continue service in the military. The drawback is that the signers cannot select where to serve. They must serve where they are sent. The majority desires to go to Moscow, but most will not be sent there. For this reason, a great many do not sign such contracts. Second -- there are those who have sufficient service time to receive a pension when they demobilize. Those who have apartments in Russia will leave, and also those for whom apartments are being built. They have registered with Mayorov (Commander of the North Western Military Group), and will have apartments provided for them in Russia, in time. A few days ago, he showed me a list on which those were crossed off who had received apartments and had left. Those who have already entered into the Latvian community will not leave. Third -- there are those, who, with the help of some arm twisting, have found the opportunity to serve in a comfortable little spot in Russia. All of these leave. A fourth category consists of military persons who are non-commissioned officers. They are mid-ranking and warrant officers who had signed short-term re-enlistment contracts. They make up an entire category of the military, and these gentlemen have other problems, as well. Basically, they have been left on their own; they have completed their contact service stay, cannot yet receive a pension, and must provide for their own future subsistence. They are disappearing somewhere. There is yet another category -- connected with the army were the so-called civilian workers, former Soviet military providers and workers. They did not walk around with epaulets. They may have even been Latvian citizens, although, for the most part, they were soldiers who had been released from active duty and who stayed to work. Every military unit was surrounded by these civilian workers. And, there is one more category that may increase the number of personnel remaining in Latvia. Mr. Mayorov has just submitted to me an official document on the number of retirees. There are 21,976 persons receiving pensions from the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. Information is not forthcoming on the KGB retirees. We had officially requested the listing a week ago. [Berzins] Must we rely on the data supplied by the chief of the withdrawing military forces? Isn't there some way we can find this out ourselves? [Upmalis] The municipalities are not doing well with respect to this matter. We had requested that, as of April 15, the municipalities, whose territories contained demobilized Russian military units, submit data regarding the retired military persons in their territory. The response is very poor. The only official data we have received up until now are from Rezekne, Jekabpils and the Vidzeme suburb. The rest are calling and complaining that they don't have any such data. As for example, Jurmala. But they have house management boards where such information could be obtained. -- That's a lot of work -- is the reply. While it is true that this a lot of work, these municipalities have the ability to gather the information. They have form No. 16, which shows who each person is. The work is there, and it must be done. But, even more surprising than this laziness to perform the work is that we are concluding agreements with Russia without requesting such official information from them. That we are concluding agreements in the dark. We had no available information on the number of retirees, but we concluded an agreement on giving them public guarantees. [Berzins] But those 22 thousand that are being mentioned constantly? [Upmalis] I have not seen any official documents as of the present. To the best of my knowledge, the first official document is the one Mr. Mayorov presented to us on Tuesday. And also. How many military persons there are in Latvia -- even this, no one has officially requested from Russia. And if we are talking about demobilization as of February 28, 1992 and afterwards, we should know these figures. The office does not have these figures, and as far as I known, no one else does either. [Berzins] Is it possible that the delegation is going around you, and that it already knows? [Upmalis] For over one and a half years, I participated in the delegation as an expert. With the exception of the last two times, which were -- Jurmala and the signing in Moscow. Maybe then... But even in such a case, this figure should have been published. [Berzins] So what is really happening -- is the Russian army leaving right now, or not? What about the orders to halt the withdrawal of the army, and all other threats of this type? [Upmalis] There is only one way to answer this -- the army cannot not withdraw. This is because the army has reduced itself to a situation where, if it could remain here, it would have to bring the military forces back, bring in soldiers, bring in material reserves, technical equipment. Without these, no army can live or survive. We are very strict in the control of all persons and military services being brought in. We are allowing military persons who are truly connected with the military withdrawal. Yes, we have admitted over 300 soldiers into the Cekule and Garkalns munitions storehouses, where they are packing munitions for removal. We look upon this as a necessity -- this is a workforce. This is also why it was possible to empty out the storehouses so quickly in Cekule -- some of the largest in Latvia. Right now, the area is being demined, and the work is being performed by the North Western Military Group. These storehouses will be taken over by the Latvian defense forces. As for the other military persons -- and, naturally, we are talking about a large number -- the road here has been closed. One or two can get in -- our borders have quite a few gaps. You don't have to look far. They are entering right here through Riga airport, and, unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in our attempts to have customs control aircraft coming from Russia. [Berzins] Is this because the Russian side is prohibiting this by force, or are we just too afraid to do it? [Upmalis] I believe the main reason is our disorganized structure. Three systems -- customs, border guards, and flight services -- must coordinate their activities. If they would get together and work properly, the problem would not exist. The Russian military withdrawal process is occurring. At the end of this month, one more Latvian rayon will be free of Russian military forces. This is the Rezekne rayon, from which the last military unit is preparing for withdrawal. It is possible that, as early as this week, part of this territory can be taken over by our armed forces for border guarding needs. Finally, the Biryuzov War School has been officially turned over. The same applies to the Alksnis War School. An airport in Daugavpils has been turned over. In Jekabpils, as well. A part of Bukultos is being turned over. In Oskalns station, a train is being filled from Zakamuiza -- a unit with about 60 various technical installations. In the near future, a division will depart from Dobele to prepare a site in the Leningrad district for the relocation of this military unit. After a conversation with Mayorov, it could be gathered that the leadership is hoping to perform the withdrawal during the summer months. This is because barracks have not been built for all of the military forces, and therefore a portion will have to spend the winter in tents. This refers to both the Tallin 144th division and the Dobele 25th sharpshooters brigade. [Berzins] People are upset that Latvia is preparing to pay for the properties built by the Russian army. [Upmalis] While participating in the talks as an expert, I paid particular attention to a statement in the agreement that was worded as follows: the Latvian side guarantees reimbursing the Russian Federation for properties built by the army of the Russian Federation. Now, the Latvian side understands this statement as follows: Yeltsin proclaimed that this army became the Russian army after February 28, 1992. Thus, if anything was built after this date, then the Latvian side is prepared to pay for it. Unfortunately, I am unaware of any property that the Russian side may have built after this date. But Mr. Mayorov understands this matter in the same way as you did, that all property left behind will be paid for by the Latvian side. It has already been said that "property cannot continue to be turned over, because the property relationships have not been settled." Thus, you can see what happens when the points of the accord between nations are not clearly defined. I already brought up the fact that such difficulties would arise, but the Latvian side interpreted this in a manner I already mentioned. There is nothing good there -- an excuse for contention has been created.
