Ever since the Team Spirit exercise started, North Korea demanded its suspension, defining it as "an offensive training exercise intended for a Northward invasion," and put forward its suspension as a precondition for the resolution of the nuclear problem. The ROK and the United States created an atmosphere favorable for enhancing North Korean nuclear transparency by accepting the North Korean demand, although with conditions. [passage omitted on nature, background of Team Spirit] Since the Team Spirit exercise has been used as a negotiating card up to now, it is likely that North Korea will continually put forward a demand for additional military concessions, including the complete suspension of the Team Spirit, at negotiations. However, relevant military officials expressed their position that the Team Spirit exercise, which is one of three elements supporting the ROK-U.S. joint defense system, in addition to the U.S. Forces in the ROK and ROK-U.S. joint command system, should no longer be the target for negotiations. Thus, the military raised voices expressing concern about the possibility of Team Spirit, which is not related to the nuclear issue, being delayed and becoming nothing but a name, due to the North Korean delaying tactics. In particular, the United States proposed that the Team Spirit be conducted every other year on the pretext of reducing security expenses and the scale of the exercise, including the participating troops, be reduced. In view of this, the military officials are worried that the United States may make additional concessions pertaining to the Team Spirit exercise. This being the case, the relevant military officials maintain that as long as North Korea continues an arms buildup, not giving up its will for war, even after it abandons nuclear arms development, alternative steps should be taken in a bid to supplement the temporary suspension or reduction of Team Spirit so that the ROK- U.S. joint defense system remains consolidated.
