FBIS4-54004 "dreas101__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-101-A Daily Report 19 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Coalition Seeks Opposition Support on Tax Reform Coalition Seeks Opposition Support on Tax Reform OW2005021894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 19 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2005021894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The ruling coalition parties decided 18 May to call on both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to cooperate in establishing a council on the tax system. The ruling coalition parties' Tax Reform Council is now working out reform bills to be ready by the end of June. However, there is little possibility that the Hata minority administration can win Diet approval for its bills. Therefore, the ruling parties decided to seek an agreement with the LDP and the SDPJ through tripartite consultations before the legislation of the bills. The LDP has also shown its intention to submit a motion of no confidence against the cabinet as soon as the budget bill for fiscal 1994 is approved. The ruling parties are believed to be aiming at securing their hold on political power by proposing dialogues on policies. With regard to the tax system reform, all parties agree on the need to continue income tax reductions after fiscal 1994. The LDP proposes not only to review the ratio of direct to indirect taxes, but also to discuss this matter in the context of the people's overall tax burden ratio, including social insurance charges. The SDPJ will soon start separate discussions with Sakigake [Harbinger] on tax system reform. In light of such a situation, the coalition parties plan to propose that the LDP, the SDPJ, and coalition parties should bring in their own bills for discussion to reach an agreement before the extraordinary Diet session scheduled for this fall. Regarding raising indirect taxes, which is the focal point of the tax system reform, the ruling parties' Tax Reform Council is studying the possibilities of the following: 1) preparing several alternative proposals on this matter; and, 2) refraining from indicating concrete tax rates. The council is thus trying to leave room for discussions with the LDP and the SDPJ. It has already been decided that several alternative proposals concerning this matter will all be included in the report to be worked out by the basic tax system subcommittee in early June. At a meeting of heads of the government and ruling parties held on 16 May, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said that the government's tax reform bill should be decided within June to prepare for the major industrialized nations' summit talks (the Naples summit). However, a senior ruling party official said on 18 May: "What the United States urges is the continuous implementation of income tax reduction to expand domestic demands. Even if discussions on how to secure revenue sources [to make up for the shortfall that may result from the tax reduction] should be delayed, it will not exert adverse influence upon Japan-U.S. relations." He thus showed the intention to entrust the ruling and opposition parties with discussing how to handle the consumption tax issue. However, the Finance Ministry is believed to be demanding the enforcement of an income tax reduction together with a consumption tax hike after fiscal 1994. Coordination between the government and the ruling parties is expected to face rough going.
