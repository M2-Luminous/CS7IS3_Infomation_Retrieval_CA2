"The United States should approach the DPRK's proposal prudently and make a decision on its judgement", he said. U.S. media set afloat reports quoting recent remarks of the U.S. official quarters that "there are both positive and negative aspects" in the proposal of the DPRK, that "it is a matter which should be examined carefully through consultation with allies" and that "never-ceasing pressure should be put on North Korea". Answering a question put by the KCNA in this connection today, the spokesman said: "This time we made to the U.S. side a detailed proposal to expand the scope of inspection for fully guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). "This progressive proposal made by us was a step which was taken in good faith after the U.S. side accepted the DPRK's formula of package solution and should affirmative willingness to practically improve the relations between the DPRK and the USA. "It is the largest concession on the part of the DPRK at the present stage in view of the low level of confidence between the DPRK and the USA and between the DPRK and the IAEA. "Of course, it is a transitional measure adopted before the third-stage talks and it is clear that an agreement on the package solution at the third-stage talks would lead to a full inspection of the facilities reported to the IAEA. "And, in the afore-said proposal, we declared that, if the South Korean authorities proposed a working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South on an understandable term, the North was ready to examine it affirmatively. "It is, in fact, improper for the United States to raise the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South of Korea as a precondition for its talks with the DPRK": The exchange of special envoys between the North and the South had been proposed by us and it is our stand to carry it into practice by all means. "As the exchange of special envoys is aimed at discussing not only nuclear problem but also a number of problems arising in the relations between the North and the South, it is a domestic issue of our nation which should be discussed and agreed upon between the North and the South. So it is not a problem in which the United States should interfere, still less a problem requiring good offices of the United States. "However, proceeding from the position to solve the nuclear problem at any cost, the DPRK, with good intentions, made clear its stand toward the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South, fully taking into consideration the embarrassing circumstances of the U.S. side. "Now some quarters of the United States are raising a noisy row as if the discontinuation of the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises were a big concession. But, in fact, the manoeuvres are an act of nuclear threat that plainly contradicts the spirit of the joint statement between the DPRK and the United States and so it is a big mistake for the United States to try to wrest something from the DPRK in return for it. "The United States would be well advised to give up the idea of using the discontinuation of the war game as a bargaining chip. "If the manoeuvres are forced, we are fully prepared to cope with them."
