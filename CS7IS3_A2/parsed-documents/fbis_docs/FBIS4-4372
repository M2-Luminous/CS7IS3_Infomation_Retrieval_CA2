Chief Justice Yong Pung How said that he was satisfied that the district judge had taken into consideration all the relevant facts. Michael Fay had appealed against the sentence of four-month jail and six strokes of the cane for two counts of vandalism. The chief justice said he had duly considered the psychiatric report and the background of the accused. He said he could not accept that the pre-sentencing report, which could call for probation, should have been made. This has been suggested by the Queen's Counsel, Mr. Michael Sherrard. Twenty charges had been taken into consideration, in which 16 were for acts of vandalism. The chief justice said he considered that Michael Fay had committed the acts of vandalism deliberately and willfully, which amounted to a calculated cause of criminal conduct over 10 days.
