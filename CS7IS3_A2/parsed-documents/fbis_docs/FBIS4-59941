The TEHRAN TIMES charged that Riyadh was opposed to peace between the north and south Yemenis and had previously done "everything to forestall the unification Yemen." "The Saudis have been plotting in Yemen in the past few weeks, until they managed to impose a full-scale civil war on that country," the English-language daily said. The paper also accused Saudi Arabia of "instigating the civil war in Afghanistan and of using petrodollars to finance the conflict." Officials and newspapers here have launched a wave of attacks on Saudi Arabia in the past two days, after Iran was forced to cancel an anti-US and anti-Israel rally by its pilgrims in Mecca. The "deliverance from the Infidels" demonstration, which was to be held Tuesday, was called off after heavily-armed Saudi police reportedly besieged the Iranian pilgrimage quarter to prevent them from holding it. Tehran said it had cancelled the rally to "avoid a bloodbath." Iran's speaker of parliament Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri condemned the ban on Tuesday and accused Riyadh of seeking to "please the United States." The Saudis "want to protect the interest of the United States. This is the main characteristic of American Islam," he said.
