The responsible officials of our country have provided an appropriate response to British propaganda. Last night the Iranian president in his remarks revealed other examples of British Government interference in the domestic affairs of Iran, namely the discovery of an spying network [halqeh-ye jasusi] in the Iranian Embassy in London. To clarify the details of this issue and to receive greater information, we have invited Mr. Mahmud Va'ezi, deputy foreign minister for American and European affairs, to provide you dear listeners with more information. Before starting each part of the interview, we will have a short report that our dear colleagues in the political department of the first channel have prepared about the background to the latest events. Then we will start the interview. [passage omitted] I wish to thank Mr. Va'ezi for taking part in our program tonight. We start our discussion by asking Mr. Va'ezi to tell us about the details of the event. [Va'ezi] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. Before starting to discuss the main topic, I wish to refer briefly to the nature of our relations with England during the past 15 years; in other words, the period after the Islamic revolution. During the past 15 years, we have witnessed many ups and downs in our relations. The main reason for it is that, in view of its past record in the region and particularly in Iran, England finds it difficult to speedily adjust itself and its behavior -- its political and propaganda behavior -- with the policies we have pursued since the revolution. Indeed, our most turbulent [motelatemtarin] foreign relations have been with England, compared to any other country. [Correspondent] Let us now turn to the issue our president referred to last night, namely the English spying activities [jasusi] in our embassy in London. Please let us know how this issue started and when did you learn about this spying network [halqeh-ye jasusi]. [Va'ezi] Nearly more than two weeks ago, when we were carrying out some repairs in the new embassy building, we discovered a listening device after pulling down one of the walls. It was a relatively powerful listening device placed inside the wall. As a result, we did not wish to make an immediate judgement or to reveal other issues that might have followed from it. When we discovered this, we asked our technical experts to investigate the matter further. This was about two weeks ago. [Correspondent] You referred to the new embassy building. Please tell us what building that is. [Va'ezi] If you recall, at the beginning of the revolution, an attack was carried out by opposition groups against the building where the Iranian Embassy was situated. As a result the building was exploded [as heard] and set on fire. We realized afterwards that the attack was led by the British security service. [Correspondent] I even heard that the Iraqi intelligence network and the British Government were together in that incident. Then the building was rebuilt. Apparently that is the building you mean? [Va'ezi] That is right. That building was eventually rebuilt after a delay. Several months ago its rebuilding came to an end and gradually the embassy sections were transferred to the new building. It was during the transfer when we came across the listening device, which was installed somewhere in a wall in one of the rooms in the building. [Correspondent] Why didn't you announce the discovery of the device and did not raise the issue in the media at the time? [Va'ezi] The clear reason was that after we discovered the listening device, our experts needed to carry out further investigation. And security and operational issues required time. That was why we wanted all our work to be carried out without any propaganda and in good time until yesterday when the matter was actually announced. [Correspondent] Did you inform the British authorities through diplomatic channels about the discovery of the listening device? [Va'ezi] We summoned the British Embassy charge d'affaires. The Foreign Ministry director general for Western Europe made a strong objection over the action by the British Government and asked for further clarification of the matter. [Correspondent] When I was consulting foreign press cuttings today, I found a commentary that said apparently as soon as the British Government became aware of the cutting off of the connection between the listening device and their own center, they embarked on a plan for accusing Iran of supporting the Irish republicans and made that clamor. Does your interpretation and information tally with that or not? [Va'ezi] Of course, because the accusation was a false one and was in no way correct. The two can definitely not be interconnected from the point of view of their content [as heard]. But taking into consideration the coincidence of the two actions, it seems that it was a preemptive act by the British Government. After the cutting off of their connection with the listening device, they made that claim in the press, and they embarked on extensive propaganda to cover up the scandal they were certain would come to light. [Correspondent] Yes, one of the international news agencies had noted -- in corroboration of the Mr. Va'ezi's statement -- that the British Government embarked on making up that accusation against Iran to create a preemptive atmosphere regarding any revelations about the listening device. Please tell us what was the reaction of other European countries -- which are in your brief -- towards the initial British accusation against Iran? [Va'ezi] It is interesting that when the British Government announced its accusation against Iran, they said they had been coordinating with the rest of the Western Europe states. We witnessed that -- with the exception of the American secretary of state -- no other state and no other official in any Western state showed any reaction. Even in our contacts with Western states, we found that that was not an important issue for them, or an issue on which any coordination had taken place with them beforehand. It seemed that it was a plan carried out by Britain. As you know, Mr. Major's administration is in a very bad position at the moment, and from the point of view of popularity, it is at its lowest point since his coming to power. It seems that through the raising of such issues, they can divert public opinion of their own people to a certain extent from those problems Britain is going through at the moment. [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, the president's statements last night were partly concerned with the fact that the media, particularly the press, in Britain acted in a totally coordinated and guided fashion within the wave of the British propaganda against Iran. In your opinion, does that mean that the issue was a pre-planned scenario, that they had prepared themselves for it beforehand, or do you think otherwise? [Va'ezi] Certainly that was a pre-determined scenario, because when they summoned our charge d'affaires in Britain, before their discussion had ended, the British radio made an announcement. Extensive propaganda had been planned beforehand, and they embarked on it. Anyway, all the information at our disposal and what has reached us so far indicate that that was a planned action. Fortunately with the strong approach of Iran, especially the summoning of the charge d'affaires and the fact that they had raised an issue that had no truth in it, there was no room for any further maneuvers. Anyway the matter subsided within a week. [Correspondent] You mentioned that preliminary investigations have been carried out about the listening device and that is why the matter has been announced. Is there any information regarding its type, form, operation, and use to inform our listeners about at this juncture? [Va'ezi] The information we have so far: the device weighs about 450 grams. The battery in the device is interesting; that is, from a technical point of view the device can operate a longer time without being accessed again. The various electronic sections in the device indicate that the device can have various functions. That is the data we can announce so far. Undoubtedly there will be more information we will announce later. [Correspondent] We read in the press that apparently the device included a microphone and a transmitter. Can you confirm that? [Va'ezi] That is so. [Correspondent] The transmitter was next to it? [Va'ezi] They were all together. [Correspondent] Can you give any information about the range of the transmitter? [Va'ezi] At the moment our information is not complete regarding this particular issue. God willing, later. [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, please tell us in what part of the embassy the device was installed? Was it a sensitive area or not? [Va'ezi] As I said before, we have been making use of the new embassy building gradually. And taking into account that we had taken over from the building contractors, the building needed some modification. The modification was in an area we had not put to use yet. We wanted to carry out the modifications and then use the area. When a wall was demolished we found out the fact. When a room or a section is not being utilized, one cannot acually talk about its sensitivity. [Correspondent] In fact that was the answer to my next question; that is, whether any damage has been done to any data within the embassy through the existence of the device. [Va'ezi] We have not made any use of that section of the embassy. We were going to make use of it gradually, after the repairs we were carrying out. [Correspondent] Have you instigated any investigation on how the device was installed in the embassy? Has any one or any committee been charged with the investigation? And has the contractor been contacted? [Va'ezi] Immediately after the device was found, we began our activity because we did not want the matter to be revealed at the first juncture. Certainly the type of activity we had up to yesterday was different. We had made our plans beforehand. That is why we shall be continuing our investigations somewhat more openly from now on. [Correspondent] The Central News Unit has not yet received any report on a formal reaction by the British Government--and, particularly, the British Foreign Office--to this issue. Why is that, Mr. Va'ezi? [Va'ezi] One reason could be that following Britain's claim two weeks ago regarding links between the Islamic Republic of Iran's intelligence organization and the IRA, discussions took place immediately between British parliamentarians, between British officials and their intelligence service and the opposition groups that exist in Britain, on the other hand. [Correspondent] Do you mean groups in Britain who oppose the Islamic Republic of Iran? [Va'ezi] Yes. That is an issue that has worried the British, particularly because of its direct effect on public opinion in our country because of our people's hatred of such groups. We strongly rejected the claim about a link between us and the IRA during talks with British authorities both in London and Tehran. On the other hand, with the strong evidence that we possessed, we raised the issue of their links with Iranian opposition groups. That was one reason for that issue becoming defused. The reason they have not reacted thus far is that this issue would bring all other previous matters to life, and it seems that the British Government does not have a strong hand on that issue. That is why it tries to raise new issues to divert attention from the case and derail it from its main course. [Correspondent] Do you, in fact, predict that British authorities will create new diversionary focal points to distract attention away from current discussions? [Va'ezi] That is usually the method they employ. [Correspondent] Mr. Va'ezi, what is our next step? We have witnessed the discovery of such British networks and bugs in the world many times, as evident in the memoirs of their experienced spies, including Mr. Peter Wright's "Spy Catcher", in which the cases of many other embassies were revealed. Now, this is my question: From a diplomatic and official view, what is our next step regarding this act by the British Government? [Va'ezi] As you know, we have not had a healthy relationship on a suitable scale since the revolution. Our relations with Britain have had some problems, most of which were the responsibility of the main offender, the British Government. The thinking in the British Government goes back to pre-revolution ideas. To be more precise: There are factions within the ruling circles of the British Government that seek tension in relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. If we look at the last 15 years of relations between Iran and Britain, we see this type of crisis every six to eight months. For this reason, relations are not on an acceptable level. We are now waiting for an explanation from the British Government. We will definitely take other steps after hearing their explanations. [Correspondent] We have seen warnings in some press opinions that relations between the two countries will possibly be reduced, and new problems will possibly emerge in relations with London. Are you of the same opinion, and do you have similar expectations? [Va'ezi] Taking into account the information currently available and the fact that relations between Iran and Britain are not on a friendly and high level, any comment now might be too early. We have to wait until all issues are clear. I will, therefore, leave this comment for the next opportunity. [Correspondent] During the past week, British officials tried to reassure their domestic public that they would not have a crisis or a reduction in the level of relations with the Islamic Republic. They tried to reduce somewhat the initial negative climate. Mr. Va'ezi, we discussed the coordinated reaction of the press and other British media with the initial government action in setting up a propagandistic climate against the Islamic Republic. But the information received until now at the Central News Bureau of radio and television indicates that only two London newspapers have had very short references to this news today and have tried not to publish the news on a large scale. Does this not mean that there has been no coordination on this occasion between the press and the British Government and, therefore, the press is waiting for new coordination? [Va'ezi] It seems that the British Government was not waiting for such speed in what was announced yesterday. They were possibly expecting this discussion with us along with the claim regarding IRA relations two weeks ago. The fact that this was not announced practically foiled the former designs. They were not prepared to work on such a subject. They have waited since yesterday afternoon because they are waiting for a new propaganda policy between the Foreign Office and the press. I think beginning tomorrow we will be able to witness a new move from the British press and propaganda organizations. [passage omitted]
