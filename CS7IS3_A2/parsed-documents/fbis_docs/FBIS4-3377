Tang and Sofia Wu] [Text] The Hague, April 15 (CNA) -- The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) will support Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, UNPO Secretary-General M.C. Van Walt Van Praag said Friday [15 April]. The Hague-based organization has a wealth of experience in lobbying the United Nations and maintains close relations with some Western countries. "We can use our special ties and experience to help Taiwan win a UN seat," Van Praag told CNA. The UNPO can also mobilize the world news media to support Taiwan's UN bid, he noted. Taiwan has been kept out of the world body since Beijing assumed the UN China seat in 1971. Van Praag said UNPO may discuss detailed measures to help boost Taiwan's UN bid during its April 18 round table session. However, Van Praag, a lawyer and an international law expert, said the UNPO cannot sue Beijing in the International Court of Justice for blocking Taiwan's entry to the UN. "Only UN members or affiliate organizations can file lawsuits in the world court," explained Van Praag. "Although the UNPO is recognized by the UN as a non-governmental organization, it is not a UN affiliate," he noted. Van Praag, who is also legal advisor to Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, was commenting on a proposal by four Taiwan legislators that the UNPO sue Beijing in the world court on behalf of Taiwan. The four -- Parris Chang, Stella Chen, Chen Tze-nan of the Democratic Progressive Party and Tsai Chung-han of the ruling Kuomintang -- arrived here Friday to attend the UNPO round table session. Parris Chang, chairman of the UNPO Steering Committee, will chair the meeting, which will discuss the prevention of international conflict in the post-Cold War world. The two-day conference will bring together more than 200 delegates from 36 UNPO members, the United Nations, the UN high commissioner for refugees, and other major international organizations. Senior officials from the Dutch Foreign Ministry and several European countries will also attend the meeting. The UNPO, an alternative United Nations, was founded in the Netherlands in February 1991 to help ethnic minorities and peoples which are not represented in the UN and other major world organizations.
