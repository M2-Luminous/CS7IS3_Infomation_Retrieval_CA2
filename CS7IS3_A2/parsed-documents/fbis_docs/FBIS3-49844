He added that the forms and scope of Poland's cooperation with NATO were also linked with the capacity of this year's budget. In an interview for the Polish Radio Third Program, the prime minister said that details of Poland's cooperation with NATO, as part of the Partnership for Peace program, as well as the results of the recent visit by President Walesa and the prime minister to Prague, will be discussed at today's meeting of the government. Waldemar Pawlak announced that this year, as an anti-inflation measure, the government would attempt to slow down the pace of official price rises [ceny urzedowe]. The prime minister emphasized that the numerous changes, which have recently occurred in Poland, have been achieved in a democratic way, without the upheavals and conflicts which took place in other countries. Waldemar Pawlak expressed the opinion that in the spring local government elections, it would be better to use the old electoral system instead of the new one proposed by the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic. According to the prime minister, councillors and representatives of the local government assemblies [sejmiki samorzadowe], with whom he recently had talks, were in favor of such a solution.
